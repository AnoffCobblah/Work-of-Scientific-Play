XIV. " On      the Atmospheric Lines of the Solar Spectrum, in           a Letter
      to the President."     By Lieut.   J. H.  Hennessey.      Communicated
      by the President.       Received   May 21, 1870.
                                                    Mussoorie,  April  25, 1870.
   My dear Sir, — I have the pleasure to           enclose a map of the solar
spectrum, including    the  region  from  the extreme   red to the lines D, and
a report on my endeavours to view the zodiacal light.         A complete set of
actinometric    observations (simultaneous) between Dehra and Mussoorie
has also been made.      The latter observations are in course of reduction,
and will,  I trust, be submitted to you ere long.
   2. Instruments. — The set of instruments which the President               and
Council of the Royal Society were good enough to send out to India under
Lieut. HerschePs care, for my use, was duly handed to me at Bangalore
(Madras Presidency) when I was on duty there in the winter of 1 867-68.
This   set comprises a spectroscope with three flint-glass prisms, a hand-
spectroscope, a tube with a double-image prism, and two of Hodgkinson's
actinometers, as detailed in Professor Stokes's letter (list) addressed to the
Under Secretary of State for India, dated 31 October, 1867.
   3. Narrative. — On the completion of my duties at Bangalore              I was
enabled to bring the instruments up to Mussoorie, where the spectroscope
was set up in May 1868.          Meanwhile, however, the hot season in the
plains had set in.    The dust, as usual at this time of the year, filled the
atmosphere, so that all hopes of obtaining spectroscopic observations of
the sun about the time of sunset were in vain ; and my endeavours to carry
out the suggestions of the Committee, which they were so good as to make
in connexion with my letter of 13 Feb. 1866, were reluctantly deferred
to the ensuing October, when a clear atmosphere might again be expected.

2                            Lieut.   J.   H. Hennessey on        the             [June 16,
      4. Position    of observatory. — With the permission of Colonel Walker,
 R.E., Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical                    Survey of India, the
spectroscope was placed in the small rotating dome observatory of the
 Survey department.           It stands on the southernmost range of the Hima
laya Mountains, in lat. N. 30° 27' 41", long. E. 78° 6' 45", height above
 mean      sea-level 6937 feet.        My observations were made in this observa
 tory, excepting the interval last winter, when, in order to command a
 view of the sun down to the horizon, I shifted the instrument to an
 adjoining ridge.
                                         I
      5. Times of observation. — was not long in ascertaining that between
  10 a.m. and 2 p.m. no sensible alteration in the spectrum occurred.                     I  am
 here speaking of the red end, which has almost exclusively been the sub
 ject of my study.           Accordingly, the observations which may be called
  '*                                                           It was, however, some time
      sun high" were made between these hours.
 before I discovered that by far the greater effect of the earth's atmosphere
  on the spectrum did not occur until the sun was about to dip* under the
  horizon.       In fact it is only when the sun is some three or four diameters
  from the horizon         that the very considerable alteration of the spectrum
  begins.       To  secure this condition, the atmosphere must be quite free from
  dust, which, as already implied, rises in great clouds from the plains until
   deposited by the heavy rains in July and August ; and the sky must be
   clear of clouds, at least about the horizon.             The lines were watched under
   these    circumstances, and mapped down to the last moment before any
   serious diminution of light occurred.              These results are given in the map
   observed " at sunset."          It is easy to see that such favourable conditions
   cannot be expected continuously day after day ; and even when available,
   the time for observation is so very limited, that no results can be obtained
  without      considerable perseverance.            When, however, this exceptional
   condition of air and sky do occur, the observer who has watched and be
  come familiar with the spectrum sun high, is well rewarded by the decided
  manner in which the atmospheric lines now stand out, as the sun, still
  quite bright, is on the point of setting.
       6.  Narrative     resumed.   — Between May and October 1868               I  employed
  my    leisure   in watching the spectrum sun high, fully expecting that the
   brilliant weather of the autumn would enable me to make every endeavour
   towards carrying out the suggestions of the Committee with the sun low.
  But the autumn        came and the air was still hazy.          In fact, while the average
   fall of rain here is some 90 inches, there fell in the season of 1868 only 61
   inches, or about two-thirds the usual quantity ; a drought which in the
   first instance led to the scarcity of food, from which these provinces are
   only now emerging.          To complete my, mortification, I found that the colli-
       * A  range of hills to the eastward   conceals  the view for some degrees    in altitude ;
    so that, though  I have repeatedly  watched   the spectrum   of a morning as well, my map
   is in preference    based on the view at sunset, when the sun can be followed down to
   the horizon.

 1870.]               Atmospheric Lines of      the  Solar Spectrum.                 8
 mator    of the spectroscope had bent, by its own weight, at the flanges
where    it unites with the drum ; and this deterioration involved remedies
for which the available means were but too limited.                In this way the au
tumn of 1868 passed away, to my great disappointment, without bringing
me any Tesults save experience ; and           I  eventually left Mussoorie, as usual,
for the winter of 1868-69, to carry on my survey duties at Dehra.
    7. Narrative continued. — On my return to this place about the end of
April 1869,       I  found, as was to be expected, that, owing to the small amount
of rain in the winter, the hazy state of the atmosphere still continued ; so
that it was not until last October (1869) that              I was able fairly to com
mence work at sunset.            Even then I had to discover by experiment that,
to observe     the full atmospheric effect on the spectrum, I must command a
view   of the sun down to the very horizon.            To suit this new condition, I
had    to shift the spectroscope twice to adjoining positions, and to modify
the map      I had already prepared.
    8.  Construction of spectroscope. — The spectroscope is made up of a
drum containing three flint-glass prisms, one of which may be made non
effective     at pleasure.       The collimator unfortunately consists of three
pieces,   of   which      the nearest  portion is rigidly fixed to the drum.      The
second piece unites with the drum piece by means of three screws driven
through flanges ; the third piece, which unscrews for packing, bears the
slit at its far end.          The spectrum is viewed by a telescope provided with
four eye-pieces, whose magnifying-powers I determined with a dynameter
to be as    follows : —
                    Eye-piece.                                      Power.
                      No.   1                                          9
                      No.   2                                         17
                      No.   3                                        25
                       No.  4                                        54
    A   graduated circle and vernier, read by a side-telescope, provide the
 means for measuring distances between the Hues ; and the foregoing are
 mounted equatorially on a tripod-stand.
    9. Details. — In observing the spectrum sun high,             I was soon struck by
the difference in intensity        of the lines as seen at Mussoorie and as given in
Kirchhoff       s well-known map. Excepting the decided lines A, B, C, and D,
all the others appeared comparatively faint, and even wanting in defini
 tion.     It is also worthy of remark, that while Kirchhoff used a power of
 forty to view the spectrum with,           I am unable to employ any higher power
 than eye-piece No. 2 (power 17).              My observations were thus made with
 eye-piece     No.     2, using all three prisms   ; and this combination,   the most
 powerful at my command, produced an image only some three-tenths of
 what Kirchhoff, I presume, actually saw.
     10. Details. — The comparative smallness of image presented to view
  has necessarily added sensibly to the difficulties of the undertaking ; for,
                                                                          b2

4                           Lieut.  J.  H. Hennessey on the                [June 16,
 understanding the Committee to suggest that            I should adopt Kirchhoff's
 map      and  scale  as  a  basis, it  became  incumbent    on me to magnify the
 image actually viewed some three times before sketching it on my map.
 As   an aid towards this end,      I  removed the strong metal cross wires in the
 telescope, and replaced them by two tolerably stout silk fibres, parallel to
 one another, and rather more apart than the image of B sun high.                    I
 could thus compare a given line with one of the fibres, or, where more
 convenient, with the space between them ; and, through the intervention
 of the fibres, compare any one line with any other. These comparisons
 of magnitude        were thus all mental, there being no micrometer in the eye
 piece    to measure small spaces with, and the smallest quantity that         I could
 measure on the circle being the distance between the two lines in D.               In
 selecting    a relative  unit between    Kirchhoff's and  my map,    I have  adopted
  the breadth he has assigned to the line A. This line will therefore be
 found equally wide in his map and in mine at sunset. The necessity for
 enlarging the image leads to an unintentional deception, deserving notice.
 It will be seen that my line A, for instance, is equally and intensely black
 throughout ; whereas the same line, shown at the same width in Kirch
 hoff's map (402 to 407), is made up of several lines of varying intensity.
 This difference is due to the lesser power of my instrument ; and in all
 probability the line up here would decompose into its component lines
 under greater dispersion.
     11. Necessity for constructing my map from independent measures. —
 The want of intensity generally in the spectrum sun high at Mussoorie,
 combined with the smaller power of the instrument, made it exceedingly-
 difficult,   and in most       cases   impossible, to identify individual lines in
 Kirchhoff's       map   with corresponding      ones under view; so that, after
 making every endeavour at identification, I was obliged to content myself
 with adopting the positions (sun high) assigned by him to the strong lines
 A, B, C, and D, and to place all the other lines of sensible intensity by
 means      of differential   measures    and interpolation.   Practically speaking,
 this amounted to the construction of a new map, so far as my wants were
concerned.
     1 2.
           Definitions.
                         — By a constant line is intended one that presents the
 same appearance at sunset or sun high ; a variable grows darker at sunset,
 and, generally speaking, widens out ; and an atmospheric or air-line is
 invisible only sun high.         By a band may be understood those broad belts
which       suddenly appear    like  shadows at sunset ; instances of bands occur
on both sides of C and elsewhere.
     13. Lines mapped. — Every variable or air-line (or band) sensibly visible
has been measured and mapped ; but of the constant hues only those
sufficiently intense to be easily intersected were observed and placed.             It
appeared undesirable to crowd the map with a large number of faint lines,
whose property of constancy made their presence in an atmospheric map
redundant.        On the other hand, the introduction of certain constant aud

sufficiently intense lines proves valuable for purposes of identification. I
may   add   in this place, that no lines whatever are here visible between B
and C ; and this fact will afford some means of estimating the relative in
tensity of spectrum viewed at Mussoorie and that mapped by Kirch hoff.
   14. Direct sunlight employed. —On first commencing work,         endea                       I
voured to follow the plan adopted by Kirchhoff and employ a heliostat for
reflecting the sun's rays ; but, unlike the Professor, was unable to com   I
mand the clockwork     for driving the heliostat.     The variability of light
under these circumstances proved intolerable ; add to this the necessity
for observing the sun as late in the evening as possible, made the introduc
tion of any absorbing medium undesirable ; and, lastly, the object of main
taining a constancy of circumstances between sun high and sunset, led me
to prefer pointing the collimator direct to the sun. I therefore screened
the drum and its prisms with an ample sunshade, and received the light
from the sun directly on to the slit of the spectroscope.
   15. Identification of constant lines. — It will be seen that in the space
A to C there appears but little for recognition.     No doubt the following
groups are, generally speaking, identical, viz.                 :   —
                            My   map, sun high.                     KirchhofTs   map.
                      Group      469-492     is the same as             4/0-492.
                        „        499-508          „         „           498-509.
                        „        570-586          „         „           570-587.
But the component lines, group by group, are widely different, and several
sensibly intense lines in the Professor's map between 541 and 564 are ab
sent here.
       Constant lines, continued. — In the space C to D the identification is
     16.
more frequent and definite.   My 711 and 719 are clearly represented in
Kirchhoff s map, and between the latter line and 795 several other cases of
identity occur.   Further on, towards D, the resemblance is not clear ; until
on arrival at the variable lines between my 955 and D recognition becomes
impossible.    Remembering that my map has been prepared from perfectly
independent measures,            I
                          am naturally glad of establishing identification,
where possible, with the Professor's map, for the evidence such identity
offers of the accuracy of my work.   Until my map had been finished, and
the scale      of millimetres drawn       above   it,   the means of making                 a   compari
son were all wanting.
  1    Comparison of variable and air-lines. — In discussing the variable

In assuming the foregoing identities,       I have been guided necessarily merely
by numerical coincidences. All the foregoing, in the proposed nomencla
ture, are variable lines, not air-lines.
    19. Discussion of air-lines and bands. — Again, comparing my map sun
high with that at sunset, and beginning from the red end, the first group
met with are the air-bands 262 to 302.             These bands, so far as     I am
aware,   have not been placed before, if seen.        I have seen and taken mea
sures to them repeatedly ; but without the interposition of a blue glass
they were invisible.      The slit, too, must be sensibly widened. The whole
group    is  nearly at the end of the luminous rays, where, at sun high,
almost complete darkness prevails ; and after careful watching of this
group, I cannot help entertaining the belief that the range of the luminous
rays increases towards the red end of the spectrum as the sun approaches
the horizon.      With the sun high, hardly any light reaches so far a3 262
of the  scale.   When, however, the sun is setting, this part of the spectrum
lights up sensibly.     I  am even inclined to assert that other bands exist still
further removed from A than the group under notice ; they, however, ap
peared    too faint for intersection.    May it not be anticipated that, at con
siderable terrestrial altitudes, an extension of the spectrum will occur both
at the violet and red ends ?
    20. The same, continued. — Between 508 and 570 a very marked suc
cession of air-lines and bands occur.          Indeed, so far as I  have been able
to glance at the spectrum in general, the most refrangible rays appear the
most liable to absorption.       The air-bands about C and D are worthy of
 notice, as also are the air-lines 724 and 726.
    21. Discussion of variable lines — Both A and B appear as lines of this

1870.]             Atmospheric     Lines of the Solar Spectrum.                             7
class.    In the  absence  of  a  micrometer for measuring small spaces,              I  have
assumed that in widening out at sunset A does so equally on both sides ;
on the contrary, B, I believe, maintains its left (or violet) edge constant,
and changes towards its right (or red) edge.               The line 812 is the most
notably variable I have observed.             Unlike other lines, it commences to
change quite two to three hours before sunset.               The darkening is gradual
until near sunset, when it suddenly becomes black, and the band to the
right as suddenly appears.         The variable lines are, however, so numerous,
that further notice of them might prove tedious reading.                   I therefore con
tent myself by calling     attention    to  the  fact  that,  so  far as I  have the means
of judging, the variable lines at sunset and sun high superpose one another,
— more accurately speaking, on the former occasion, when they are gene
rally wider, they include the position occupied sun high.                    I need hardly
dwell on    the circumstance     that   the   loss  of  light   which    no   doubt occurs
near sunset cannot be the cause of the widening out in these lines ; for
constant lines, identified with KirchhofFs, stand mapped in the vicinity of
variable lines of greater and lesser refrangibility.
    22. Concluding remarks. — At the time of writing the air is so laden
with dust that you may gaze on the setting sun with impunity ; and spec
 troscopic observation, even at several degrees of altitude, is impossible.
 But when the ensuing rainy season is approaching its termination, and the
 exquisitely clear state of atmosphere once more returns, I hope to make
good progress with the map ; and also to try and ascertain*, by comparison
of the   map already made with the actual objects,             if the variable and atmo
spheric lines and bands change their appearance from time to time.                          A
 variation of the latter kind might open out a vast field of inquiry.
    23. Proposed alteration of spectroscope. — Though quite willing mean
 while to continue the work with the spectroscope as it now stands,                 I  should
 consider it a great boon if you would allow me to send it to England for
 certain improvements.        These I briefly indicate as follows: — 1. One or
 even two additional     prisms might be introduced into the drum, so as to
 increase the dispersion.       2. The collimator should be made up into one
 piece with the   drum,   and this may be done simply by uniting the present
 three pieces firmly together.        3. A micrometer introduced at the eye-end
 of the telescope    would  be   invaluable.       The stand answers every purpose,
 so that it might be useless sending it home, unless any delay is likely to
 occur in improvising a stand to adjust and test the instrument.                   Should I
 receive a favourable reply by the return mail, the spectroscope ought to
 reach Messrs. Troughton and Siraras by the end of July; and if they could
 undertake to do the needful alterations by the end of August, it would, if
 despatched immediately overland, reach me about the first week in October,
 just in time for the fine weather. Unless, however, these dates are not ex
 ceeded, I should lose the observing season, and this would be lamentable.
    24. The same. — Even should the foregoing meet with approval,                        I am

already owe Mr. Huggins a considerable debt of gratitude for past superin

   25. Zodiacal light. — Every attention has been given to this subject, but
the only result obtained        is,   that no traces whatever of the zodiacal light
are visible here.    I   was on the watch        in October and the early part of
November 1868.          In April and May of
                                       1869 my absence on duty at Dehra
prevented my devoting more    than an occasional evening to the subject.
Last autumn, however, gaveI     every attention, but all without seeing the
                                           it
light. The following extract from  my note-book, made the first morning
of my watching last winter,           isa representative of all subsequent entries —          :
    13th October,       1869.         Mussoorie Observatory. — A beautifully clear
morning.    Not speck of cloud or mist to be seen. The horizon, S.S.E.
                    a
by  S. to S.S.W., appears sharp and distinct, though some 90miles distant.
To the north, the snowy range, though some 60 miles away, appears hardly
a  day's journey from this.  The light                  is
                                             gradually increasing the red            ;
rays now tinge the sky     ;    the sky itself brightens the highest peaks
                                                                ;                        of the
snowy range are tipped with         light the sun bursts over the hills as
                                                ;                                        if   in   a
moment.       All   this has happened without any wings or rays preceding the
sun.    In other words, no     traces of the zodiacal light have appeared.
  26. The same, continued. — watched for the light on the mornings of the
                                       I
14th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, and 29th October, and on the 1st, 9th, and 15th No
vember, 1869. On all these occasions the air and sky were beautifully clear.
Other   dates   of watching, under unfavourable circumstances, are excluded
from this list.    Though no zodiacal light appeared to me at Mussoorie,                      it   is
worthy of remark that Colonel Walker, while travelling by post across the
plains of Central India, saw a brilliant show of the light (as far as    can             I
reckon)  between    the 12th and 15th of November, 1869. Recently   watched         I
for the light on the evenings of the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th April, 1870,
with the same results as before.
   27. The same, conclusion. — How far these facts supply  connecting-link  a
between the earth's atmosphere as medium and the zodiacal light leave for
                                                a                                    I
the consideration of more competent authorities. The information may have
some special interest for       Mr. Balfour Stewart, who,          I  learn from the monthly
notices of the Royal       Astronomical             Society,   has   given the subject some
attention.
   28. Actinometrical observations. — Discussion of these observations                             is
deferred until, with the assistance of Mr. W. H. Cole, M.A.,  am able to         I
reduce and forward the results already obtained.    The two actinometers
(Hod'gkinson's) work capitally, and are in good order.                           Amongst other
observations, they have been compared with one another.                          Unfortunately

 a press   of other work precluded them from comparison with the instrument
(standard) at Kew Observatory.           After inspection of the observations, you
 may be good enough to consider the desirability of sending me a third
actinometer of the same kind, due comparison being first made at Kew,
whereby the relation between         the instrument        at the Observatory (Kew)
and those sent out to me by the Royal Society may be established.
XV. " On the Radiation of Heat from the Moon.— No. II."                             By
         the Earl of Rosse, F.R.S.              Received June 14, 1870.
    In  a former communication        to the Royal Society I gave a short account
of some experiments on        the  radiation   of heat from the moon, made with
the three-foot reflector at Parsonstown, during the season of 1868-1869.
I  then showed     :
    1st.  That the moon's heat         can be detected      with certainty at any time
between the first and last quarter,        and  that,   as  far as could be ascertained
from so imperfect a series of observations, the increase and decrease of
her heat, with her phases, seems to be proportional to the increase and
decrease    of her light,  as deduced by calculation*.
    2ndly. That      a much smaller percentage of lunar than of solar rays is
transmitted by a plate of glass, and we therefore infer that a large portion
of the rays of high refrangibility, which reach the moon from the sun, do
not at once leave the moon's surface, but are first absorbed, raise the
temperature of the surface,       and afterwards leave it as heat-rays of low re
frangibility.
    3rdly. That, neglecting the effect of want of transparency in our atmo
sphere, and assuming, in the absence of any definite information on the
subject, that the radiating-power of the moon's surface is equal to that of
a blackened tin vessel filled with water, the lunar surface passes through a
range of 500° F. of temperature ; consequently the actual range is probably
considerably more.
    4thly. The proportion      between    the intensity of sunlight and moonlight,
and between the heat which comes from the sun and from the moon, as
deduced from those observations, agreed as nearly as could be expected
with the values found by independent methods, and for this reason might
be considered the more reliable.
    During the past season these observations have been continued, but much
time has been spent in trying various modifications of the apparatus, and
 a satisfactory comparison of observations made on different nights, under
 different circumstances, has been impossible         ;  however, by more numerous
and more complete experiments, made alternately with and without an inter-
          * See the Proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 112, 1869, page 439.

   The piece of glass used on the other occasions, instead of being placed
at six or eight inches from the pile, was laid against the end of the pro
tecting cone, or about half an inch from the face of the pile.                    When it
was placed in this position and tested for solar rays, an increase of devia
tion in the proportion of 1*1 to 1 was obtained, owing to the " bottling up"
of the sun's rays as in an ordinary greenhouse, and the keeping off of
currents of air.
   It seems    therefore to be clearly proved that there is a remarkable dif
ference between the sun's and the moon's heat in regard to their power of
passing through glass.           The amount transmitted varies from night to
night, and    in  the  later  observations the value was generally larger than in
the earlier ones.      Possibly this may have arisen from the formation of a

In all the foregoing experiments on lunar radiation the quantity                measured
by the thermopile was the difference between the radiatiou from the circle
of sky containing the moon's disk and that from a circle of sky of equal
diameter not containing the moon's disk ; we have obtained no information
in reference to the absolute temperature of either the moon or the sky.
    The following experiment was therefore made with the view of trying to
connect the radiation of the sky with that of a body of known temperature,
the deviation due to each degree (Fahrenheit) difference of temperature
 between a blackened tin vessel containing hot water and subtending a given
 angle at the pile and a similar vessel containing colder water was first
 ascertained ; then a similar determination of that due to the difference of
 radiation from one of these vessels, and from a portion of sky of equal
 diameter, was made.          The following      was the result : —
   * About   12 minutes in place   of   30 to 60 minutes.

 of glass employed.

   If   the temperature of space be really as low as is supposed, this result
seems to indicate considerable opacity of our atmosphere for heat-rays of
low refrangibility.
   The    ever varying transparency          of our atmosphere has been found to be
a very serious     obstacle   ;  but    the   much greater steadiness of the needle
during     the later experiments (the mean error of the last few nights' ob
servations having been from two to three aud a half per cent, only of the
whole deviation*) encourages us with the hope that, by taking advantage
of favourable moments, and measuring the moon's light simultaneously
with her heat, more accurate information                   on this subject may soon be
acquired.
   The observations were examined with the view of ascertaining how far
the heating-power of the moon's rays varies with her altitude.                   Owing to
the interference of clouds, and the limited range of altitude within which
the observations were made, it is hardly worth while to give the results in
detail ; however, I may just say that the heating-power of the moon's rays
appears to diminish with her altitude only about one-third as fast as the
intensity of the solar chemical rays, as ascertained by Roscoe and Thorpe.
   Au attempt was made to ascertain, by comparing two measurements of
the moon's light at different altitudes with two corresponding measure
ments of her heat, whether our atmosphere intercepts the heat-rays to a
greater extent than the luminous rays.                It was found that while the light
was diminished        with the altitude in the proportion of about 3 to 1, the
heat was diminished in the proportion of about 5 to 1 .                 In consequence,
however, of much of the moon's light and heat being intercepted by hazy
clouds, or condensed vapour, at the lower altitude, the experiment was in
conclusive as to the effect of         a  transparent     atmosphere on the dark rays
of heat.
    The accompanying diagram shows the proportion between the amount
of lunar heat found on various nights at various ages of the moon. There
appears to be a general accordance between the variation of her radiant
heat with her phase and the corresponding amount of her light as deduced
by calculation.
   * During the experiments of       the previous season the mean error varied between 27
per cent, and 85 per cent, or more.

    The integrals obtained in my last paper on this subject were deduced by
the same process which afforded the determinants in the first paper. It
is obvious that these integrals could be found by a more direct investiga
tion. This is what I am now going to attempt.                   It will be found moreover
that the present method will have the advantage of clearing away the am
biguities arising from the existence of common factors in the algebraical
coefficient of the highest differential, and the denominator of the exponen
tial in the solution.         It will also be found to lead us to certain ulterior
results.
   Let    us take the differential equation
             (*+/3*)g +(*'+r3'*+yV)                  g    + (a"+/3"*+yV)g
                     + (a'"+/3'"x+y'Vj)y=0.
   Let us now put in this equation
We shall easily        see   that it is impossible for the exponential to contain

Substituting these values in the differential equation, and equating the co
efficients of the highest powers of (x) to zero, we have

    The other integrals given in my last paper may              be deduced   in  a similar
way.

                                                                                     P   S

where    P, Q, p,   q are rational and entire functions        of (x).
    Let,  as before, the differential equation be
(«,+«,*+...                                                                     ...=o.

Then    it is easily   seen that the factors    of q must be divisors     of
                                 «o + ai#i + .••

 Now this series can evidently be written in the form
                                 y =R(#)eio+ii*+    ••• + vxm,
 where    H(x) can be expanded in descending powers of fx). Hence if this
 value   of y be substituted in the proposed differential equation, we may de

       Prof. Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received April 18, 1870.
                                                              Observatory, Feb. 27.
   Dear Sir, — I     have    little more definite to tell you with reference to the
star  »;  Argus ; thinking that a larger dispersion would be of advantage, I
have     had a supplementary arrangement added to the spectroscope, by
means of which a direct prism may be interposed between the collimator
and the usual prism.
   With this increased dispersion, the red line keeps its place        ; the yellow
one turns out to be      slightly more refrangible than D.
   The green lines, which, with the smaller dispersion,         were very difficult,
now become almost unmanageable ; this would seem to throw some doubt
on their reality, as mere extra dispersion should have little effect on real
lines.
   The direct prism being          a small one, does not take in the whole     of the
pencil when condensed to the limits bearable by the collimator ; but as
the arrangements at my disposal do not in any case admit of utilizing
the full condensation, the smallness of the prism has not had any material
effect.
   On the whole,       I am now inclined      to think that, with respect to the
green lines, the appearance         of the spectra is due to a character of light
somewhat similar to that of a Orionis, &c. ; a spectrum of groups of dark
lines, with spaces more or less free between them, producing the effect
(when the light is not sufficient to bear a slit fine enough for dark lines)
of a spectrum crossed by bright lines.
   The behaviour of the red line, however (of the blue one, being less con
spicuous, I cannot speak with so much confidence), would lead to the
already drawn inference that it is a real hydrogen line.
   I have examined other stars of about the same magnitude as rj Argils ;
in the majority of these there is not even a suspicion of condensation in
any part of the spectrum ; red stars, R Leporis for instance, give a spectrum
not dissimilar to that of »j Argils ; but the red line on none of the stars
examined is so conspicuous as in tj.
   The weather since the beginning of this year has been more favourable,
so that I am able, by degrees, to increase the amount of work done.              The
routine work is the review of figured nebula? ; as might be expected, the
4 feet gives views considerably different from the C. G. H. drawings ; but at
present I have nothing worthy of special mention.
   The light of the nebulae, as they are taken up for general examination,
is analyzed with the prism ; of those which have been examined I have yet
found none for which it may be certainly said that the light is not of defi
nite refrangibilities.
   In irregular nebula?,        the bright knots even, which     are  so   distinctly

mottled as to point to a cluster condition, give out, as far as have yet seen,
light which is monochromatic, or nearly so.
   Acknowledged clusters, where discrete stars are plainly discernible, are
of course excluded ; of the nebulosity mixed up with such clusters as
47 Toucan,     I cannot speak with certainty ; but if the light were monochro
matic,   I think that (in the     case particularized    at least) the brilliancy would
be sufficient to afford a definite impression.

   From Mr. Huggins's observations
of the nebulas in Orion, I gather
that he has seen only the three usual
lines ; with a wide slit,     I  had lately
a very strong suspicion of a fourth
line, probably G.        I  have not spe
cially   examined     the  nebulae   since  ;
but probably Mr. Huggins will be able to give confirmatory evidence.
   On the night of February 1 st we had a pretty brilliant auroral display ;
being at work at the time, I missed part of it ; but as soon as became          I
aware of its existence I applied the spectroscope.              At moments four lines
already known were easily visible, the chief line being remarkably brilliant.
A much narrower slit than that used could have been borne at the time of
maximum       display, which, however, lasted only a few moments.                  I was
intent on measuring the lines, as at the time I bad no published definite
                                                      o
information     with   reference   to other than Angstrom's special line ; but at
moments light was seen at the red end of the spectrum sufficiently bright
to leave a distinct impression of colour ; when, however, special attention
was devoted to that part of the spectrum the aurora had greatly diminished
in brilliancy, so that I was unable to make out whether a red line existed,
or whether there was a general spectrum at the red end.                 I incline to the
latter opinion, and put it down to the rose-coloured arc ; this arc, however,
which seemed pretty brilliant after the streamers had disappeared, did not
then give a visible spectrum.           Probably this phenomenon has been ob
served    before to better purpose        ;   but I  cannot find mention      thereof in
published accounts.                                          Yours truly,

   The   memoir describes     the principal scientific results which have been
obtained during the last three years, in the course of chemical work on the
Neilgherry Cinchona-plantations.
   The chemical characteristics of the various parts of the Cinchona plant
are described.     The condition in which the alkaloids are met with in the
living bark is shown to be that of a slightly soluble tannate existing in the
parenchymatous cells.
   The order of formation of the alkaloids is shown to be, 1st, uncrystal-
lizable quinine ; 2nd, crystallizable quinine ; 3rd, cinchonidine and cincho-
nine.    Reasons are adduced for thinking that the alkaloids are really formed
in the tissues in which they are found.
   The effect of the solar rays falling on the bark, either while living on
the tree or when separated,        is shown to be prejudicial         to its contained
alkaloids.     The effects of shielding the bark artificially, and the influence
of elevation of the site of growth, are detailed.
   The question as to whether the alkaloids are substitutes for the mineral
bases is discussed, and a series of experiments is described, which combine
to show either that such substitution does not take place, or does so only
in  a very partial degree.

    In my last communication*         I stated   that, from the results of my ex
periments,    I came to the conclusion that, by acting on these hydrocarbons
with chlorine,    a mixture   of primary     and secondary chlorides was formed,
as the alcohols derived from these        chlorides yielded on oxidation, besides
 an acid containing     the tame number      of carbon atoms as the alcohol, also
 acetones,  or the characteristic oxidation products of secondary alcohols.
    The  correctness   of this conclusion has been fully proved by further ex
periments, and      I am at present engaged in investigating the conditions
 under which the one or the other of these chlorides is formed.
    In order to obtain decisive results, it was first of all required to work on
 considerable quantities of a hydrocarbon ; and I selected for this research
 hexyl-hydride, C„ Hu, from petroleum, as this body can be obtained the
 most easily in a sufficient quantity.
    The derivatives of hexyl-hydride      have been     fully investigated by Cahours

and Pelouze*, but the results which            I
                                       have so far obtained differ in several
important points from  those of these eminent  chemists.
   By acting on this hydrocarbon with chlorine in the cold and in presence
              I
of iodine, prepared hexyl-chloride, C„ H13 CI, already described by Cahours
and Pelouze, which   boils at 125°-126° C. ; but besides this compound
there was also formed a pretty large quantity of a product which distilled
between 126° and 135° C, and from which no substance having a constant
boiling-point could be isolated. This higher boiling portion can be sepa
rated only with difficulty from the chloride boiling at 125°-126°, for even
after repeated distillations a residue of the former is always left behind.
   On heating the lower boiling chloride with glacial acetic acid and
potassium acetate a hexyl-acetate was obtained, of which the larger portion
distilled between 158° and 162°, the boiling-point rising up at last to 1/0°.
Besides the acetate a pretty large quantity of hexylene, C8 H„, had also
been formed by the decomposition           of the chloride.
  The chloride boiling       between     126° and 135°, treated      in the   same way,
yielded also hexylene, besides a hexyl-acetate distilling between 1G0° and
1/0°. According to Cahours and Pelouze, this ether boils at 145°.
  I   did not try to isolate definite compounds from these acetates, as               I
found that by converting them into the alcohols and subjecting these to frac
tional distillation, they easily split up into two distinct compounds, — one,
which forms the greater part of the mixture, boiling constantly at 140°-
 141°, and the other and smaller portion distilling between 150° and 155°;
the quantity of liquid coming over between these two limits being quite
insignificant.
   The liquid boiling at 140° is a secondary hexyl-alcohol ; on oxidation it
yields first an acetone, which, by further oxidation, splits up into acetic
acid and butyric acid.        It   is therefore methyl-butylcarbinol, — ¦

upon the hydride with chlorine.
 I   have found that,        by
                          treating this hydrocarbon with chlorine alone in
the cold as well as at the boiling-point, chlorides are obtained which boil
between   1   25° and 135°, and which appear to be identical with those described
above.   I     intend not only to study these chlorides more fully, but also to

electricity, and of electricity generally, upon nerve and muscle.
 1.   The electrical phenomena belonging to living nerve and muscle during
                              the state of rest.
  Argument. — Living nerve and muscle have an electricity of their own,
which fails      by
              degrees as life dies out, and        wanting altogether after
                                                                         is

 death.    This electricity is made known by the electrometer, as' well as by
the galvanometer.       Living nerve and muscle supply to the galvanometer
currents, called respectively the nerve-current and the muscle-current,
when the sides of the fibres are connected, through the coil, with either
one of the two ends, or when certain points upon the sides or upon the
ends are brought     together in the same manner, the direction of these cur-
rents showing that the sides of the fibres are positive in relation to either
of the two ends, or else the reverse (the instances of reversal being the
exception and not the rule), and that the positive surface becomes more
positive, and the negative surface more negative, as the distance from the
line of junction between these surfaces increases.     Living  nerve and muscle
are also (as is now for the first time distinctly  proved by means of Thom
son's New Quadrant Electrometer) capable of acting upon the electro
meter, the action showing that the electrical differences upon which the
nerve-current and muscle-current depend are not the same in all parts of
the fibres, the differences between the sides and the ends being differences
in kind, like those which belong to the two surfaces of a charged Leyden
jar, the differences upon the sides singly, and upon the ends singly, being
only those which indicate different degrees of tension in one kind of elec
tricity. In accounting for these phenomena, the very imperfect conducti-
bility of nerve and muscle, and of animal tissue generally, is taken as a
starting-point. It is assumed (and in support of this assumption some
new measurements of the resistance of nerve and muscle to electrical con
 duction are given) that in nerve and muscle the sheaths of the fibres may
conduct electricity so imperfectly as to be capable of acting as dielectrics, —
that a charge of one kind of electricity, developed on their outsides (by
oxygenation|or in some other way), may induce an opposite charge on their
insides, — and that the electrical condition of the two ends of the fibres may
 be opposed to that of the sides, because the charge induced within the
 sheath is conducted to the end3 by the contents of the sheath. It is sup
 posed, in short, that the fibres of living nerve and muscle during rest are
 so many charged Leyden jars, their electrical condition at this time being
 statical, not current, and that the nerve-current   and muscle-current are no
more than accidental phenomena arising from the galvanometer being
placed between two points which happen to be electrically dissimilar. And
in support of this view it is pointed out that precisely parallel electrical
phenomena may be obtained from a piece of wood, shaped like the piece of
 nerve or muscle, and coated on its sides, but not at its two ends, by a sheath
 formed of two layers of tinfoil separated by an intermediate layer of thin
 gutta-percha sheeting, if only the sides be charged as the sides of the piece
 of nerve or muscle    are supposed to be charged, and      if the electrodes of
 the galvanomer or electrometer be applied in the proper manner.
 2. The   electrical phenomena   which mark the passing of nerve and muscle
                   from the state of rest into that of action.
    Argument.   —  The nerve-current and muscle-current disappear almost

 24                Dr. C. B. Radcliffe on Animal Electricity.           [June 16,
 entirely when nerve and muscle pass from the state of rest into that of
 action.     The "secondary contraction" set up in a muscle by simply
 laying  its  nerve upon another muscle or nerve in which a state of action is
 present, points to a disturbance outside the anting nerve and muscle such
 as might be caused       by a discharge of electricity, and suggests the idea
 that the sudden disappearance of nerve-current and muscle-current in action
 may be owing to such discharge ; and this view is not a little borne out by
 certain close anatomical and physiological analogies which are found to
 exist between the muscular apparatus and the electric organs of the Tor
 pedo.     In short, the evidence seems to show that a discharge analogous to
 that of  the  Torpedo is developed, as Matteucci supposed, when nerve and
 muscle pass from the state of rest into that of action, and that the dis
 charge of the Torpedo itself may be nothing more than the unmasked
manifestation of a discharge which occurs in a masked form in every case
of nervous and muscular action.
   3. The workings     of voltaic electricity, and of electricity generally, upon
                                   nerve and muscle.
    Argument. — The behaviour of muscle under the action of the so-called
 "inverse" and "direct" currents is taken as the text in the present inquiry.
    Contraction in this case plainly belongs, not to the time when the circuit
remains closed, but to the moments of closing and opening the circuit,
when the nerves and muscles are acted upon by instantaneous currents,
 called extra- currents, which currents are in very deed discharges.         These
 extra-currents agree with ordinary induced currents in their discharge-like
 character   ; but they disagree     in their direction, the extra-current at the
closing   of  the circuit  taking  the  same course as the constant current, the
extra-current     at the opening having the opposite course ; and this point of
difference is not to be lost sight of. At first both extra-currents cause
contraction ; afterwards, when the muscle and nerve have lost some of their
susceptibility to impressions, only that extra-current causes contraction
which happens to pass in the same direction as that in which motor im
pulses are transmitted along the motor nerves to the muscles. With this
clue, indeed, it is not difficult to trace to its cause every variation in the
order of contraction" which characterizes the case in question.
    Nor is it altogether unintelligible that the behaviour of the muscles as to
the continuance of these contractions should, under ordinary circumstances,
differ in the case where the current is inverse, and in the case where the
current is direct.      This difference is noticed when the voltaic circuit is in
sulated, but not when an earth-wire is put to either of the poles. With the
 voltaic circuit insulated, the contractions continue for 60' or longer in the
case where the current is inverse, and for no longer than 15' or 20'         in the
case where the current is direct       : with  the earth-wire at the negative pole
the contractions continue for 60' or longer in the case where the current
is inverse, and in that in which the current is direct also ; with the earth

1870.]            Dr. C. B. Radcliffe on Animal Electricity.                   25
wire at the positive pole the contractions continue no longer than 1 5' or
20' in the case where the current is direct, and in that in which the cur
rent is inverse also.    With the earth-wire     at either pole — that is to say,
the part acted upon by the inverse current and the part acted upon by the
direct current are both made to contract for the same length of time, the
contraction in both parts being 60' or longer if the wire be at the negative
pole, and for no longer than 1 5' or 20' if it be at the positive pole.      Now
the earth-wire changes the charge of free electricity associated with the
inverse and direct currents, but it does not alter the course of those cur
rents.     When the voltaic circuit is insulated, the part acted upon by the
inverse current is charged positively, and that acted upon by direct current
negatively, the charge in each case proceeding from the voltaic pole which
happens to be nearest ; when the earth-wire is put to either pole, the free
electricity of that particular pole runs off to earth, and the parts between
the poles (the half traversed by the inverse current and the half traversed
by the direct current alike) are charged with the free electricity of the
other pole, — with positive electricity if the wire be at the negative pole,
with negative electricity if it be at the positive pole. The whole case,
indeed, is one which seems to admit of only one conclusion, namely this —
that the longer or shorter continuance of the contraction must have its ex
planation, not in the current being inverse in the one case and direct in the
other, but in the free electricity associated with one or both these currents
 being positive in the one case and negative in the other, the contraction
continuing for the longer time when this electricity is positive, and for the
shorter time when it is negative.        And that this should be so is not alto
gether unintelligible if the natural electrical condition of the fibres of living
nerve and muscle be what       it has been assumed to be — a condition  in which
the outsides and insides of the sheaths are in opposite electrical states, the
charge on the outside, usually positive, inducing the opposite charge on the
inside  ;  for on this assumption it may well be that a positive artificial
charge    to  the outsides of the sheaths may preserve the natural activity of
 the fibres, and so favour the continuance of the contraction by keeping up
 their natural charge, the positive electricity outside the sheaths inducing
negative electricity inside the sheaths ; and that a negative artificial charge
may have the contrary effect, the negative charge outside the sheaths in
ducing positive electricity within the sheaths, and so producing that re
versal in the relative position of the two electricities which is only met
with when the fibres are upon the point of losing their activity.
    Voltaic electricity, therefore, would seem to act upon nerve and muscle,
not by the constant current which passes while the circuit is closed, but by
the charge of free electricity, positive or negative, associated with this
current, and by the extra-currents which pass at the moments of closing
 and opening the circuit, which extra-currents are in very deed discharges,
 the charge being favourable to the continuance of activity when positive,
and unfavourable when negative, the instantaneous currents or discharges

causing action. As with the natural electricity of nerve and muscle, so in
this case, rest aud charge, and action and discharge would seem to go
together.
   And   so also with the action      of Franklinic and Faradaic electricity upon
nerve and muscle.         With Franklinic electricity the state of rest in both
nerve and muscle is plainly connected with the charge, and the state of action
with the discharge. With Franklinic electricity, too, the positive charge is
found to be favourable to the continuance of the state of action, and the
negative charge unfavourable.         And so likewise with Faradaic electricity,
not only as regards the connexion of the state of action with the discharge,
for the induced currents may be resolved into discharges, but also as regards
the connexion of the state of rest with the charge, for in the interval be
tween the two induced currents the secondary circuit is         in fact occupied by
a charge    of electricity.
                             Part II. — On   Electrotonus.
   Argument. — There is reason to believe that the whole truth has not yet
been elicited respecting the movements of the needle of the galvanometer
and the modifications of the activity of the nerve which are characteristic
of electrotonus.
   The movements of the         needle of the galvanometer characterizing electro
tonus appear to be due, not, as is commonly supposed, to modifications of
the nerve-current consequent upon the action of the voltaic current, but to
the passage through the coil of the galvanometer of streams of free electri
city, positive or negative, as the case may be, from the voltaic pole which
happens to be nearest to the coil, — of free positive electricity from the
positive pole in anelectrotonus, of free negative electricity from the negative
pole in cathelectrotonus. They cannot, so it is argued, be due to modifica
tions of the nerve-current consequent upon the action of the voltaic current,
because the same movements continue when there is no nerve-current to
be thus modified, as when a dead nerve is used in place of a living nerve,
or even when other bodies are substituted for nerve           ;  they may, so it is
suggested, be due to streams of free electricity passing through the coil of
the galvanometer from the nearest voltaic pole, because such streams do
pass in this direction, and because streams of free electricity from a
frictional machine so passed give rise to similar movements, — the stream of
positive    electricity  to the movement of anelectrotonus, the stream of
negative electricity    to  that of cathelectrotonus.    This is the view taken of
the movements of the needle of the galvanometer characterizing electro
tonus.
    A  different conclusion to that commonly held is also thought to be
necessary respecting the modifications of the activity of the nerve in elec
trotonus.      Instead of this activity being suspended in anelectrotonus and
exalted in cathelectrotonus, the facts, many of them new, are, when fully
realized, found to show that this suspension is met with, not in anelectro

tonus only, but in cathelectrotonus also.      It would seem, indeed, that the
only difference between anelectrotonus and cathelectrotonus in this respect
is, that this suspension is a little less complete in cathelectrotonus than in
anelectrotonus, a lesser '• stimulus
                                      "
                                         serving to cause action in the former
state than in the latter.    It would even seem that any proper exaltation of
activity is to be met with in anelectrotonus rather than in cathelectrotonus.
Such are the conclusions respecting the modifications of the activity of the
nerve in electrotonus which are believed to be warranted by all the facts,
old and new alike.
    Nor   is the increase of contraction   detected   by the myograph in cath
electrotonus a sufficient reason for concluding that the irritability of the
nerve and muscle is exalted in this state ; on the contrary, this increase
may be nothing more than the natural consequence of the altered electrical
condition in cathelectrotonus.     In ordinary muscular action, the state of
 elongation or relaxation is believed to be caused by the mutual attraction
of the charges of opposite electricities disposed upon the two surfaces of
 the sheaths of the muscular fibres, this attraction compressing the sheaths
 at right angles to their surfaces ; in ordinary muscular action the state of
 contraction is believed to be brought about by the discharge of the charges
 which caused the opposite state of elongation, this discharge leaving the
 fibres free to obey, as simple elastic bodies, the attractive force inherent in
 the physical constitution of their molecules.      In cathelectrotonic muscular
 action, on the other hand, it is believed that the state of elongation may
 be greater than that which is natural to the fibres (after removal from the
 body, at least), because the charge communicated from the negative pole to
 the fibres is greater than the natural charge of the fibres, the artificial
 charge to the outside of the sheaths inducing an equivalent charge of the
 opposite electricity on the insides, and so causing increased elongation by
increasing the compression to which the sheaths are subjected between
 these two charges ; and that the contraction may be increased, because
 contraction, according to this view, is only the return of the fibres, by
 virtue of their elasticity, from the previous state of increased elongation.
 The case supposed is precisely that which may be imitated in every
 particular upon a narrow band of thin india-rubber sheeting, coated with
 gold-leaf on its two surfaces within a short distance of their edge, or else
wetted to the same extent simply with water, and by charging and dis
 charging in turn ; for as the charge is communicated the band goes on
 elongating until the charge has reached its maximum, and when discharge
 is brought about there is sudden shortening, the degree of shortening being
 always commensurate with the previous degree of elongation. What happens
is that which is supposed to happen in ordinary muscular action and in cath
 electrotonic muscular action also, if only the effects of the smaller charge and
 discharge be made to stand for the first, and those of the fuller charge and
 discharge for the last form of muscular action.        It is of no moment, also,
 whether the electricity used in charging be negative or positive.       Whether

28              Dr. C. B. Radcliffe on Animal Electricity.             [June 16,
the charge he negative or positive, the results are the same, and therefore it is
plain that there ought also to be increased contraction in anelectrotonus if
this be the true explanation of the increased contraction which happens in
cathelectrotonus. In cathelectrotonus it is assumed that the negative charge
from the negative voltaic pole charges the outsides of the sheaths of the fibres
negatively, and induces an equivalent charge of positive electricity on the in-
eides ; in anelectrotonus, on the other hand, it is assumed that the positive
charge from the positive voltaic pole brings about a contrary state of things
in the fibres, charging the outsides of the sheaths positively, and affecting the
insides negatively by induction.      The difference assumed to exist between
the two electrotonic states is in the relative position of the two charges
upon the sheaths of the fibres, nothing else.       It is not a difference which
can affect the elongation of the fibre if elongation be brought about by the
mutual attraction of the opposite charges with which the sheaths are
charged ; for the attraction of either charge for the other must be the same,
whether it be exercised from within the sheath or from without it.              It
follows, indeed, from what is supposed, not only that there should be in
creased contraction in anelectrotonus as well as in cathelectrotonus, but
also that the state of rest in both electrotonic conditions should be
characterized by increased elongation.        And what there should be in
theory there is in fact ; for it proves on inquiry that contraction may be
caused in anelectrotonus by an adequate " stimulus," that this contraction
is greater than that caused by the same " stimulus
                                                        " in the unelectrotonized
state, and that actual increased elongation of the fibres is an effect of both
cathelectrotonus and anelectrotonus.       The view of muscular action here
taken is that which has been always advocated by the author as regards
contraction, but it is modified somewhat as regards elongation; for now,
instead of looking upon elongation as arising from the mutual repulsion
among the muscular molecules set up by the presence in the muscle of a
single charge of electricity, this state is referred to the mutual attraction of
opposite electrical charges disposed, as in a Leyden jar, upon the two sur
faces  of the sheaths of the muscular fibres.
    Looking back, then, at the history of electrotonus there appears to         be
nothing contradictory    to what has been already said respecting the work
ings of electricity upon nerve and muscle.          It is still the same story of
rest along with the state of charge, and of action along with the state of
 discharge, with this significant addition, that in electrotonus the charge is
 shown, not only as coincident with the state of rest, but as having an
actual power of suspending action in both nerve and muscle, and of causing
increased elongation of the fibres in muscle.

"  On Approach caused by Vibration." By Frederick Guthrie,
        B.A. Communicated by Prof. G. G. Stokes, Sec. R.S. Re
        ceived August 26, 1869*.
    § 1 . The chain of experiments which I have to describe arose from the
endeavour to explain an observation that a delicately suspended piece of
cardboard moves, from a considerable distance, towards a vibrating tuning-
fork. It will be preferable to detail the experiments, not in the order in
which they occurred to me and were actually performed, but in the order
              I
in which conceive them to form a logical sequence.
    § 2. The experiment of Clement shows that when a continuously renewed
current of air passes between two parallel disks from the common axis to
 wards the circumference, the disks are urged together.                    Consequently, in
 seeking to explain the fact observed in § 1, it was necessary to examine the
 air surrounding the resonant fork in order to ascertain whether air-currents
 existed in its neighbourhood ; and further, to distinguish between such
currents as might be found to move in closed curves forming whirlwinds in
 the immediate neighbourhood of the fork, and such as might radiate in un
 closed paths from the fork through the air.
     § 3. In 1831 Mr. Faraday f, in tracing the cause of the accumulation of
light particles on the internodal points and lines of vibrating bodies, came
to the conclusion that such accumulation was due to minute whirlwinds, and
not, as had been held by M. Savart J, to the existence of secondary nodes.
A general conclusion at which Mr. Faraday arrived                was this    : whenever the
different parts of a surface are vibrated to different degrees, there is always
a  tendency for the air to flow along the surface of the vibrating body to
wards the more violently agitated portions from the less agitated.
    § 4.   It  is clear that, before examining the possible connexion between
these superficial whirlwinds and the fact mentioned in § 1, it is necessary
to examine into the existence         of air-currents of unclosed paths.

30            Mr. P. Guthrie      on Approach caused by Vibration.
   The tuning-fork which was most employed, and
which   I call fork A, gave 128 complete vibrations per
second,   and had the following dimensions        : —            *£A
                               metre.
                          oy =0-0230,
                          ojt=0-0172,
                          o*=0-3255.
   I call   the three faces intersecting in o, the faces a, b,
and c respectively.        Let the symbol H^ &c. denote
the position of the fork when the face c is horizontal,
&c.
   § 5. Experiment       1. —The fork A     was set vibrating by drawing the bow
across the edge oy     ;  the plane of vibration was accordingly parallel to b.
The fork was then brought into the neighbourhood of an ascending thread
of smoke. The fork and smoke had in succession the three relative posi
tions : —
   (1) H4. The smoke passed across the face a parallel to oy.
   (2) Ho- The smoke passed across the face b parallel to ox.
   (3) H0. The smoke passed across the face c parallel to o x.
   In all cases the smoke clung to the surface across which it passed          as
though the fork were at rest.
   § 6. Experiment 2. — A cylindrical
glass tube T, 0-4 m. long and 0-042 m.                          ~" ~"
in internal diameter, was fastened (fig.
                                              2)
in a horizontal position. One end was left
open, the other carried a cork, through
the centre of which passed a horizontal
tube t, 004 m. long and 0-0035 m. in
ternal diameter.      These tubes were filled
with smoke, and the fork A, which had
been set vibrating as      in § 5, was brought
to the open end of the wide tube. The
fork and tube had in succession the
four relative positions shown in fig. 2,
namely    : —
   (1) Hc. Axis      of tube perpendicular
to a.
    (2) H0. Axis      of tube perpendicular
to a.
    (3) H„ or H4. Axis of tube perpendicular to c.
    (4) The same as (3), but having one prong of the fork thrust as far
as possible into the tube T.         In none of the cases did the smoke show any
 tendency    to escape through the tube t, nor was fresh air drawn in.
    § 7. Experiment 3.— The cork and tube t of experiment 2 were with

                 Mr. F. Guthrie on Approach                        caused by       Vibration.                     37
drawn and replaced by a film-bubble                         of glvcerine-soap-water.                  The       com
binations of position of experiment 2 were repeated.  In none   cases                                of the
did the bubble show any variation from the vertical plane.
                       I
   §8. Hence conclude that when a tuning-fork is in a state of plane
vibration, no permanent true air-currents are formed; that    no air-                                 is,
currents could be detected   departing from any side of the fork and pe
netrating the surrounding air in unclosed paths.
 §  9. The superficial whirlwinds examined       Mr. Faraday may be sup
                                                                      by
posed to be greatly modified when they are excited          the immediate                in
neighbourhood of                a  solid body  and as the
                                                    ;
                                                                       " attraction " which formed
the starting-point              of the present examination             (§    1)   is   exerted       upon   a   solid
body     in the neighbourhood of the resonant fork,                              some experiments, sup
plementary to those of Mr. Faraday, were found necessary.
 §  10. Numerous experiments, which need not be here detailed, showed
(1) that Mr. Faraday's surface-currents, as exhibited on   freely vibrating              a
fork, are very much modified when the fork vibrates in the immediate
neighbourhood of     rigid plane, and (2) that the effects of any currents
                                a
produced         by   vibration     do not extend sensibly beyond O'OOG m. from the
fork's   face, and only even to this extent near the a face.
 §     11. We shall see that the existence of such air-circuits, confined as
they are to the immediate vicinity of the fork, are quite insufficient to ac
count for the class of phenomena which have to be described, and which
are    similar   to the fundamental fact mentioned                      in   §   1
                                                                                 .
 §       Experiment 4. — To one end of
       12.                                                     a                        p-       o
splinter of wood, 0'5 m. long,      card                a
0'08 m. square was fastened   such way         in       a
that the plane of the card was vertical,
and           the line of the splinter.
         contained
The whole was hung from    fibre of un-        a
spun silk (fig.        3)   and counterpoised.               The
tuning-fork   was set in vibration as be
                  A
fore, and was brought towards the card                          in   the three relative positions cor
responding to those of      namely —      6,
                                    a §
                                                        :
      (1) (Hc). The face parallel to the card.
      (2) (Hc). The face parallel to the card.
                                    b
      (3) (Ha or H4). The face parallel to the card.
                                                   r.
   In all three cases the card moved towards the fork. The rate at which
the card moved was greatest when the fork was sounding loudest.      In all
three cases    was possible to draw the card from
                 it                                 distance of 0-05 m. at   a
least,   —distance quite beyond the direct influence of the superficial
             a

to move     be caused by the condition of the medium between the two, it
seems inevitable that the tendency shall be mutual. Thus, if that tendency
result from a general diminution in the tension of an elastic medium be
tween the two, they will be urged towards one another. To test the reci
procity of the motive tendency in the case under consideration the follow

   § 14. Experiment 5. The tuning-fork A was fastened to the end of a
rod TO m. long; the other end of the rod was counterpoised, and the
whole was hung from a silk tape. If the vertical plane passing through
the rod be called V, then the rod and fork received in succession                           the rela

(3) it was fastened to an iron rod in the direction of its axis, and the two
were then attached to the suspended rod at their common centre of gravity.
The fork was sounded by the bow as before, and a piece of card 0*05 m.
square was brought near the face a (in 1), b (in 2), and c (in 3).     In all
cases the suspended fork                          but, owing to the great

inertia    of the suspended fork and counterpoise, the motion  was much
slower and less striking than was the case when the card was hung.
   § 15. Experiment 6. — Further, instead of a card, a second fork, B
(sounding A), was set in vibration, and brought into the neighbourhood of

upon our problem, was this    What

             a                                                Though this      ?
question has received very great attention from theoretical physicists,                            it
has not been approached, as far as  am aware, from the side of experiment
                                         I
in the manner to be described.
  §   17. Experiment    — The fork A was fixed in an upright position in

its sounding-box (fig. 4).  One of its prongs was enclosed in glass tube                a
T, 0-4 m. long, and 0-042 m. internal diameter, carrying        cork through   a
which the prong passed.    The upper end of also carried cork, through
                                                        T                          a
which passed    narrow tube

 centrifugal     effect.   On passing the bow
across    /,  the enclosed   prong   was also set                  Fig. 4.
in vibration. When the amplitude of the
vibration was as great as possible, the
water had sunk in the tube t to the amount
of 0-003 m. The moment both prongs
were suddenly stopped the level of the
water in t was restored.         The depression
of the water in t cannot be due to in
creased temperature ; for, if it were so,
the increase of volume would be gradual
and accumulative,        and, on    stopping the
vibration, the contraction due to cooling
would be also gradual ; whereas the at
tainment of maximum depression and the
restoration      to normal    volume are prae-
tically instantaneous.
    § 18. We have here accordingly an experimental proof that the rapid
motion (in this instance vibration) of a body in a medium produces on the
whole an effect similar to that which would be produced by the expansion
of the body, namely, a displacement of the medium. If air were perfectly
elastic    and had no inertia, no such total displacement could ensue, and I
think I     may safely predict that the apparent expansion of the medium
will be found, in the      case of hydrogen less, and in the case of carbonic acid
greater than in that of air*.
    § 19. Though we know the dimensions of the fork and its rate of vibra
 tion, and though we can measure with tolerable accuracy the amplitude of
 its vibrations, we can only calculate from this the mean velocity of any
 given point, because in the middle of a vibration the fork is moving very
 much faster than towards the commencement or termination.                  Hence this
 vibratory displacement cannot, with our present data, be connected with the
 known rate at which air enters a vacuum.
    §20. The fundamental experiment of §§1, 12 next suggested for its
 explanation the following question.          Let there be two equal and opposite
 forces,  P and Q, producing equilibrium upon a body having inertia ; let one
 of  them,    P, be increased and diminished by a series of equal increments
 and decrements following one another in rapid succession. Will the con
 tinually varying force, whose mean is P, maintain average equilibrium with
 the unaltered force Q?         The plane of the cardboard in § 1 and § 12 is the
 seat of two opposing forces, namely the pressure of the atmosphere on
 both sides.      When the sounding-fork is held on one side, the pressure on
 that side undergoes successive equal increments and decrements.               Accord
ingly,   if  the question just proposed be answered in the negative,            a suffi-

  40           Mr. F. Guthrie on Approach        caused   by Vibration.
  cient ground would be at hand for the approach of the cardboard to the
  fork.
      §21. Experiments. — A "Cartesian diver" was               made  out of a test-
  tube, a bubble of air, and a beaker-glass of water.            This was so nicely
  adjusted   that it rose  when   near  the surface  of  the water,  and sank when
  the top of the tube was 0'05 m. below the surface. When resting on the
  bottom of the beaker, the top of the test-tube was 0"067 m. below the
  surface of the water. When the diver was resting on the bottom of the
  beaker, the tuning-fork A, in a state of vibration, was presented to the
  glass in various directions with regard to the tube. The fork was placed
  sometimes in contact with the water, sometimes in the neighbouring air,
  and sometimes in contact (towards the base of the fork) with the glass.
  Although the vibration of the bottom of the beaker caused the diver to
  leap up it invariably sank again, and showed no sign of undergoing any
  alteration in specific gravity. If, now, the question in § 20 were answerable
  in the negative, the equilibrium would have been destroyed, because the
  atmosperic pressure on the one hand, and the elasticity of the confined air
  on the other being equal and opposite forces, an alteration in one caused
  by its subjection to successive sonorous waves, would have altered the
  volume of the confined air and so destroyed the equilibrium.
     § 22. I hoped to throw light upon the fundamental experiment             of §   1
 and § 12, by varying the nature of the surface of the body which received
 the vibrations, with the view on the one hand of preserving them, and, on
 the other, of dispersing them as much as possible.          With this view expe
 riments 9-12 were undertaken.

 and its bottom in the plane V. The cylinder was coun
 terpoised, and the whole was hung from an unspun silk
                                                                                /

end of the cylinder in the three positions already de-                             ,
scribed, and also with one prong inserted into and nearly                          o

touching the bottom of the cylinder.          In all cases motion
towards the fork ensued.
    § 24. Experiment      10. — A handful    of cotton-wool was
hung upon the splinter in place        of the cylinder of experi
ment 12. The cotton-wool moved towards the fork from a
distance of at least 0*05 m., when the latter was presented
to it in either of the three positions, § 8.                              I
    Muslin and washleather behaved in a similar manner.
    §25. Experiment 11. — A circular paper drum 025m.                  in diameter
having a rim 0"025 m. deep, was hung by a silk tape in the same manner
as the cylinder   of § 23. Parchment was stretched across the wide eud of

a funnel 02 m. in diameter.    The neck of the funnel was placed in the
mouth, and the drum of the funnel was brought opposite and parallel to
the edged face of the paper drum.   Air was rapidly forced into and drawn
out of the funnel.   The paper drum moved towards the funnel even from
a distance    of 01 m.
   §26. Experiment       12. — A sheet
                                   of cardboard 0'4 m. square was hung
in the plane V froma rod I -0 m. long.   The cardboard was counterpoised,
and hung from a silk tape. The paper drum of § 25 was placed 0"05 in.
from the cardboard, and parallel to          it,
                                       and was then thipped.   The card
board moved towards the drum.
    §27. Experiment 13. — rod of brass l'2m. long, provided at the ends
                               A.
with disks of brass perpendicular to the rod 0-26 m. in diameter, was set
in longitudinal vibration     by
                             means of rcsined leather.  One of the disks
was held, during the vibration, near to the cardboard of 26, also near the
                                                                 §

two were at the distance of 0"2 m.
    §28.  I have in the foregoing paragraphs sought to eliminate systema
tically secondary and disturbing influences from the fundamental experi
ment.    The experimental results appear to me to point to the following
conclusions.
    Whenever     an elastic mediumbetween two vibrating bodies, or between
                                      is
a vibrating body and one at rest, and when the vibrations are dispersed in
consequence of their impact on one or both of the bodies, the bodies will
be urged together.
    The dispersion of    vibration produces
                         a                     similar effect to that produced
                                                   a
by  the  dispersion of the  air-current in Clement's  experiment, and, like the
latter, the effect   due to the pressure exerted by the medium, which
                    is                                                       in   is
a state of higher mean tension on the side of the body furthest from the
origin of vibration than on the side towards it.
    In   mechanics, — in nature there       is   no such thing as   a   pulling force —
though the term attraction may have been used    the above to denote the
                                                         in
tendency of  bodies to  approach, the line of conclusions here indicated
tends to argue that there    no such thing as attraction in the sense of
                              is                                                       a
pulling force, and  that  two utterly isolated bodies cannot influence one
another.
    If the   setherial vibrations which are supposed to constitute radiant heat
resemble the aerial vibrations which        constitute radiant sound, the heat
which all bodies possess, and which they are all supposed to radiate in ex
change, will cause all bodies to be urged towards one another.

On Jacobi's Theorem respecting the relative equilibrium of a
   Revolving Ellipsoid of Fluid, and on Ivory's discussion of
   the Theorem."     By I. Todhunter, M.A., F.R.S., late Fellow
   of St. John's College, Cambridge.   Received November 23,
      1869*.
   1. The late James Ivory contributed       to the Philosophical Transac
tions various memoirs on the subject of the equilibrium of fluids and the
figure of the earth : the memoirs will be found in the volumes for 1824,
1831, 1834, and 1839.     Ivory objected to the received theory of the equi
librium of fluids, and advocated some peculiar opinions at great length,
and with much repetition.     I do not propose now to criticise these memoirs ;
I  will merely state that I consider them to be altogether unsatisfactory.
   2. There    is,
                 however, one theorem in the general subject to which                          I
now propose to draw attention, namely, Jacobi's theorem respecting the
possibility of the relative equilibrium of an ellipsoid of fluid having three
unequal axes and revolving about the least. Ivory discussed this theorem,
and hia errors are so numerous and so singular, that        have thought    I                  it
would be desirable to place the corrections before the Society which origi
nally received and published Ivory's communications. In correcting Ivory's
errors and supplying his defects,    shall add something to the discussions
                                          I
which have hitherto been given of the theorem itself.          will be seen     It
as we proceed that         one   of Ivory's errors has          been     already noticed and
corrected.
   3. Ivory first alluded to the matter in the memoir of 834, which was read
                                                                        1
to the Royal Society      few months before Jacobi announced his discovery
                            a
of the theorem. Of course at that date Ivory held the common opinion,
that the relative equilibrium of  revolving ellipsoid with three unequal
                                          a
axes was impossible.    But he does not merely acquiesce in the erroneous
opinion, he attempts to demonstrate     in the following manner —
                                                it
   " Further, the figure of the fluid in equilibrium can be no other than
                                                                                     :

 which obviously excludes       ellipsoids with three unequal axes, and limits the
 figures  of equilibrium   to spheroids formed by the revolution of an ellipsis
 about the axis    of rotation  ; . .  ."
    The error here begins with the sentence which I have put in italics ; the
resultant of the attractions parallel to y and z need not act in the plane
 which Ivory specifies : the component which he obtains in a plane touching
the surface may be balanced by a like component arising from the attrac
tion parallel to   x and the the so-called centrifugal force.
    4.  To the Philosophical Transactions for 1838 Ivory contributed a
memoir of ten pages on Jacobi's theorem.                  Ivory devotes a few sentences
to the history of the matter.              He records the fact that Lagrange had
inferred that the figure of relative equilibrium must be a figure of revolu
tion.    He makes no allusion, however, to his own erroneous demonstration
in the volume for 1834.
    5.  The object of the memoir          seems to be twofold     — to establish Jacobi's
theorem,     and to deduce numerical results relating to the extreme possible
cases   analogous to those which had long been known relating to the extreme
possible cases for an ellipsoid        of revolution.      The first object is attained ;
Jacobi's theorem is demonstrated             in a   manner    resembling that which had
previously been used by Liouville.             The second object Ivory fails to attain,
owing to an error in his process.
    6.  In the  second page    of the memoir there          is an error in mechanics re
sembling     that  which we have already noticed            in Art. 3.   At any point in
the surface     of  an ellipsoid,     let the normal to the surface be drawn ; and
let it be terminated by the principal plane which is perpendicular to the
axis of rotation : let p be the length of this straight line.               At the same
point   in the surface draw a straight line in the direction of the resultant
of the attraction of the whole mass of the ellipsoid, and let it be terminated
by the same principal plane ; let p' be the length of this straight line, then
 Ivory says : —
    " Let a denote the third side of the
                                                     triangle which has p and p' for its
 other sides : then <r will represent the only force which, together with the
 attractive force p, will produce a resultant in the direction of p at right
 angles   to the surface of the ellipsoid."
    This statement is quite wrong. Any straight line which is in the same
 plane as the normal at any point, and the direction of the resultant attrac
 tion at that point, may be taken for the direction of such an additional force
 as Ivory requires ; and the magnitude of the force can then be properly
 determined.
    7.  In   order to render the discussion of Ivory's memoir readily intel
 ligible, it will be necessary to indicate briefly the demonstration of Jacobi's
 theorem.

   Take     the axis of x for that of revolution, and let            u> be the angular

Here   we have changed u into         x, and  X into    J, in order to have the      same
notation as Ivory has.         Ivory says :
   " From the equation
                             (4) we learn that q will be known when / is given,
or that every spheroid of a determinate form requires an appropriate
velocity of rotation.
   " The    inspection of the same equation is sufficient to show that q is
positive   for all values of T ; and as it vanishes both when V is zero and
infinitely great, it must pass at least once from increasing to decreasing,
or it will admit of at least one maximum value.                   By differentiating with
            /

                                                is positive between      the limits  f =0
and  T=l    ; that it will consist of a positive and a negative part when V is
greater   than   1; and the positive part decreasing while the negative part
increases, that it will ultimately be negative when I' is infinitely great.
It  follows   therefore that
                                   T^   can be only once equal to zero, and conse-
quently that    q can have    only one maximum value, while            P  increases  from
0 to oc ."
   This is quite unsound,        because the words which        I  have put in italics are
untrue.     There are two ways of separating the integral into a positive part
and a negative part.         We may take for the positive part the integral

   9. However, although Ivory's reasoning                                   is      unsound, the result which he
wishes to establish                is   correct, as      I    shall now show.
                                                                                X

 I        increases from unity to                   infinity, the integral vanishes and                              changes     sign
once, and only once.
     It
      obvious that the integral must vanish once, because
          is                                                        positive                                      it   is

case, but the sign             is certainly negative.
     Put z for Ix        ;    thus the integral becomes

     19.As I have already stated, Ivory accepted the correction made by
Liouville ; but in the two pages in which the mistake is acknowledged
other untenable assertions are advanced. It was in effect necessary for
Ivory's purpose to trace the curve determined by V=0 in the first quadrant ;
but instead of demonstration such as we have supplied in Art. 14, Ivory
gives unwarranted assertions of the kind already noticed in Art. 18.

According         to Ivory's statement                   it   would be necessary that

aggregate of the negative elements.    However, be this as it may, there
can be no doubt that the specific criterion which Ivory proposes is quite
unsupported            by demonstration.
     When        p    and r are very large, the relation               between them is approxi
mately that given                 in Art.    1 5.
     21.       In Arts.     it is shown that for every given value of p greater
                                14 and 16
 than p,, there is one, and only one, value of r which will make V vanish.
 We shall now show that corresponding to every value of r there is one,
 and only one, value of p which will make V vanish.
    Whatever be the given value of r, it is obvious that V is positive when
j5=0, and negative when p is large enough: thus there must be some in
 termediate value of p which makes V vanish.
     We have then to show that there is only one such value ; to show this
we   shall demonstrate the proposition which Ivory asserted on insufficient
grounds,         namely, that            —   can never vanish simultaneously with          V.

     We shall first show that the limit                       p= 3   may be changed to          a   larger
limit.

in the first quadrant, every straight line parallel to the axis of p meets the
curve once, and only once, and every straight line parallel to the axis of r,
and at a greater distance from it than pv meets the curve once, and only
once.        As -y- vanishes with r, the curve   meets the axis    of p  at right angles ;
and from        Art. 15 it follows that when r and p are indefinitely great,
the angle which the tangent to the curve makes with the axis of p is very
nearly a right angle. Thus, for small values of r the curve is concave to
the axis of p, and for very large values of t the curve is convex to the axis
of p   ;   so that the curve must have a point or points         of inflexion.

paper in the Transactions for 1838, Mr. Ivory has with great elegance
 demonstrated this theorem, and has given, with greater detail than its
 authors had entered on, several statements regarding the limitations of the
proportions of the axes."         The language is cautious, but seems to imply
some suspicion with regard to the accuracy of the statements.                      As we
have now seen, many of Ivory's statements are inaccurate, and others,
though accurate, are based on unsound reasoning.

         quorn Rankine.          Received December 9, 1869*.
    In venturing to present to the Royal Society         a paper on a subject which
 has engaged      the attention, more   especially  in  France,    of some of the most
 eminent engineers and writers on Mechanical Philosophy, the author feels
 it to   be incumbent on him to state the nature       of the claim to their attention
 which he hopes it may be found to possess             in point of originality or im
 provement on the method of treatment.
    To do this clearly, however, it will            be necessary      to advert to the
 principal steps by     which  progress in the knowledge of this subject has been
 made, both in France and in this country.
    The theory of continuous beams appears to have first attracted attention
 in France about 1825, when a method of determining all the conditions
 of equilibrium of a straight beam of uniform section throughout, resting
 on any number of level supports at any distances apart, each span being
 loaded uniformly, but the uniform loads varying in any manner from one
 span to another, was investigated and published by M. Navier.                        This
 method, although perfectly exact for the assumed conditions, was objection
  able    from the great labour and intricacy of the calculations it entailed.

           Mr. J. M. Heppel        on the Theory   of Continuous Beams.         57
  Messrs. Molinos and Pronnier, in their work entitled ' Traite" Theorique et
  Pratique de la construction des Pouts Metalliques,' describe this process
 fully, and show that for a bridge of n openings, the solution must be effected
 of 3»+ 1 equations, involving as many unknown quantities, these equations
 being themselves of a complex character ; and they observe,
                                                                   " Thus to find
 the curve of the moments of rupture for a bridge of 6 spans 1 9 equations
 must be operated on ; such calculations would be repulsive, and when the
 number of spans is at all considerable this method must be abandoned."
     The method of M. Navier, however, remained the only one available
 till about 1849, when M. Clapeyron, Ingenieur des Mines, and Member of
 the Academy of Sciences, being charged with the construction of the Pont
 d'Asnieres, a bridge of five continuous spans over the Seine, near Paris,
applied himself to seek some more manageable process.              He appears to
have perceived (and so far as the writer is informed, to have been the first
to perceive) that if the bending moments over the supports at the ends of
any span were known as well as the amount and distribution of the load, the
entire mechanical condition of this portion of the beam would become known
just as if it were an independent beam. Upon this M. Clapeyron proceeded
to form a set of equations involving as unknown quantities the bending
moments over the supports, with a view to their determination.          He found
himself, however, obliged to introduce into these equations a second set of
unknown quantities (" inconnues auxiliaires "), being the inclinations of the
deflection curve at the points of support, and not having arrived at a general
method of eliminating these latter, was obliged to operate in each case on
a number of equations equal to twice the number of spans. M. Clapeyron
 does not appear, as yet, to have made any formal publication of his method,
but to have used it in his own practice, and communicated it freely to those
with whom he came in contact.
     In 1856, M. Bertot, Ingenieur Civil, appears to have found the means
 of eliminating this second set of unknown quantities n + 1 in number for
 a bridge of n spans, and thus reducing the number of equations to n— 1.
     Each of these equations involved as unknown quantities the bending
 moments over three consecutive supports, and was considered, from its
 remarkable symmetry and simplicity, to merit a distinctive name, that of
 " The    Theorem of the three Moments."
     The method, however, to which this theorem is the key, is still every
 where called that of     M. Clapeyron, and, as it appears to the writer, justly
 so, as it was an immediate and simple result from his investigations, with
 which    M. Bertot   was well acquainted.
     The next important        advance   was   made in 1861,   when   M. Bresse,
 Professeur    de  Mecanique      appliquee  ;t l'Ecole Imperiale  des  Ponts et
 Chaussees, completed the matter of the third volume of his course, which
 is exclusively devoted to this subject*.           M. Bresse explains and de-

 was not published  till 1865,

58           Mr.      J.   M. Heppel on            the Theory    of Continuous Beams.
monstrates the theorem of the three moments, at the knowledge of which
he had himself arrived from               M. Clapeyron's investigations, independently of
M. Bertot.   He then goes on to the investigation of an equation of much
greater generality, in which what is termed by English writers
                                                               " imperfect
continuity
                  "
             is taken into account, being, however, there replaced by the
precisely equivalent notion of original differences of level in the supports,
the beam being always supposed primitively straight; besides this the loads,
instead of being taken as uniform for each span, are considered as distributed
in any given manner.
   Having obtained this fundamental equation, M. Bresse proceeds to
investigate the nature of the curves, which are the envelopes of the greatest
bending moments produced at each point, by the most unfavourable
distribution of the load in reference to                   it,
                                               and finally gives tables for the
ready  calculation of results in   great variety of cases, comprising most of
                                               a
those likely to occur in practice.
   During the time that M. Bresse was engaged in these researches, an
 Imperial Commission was formed, of which he was            member, for the     a
 purpose   of devising rules applicable to practice,  and  the results of his
labours have been the basis of legislative enactments equivalent to our
 Board of Trade regulations prescribing the methods to be followed in
determining the stresses in the various parts of the structure.
   About the same time that M, Bresse turned his attention to this sub
ject,  itappears also to have engaged that of M. Belanger, who in his work
 entitled Theorie de      Resistance et de la Flexion Plane des Solides &c,
                                la

                            a
which in one point of view     slightly more general than that of M. Bresse,
                                          is
as    takes in variation of the moment of inertia of the section from one
     it
span to another.     In another point of view its generality   slightly less,          is
as   it     only with loads distributed over each separate span uniformly,
          deals
whereas      M. Bresse
                     replaces the simple algebraical terms expressing these
by definite integrals expressing the load as   function of the distance from
                                                                a
one of the points of support.
  As far as the writer      informed, little has been
                                     is                                         done    in France to
advance this theory beyond the point to which                         by the
                                                                        it   was brought
writers last mentioned, and especially by M. Bresse but valuable contri     ;
butions to its development in reference to application to practice are to be
found in the work of MM. Molinos and Pronnier above referred to, as well
as in various           papers by     MM.          Renaudot,     Albaret,   Colignon, Piarron de
Mondesir,         &c.
     In England little or no attention appears to                   have been paid to this sub
ject by writers on mechanics till 1843, when the Rev. Henry Moseley,
 Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy at King's College, London,
published his work on 'The Mechanical Principles of Engineering and
Architecture.' In part       of this work, which treats of the strength of
                                     5
materials, four cases of continuous beams are fully investigated, and the

           Mr. J. M. Heppel      on the Theory   of Continuous Beams.           59
general case is to a certain extent discussed, the method of M. Navier
being perhaps rather indicated than fully developed.
    Prof. Moseley's work was altogether a most valuable contribution to
engineering science, and, as far as the present subject is concerned, no
doubt furnished the groundwork of the method applied by Mr. Pole to
the solution of other particular but more complex and difficult cases.
    The first case which engaged the attention of Mr. Pole appears to have
been that of the bridge over the Trent at Torksey, consisting of two spans
of continuous tubular beams, resting on abutments and a central pier.
For special reasons it had become necessary that the real conditions of
equilibrium of this bridge should      be investigated  with more than ordinary
precision ; and this Mr. Pole did by a      method virtually identical with that
of M. Navier, though it does not appear that he had any previous know
ledge of that method, except through the medium of Moseley's work.
Throughout Moseley's cases, however, the load on the beam is considered
as distributed uniformly over its entire length, whereas Mr. Pole had to
deal with the case of different loads on the two spans, and no doubt had to
devise the method of analysis necessary for its treatment.              Mr. Pole's
                                                            '
paper on this subject is published in vol. ix. of the Minutes of Proceed
ings Inst. Civ. En.' 1849-50.
     As far as this went, however, it could hardly be considered to have
 advanced the theory of the subject, as M. Navier's method included this
 case, and much more; but about the same time         Mr. Pole had   to investigate
 the   case  of a  much larger work, the Britannia Bridge, where he had to
 deal with some new conditions, which, as far as the writer is aware, were
 then for the first time successfully treated.
     These were that, besides variation of load on the different       spans, their
 cross sections also varied, and there was imperfect continuity over the
 centre pier, that is to say, that the points of support being supposed to
 range in a straight line, the beam if relieved from all weight would cease
 to remain in contact with them all, and would consist of two equal straight
 portions, forming an angle pointing upwards.            The process, which for
  distinction may be called that      of M.   Navier,  was  skilfully extended by
  Mr. Pole so as to include these new circumstances, and by its means
  results were obtained certainly true within a very small limit, and as near
  the absolute truth as any existing means of treating the subject would
  produce.
     Mr. Pole's researches    on this subject are published   in Mr. Edwin Clark's
  work on the Britannia and Conway Bridges, 1850. Both from the clear
  and accurate treatment of the case and the record of the numerous and
  delicate observations by which the theoretical conclusions were continually
  verified and kept in check, they are most strongly to be recommended to
  the attention of engineers    having to deal with works of this character.
      The  sequence  of events now compels the writer to advert to some studies
   of his own.    In 1858-59, being then Chief Engineer of        the Madras   Rail

   60       Mr. J. M. Heppel        on the Theory      of Continuous   Beams.
   way, he had occasion to investigate the conditions of a bridge of five
   continuous spans over the River Palar. Having in India no books to refer
   to but those of Moseley and Edwin Clark, he found himself unable to extend
   the treatment of the cases there given to that of a beam with an increased
  number of openings and varying loads. After many attempts and failures,
  the same idea occurred to him which appears to have struck M. Clapeyron
  nine or ten years before, that if the bending moments over the supports
  were known, the whole conditions would become known.
      Following this clue, he was fortunate enough to succeed in at once
  eliminating the other unknown quantities, which M. Clapeyron had been
  obliged to retain in his equations for many years after his original discovery
  of the method, and thus to arrive at an equation precisely identical with
  that which had been first published in France by M. Bertot in 1856, and
  was known as the      " Theorem of the three Moments."
      This was sufficient for the immediate purpose, as the beams           in question
  were straight and     of uniform section throughout, conditions        to  which this
  theorem is strictly applicable without any modification whatever.
      As, however, the writer was at this time under the impression that he
 was using an entirely new mode of analysis, he was naturally anxious to
 check its results by comparison with those obtained in some well-known
 case by other means.         Fortunately be had at hand that of the Britannia
 Bridge, perhaps the best that could have been selected ; but for this purpose
 it became necessary to import into the fundamental equation the conditions
 of varying   sections in the different spans and imperfect continuity.           This,
 however, presented no great difficulty, and by means of an equation thus
 modified, he had the satisfaction of reproducing all Mr. Pole's results, and
 thus convincing himself of the trustworthiness of the method in question.
     The equation thus generalized is absolutely identical with that arrived at
 by M. Belanger in the work above referred to*.
     It would appear, then, that the theory of this subject was independently
 advanced to about the same state of perfection in France and in England,
 though as regards the development of its application to practice no doubt
 very much the more has been done            in the former country.
     The writer will now advert to some inherent defects of this theory, the
cure of which is the principal object of the investigation which follows.
     The chief one, which is admitted by all writers on the subject, is the
necessity for supposing the moment of inertia of the section constant
throughout each span ; any more general hypothesis, it is said, would render
the calculation inextricable.        Still it is certain that the conclusions arrived
at on the hypothesis of a constant section cease to be true if a variation of
section is introduced, and the amount of error thereby induced, though
considered to be probably small, is still a matter of uncertainty.
     The next defect is the assumption of uniformity of load throughout
    * A paper on this subject by the writer was published in the Minutes of Proceedings
Inst. C.E. vol. xh. 1859-60.

           Mr.    J.  M. Heppel on          the Theory    of Continuous Beams.           Gl
 each span ;    for although as far as rolling load is concerned no more correct
 hypothesis could be made, the weight of the bridge itself, if a large one,
 usually varies considerably in the different parts of the same span.
    The equation given by M. Bresse, as has been stated, provides for certain
 kinds   of variable      loads by the use       of integrals, but the writer is not aware
that they have been applied, even by that author himself, to the purposes
of calculation, and it seems to him that in most cases the attempt to make
such an     application would be beset with difficulties.
    It will, however, it is hoped, be seen from what follows, that the dealing
with variations of the above elements does not in fact present any very
formidable difficulty,        though no doubt the labour of calculation is greater ;
but what the writer regards as most satisfactory is the very small difference
in the principal results          in the  case   of the Britannia (where   these variations
greatly exceed       in amount those usually occurring), whether obtained by
the   approximate method hitherto followed, or by the more rigorous one to
be  explained, affording a strong presumption that in all ordinary cases the
former method maybe confidently                  employed without risk of any important
error.
   Should      the following treatment of the case be deemed successful, the
author would remark that its success is mainly due to the use of an
abbreviated functional notation, by which a great degree of clearness and
symmetry is preserved in expressions which would otherwise have become
inextricably complex.

68                  Dr. W.     J. M. Rankine on Mr. Heppel's
considered as demonstrated that, for most ordinary cases of large bridges,
calculations founded on equation (26) may be confidently relied on.                     It
need scarcely    be   remarked    that these are  much    more   simple   and   easy than
those founded on the more exact but complex equations above given.
   In smaller bridges, however, the error of the approximate process will
be more considerable, and the process            above given may be applied with
advantage    to its  correction.
   In concluding this paper, the author desires to record his thanks to his
young friend, Mr. Henry Reilly, for the patience and skill with which he
made, in detail, all the intricate calculations      of the numerical values of the
various functions involved in the above demonstration.

   1.  Condensed form of stating the Theory. — The advantages possessed
by Mr. Heppel's method of treating the mathematical problem of the state
of stress in a continuous beam will probably cause it to be used both in
practice and in scientific study.
   The manner in which the theory is set forth in Mr. Heppel's paper is
remarkably clear and satisfactory, especially as the several steps of the
algebraical investigation correspond closely with the steps of the arithme
tical calculations which will have to be performed in applying the method
to practice.
   Still it appears to me that, for the scientific study of the principles of
the method, and for the instruction of students in engineering science, it
may be desirable to have those principles expressed in a condensed form ;
and with that view      I have  drawn up the following statement of them, which is
virtually not a new investigation,       but Mr. Heppel's investigation abridged.
   Let (x=0, y=0) and (x=l,             y=0)   be the coordinates        of two adjacent
points of support of      a continuous beam,    *  being horizontal.       Let y and the
vertical forces be positive downwards.
   At a given point x in the span between those points let fi be the load
per unit of span, and EI the stiffness of the cross-section, each of which
functions may be uniform or variable, continuous or discontinuous.
   In  each   of the following double and quadruple definite integrals, let the
lower limits be     x=0.

   Consider,     now, an adjacent span extending from the point of support
(x=0)     to  a  distance (— x=V) in the opposite direction, and let the defi
nite integrals expressed by the formula (1), with their lower limits still
at the same point (j=0), be taken for this new span, being distinguished
by the suffix —1 instead of 1.           Let — T' be the slope at the point of sup
port   (x=0).        Then  we have for the value      of that slope,
   Add together the equations (5) and (5A),             and let t=T— V denote the
tangent of the small angle made by the neutral layers of the two spans
with each other in order to give imperfect continuity. Then, after clearing
fractions, we have the following equation, which expresses the theorem of
the three moments in        Mr. Heppel's theory : —
           0=*(,(3lP + 9_tf-«i«'2-M_iZ'Zs)-*l!?ir-<l._15-_'f

   That equation gives          a linear   relation  between   the bending moments
       *oi *i   at any three consecutive points of support, and certain known
functions of known quantities.            In a continuous girder of N spans there
are N   —  1 such equations and N        —   1 unknown moments;      for the moments
at the end most supports are each=0.                  The moments at the interme
diate points of support are to be found by elimination ; which having
been done, the remaining quantities required may be computed for any
particular span as follows : — The inclination T at a point of support by
equation (5) ; the shearing force P at the same point by equation (4) ;
the deflection y and moment * at any point in that span by equations (3)
and (2).     Points of maximum and minimum bending moment                 are   of course
found by making -r-        =0   ; and points of inflection by making      *=0.

just described forms the basis of the formulae given in a treatise called ' A

 desirable to test those formulae by means of Mr. Heppel's method.

   On endeavouring to prepare apomorphia by cheap method, Mr. Mayer

elements of water could not be abstracted               by
                                            this reagent (the results of
this reaction have not yet been published)     Apomorphia having been ob

the elements of water, might be prepared by      similar reaction.

ing the  experiment    new
                        a   base was  obtained, which  proved  on  analysis to
be apocodeia.
   When hydrochlorate of codeia         is   heated with an excess       of   a   concentrated
solution of chloride of zinc, to    temperature varying between

180°   C,   for about  minutes, the decomposition takes place

a yellowish-brown tarry mass separates from the liquid, which on further
cooling may be drawn into thin threads, and thus obtained almost free
from the excess of the chloride of zinc.  This amorphous silk-like mass                        is
almost pure hydrochlorate of apocodeia.     To obtain the base in    pure                 a
state from this substance, the following method was employed  —                   :
   The hydrochlorate was dissolved in hot water and precipitated by by-

drochloric acid. The liquid containing the precipitated hydro-chlorate was
allowed to cool, and the precipitate on solidifying was separated from the acid
solution.     The operation of dissolving and reprecipitating with hydrochloric
acid was repeated several times, and lastly the hydrochlorate was dissolved
in water, precipitated with carbonate of sodium, and the base extracted
with ether. On evaporating the ether-solution the base remained behind
as an amorphous,        gum-like, reddish mass ; this was powdered, dried in
a  water-bath,   and   gave on analysis the following results.         All combus
tions were made with oxide of copper and oxygen.
    (I.)  0*3245  gramme of the base, dried at 100°C, gave 0*9150 carbonic

    The reaction that    has therefore taken place is similar to that      of hydro
 chloric acid on morphia, viz. that the chloride      of zinc   has abstracted     the

     The hydrochlorate cannot be obtained in a crystalline state ; it is easily
  soluble in water, and is precipitated thence by strong hydrochloric acid.
     On comparing the actions of different reagents on this base with those
  obtained with apomorphia (Proc. Roy. Soc. No. 112, 1869, p. 459), they

were found to be almost identical, the most marked of the few differences
being that the blood-red colour given with nitric acid is much more per
manent than in the similar apomorphia reaction.       Between the two bases
also a very marked difference exists in respect of stability, apocodeia being
far superior in this respect to apomorphia ; in fact it may be precipitated
by ammonia or carbonate of sodium, washed and dried, without undergoing
a marked change of colour.
  The hydrochlorates        also    for that of apomorphia can be easily
                                   differ   ;
crystallized, whereashydrochlorate  of apocodeia has only been obtained in
an amorphous state.    The preparation of apocodeia is easy and sure, yield
ing a very large product.  In this respect it differs materially from apo
morphia, the preparation of which is tedious, and the amount of yield very
uncertain, hence the high price of this valuable therapeutical agent.   The
solutions of the two hydrochlorates also show the same differences that
the bases themselves do. In physiological effects also there is a decided
difference between the hydrochlorates, that of apomorphia being, as ob
served by Dr. Gee, a very violent emetic, whilst that of apocodeia     ac          is,
cording to Dr. Legg's experiments,     mild emetic

cutaneous abscesses at the place of injection, which the apomorphia salt
does not.
   It has been shown in Part II. (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xvii. p. 460) of these
researches, that when codeia      heated with hydrochloric acid
                                    is                               splits up

into chloride of methyl, water, and  apomorphia.   The  action   of hydriodic
acid on narcotine for the elimination of the methyl contained in         howit   is,
ever, more energetic than that of hydrochloric acid. Therefore            was     it
thought probable that, by means of hydriodic acid, CHa might be ab
stracted alone, as iodide of methyl, from the codeia, leaving the elements of
water, and thus forming morphia.
  On trying the experiment, however, not           trace of iodide of methyl was
                                                       a
obtained, but the iodide of        a   new base, which    at present under ex
                                                            is
amination.
   The   codeia with which the foregoing experiments were made was                 kindly
presented to us by Messrs. MTarlan and Co., of Edinburgh, to whose
liberality we are already so much indebted.

  74                 Messrs. Parkes and Wollowicz      on the          [Recess,
  man was the subject of the experiments, and he was placed on precisely
  the same diet as is recorded in the former paper.
     The experiments were continued for 30 days, the man having abstained
  from any alcoholic beverage for 1 6 days previously.      During the first 1 0
  days, water only was taken at dinner, during the next 10 days red Bor
  deaux wine was substituted     for the water;   10 fluid   ounces  (284  cub.
  centims.) being given on the first 5 days, and 20 fluid ounces (568 cub.
  centims.) on the last 5 days. The wine was taken at dinner time, at a
  quarter past 1 o'clock.   In the last 10 days water was again given.
     The wine was a good claret, as it was thought best to use a superior
  wine ; it was Haut Brion wine of second growth, of the vintage of 1863,
  and was sold in London at the price of 60*. per dozen.       It contained 1 1
 per   cent, of alcohol. The free acidity was equal to about 3 grains per
  ounce of tartaric acid (C4 H8 0„) ; the total solids amounted to 2 1 ¦76
 grammes, and the fire-proof salts to 2*359 grammes per litre.          Of this
 amount of salts 2*027 grammes were soluble, and '332 insoluble.         In the
 former, phosphoric acid and chlorine were present in the amounts of "145
 and *106 gramme per litre respectively;        the insoluble salts contained
 only *0175 gramme of phosphoric acid per litre.     In the 10 ounces of wine
 there were therefore only 0*7 grain of phosphoric acid, and 0*46 grain of
 chlorine.
     The  ash  was intensely alkaline, and, when neutralized with standard
 acid, the alkalinity was found to be equal to 1*679 gramme of tartaric acid
 (C4H606) per litre.
     Only two circumstances (except the taking of wine) were different in
 this set of experiments as compared with the former.
    The first experiments were made in February and March 1870, when
 the weather was very cold ; the present were made in May and June
 in very hot and dry weather. The only influence we could trace to this
 altered condition of climate was that the amount of water allowed was in
 sufficient, and the man suffered some discomfort from thirst. We could
not perceive that any effect was produced on the nitrogenous elimina
tion ; certainly there was no diminution.
    The other alteration was that the man had gained 4 lbs. in weight, and
was still gaining a little when the experiments were commenced ; he con
tinued to do so slowly until the 24th day, when his health began to give
way and he lost weight.
    The experiments included the number of the pulse (taken in the recum
bent position) every 2 hours from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., tracings of the pulse
and respirations, the temperature of the axilla every 2 hours from 6 a.m.
to 10 p.m., the temperature of the rectum four times a day (the observa
tions being taken with the same thermometers as on the former occasion),
the amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, chlorine and free acidity of the
urine, and the weight, and in the two cases the amount of nitrogen in
the stools.

     The pulse in this man had                a daily     course of great uniformity, the
 changes being chiefly dependent on food and in a less degree on exercise.
 If  the last line (the mean of the hours) is read, and it is remembered that
 breakfast    was taken at 8, dinner at 1, and tea at 5, the increase in the
 Dumber of beats at 10, 2, and 6 o'clock is at once accounted for.                                It rose
 after breakfast nearly 7 beats j then fell 4 beats ; rose after dinner nearly
 1 0 beats ; then fell, but not to its previous standard ; rose after tea 3 beats,

other cause influencing the heart's beats was exercise ; we kept the exer

trace defect or excess      of  exercise    on the next reading of the pulse.              The

   The wine increased the frequency of the heart's action by 4\ beats
every minute during 14 hours in the day, and doubtless also in the re
maining 10, for the pulse at 8 a.m. was still too frequent during the wine
period.     In the 24 hours there was then an excess in the heart's action
of 6120 beats, or nearly 6 per cent. As the amount of alcohol was 1-1
ounces in the first 5 days, and 2-2 ounces in the other 5, the increase in
the number of the heart's beats was slightly more than in the days when
an equal quantity of pure alcohol was taken.
   This was partly owing to the continuance of the wine, as the first day's
excess was only 1 658 beats, and partly to the fact that whereas in the
former series of experiments the mean pulse-beats in the water period
were 73-, in this they were 76-3.               The man's heart was evidently rather
more excitable in this series than in the former.
   When the hourly changes are compared with the water period, it is seen
that the influence of food is marked as before, but that the wine exag
gerated the effect, and kept the pulse at a greater rate for a longer time.
   An extract from the Tables will show this. It must be noted that the
wine was taken at      1   o'clock, or a little after.

    It frill be  seen, then, that the pulse at 4, 6, and 8 o'clock       in the wine period
is much        above   the corresponding numbers in the water period.                     The
effect of the wine is largely perceptible for eight hours, and is traceable
during all the observations. The mean of the first five days is 80"34
beats per minute, and         of the last five days 80*78 beats.
    The   effect   of increasing the wine to 20 ounces is chiefly perceived in the
greater acceleration of the pulse at 4 o'clock in the last five days as com
pared with the first five.         When 10 ounces were taken, the mean pulse at
4 o'clock was 84"2, or two beats per minute less than at 2 o'clock, where
as in the 20-ounce days the             mean pulse at 4 o'clock was four beats above
 the 2 o'clock rate.

     The pulse continued high during the whole of this period, the                      excess
 being chiefly in the afternoon hours           ;  even 10 days after the wine was left
 off it had not returned to its proper rate ; but this was probably in part
 owing to indisposition, which will be referred to presently.
     Sphygmographic observations were taken three times a day ; but as the
 curves from alcohol were so fully given in the former paper, we have thought
 it necessary only to put in nine curves, three before, four during, and two
 after wine. We have selected 3 o'clock as the hour, so that the influence
 of food    is perceptible     in all :  the effect of the wine was the same as that
 of alcohol, though of course in a degree proportional to the amount.
     We also attempted to determine the ratio of the radial pulse, heart's
 action, and respiration by means of Dr. Burdon- Sanderson's ingenious
 cardiograph.         Unfortunately we did not obtain the instrument in time to
 determine the curves properly in the period before wine, and we are there
 fore not able to give proper comparisons.                 We could not, however, so far
 trace any effect on the number or depth of the respirations.

       It willbe seen on reading the last line (mean of the hours) that the tem
  perature   follows the same course as the pulse in being manifestly influenced
  by food, and rising after breakfast, dinner, and tea.      The only exception
  (and  this  is perhaps apparent  only)  is at 8 p.m., when   the mean tempera
  ture is higher than at 6   p.m.  while the pulse is falling ; but this was per
  haps accidental,               »'.   e.   a   longer series of observations might have given
  different results;                for          three observations the temperature was higher at
 6     o'clock, and in three                it inwas equal, while in the other four, when     was                        it
  highest at   o'clock, there were two exceptional high temperatures which
                     8
  augmented the mean amount.        In the next period the mean temperature
  at   p.m.
       8    was lower than at 6.
     We were unable to see any diurnal change of temperature in this man

     The temperatures of the three first hours are practically identical, and
  as already said, the rise at 8 o'clock            in the water period seems to us acci
  dental, i. e. as dependent on two exceptional high temperatures, which
  raised the mean amount.              In the other     5  hours the mean temperature was
  four times slightly higher in the water, and once in the wine period.
     The result of all the observations was that, in the water period of ten
  days, the mean temperature was 9 7°- 726, and in the wine period was
  97°-56, or 0o-166 less, a difference so slight as probably to fall within the
  limits of unavoidable error.             The mean of the first five days, with 10
  ounces     of wine,     was  97°-526 ; the mean of the last five days, with 20
  ounces     of wine,    was 97°-590, proving that doubling the amount of wine
  caused no lowering of mean temperature, and probably no rise, as the
  difference is so slight.
      We conclude that in health               the    apparent      heat after wine must be
  owing, as in the case of alcohol and brandy, rather to subjective feel
  ings connected with the quickened circulation than with an actual rise
   of temperature ; but that, on the other hand, wine in the above quantities
   causes no appreciable lowering           of temperature.

   The mean temperature of the rectum (taken four                     times a day instead  of
three, as in the former experiments, and at different hours) was rather
higher than the mean of the former experiments, viz. as 91)-38 to 99-06G.
It was also more uniform, both from day to day and hour to hour.                           If
these four hours be accepted as giving the mean temperature of the 24

    The mean temperature         is 0°-16 lower.        It is curious that this is almost
precisely the same change as in the case of the axillary temperature ; yet
it is probably an accidental coincidence. The 4 p.m. temperature, which
ought to show the effect of wine, is slightly higher (0o,09) than in the
first period; the 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. temperatures are lower by nearly
0°-3, and the 12 o'clock temperature is higher by 0°-l.
    The differences are thus slight, and in contrary directions, so that no de
cided influence, one way or the other, can, we think, be ascribed to the wine.

                             4.  Action on the Urine.
                       Elimination of water          by the kidneys.
   Twenty-eight fluid ounces were taken as drink, and the water in the
so-called solid food made the total daily ingress of water 12\ fluid ounces,
or 2059 cub. centims.
   The following     are the means      of the three periods : —

     1st period (water)                     2059 o.o.                      1210 c.c.
     2nd period (wine)                      2010 c.c.                       1148 c.c.

   As 49 cub. centims. less water were taken in the wine-period, the
amount of urine ought perhaps to be increased by this amount, and this
would make it only 13 cub. centims. less than the first period.
   It may be concluded that ] 0 and 20 ounces of light wine (containing
l'l and 2*2 ounces of alcohol), when substituted for water, had no diu
retic effect.    The amount of alcohol to act as a diuretic was perhaps too
small, as in the former series with the larger quantities of alcohol there
was certainly some increased flow of urinary water.

   The same amount of food being given as in the previous experiments,
the amount of nitrogen passing into the body was 1 1\ or 1 7| grammes,
or probably a little more.            The whole of this passed by the urine and
bowels, so that in this respect the difference in the temperature of the air
had no effect.      In other words, although the weather                 was so hot, there
was no evidence     of urea escaping by the skin.

    The mean of the nine days of ureal nitrogen, which correspond with
the days of soda-lime nitrogen, is 16*493 grammes.          The mean of the ten
first days in the previous series, with an equal quantity of food, was
16*21 1 grammes of nitrogen as calculated from the urea, and 1 6*226
grammes as determined by soda-lime.             In the present experiments the
amounts are higher in a very trifling degree, viz. *379 gramme, and *313
gramme in excess respectively.       The difference is so slight (under 6 grains
in 24 hours) that the two series may be considered identical.           Possibly as
the man was 4 lbs. heavier,       there might be some additional nitrogenous
tissue furnishing the slight excess of nitrogen.

  whole of the ten days, the soda-lime nitrogen of the 25th day may be
  added to the total ureal nitrogen, and the mean taken.                If this be done,
  the mean daily excretion       of   nitrogen  was    18-362  grammes. This gives
  an excess of no less than 1-682 gramme over the first period, and 1-504
  over the wine-period.       The    excess  was so large, and was so unlike any
  thing   seen before   during any of the experiments, as to prove it was not
  accidental.
      The question now arises, if the increase         was owing to the direct effect
  of the wine.       This seems unlikely, partly       because  some    evidence   of in
  crease would then have been obtained from the ten days during which
  the wine was taken, and partly from another reason.                  During this last
  period the man became ill; he was not feverish, but his pulse was quick.
  On the 25th, 26th, and 27th days there was some looseness of the bowels
  and headache ; he could scarcely eat his food, and lost weight for the first
   time.
      On the 29th day he was better, and on the 30th felt quite well, and on
  that day the nitrogen (as determined in both ways) fell greatly.                    He
   ascribed his illness to the monotony of his life, the sameness of his diet,
   and the comparative want of exercise, whilst it is also possible that the

wine, to which he was unaccustomed, and the small allowance of water,
may have had some effect in deranging his nutrition. It seems, however,
fair to conclude that the wine had only an indirect share, if any, in causing
this illness and increased elimination, which was manifestly caused by some
peculiar morbid state of nutrition. It is noticeable in this case that there
was increased elimination of nitrogen (evidently in the form of urea),
without any increase in the mean temperature of the body.        There was,
however, an increase in the temperature at 2, and o'clock, when diges

however, interesting to note that the mean daily excretion of the whole
thirty days is almost precisely the             same as the mean daily excretion              of the
twenty-five days in the previous                 series (viz. 7'028 grammes as against
6-915 grammes),         and   this   proves   the   equality of the diet.
    The acidity of the urine was increased during the wine-period, and this
continued afterwards.            It  may be observed that the mean free acidity of
the former experiments was almost precisely the same as in these experi
ments during the water-period (viz. 1-974 as against 1 -955 gramme), and
was very nearly the same           in the alcoholic       as  in the wine-period (viz. 2-342
as against 2-221).
    It seems fair to conclude that the free acidity was really increased, and
that the increase continued subsequently.

    The nitrogen       was determined twice, viz. on the 10th day (last day be

there had been some constipation before the 10th day, and the stool was
 unusually copious and less watery ; it represented, in fact, some accumula

 days.

    Looking to the mean weight of all the stools, to the particular circum
 stances  of the 10th day's stool, and the very nearly equal percentage of
 nitrogen on the 10th and 19th days, it may be concluded that the wine did
 not affect the intestinal discharges either as regards quantity or nitrogen.
                      6.  The Elimination of Alcohol.
    As in the former series, the numerous experiments we had to perform
 prevented us from thoroughly investigating this difficult problem.          We
 tested the appearance of alcohol in the excreta by the bichromate-of-potas-
 sium test as before.     The general results were as follows : —
                            Elimination  by the breath.
    In  the first period the bichromate test was not tried on the first day ;
it   was very slightly changed in colour on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days,
 when the breath was blown through the test for 15 minutes about 2
 o'clock.    On the remaining 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th days, no
 change was produced.        On the 1st day of wine after dinner, the colour
 became green in eight minutes, on the 2nd day in six minutes, and subse
 quently a little sooner. On the 16th and subsequent days (when the wine
 was   doubled) the change was much greater.         In the evening, except in
 one or two cases, no change was produced.          On the 21st day (1st day
 after wine) and subsequent days there was no alteration.
    The breath was condensed by a freezing-mixture on the 9th day about
 4 o'clock  ; about £ cub. centim. was collected ; it was tested for alcohol by
 the Iodoform test, but none was found ; it was unfortunately not examined
 by the bichromate test.      On the 20th day (20 ounces of wine) the breath
 was again condensed ; it gave an immediate marked green reaction with
 the bichromate     test.  On the 22nd day (the 2nd after the wine) it was
 again condensed, and gave still an immediate reaction, though not so
 marked as on the 20th day ; so that two days after the wine was left off,
 some   was   passing off by the lungs, though it was not detected by merely
 breathing through the test.
    On the 25th and 28th days, when the breath was again condensed, no
effect was produced on the bichromate test.
                             Elimination by the shin.
    In the former series of experiments, when the perspiration was obtained
by putting the arm in an hermetically sealed glass jar, no effect was pro
duced in the bichromate test by the sweat before alcohol had been taken.
    But on this occasion, when 12 cub. centims. of perspiration were collected
in four hours on the 5th day, the bichromate test was at once made green.
No alcohol was detected by the Iodoform test, but we are not certain if
this can be relied upon. This was on the 1 7th May, and no alcoholic
liquid had   been taken since the 25th   April.

days (after wine).             In all    cases an extremely marked green reaction was
at once given.
  We conclude, therefore, that fresh experiments are necessary with re
gard to the correctness of the bichromate test, when applied to the con

   We conclude from this Table that when 10 ounces of wine (containing
 •
1 1 ounce of absolute alcohol) were taken, no alcohol passed into the urine.
On the 16th day, when 20 ounces (=2'2 ounces of absolute alcohol) were
taken, none was found in the urine ; the next day no examination was
made,      but on the 18th day alcohol was detected, and two days later the
reaction was marked.     Two days after the wine was left off no alcohol was
found.
   Therefore,  when this man took 2 ounces of absolute alcohol day after
day, some of it was eliminated by the urine. When he took only 1 ounce,
none was eliminated during the space of five days.    If, as has been sur
mised by Dr. Anstie, the appearance of alcohol in the urine indicates that
there is an excess in the body, it seems clear that this man cannot take
much more than 1 ounce without the urine giving evidence of          and                             it,
thereby proving excess.   It soon disappeared from the urine, certainly
on the 2nd day (the first day's urine was not examined), whereas, on the
former occasion, when    much larger quantity had been taken,
                                   a                             could be                  it

    No experiments were made.
                                 General Conclusions.
    1.   The general results of these experiments are in all respects identical
 with the experiments         on alcohol and brandy, that is to say, there was a
 marked effect        on the heart, coinciding tolerably well in amount with the
effect   produced by pure alcohol in the former experiments ; there was no
unequivocal alteration of temperature in the axilla or rectum, no alteration
in the elimination of nitrogen, for the increase in the last period cannot be
credited to the direct        effect of the wine ; no alteration in the phosphoric
acid   of  the    urine ; some augmentation of the free acidity of the urine ; no
alteration    of the al vine discharges. In other words, claret- wine in the above
quantities cannot so far be distinguished in its effect from pure alcohol.           Its
most marked effect, the increase          of the heart's action, must   be ascribed to
the  alcohol, in great measure, though the ethers may play some slight part.
   But it would be going too far to assert that the dietetic effects of red
Bordeaux wine and          of dilute alcohol are identical.   The difference between
them must probably be sought in their effects on primary digestion and
assimilation,       delicate and subtle influences which experiments like those
recorded in the paper do not touch.          The influence of the sugar, of the salts,
and of the acidity must also be appreciated by other methods.                 The man
himself affirmed that the wine agreed with him better than the alcohol or
brandy,     but the large quantity        he took of these last fluids vitiates the
comparison.
   These experiments on wine enabled           us to define somewhat better than the
previous trials what might be considered moderation for this man.              The   10
ounces    of wine, containing about 1 fluid ounce of pure alcohol, did not cause
the least    unpleasant feeling of heat or flushing. The 20 ounces (containing
almost    2 fluid ounces of alcohol) were manifestly too much,             lie felt hot
and  uncomfortable, was flushed, the face was somewhat congested, and he
was  a little drowsy.        Moreover, as already mentioned, alcohol then began
to appear      in the urine.       Therefore he ought certaiuly not to take much
more    than    1  fluid ounce of absolute alcohol in 24 hours.
   With regard to the propriety of this healthy man taking any alcohol,
we have no hesitation in saying he would be better without it.               His heart
naturally acts       quickly and strongly enough ; alcohol increases its action too
much,     and might lead on to alteration in its condition, or to injury of
vessels,   if any degeneration were to take place in them. This man had
gone   through the Abyssinian campaign, and stated that when the force was
without rum, owing to deficiency of transport beyond Antalo, he had in
no way felt the want of the stimulant, though some of his comrades did.
This   seems    to confirm our opinion, that alcohol for him is not a necessity,
and indeed      is not desirable.

        Received     Sept. 10, 1870.
   1.   Object of this Investigation. — The principles of the action of com
bined streams were to a certain extent investigated by Venturi, and stated
in bis essay ' Sur la Communication laterale du Mouvement dans les
Fluides' (Paris, 1798).          The principle of       the conservation   of momentum,
so far as    I  know, was first explicitly applied to combined streams by               Mr.
William Froude, F.R.S., in a paper on Giffard's Injector, read to the
British Association at Oxford, in 1860, and published in the Transactions
of the Sections, p. 211.          Various      other authors have treated the same
problem       by different methods, based virtually on the same principle.
A    very complete and precise investigation of the theory of combined
streams, in every case in which two streams only are combined, is con
                                                '
tained in Professor Zeuner's treatise Das Locomotivenblasrohr
                                                                                " (Zurich,
 18G3),      The theoretical conclusions are tested by comparison with experi
ment, and applied to practical questions, especially those relating to the
apparatus from which the treatise takes its name. The object of the present
investigation is to apply similar principles to the combination of any
number of streams          ; and the demonstration of the fundamental dynamic
equation     differs  from   that given by Zeuner in method, though not in prin
ciple, being effected at one operation by the direct application of the prin
ciple of the equality of impulse and momentum, instead of by the con
sideration of the loss of energy that takes place during the combination
of  the streams.
   2.   Terms and Notation           used,    and Suppositions made. — The several
streams which are combined will be called before their junction, the com
ponent streams ; the stream formed by their combination will be called
the resultant stream.           The passages through which the component and
resultant streams flow will be called respectively the supply-tubes and the
discharge-tube.         The combination of the streams will be supposed to take
place   in  a  short   cylindrical chamber, with its axis parallel to the direction
of flow, which will be called the junction-chamber.
   At    one end    of the junction-chamber         are the outlets   of the supply-tubes,
which will be called the nozzles            ; at the other end, the inlet of the dis
charge-tube,      which   will be called   the    throat.    It will be supposed, further,
that the supply-tubes are so formed as to direct the component streams at
the nozzles,      so that they shall all flow sensibly parallel to each other and
to the resultant stream.          The principal        symbols used are as follows    :  for
any one     of the component      streams    : —
       a,  area of nozzle ;
       v,  velocity of flow at    nozzle ;
       *0, bulkiness, or reciprocal of density at nozzle.
   The several component streams may be distinguished from each other,
when required, by suffixes;         as 1, 2, 3, &c.

only, be compared with the equation not numbered, which immediately
precedes equation GO in Zeuner's treatise, it will be seen that they are

bulkincss * and pressure p is contained in a reservoir, from which it is
capable of being expelled by the inward motion of a piston loaded with an
external force equivalent to the pressure, it is known that the potential
energy of the mass of fluid and of the piston relatively to a point at the
level of the centre of mass of the fluid is expressed by multiplying the
mass by        I        *^P'   ^e       re'at-i°n   hetween       * and     p being that which is              called

                                     (Abstract.)
    In   this paper the author, referring in the Introductory Section (§ 1 ) to
objections published to his former restorations and inferences as to the
 function of the dentition of Thylacoleo, proceeds to give descriptions, with
 figures, of (§ 2) an upper jaw and maxillary teeth, and (§ 3) of a portion
 of   the mandible with mandibular teeth, from tertiary deposits at Gowrie
  Creek, Queensland, presented to the British Museum by Sir Daniel
 Cooper, Bart.
    He then describes certain specimens and photographs of maxillary teeth
  (§ 4), and of mandibular teeth (§ 5) of the Thylacoleo, subsequently ob
 tained by Prof. A. M. Thomson, of Sydney, and Gerard Krefft, Esq., Cu
 rator of the Museum of Natural History, Sydney, New South Wales, from
  caves in Wellington valley, for the exploration of which a grant had been
 voted by the Local Legislature of New South Wales.
    Section 6 is given to a description of the specimen in the British
 Museum, and a cast in the Museum at Sydney of an entire inferior in
 cisor, transmitted, with the photograph above mentioned, to the author.
 The guiding principle in inferring function from form of teeth is next de
fined   (§ 7), and the author proceeds to discuss the objection from the loca
tion of laniaries in § 8. The dentitions of Thylacoleo and of Phascolarctos
are compared in § 9 ; and the results contrasted with those of the advocates
of the herbivority of both genera, which were illustrated by the figures
 2 & 4 in the ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,' vol. xxiv.
pp. 312, 313 (1868).
    In § 10 the deductions from the mandibular        characters of carnivorous
 and herbivorous marsupials are tested, and those characters illustrated by
 descriptions and figures of the lower jaw in Thylacoleo, Cheiromys, Pla-
 giaulax, Thylacinvs, Sarcophilus, Phascolarctos, and Hypsiprymnus.         The
 testimony to the native food of the Aye-aye is sifted in § 11, and the
                                                                  i 2

 bearing of the characters of its mandible and dentition on the question of
 the carnivority or herbivority of Thylacoleo is weighed.          A like comparison
 and physiological consideration are applied to the mandibular characters of
 Thylacoleo, Playiaulax, and the true Rodeutia in § 12; and the author
 next   (§ 13) proceeds to the consideration of the form, structure, and
 growth of the large incisors in the Diprodont paucidentate Marsupials,
 and in the lemurine and lissencephalous Rodents.               To the affirmation of
 " the obviously phytophagous type of the incisors of Thylacoleo and
 Playiaulax," the author, referring to the descriptions and figures of those
 teeth in the preceding part of his paper, enters upon a consideration of
 the relations of their differences from those teeth in the truly phyto
 phagous Marsupials and Placentals to interrupted and continuous applica
 tion of teeth (§ 14). The alleged adaptability of the carnassials in Thyla
 coleo to reduction of vegetable food leads next to a consideration of the
 work of the molar machinery in known existing Herbivora (§ 15).                    In
 section 16 the place, and especially the family relations, of the Thy
 lacoleo in the Marsupial     order are considered.         Instances of existing di-
protodonts subsisting    on animal food, and         of existing polyprotodonts on
vegetable food, are adduced       ;   and, after comparisons with the genera Ma-
cropus, Halmaturus, Layorchestes,             Heteropus, Petroyale, Osphranter,
 Dendrolayus, Hypsiprymnus,            Bettonyia,   Potorous, Dorcopsis, Cuscus,
Phascolarctos, Phalanyista, Ilepoona, Dactylopsila, Petatirus, Belideus,
Acrobata, Petaurista, Dromicia, Tarsipes, the author is led to assign
Playiaulax and Thylacoleo to a distinct family of Diprotodont Marsupials
under the name "Paucidentata,"           in reference  to the reduction  of the molar
teeth  to one on   each   side  of the upper jaw,      and   two on each side of the
lower jaw.     He then (in §    1
                                  7) discusses the reality and value of the indica
tions of tendency from the     "                                " in the dentition of
                                    general to the particular
the mesozoic and neozoic Paucidentate Marsupials.              The objections to the
predaceous nature of Thylacoleo and Playiaulax from their alleged feeble
ness and dwarfishness are discussed in § 18.           The grounds on which John
Hunter    was led to refer the molar      of Mastodon ohioticus to either     a carni
vorous or   a mixed-feeding animal, and those on which the author refers the
dentition and skull of Thylacoleo to a carnivorous species, are contrasted,
and the nature of a disparaging comparison is exposed in § 19.
    The author concludes by          a  description of certain unequal phalanges,
which supported a strong claw, bound close by a basal bony sheath, as in
the Lion, obtained from the breccia-caves of Wellington valley, and for
which, among the fossils thence exhumed, there is not, at present, any
other claimant save Thylacoleo.

   Sir, — I  have the honour to report that the pendulum-observations
which have been carried on since the year 1865, by Captain Basevi, in con

   1870.]             On the Indian Pendulum-observations.                      99
   nexion with the operations   of the Trigonometrical Survey of India, at the
  recommendation of the President and Council of the Royal Society, are
  now nearly completed, in conformity with the original programme of opera
  tions which was sanctioned by the Right Honourable the Secretary of State
  for India, in his military letter No. 2/1, dated 23rd August 1864, to the
  Governor- General in Council.
      (2.) The results are of much importance, not only as affording inde
  pendent information on the figure of the earth, but as throwing some light
  on "the laws of the local variations of gravity which are superposed on
 the grand variation from the poles to the equator ;
                                                           " thus it will, I trust,
 be conceded that they amply fulfil the purposes contemplated in the
 'Correspondence and Proceedings of the Council of the Royal Society
 concerning Pendulum-Observations in India.'
     (3.) But, before the operations are brought to a close, I think it is
 desirable that the President and Council of the Royal Society should be
 informed of what has been done hitherto, and of what remains to be done
 to carry out the original programme of operations ; also that they should
 be  invited to suggest any supplementary measures which they may consider
 necessary in order to complete the operations, and thus perfect a work
 which was commenced at the suggestion of the President and with the
 hearty    approval of the Council, and in    the success  of which they take    a
lively interest.
     (4.)  I have therefore prepared the accompanying note on the opera
 tions in explanation    of what has been done hitherto, and of what remains
 to be done to complete the original programme ; and        I beg leave to request
 that the Secretary of State may be moved to communicate it to the
 President and Council of the Royal Society, and to invite their opinions
 and suggestions.       The Note is accompanied with a map on which the
 positions   of the pendulum stations   are indicated.
                                 I have the honour to be,   Sir,
                                      Your most obedient Servant,
                                              J.  T. Walker, Colonel R.E.,
                              Supdt. Great Trigonometrical       Survey of India.
Note on the Pendulum-observations        in India, which are being carried on
     by  Captain J.  P. Basevi, in connexion with    the operations of the Great
     Trigonometrical   Survey  of India.
    The observations have     been made    with the two invariable pendulums
of the Royal Society, which are     known as No. 4 and No. 1821. The number
of vibrations in twenty-four hours is determined by observing the coinci
dences of each pendulum with the pendulum of a clock by Shelton, which
is also the property of the Royal Society.       The pendulums are swung, one
at a time, in the receiver of a vacuum apparatus out of which as much air
as possible   is withdrawn by an air-pump, and the rate of the clock is de
termined     every night.

100                   On   the Indian Pendulum-observations.                    [Nov. 24,
    (2.) Captain Basevi's daily course of procedure is as follows. At 6 a.m.
he sets in motion the pendulum which is under observation.                       At 7 a.m.
he observes three coincidences and reads the thermometers and pressure-
gauge.      Between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. he observes a coincidence and reads
the thermometers and the gauge, five times at intervals of 1^ hour.                      At
4   p.m.   he closes this portion of the work by observing three coincidences
and again reading the thermometers and the gauge.                   Thus for nearly ten
hours of the day Captain Basevi never permits himself to be absent for more
than    a few minutes at a time from the pendulums.                 These frequent ob
servations are necessary in order that the temperatures may be exactly
determined.        At  8 to 10 p.m. he observes     transits.
     (3.) Originally it was expected that, by employing a vacuum-apparatus,
the pendulum might be vibrated for twenty-four hours before the vibrations
 became too small for the observation of coincidences, and consequently that
 the rate derived from the coincidences would be wholly independent of
 irregularities in the clock's rate in different parts of the twenty-four hours.
 But this would have necessitated observations of the temperature at regular
intervals throughout        the twenty-four    hours, which, as      a  rule, would have
 been impossible, though a few such groups          of observations have been taken
 experimentally.       Moreover     at   the commencement of the operations the
vacuum-cylinder        could not be      made sufficiently air-tight to admit of so
 protracted an observation.
     (4.) Each pendulum is         observed   a certain number         of days with the
 face to the front, and then as many days with the face to the rear. At the
first four stations observations were taken for five days on each face, making
 altogether twenty days' observations for both pendulums ; as, however, it
was found that the theoretical probable error           of the mean of the ten days'
observations by a single pendulum was               only +"05 of a vibration, the
 number of observations was subsequently limited to six days on both
faces, making altogether twelve days' work at each station.
     (5.) The observations      are now being printed in the office          of the Trigo
nometrical      Survey, and a few specimen pages accompany this note. A
 preliminary abstract of the mean results by both pendulums is also given,
 and a map indicating the positions of the stations of observation*.
     (6.) The results obtained hitherto          are   not final  ;  the coefficients     of
 the corrections for temperature and pressure have not yet been conclusively
 determined, and the reductions to mean sea-level will probably be effected
 when the calculations of the influence of local irregularities in the crust of
 the earth have been carried to a greater distance from the stations than has
 hitherto been practicable.
     (7.) Of these corrections the most important is that for temperature ;
 the mean temperature of the observations ascends from a minimum of 54°
 at the base station Kew, to           a  maximum of 88° at Namthabad,              being  a

range of 34°    ;  as the correction        is approximately equal to one vibration
for  2°  of temperature, or       seventeen    vibrations for the extreme range, the
true value must necessarily              be   determined with the utmost           possible
accuracy.
    (8.) In Section XIII. of my General Report on the Operations of the
Trigonometrical Survey for 1 866—67, I have fully described certain mea
 sures which were taken to determine the coefficient of linear expansion.
Briefly, they     were as follows      :  vibrations   were  observed, at high and low
temperatures, under the lowest pressure which could be obtained in the
vacuum-apparatus at Kaliana, and at the natural pressure at Masoori ; the
expansions were also determined at high and low temperatures by direct
micrometric measurement, with the following results : —
                     Pressure, in   Factor of expansion
                        inches.      for V Fahrenheit.
   At Kaliana ..           3"5           000,011,10       , ,
     „ Masoori ..         23-5           000,010,01         b? vibrations.
                                                         }
     „ Dehra              277            000,009,73         by direct measurement.
Thus the value of the expansion which was determined from vibrations
under a pressure of 3-5 inches was 14 per cent, greater than the value
determined by direct measurement, at the natural pressure.                     I  stated in
my report that
                    " whether this is due to an actual increase of expansion for
a decrease of pressure or to the action of other phenomena which are at
present     unknown       or only    imperfectly     known,   is a problem      for future
solution."
    (9.) Experiments have been made at the Kew Observatory for the
                                                                                     '
purpose of investigating this question ; they are described in the Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society,' No. 113, 1869.                     Owing, however, to
difficulties which were experienced in working with artificial temperatures,
the results were not conclusive as regards the present difficulty, and the
hope was expressed         that the question would find its best solution by our
labours in India.
    (10.) The temperature-coefficients which have been employed in the
preliminary reductions are those which were obtained from the observations
at Kaliana, viz. :
   For No.         4 pendulum 0'485 vibration per diem for 1° Fahrenheit.
     „ No.    1821          „       0-470
   (11.) The pressure-coefficient which has been employed hitherto is
the mean of the two values determined at Kew, or 0-32 vibration per diem
for each inch of pressure at 32° Fahrenheit.
   (12.) In the reductions to the sea-level, the surface-density has been
assumed to be half the mean density of the earth.                 Dr. Young's formula
has been used exclusively for stations situated on tolerably level plains,
but for stations on hills the observations             have   been  first reduced to the
general level of the country by computing               the vertical    attraction of the
elevated   mass down to this level, the mass being divided into a number                 of

 compartments by concentric circles and radii ; they have then been reduced
 to the sea-level by Dr. Young's formula.       The stations thus corrected are
 Masoori, Usira, Ehmadpur, and Somtana; at Masoori, curvature was taken
 into account, and the calculations were extended to a distance of 100 miles
 all round; but at the three other stations curvature was not allowed for, as
the calculations were only carried to a distance of one mile.
    ( 1 3.) The preceding details will suffice to explain all that is necessary
 regarding the observations, and the preliminary results which have been
 derived therefrom which accompany this note.        I will therefore now pro
 ceed to indicate the principles by which we have been guided in selecting
 the positions of the pendulum-stations.
    (14.) In the first instance, the original programme of observing at a
 certain number of stations of the Great Arc was duly carried out ; the
 pendulums were swung at eighteen stations between Cape Comorin and the
 Siwalik Hills at the base of the southern slopes of the Himalayas, and at
two stations north of the Siwaliks.
    (15.) As yet no observations have been taken on the higher ranges,
or on the tablelands, of the Himalayas, and thus the full influence of
 these ranges in producing local variations of gravity has not yet been
ascertained.    But the observations at the five northernmost stations indi
cate that there is much probability that the density of the strata of the
earth's crust under and in the vicinity of the Himalayan mountains is less
than that under the plains to the south, the deficiency increasing as the
 stations approach the Himalayas, and being greatest when they are north
of the Siwaliks.    On the other hand, the observations at the five southern
most stations show an increase of density in proceeding from the interior
of the Peninsula to the coast of Cape Comorin.           Thus both groups of
observations tend to confirm the hypothesis that there is a diminution of
density in the strata of the earth's crust under mountains and continents,
and an increase of density under the bed of the ocean.
    (16.) In order to test this hypothesis still further, as soon as the
observations at the stations of the Meridional Arc were completed, the
pendulums were taken to an ocean station — the Island of Minicoy, in the
same latitude as Punnae, and about 250 miles from the mainland ; and
afterwards to five stations on the east and west coasts, each in nearly the
same latitude as one of the stations in the Meridional Arc.          Thus the
comparisons between the local variations of gravity under the continental,
the coast, and the ocean stations are independent of an exact knowledge of
the normal variation of gravity in proceeding from the poles to the
                                                                       equator.
It will be seen that, without a single exception, gravity at a coast station is
in excess of gravity at the corresponding inland station, and that at the
ocean station it is greater than at the corresponding coast station; thus:

    (17.)   I may observe that the coast stations were selected at places as
 far removed as possible from mountain-ranges, in order that the results
 might not be affected by the local variations of gravity under mountains.
 For this reason additional stations could not          be obtained on the west
 coast, because    to the north of Mangalore there is a range of mountains
 running parallel to the coast at a very short distance.
    (18.) Having completed these observations, Captain Basevi returned to
the head quarters at Dehra Doon last April, taking a set of observations at
 Kaliana en route, in order to ascertain whether the times of vibration of
the pendulums had sensibly altered, through accident or wear of the knife-
edges, in the period of four years which had elapsed since 1866, during
which the apparatus had been transported (chiefly by land, but partly by
sea) over a distance of several thousand miles, and the pendulum had been
swung at twenty-two stations. The result indicates a slight alteration in
 the pendulums, probably by wear of the knife-edges, to an extent equiva
lent to one-third of a vibration in twenty-four hours.
    (19.) It now remains for Captain Basevi to investigate the true vacuum
 and temperature corrections, by experiments under artificial temperatures.
 He is at present making the requisite preliminary arrangements for the
 purpose, and will commence the experiments as soon as possible.            They
 should be completed by the time that the snows of the approaching winter
 are sufficiently melted to permit of the passes on the great southern ranges
 of the Himalayas being crossed. Captain Basevi will then proceed to take
 observations in the inner Himalayas, on three extensive tablelands which are
 of great height, and are sufficiently removed from the neighbouring ranges to
 obviate the necessity for minute calculations of the masses of these ranges,
 calculations for which the requisite data are not forthcoming.         The three
 tablelands are "the plains of Deosai," lat. 35° 5', long. 75° 30', height
 13,400 feet ; the plains north of the Changchenmo range, lat. 35° 15',
 long. 79° 20', height 16,000 feet; and "the plains of Hanle," lat. 32°
  50', long. 79°, height 14,200 feet.       Captain Basevi also proposes to take
 observations in the plains of the Punjab to the south of the Himalayas.
 Finally, he will descend the Indus, and take observations on the coast at
 Karachi, thus obtaining     an additional   coast station, which will be comple
 mentary to an inland station on Colonel Everest's Arc of the Meridian.
    (20.) It does not appear necessary that any more observations than these
 should be taken in India.       But in the proceedings of the Council of the
 Royal Society    in which   the  original programme of observations was dis

 104               On  the  Indian Pendulum-observations.          [Nov. 24,
cussed,  it was proposed that observations should be taken at points nearer
to the equator, at Ceylon, Singapore, or Borneo ; also at Aden, a     position
of interest, " from being in a long line of depression where a large  gravita
tion might be expected."       But as one of the two pendulums has     already
been swung by General Sabine at three stations on or between the      equator
and the parallel of Punnae, Captain Basevi's southernmost station, and as a
pendulum has been swung by Mr. Goldingham at the equator and at the
Madras Observatory, which is also one of Captain Basevi's stations,       I am
inclined to think that there is no immediate necessity for taking observa
tions at Ceylon, Singapore, and Borneo, and that Captain Basevi's opera
tions need not be prolonged for this purpose.       On the other hand, how
ever, he will be easily able to observe at Aden ; and he might also observe
at some point in Egypt, on the plains which are crossed by the Suez Canal,
with the great advantage that the stations would be complementary to
certain of the stations in India ; thus Aden would be compared with
Madras    and  Bangalore,   and the plains of Egypt with the Himalayan
Mountains.
   (21.) I propose, therefore, that Captain Basevi should proceed from
Karachi to England, taking observations en route at Aden and in Egypt,
and bringing his operations to a close by a series of observations at the
Greenwich Observatory, if the Astronomer Royal has no objections.             I
mention the Greenwich rather than the Kew Observatory because the true
time can be obtained there from the astronomical clocks, whereas at Kew
it can only be obtained by observation     ; and if (as is probable) Captain
Basevi arrives in the winter, pendulum-observations taken at Kew would
be greatly delayed, as happened when the operations were commenced at
Kew. Moreover, Greenwich appears to have been employed as a refer
ence station for pendulum-observations    more frequently than Kew.

   An attempt is here made to establish a general theory of a certain class
of resonators, including most of those which occur in practice. When a
mass of air or other gas is enclosed in a space bounded nearly all round by
rigid walls, but communicating with the external air by one or more pas
sages, there are certain natural periods of vibration or resonant notes
whose determination is a matter of interest.   If the dimension of the air
space is small compared to the wave-length of the vibration, the dy
namics of the motion     in its general character, of remarkable simplicity.

   The question thus resolves itself into the determination of the conduc
tivity (or the resistance which      its reciprocal) for different forms of

sides     of the       vessel, has been
                            already treated, although in   very different      a
way, by Helmholtz, who, in his celebrated paper on vibrations in open
pipes, compared his theory with the observations of Sondhauss and others
on the notes produced, when such resonators are made to speak by                                      a
stream        of air blown        across   the mouth.         Sondhauss

whatever may be the length of the neck.                       If   L   be the length and    R        the

     This supposes  the neck     a circular   cylinder.    If  the section be an ap

    When the neck is very long the           second    term may be neglected, and
 when L is very small the first term          becomes    insignificant.   In the third
 part experiments are described which were instituted to compare the
 general formula with observation, and which gave a satisfactory agreement.
 The value given   above for    - is only   approximate.      It  is proved, however,
                                c
that the resistance of a finite cylindrical conductor whose plane ends lie in
 two infinite insulating planes, but join on to conducting masses on the
further side, corresponds to a length L+a of the cylinder, where

    As  a particular  case,  it appears that the correction to the length of an
 organ-pipe, supposed, as in Helmholtz's paper, to be surrounded at the
mouth by a wide flange, lies between '785 R and -8282 R.
    Approximate formula? are investigated for the resistance of tubes which
are not exact circular cylinders.        It will be sufficient to particularize here
the case of tubes of revolution.       The resistance is shown to lie between the
two limits

    "When there is more than one vessel in the vibrating system, there are
 several independent periods of vibration corresponding to the degrees of
freedom.     The theory of these vibrations is also considered.
    In the experimental part of the investigation the object is to determine
 with sufficient precision the pitch of the resonant note. This is generally
done by causing the resonator to speak.             For several reasons, which are
detailed, I consider this course unsatisfactory, and have availed myself of
other indications to fix the pitch, which are not, indeed, capable of so great
an apparent precision, but yet are more to be depended on.

mitting to destructive distillation a substance which I then named ox-
amelanil or melanoximide*,        but which at the present time would be con
sidered   as  oxalyldiphenylguanidine.       The phenylic cyanate, which           I  then
called anilocyanic acid, is formed only in very small quantity            ;   I never  had
more than a few grammes of the substance in my possession                   ;  and it was
only from the sharply denned properties of the body that                I   was enabled
to describe it correctly.
    Eight  years later  I again met with this compound.            When I found that
diphenylsulphourea, by treatment         with   anhydrous phosphoric acid, split
up into aniline and phenylic mustard-oil, the idea naturally suggested
itself to utilize this reaction for the preparation of phenylic cyanate, by
distilling normal diphenylurea with anhydrous phosphoric acidf-
    In fact, phenylic cyanate can be prepared in this way. On heating dry
diphenylcarbamide with anhydrous phosphoric acid, the frightful odour of
the cyanate was immediately developed ; and on distilling the mixture of
the two bodies, the phenylic cyanate came over in colourless drops.
When, however, the experiment was made on a somewhat larger scale,
the product was so small that I was compelled to consider this process
more    as a mode     of formation of the    substance     than as a method for its
preparation.
    Lately my experiments on the mustard-oils led me to a simple process
for the preparation of the phenylic cyanate and its homologues.
                          J
    In a former paper I drew attention to the facility with which the mus
tard-oils   combine with    a molecule of alcohol.        When phenylic mustard-
oil is heated for a considerable time with         alcohol,  it yields the beautifully
crystalline half sulphuretted phenylurethane, which, when distilled alone,
or, still better, with phosphoric anhydride, again splits into its com
ponents alcohol and phenylic mustard-oil.
    Taking into consideration the result of this experiment, ought we not
 to obtain the phenylic cyanate on distilling phenylurethane with phos
phoric acid    1

 this substance was treated with methyl, ethyl, or amyl alcohol, the phenyl
 urethane of the methyl, ethyl, or amyl series was obtained §.                 Since then

 the phenylurethane of the ethyl series, phenylcarbaminic ether, has been
 carefully investigated by Messrs. Wilm and Wischiu*, who obtained it by
 the action of chlorocarbonic ether upon aniline.
    I  have repeated    the experiment of Messrs. Wilm and Wischin, and can
 fully  confirm  their  results. The body prepared in this manner is identical
 with that which I formerly obtained. The melting-point of the substance,
 after repeated crystallization, was found to be 51°; Messrs. Wilm and
 Wischin gave 51°-5-52°.           The boiling-point was about 237°, the same as
 that found by those gentlemen.
    Messrs. Wilm and Wischin             state that the phenylcarbaminic             ether
 (which they     call  carbanilidic  ether)   is volatile  without   decomposition.      I
find that although the greater portion escapes decomposition when dis
tilled, yet part of it splits up into phenylic cyanate and alcohol,
                          C, Hu NOa= C7 H5 NO + C, H6 O,
which is perfectly in accordance with what I expected from the study of
the half-sulphuretted phenylurethane.              On distillation, the well-known
and familiar odour of the phenylic cyanate is immediately developed ; and,
in fact, Messrs. Wilm and Wischin must also have observed it ; for they
say of the carbanilidic ether,
                                      " the vapour of this body excites a copious
flow of tears, but when diffused has a faint resemblance to bitter almond-
oil." What Messrs. Wilm and Wischin smelt was the phenylic cyanate.
If  the mixture of phenylic cyanate and alcohol, obtained along with a large
quantity of phenylurethane by the distillation of the latter, be allowed to
stand for twenty-four hours, the odour of the cyanate will have disap
peared eutirely     ; the cyanate and alcohol have recombined with formation
of phenylurethane.
    After these results of the behaviour of phenylurethane under the influ
ence of heat, there could be no doubt that phenylic               cyanate would be ob
tained by the employment of phosphoric anhydride.
    Experiment has fully confirmed this expectation.
    Phenylic Cyanate. — When phenylurethane is heated with anhydrous
phosphoric acid, a considerable quantity of a colourless liquid distils over
of great refractive power, having         a pungent odour, and attacking- the eyes
strongly. This liquid is phenylic cyanate, which only requires redistilla
tion to be obtained pure. As in all operations in the aromatic series in
which phosphoric anhydride takes part, the quantity obtained is by no
means that required by theory, although it approaches it.
    For more than one reason         I  had desired to discover a method for the
preparation of the phenylic cyanate.              I was now enabled to determine
 more accurately the boiling-point of         the  body ; it is 1 63°.    In my former
 determination,    for which     only a few grammes were available,         I   had found
it to be 1 78°.
    The specific gravity of the phenylic        cyanate   at 15° is 1*092.    Its vapour-

     With   respect  to the behaviour of the body with other substances,                I
can refer to my former paper.           With water it yields carbonic acid and
diphenylcarbamide ; in contact with alcohol the urethane is reproduced ;
it combines immediately with ammonia and its derivatives, forming an
inconceivable number of ureas.          But, besides  other combinations, it ex
 hibits   a remarkable    reaction.   I  may mention that the possession            of  a
 considerable quantity of phenylic cyanate has given me an opportunity
 of again observing the behaviour of this body towards triethylphosphine,
 formerly    described*.     If  a glass rod,  moistened with the phosphorus
 base, be dipped into a    considerable quantity of phenylic cyanate, in a few
 moments it becomes very hot, and the whole solidifies to a mass of beau
 tiful crystals.
      The principal    product formed in this reaction is a body insoluble in
 water, and not very soluble in boiling alcohol, from which it crystallizes on
 cooling in fine prisms, which in an analysis formerly published gave
  numbers corresponding to cyanurate of phenyl, and may therefore be re
  garded as phenylic cyanurate.       I must, however, leave it an open question,
  whether this substance is identical with the phenylic cyanurates, obtained
  the one by the action of chloride of cyanogen on phenol f, the other from
  triphenylmelamine %.
      Now that the necessary     material can be obtained, there is no difficulty
  in a complete investigation of this body, as well as the by-products formed
  by the reaction in question.
      We may here find room for      some observations on the homologues           of the
  phenylic cyanurate.

 tives like phenylic cyanate. On treatment with water ditolylurea is pro

 of compound ureas.

    Xylylic cyanate exhibits the same reactions as those which are so pro
minent in the corresponding members of the phenyl and tolyl series, but
somewhat weaker. The combinations which take place almost immediately
in the case of phenylic and tolylic cyanates often require days with the
xylylic cyanate. Even in the presence of triethylphosphine xylylic cyanate
solidifies but slowly.

effected by the action of chlorocarbonic ether on naphthylamine.                    It is

in needles which melt at 79°. Its composition is expressed by the for

     Naphthylic cyanate. — A short notice of this compound                 has already
 appeared.     When   I had found that diphenylcarbamide gave phenylic cya
 nate by distillation   with phosphoric anhydride, Mr. Vincent Hall* made
 the corresponding experiment in the naphthyl series, but only obtained a
 very small quantity of the naphthyl compound.                  The formation of the
 naphthylic cyanate by     this method    was,  however,     established.
     The naphthylic cyanate is obtained in considerable quantity by the dis
 tillation of naphthylurethane with phosphoric anhydride.               It is a colour
 less, not very mobile fluid, whose boiling-point is about 269°-270°.                  Its
 vapour    has the pungent   odour  which   is peculiar   to  the cyanates,   but at  the
 ordinary temperature naphthylic cyanate is almost odourless.                  Its com
 position is expressed by the formula
                             CuH7NO=£0HJN.
  I  have, moreover, satisfied  myself of its correctness by the reactions of the
 body.     On considering its behaviour with water and alcohol, and their de
 rivatives, there can be no doubt as to the nature of the compound.                  The
 facility with which these reactions take place with the naphthyl compound
 is remarkable.     The naphthylic      cyanate acts with incomparably greater
 quickness and precision than the analogous xylyl-compound ; this is par
 ticularly shown in the action of triethylphosphine, which causes the cyanate
 of the naphthyl series to solidify almost instantaneously.
      I have to give my best thanks to Mr. F. Hobrecker               for his efficient
  assistance in the prosecution of the above research.

1870.]                       President's  Address.                         115
   It  may be in the recollection of some of the Fellows that, in the Anni
versary Address delivered in 1863, 1 ventured to suggest the interest and
probable value of a series of Pendulum Experiments at the principal stations
of the Great Indian Arc. Encouraged by the warm concurrence in opinion
and promised support of Colonel Walker, Superintendent of the Indian
Trigonometrical Survey, a circular note was addressed by myself, with the
concurrence of the Council, to several of the Fellows of the Royal Society
conversant with the subject   ;  and the correspondence, including  an outline
of the proceedings which in Colonel Walker's judgment would        be required
in India, should the experiments receive the sanction of the Indian autho
rities, was submitted through the proper channels to the Secretary of State
for India, and received the sanction of the Indian Government.
    The pendulums and accompanying apparatus having been prepared at
the observatory of the British Association at Kew (aided by a special
subsidy from the Government-Grant Fund placed annually at the disposal
of the Royal Society), were embarked for India, in March 1865, under the
charge of Captain Basevi of the Royal Engineers, appointed to conduct
the experiments with them in India. These have been executed in great
part, and are still in progress, under that officer's superintendence. In the
meantime the Royal Society has been favoured by a recent communication
from the Secretary of State for India, enclosing Col. Walker's official report
of what has been accomplished, and of what remains to be accomplished in
 India, to complete the original programme — and transmitting a despatch
signed by the Governor General and other high authorities of the Indian Go
vernment, requesting that the President and Council of the Royal Society
may be invited to suggest at an early day any supplementary          measures
which they may deem desirable.
    It  appears that, at the date of Colonel Walker's report, pendulum ex
 periments had been completed at twenty-five stations on the mainland of
 India, extending from Cape Comorin in lat. 8° 5' N. to Mussoorie in lat.
 30° 28'  N., and at a 26th station, on the Island of Minicoy, midway between
 the Maldives and the Laccadives, in lat. 8° 6' — and that five additional
 stations had been allotted as the work of the present year, four of which
 are in the high tablelands of India between 32° and 36° N., and one near
 the mouth of the Indus.
    I  had the pleasure of receiving, about the same time, a letter from
 Colonel Walker himself, announcing his intention of being in England, on
 furlough, towards the end of December, when he might be personally
informed of any further uses to be made of the pendulums in India — pro
posing also that, on the return voyage to England, Captain Basevi should
be instructed to obtain the rates of the pendulums at Aden (suggested as
 desirable, from its geographical peculiarities, by our Foreign Secretary, in
 a letter to myself, printed in the Minutes of Council of June 1864), and
 at a station to be selected in the vicinity of the Bitter Lakes.      Colonel
 Walker    also suggested  that, on the arrival of the pendulums in England,

 116                           Anniversary Meeting.                       [Nov. 30,
 their rates should be ascertained         at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich,
 in addition to the necessary repetition of the original experiments at the
 Kew Observatory.
     The documents thus referred to having been read at a recent evening
 meeting, and suitable communications having been made to those Fellows
 of the Society who participated in the original recommendation of the
 experiments, a Committee has been named, with Colonel Walker aa one of
 its members, to meet as soon as may be convenient after his arrival in
 England, to prepare      a reply to the Indian Government.
    It may perhaps be permissible to notice, on this occasion, that the experi
 ments on the retardation which pendulums experience when vibrated in
 different gases, for which a sum was allotted some years since by the
 Government-Grant        Committee, yet await the supervision of an experimen
 talist having sufficient leisure and interest in the subject.        The apparatus
 at Kew may be made quite suitable for the purpose ; and the occasion is
 favourable.
    The successful   voyage    and safe return of the North-German Polar        Ex
 pedition is an event on which the Royal Society may add its sincere con
 gratulations to those of the public at large.         The progress of geographical
 discovery, connecting with    itself, as it does, the advancement of many physical
 sciences which require, either for extension or for confirmation, the assu
rance derived from experimental research, has for nearly three centuries
 been carried on in the Arctic Regions, where it has afforded a common
field for the enterprises of the British and of the northern continental
nations — enterprises conducive to hardihood, and to qualities which are the
result of a generous emulation, unmixed with the deteriorating influences
which are but too apt to be generated by the rivalries of war. The earliest of
these undertakings were indeed antecedent to the existence of the Royal
 Society  ; but on their revival — which took place in 1818, at the termination
of the great War by which Europe had been desolated for so many years —
the British Government, at the instigation of the Royal Society, was the
first to recommence, and for several years to continue, a succession of under
takings, in which we have now to recognize the successful participation of
more than one kindred and allied people.
    The German expedition consisted of the ' Germania,' a steamer of about
80 tons, duly strengthened for encounters           with ice, commanded by Captain
Koldeway, who seems to have possessed in an eminent degree the special
qualifications required in such an enterprise.            Besides her naval comple
ment of twelve officers and seamen, four gentlemen were embarked for
special scientific services, to whom were confided, among other objects,
the researches preliminary to the measurement of an arc of the meridian
                                                                 '
on the coast-line of East Greenland.            The ' Germania was accompanied
                           not furnished      with          apparatus, named
                                                                              " The

ice which has to be traversed in the passage from Europe to East Green
land, and did not subsequently rejoin ; the * Hansa' having been unable to
force her way through the ice, was finally wrecked by    the crew escaping    it,
on the ice, and being conveyed, on    constantly lessening ice-raft, to near

which they had                preserved,   to the nearest     Danish settlements,            from which
they have returned without loss of life.

which my pendulum experiments had been made forty-six years before.
They subsequently visited Cape Philip Broke in lat. 74° 55', which had
been the first landing-point on the coast when examined by Captain Cla-
vering and myself in the British Expedition of 1823. The highest latitude
reached        by   the   '
                              Germania'    was 75° 31', where she was stopped by the ice,
and returned to winter in the bay, in the Pendulum Island, in which they
had first anchored. The extreme northern point of the coast which had been
seen      in   1823,          Captain Clavering "The Ilaystack,"
                              named   by                                 lat.                      in
75° 42', was visited in sledges in the spring of 1870, by parties engaged in
the survey operations, which extended into the 77th parallel.
   One of the most noteworthy results of this expedition, and           may                       it
possibly prove one of the most important,   the discovery that the lands
                                                               is
adjacent to the bays and fiords               in
                                East Greenland abound     flocks of Rein            in
deer and Musk-oxen, and in smaller game of various descriptions.   stated                    It   is
that during the stay of many months on the coast the crew were rarely
without an abundant supply of fresh food, derived from the country itself.
It    possible that this abundance of game, combined with the magnificence
     is
of the glaciers and of the mountain scenery accessible by the deeply intersect
ing fiords, may tempt persons who in these days have trained themselves
to      arduous      mountain-ascents          to visit   a    country   in     which         panoramic
views over ret unexplored                  regions of the globe might be   recompense    a
for their toils and dangers.                The mountains rising from one of the fiords
visited by the surveying parties of the 'Germania' attain     height of                  a

than about 400 geographical miles.
   The Survey which has been recently made under the auspices of the
 Swedish Government, with a view to the measurement of an arc of the
meridian at Spitzbergen, may have suggested the corresponding survey of
the coast    of East Greenland.      But, without doubt, the extent of con
tinuous land in the direction of the meridian is much greater in Greenland
than in Spitzbergen ; whilst the fiords, which so generally characterize
the Greenland coast, would probably greatly facilitate the access to localities
suitable for trigonometrical stations.    The return of the * Germania,' whilst
the objects of her mission were still incomplete, was occasioned by the
necessity of replacing her boiler, which had wholly failed ; and she will pro
bably resume her operations in the coming year.          It is understood that
the Swedes also are organizing another Spitzbergen expedition, of which
the special objects have not yet been announced.      It may be hoped that the
remeasurement of the Fairhaven Hill may be remembered on this occasion.
Its height in 1 823 was determined with great care, both geometrically and
barometrically, by Captain Foster and myself (Phil. Trans. 1824, Art. xvi.).
The permanency, or otherwise, in the elevation of marked features of the
land is a subject of considerable geological importance in some countries ;
and Spitzbergen is one of those in which it has been occasionally questioned.
   The discrepancy in the action of the currents experienced in 1823 and
1 869, on the extensive    ice-fields which occupy the middle space between
the coasts of Europe and of East Greenland, is very noteworthy.        In 1823
the most careful observations, of officers greatly practised in such investi
gations, failed to discover any perceptible surface-current whatsoever, either
by its effect on the ice itself, or on the surface-water of the sea between
the ice and the Greenland coast ; whilst in 1869 the crew of the ' Hansa,'
having taken refuge on the ice after the loss of their vessel, in the approxi
mate geographical position of 70° 50' N. and 21° W., were carried by it
to the lat. of 61° 12' N. and long, (about) 42° W., — being a drift extending
over more than 500 geographical miles, accomplished in little less than 200
days, the average being somewhat less than three miles a day.           In seas
much encumbered by floating ice, currents are generally ascribed to the
prevailing winds; and there appears to have been in 1869 a considerable
amount of northerly gales.      But the frequent existence of a current setting
to the south and south-west down the coast of East Greenland has been
recognized by the highest authorities, and is regarded by Forchhammer,
in his valuable memoir on the Phenomena of the Sea, in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1865, as a returning branch of the Gulf-stream, recog
nizable as such by the difference in the analysis of the polar and equatorial
waters.     This branch of physical research has doubtless received full
                                     '           '
attention from the officers of the Germania;       and we must await the pub
lication of the complete account of the voyage for the full details.
   The plant-remains of the Miocene epoch, discovered in Spitzbergen and

Greenland, have given a new feature of interest to future explorations
within the Arctic Circle.      The valuable memoir which Professor Oswald
Heer, of Zurich, has contributed recently to the Philosophical Transactions
(1869, Art. XIII.), has added much to the evidence contained in his pre
vious papers of the existence, at that early period of the earth's history, of
a vegetation in some cases identical with, and in others scarcely differing
from, that which now lives and flourishes in the Temperate Zone — a vege
tation comprehending oaks, planes, chestnuts, and even a Magnolia, the
leaves and fruit of which were found in the North-Greenland deposits.
Altogether, Professor Heer has identified no less than 137 species of the
Arctic flora of the Miocene age ; and he has moreover inferred, with great
appearance of reason, that at the same era vegetation of the same cha
racter may have prevailed generally in lands within the Arctic Circle. The
anticipation of future discoveries of plant-remains, adding possibly largely
to the number of 137 species already recognized, must tend to give to
land-explorations and excursions an interest which was comparatively
wanting to them when all that the explorer could anywhere hope to find
(other than the scanty, though in some respects beautiful, flora which the
rigours of the Arctic region at the present time still suffer to exist) was, at
most, the less attractive fossil remains of much earlier geological ages, to
the climatology of which less interest attaches than to that of the com
paratively recent (however ancient) Miocene age.
    There have been in the past year two vacancies in the list of Foreign
Members of the Royal Society.       The two gentlemen who have been elected
are Professor Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau, of Ghent, and Professor
Anders Jons Angstrom, of Upsala.          Professor Plateau has been an earnest
worker in the field of physical science for above forty years. His memoirs,
 the titles of which (forty-six in number) are given in the fourth vo
lume of the Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers, give evidence of
 the completeness with which he has treated the subjects he has taken
 up ; and many of his experiments are remarkable for their ingenuity and
 originality. Questions in physical optics were the first to engage his at
 tention.   In this branch of science his researches were confined to the
 laws of visual appearances, including those relating to ocular spectra, the
 duration of impressions on the retina, and irradiation ; and though some of
 nis conclusions may have to be corrected, there is no doubt that in this special
 department he has done more than any one of his predecessors or contempo
 raries.   Another subject which has occupied him in his later years, and has
 supplied the materials of eleven memoirs, concerns the figures of equilibrium
 of a liquid mass without gravity.      No one can contest the perfect origi
 nality of this series of investigations, or fail to admire the simple and
 effective means by which he has carried out his experiments, and the saga
 city with which he has arrived at results which have formed a new starting

point for mathematical investigations relating to the corpuscular theory.
It is much to be regretted that Professor Plateau's scientific labours for
more     than twenty years past have been carried on under a deprivation of
sight   occasioned   by the ardent pursuit of his favourite science.            Although
totally blind, his experiments are of the most exquisite delicacy ; and the
reasoning of which they form the material is as accurate and penetrating
as the experiments themselves are beautiful.
    The    second   gentleman who is elected          a Foreign    Member,       Professor
  o
Angstrom, is distinguished by his researches in many departments of physical
science, and is entitled to rank among the very highest of those who have
 within a few years developed the powers of spectroscopy to their present
 marvellous     extent.    In  fact,  his  '
                                             Optic Researches,' 1853, contain the
 fundamental principles of nearly all that has been done since.
     The following notice is from the pen of the Rev. Dr. T. Romney Robin
 son, F.R.S., of Armagh : —
     " From Euler's theory of Resonance, he infers that,           as a body absorbs all
 " the series of  oscillations which it can itself assume, it must, when heated so
 " as to become    luminous, emit the same rays which at a lower temperature it
 " absorbs.
     " It is hardly possible to announce more distinctly this important fact, on
 " which    nearly all solar and stellar spectroscopy rests      ;  and  it is much to be
 " regretted that, from the ignorance of the Scandinavian languages which is
 " so general in this country, it was not known here till 1 856. He proceeds
 " to  examine the spectrum of the electric spark.          It is traversed by two sets
 "of   lines on an obscure ground.          The first of these belongs to air.         The
 " lines reach across the spectrum, and do not vary with the nature of the
 "electrodes. The second set come from the electrodes ; they are in general
 " far brighter than the other, and, unless the discharge is powerful, are con-
  " fined to the vicinity of the electrodes. Each metal has its own set ; but,
  "owing    to the small dispersion of his spectroscope (one prism             of 46°), he
  " thought some lines were common to two or more metals. Alloys showed
  " the lines of their components with no greater difference than could be ex
  plained by the want of power in his instrument.                He shows that these
  " lines are not produced by interference. The solar spectrum may be re-
  " garded   as a reversion   of  the electric one  ; and he is convinced that the ex-
  " planation of the dark lines in the former embraces that of the bright
  " lines in the other. Each gas has its peculiar spectrum ; he notices the
  " faintness of the oxygen-lines in air, and he describes the three bright bands
  "of hydrogen, and a fourth fainter.
     " In 1861, in a second memoir, he developed 1 is theory of the reversion of
  " the lines. He had then obtained a better spectroscope and a large Ruhm-
  " korff, with which   he compared many       of the solar with metallic lines. Many
  " double lines belong to two metals. Gas-lines are more diffused and less
  " sharply defined than those of metals, especially metals difficult of fusion.
  " He found no evidence of nitrogen or oxygen in the sun.

     "His third     memoir (1863) contains a determination of the wave-lengths
" of Fraunhofer's principal          lines, and others, 70 in all. As the same matter is
" treated     far more completely in        a subsequent  memoir, it is only necessary to
" notice that he corrects his           measures for the pressure and temperature of
" the air, for the temperature          of the grating employed, and for the aberration
"   caused by a motion of the instrument in a direction at right angles to the
" incident light. This last will cause a difference between the deviations on
" each side of zero. In the high latitude of Upsala, and in an unfavourable
" summer, the observations which he made to test the reality of this correc-
" tion     were neither sufficiently good nor numerous to satisfy him              ; yet the

" metallic      spectra were obtained, not by an induction-machine,               but by the

      "In    1866, he found         that the lines   A  a B, and     some others, though

 " strength     at  1 6°  below zero of Fahrenheit, while the other telluric lines were

         In 1869 his researches        on the solar spectrum contained determinations

" ration     were attended to     ;  and in the measures of the deviations the 5th
" and    6th spectra were generally taken ; his experience indicates that in
" taking these measures it is best to have the intervals of the grating not
" very    close, but covering a surface      of some magnitude   : the deviations are
"  less, but the spectra brighter.
     " The result of these measures is given in six beautiful maps, extending
" from B to H\ The places of the lines are laid down on a scale, not of de-
" viations, but of wave-lengths, in which the unit is a ten-millionth of a
" millimetre.
     " The advantage of this can scarcely be overrated ; for in other maps
" the    scale depends on the refractive indices     of the prisms and their adjust-
" ments, so that no two are comparable ; while at ordinary temperatures and
" pressures the wave-lengths are invariable.
     " In addition to hydrogen he found in the sun thirteen metals, of which
" titanium has 200 lines. The total amount of metallic lines is nearly 800,
" including most of the strong lines ; so that probably the sun has few ele-
" ments which are not found on our earth. There are some strong lines
" between E and G whose origin as yet is unknown ; one coincides with a
" line of bromine, whose presence is not probable. There are three strong
" magnesium lines not present in the sun ; and oxygen, nitrogen,         and carbon,
" so common here, are not detected there. He thinks the sun is not hot
" enough to make the first two luminous; carbon in the circuit of his battery
" shows no lines of its own, but those of its compounds. He doubts
" Pliicker's      notion    of the   same  substance having different spectra, and
" thinks     that the change is merely due to the increased temperature, which
" makes       faint lines intense — and is disposed to think that the pillar-like
"appearance observed in some star-spectra indicates a lower temperature
" than    the black sharp lines which occur       in others.
     " The    aurora and zodiacal light have in common a line      (\=5567) whose
" origin is yet unknown.
     " It must be admitted that this list is the exponent of intellectual power
" of first-rate excellence, and of additions to our knowledge which are not
" only intrinsically valuable, but are also eminently suggestive of ulterior
" progress. Nor can his claim to priority of entrance into this wondrous
" region be disputed by any unprejudiced judge. Though Stokes and Thom-
" son nearly at the same time drew the same conclusion as to absorption,
»' and even      satisfied themselves of the identity of D with the sodium lines —
"   though Stewart, and still more successfully Kirchhoff, again brought it
"   before the public three years after, yet this is what happens to every
"   inventor or discoverer      :   others follow in his track, some   perhaps more
"successfully       than himself; but his right remains untouched."

the subject of a communication to the Society at its next Evening Meeting,
I  abstain from adverting on the present occasion to any of the interesting
particulars with which Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys          have been so
obliging as to furnish me.
    Her Majesty's Government having been pleased to accede to a request
made by a Joint Committee of the Royal and of the Royal Astronomical
Societies, for means of conveyance to and from Cadiz and Gibraltar of
twenty-five persons desirous of observing the Total Solar Eclipse on the 2 1st
December 1870, and for a sum not exceeding £3000 to defray cost of in
struments, travelling-expenses of the scientific party, and other miscellaneous
services and purposes connected therewith, the necessary arrangements have
been confided to an organizing Committee, under the immediate direction
of the Astronomer Royal, and are now in progress.
    You are perhaps aware that your President occupies, as such, an official
seat in the Board of Trustees of the British Museum.            In attending to
these duties, I became impressed with the benefits which might result if
objects, for the exhibition of which space cannot be found at the British
Museum — and most especially specimens of natural history — were freely
lent, under suitable regulations for their safe custody and safe return when
required, to Provincial Museums.       For this purpose it would be necessary
to introduce    a modification  in the Act of Parliament, under which         the
Trustees are now bound not to permit the removal from the Museum of any
article which has been once received into it. I have made this suggestion
known in different quarters, and have found it, generally speaking, so
favourably received, that    I even thought it possible that I might be able
ou this occasion to inform you that some advance had been made in its
actual realization.   I can only say at present that some steps have been
taken in that direction, which, 1 hope, may yet bear fruit.
    I proceed to the award of the Medals.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded to Mr. James Prescott Joule, for
his Experimental Researches on Heat.
    The researches, for which the Copley Medal has thus been awarded, are
the same for which a Royal Medal was awarded to Mr. Joule in the year
 1850.    The terms of the award in 1850 were for "his Researches on the
Mechanical Equivalent of Heat ;
                                    " those on the
                                                     present occasion were for
his "Experimental Researches on Heat."              Both awards refer to the'
same experiments, and are substantially for the same great step in Natural
Philosophy ; of which, therefore, it is needless for me to give you an account
at this time.   You are all aware that by it a great principle has been added
 to the sum of human knowledge — one fruitful in consequences in a thousand
 ways, and which, being accepted amongst undisputed         truths, is now em

bodied, without question, alike in the most wide-ranging                                speculations and
the most matter-of-fact practice.
   The award of two Medals for the same researches is an exceedingly rare
proceeding in our Society, and rightly so.   The- Council have on this
occasion desired to mark by                    it,in the most emphatic manner, their sense
of the special and original                     character, and high desert of Mr. Joule's
discovery.             No words of mine could add to the value of the award.
         Mr. Joule,
 I   present you with this Medal, in testimony of the very high sense
which the Royal Society entertains of your researches, and of the results to
which they have led.
  The Council                   Royal Medal to Professor William Hallowes
                            has awarded        a
Miller, Foreign   Secretary of the Royal Society, for his researches and
writings on  Mineralogy and Crystallography, and for his scientific labours
in the restoration of the National Standard of Weight.
  These last-named labours appeared to me to have, from their national
importance conjoined with great scientific merit, so peculiar claim to a                   a
Royal Medal,                 preeminently on this ground that
                            that    it   was                       ven                          I

Standards Commission, to give here in full   statement from his pen, in

" Member of that Commission, his friendly assistance contributed greatly to
" guide the Commission m son.e of their more important recommendations,

" mary,    Secondary, and Local Standards. As Head of the new Department,
" the   Government were most fortunate in being able to avail themselves of
" the   talent and energy of Mr. H. W. Chisholm ; and to the cordial co-
   operation of Professor Miller and Mr. Chisholm, principally in regard to
**
" the   questions of Weights, but also on many points applying to lengths
"and capacities, is to be ascribed in great measure a result which (in the
" hope of Professor Miller's colleagues) will prove to be an important legis-
" lative   success.   Without the extensive knowledge and the long experience
" of Professor    Miller this result could not have been expected. The field of
" labour    was  very wide ; not only were the state of Standards of all degrees
" of subordination,     and the legislation respecting them, to be considered, but
" the Commission       and Professor Miller, in a high degree, had the serious
"  and responsible charge of offering to the Government their matured opi-
"nions on the grave questions of introduction of Metric System, abrogation
" of Troy Weight, and future arrangement of the entire system of British
" Standards. It is believed that the fruits of these labours may be correctly
" stated as : — the establishment of an office which for accuracy of standards
" and perfection in the methods of using them, may compare favourably
" with any in the world; the indication of the best direction of legislation
" in establishment of regulations for their national utility ; and the expo-
" sition of the broad views which may advantageously be adopted by nations,
" especially by Britain, in deciding on the course to be followed under the
" competing claims of different systems. For this presumed success the
"  country is greatly indebted to the ability, the science, and the incessant
*' attention   of Professor Miller."
    Though in awarding the Royal Medal to Professor Miller it was natu
rally impossible not to advert to them, I am not prepared to give you any
corresponding account of those researches in Mineralogy and Crystallo
graphy which, having        been prosecuted for more than thirty years, have
gained     for him    the  highest   reputation wherever those departments of
knowledge are cultivated throughout the world, and have accordingly been
translated into different European languages.

    The Council has awarded the Rumford Medal to Monsieur Alfred Olivier
Des Cloizeaux, for his researches in Mineralogical Optics.
    For nearly thirty    years M. Des Cloizeaux      has been occupied  in investi
gating the characters of crystallized bodies, and more especially those which
are produced by their action upon light.             He has subjected nearly 500
crystalline species to an optical scrutiny, determining the ratio of the velo
city of light of various colours in air to its velocity in the direction of each
of the axes of optical elasticity within the crystal, the angle between the
optic axes in biaxial crystals, and the dispersion of the optic axes.          The
results of these observations are published in vols. xi. and xiv. of the ' An
                                              '
nates des Mines,' and in vol. xviii. of the Memoires des Savants Strangers '.
    Assuming the truth of the laws connecting the optical properties of
a  crystal and its system of crystallization established by Sir David Brewster,
he has applied them to correct the descriptions of mineral species, by the
methods detailed in his ' M6moire sur l'emploi du microscope polarisant
et sur Fe'tude des proprie'te's optiques bireTringentes propres k determiner
le systeme crystallin dans les cristaux naturels ou artificials.'       Numerous
instances of these corrected descriptions occur in the ' Comptes Rendus,'
 the ' Annales de Chimie,' the ' Annales des Mines,' the * Transactions of
                       '                        *
 the Royal Society       for 1868, and in his     Treatise on Mineralogy.'
    While investigating the     effect of heat in modifying the action of crys
 talline bodies, he observed that the positions of the optic axes of felspar,
 chrysoberyl, and brookite changed on the application of heat, returning
 to their original positions when the crystal regained its initial temperature,
 as indeed was known before in the case of felspar ; but on increasing the
 temperature beyond a certain limit, he made the very unexpected discovery
 that the positions of the optic axes were permanently altered.            Thus in
 felspar the permanent change occurs at a low red heat, or at about 600° C.
 M. Des Cloizeaux exhibited this experiment in the presence of the Che
 mical Section of the British Association at the Meeting held in Cambridge

 1870.]                        President's Adaress.                        127
in 1862.      This discovery leads to a conclusion of great importance to the
geologist. The optic axes of a crystal of felspar serve as the index of a
self-registering thermometer, and show that the crystal had never been
exposed to a temperature reaching to 600° C.
    Circular polarization was first discovered iu quartz by Arago in 1811,
and in chlorate of soda, bromate of soda, and acetate of uranium and soda,
all    three  belonging to the cubic system, by Marbach in 1854.             In
 1857 M. Des Cloizeaux detected its existence in cinnabar, producing a
rotation of a plane-polarized beam, sometimes to the right, sometimes
to the left, to from 15 to 17 times the angle of rotation due to an equal
thickness of quartz, — and also, nearly at the same time, in sulphate of
strychnine with 13 combining-weights of water, a crystal belonging to
the pyramidal system, the rotation, iu one direction only (Herschel's
right-handed rotation), the same as that of its solution, and about half
as great as in an equal thickness of quartz.        In February 1869 M. Des
Cloizeaux     discovered that benzile (C14 H10 O2),   a compound obtained by
 Laurent from the essence of bitter almonds in 1835, in crystals belonging
to the rhombohedral system, produced a rotation a little greater than that
 of quartz. The crystals which came first into his possession were all dex-
 trogyre ; but he has lately obtained some producing a rotation in the op
 posite direction.
    In his memoir on the Crystallization and Internal Construction of Quartz
 he has largely employed the method of exploration by polarized light.
     During the summersof 1845 and 1846 he paid two visits to Iceland,
 in   one   of which, conjointly with M. Bunsen, he determined the tem
  peratures, at different depths, of the great Geyser and the Strokkur, with
  the view of discovering the source of their heat, and the cause of the
 eruptions.
     Any remarks on his very numerous and valuable determinations of the
  forms of crystalline species, as well as on the geological observations made
  by him in Iceland, would be obviously out of place in a summary of the
  researches on light and heat which render him eligible as      a recipient of
 the Kumford Medal.

by the insertion of the requisite details, within the time at which the pub
lication of the Proceedings would be due. It has been found, however,
that in working out these details so many new points arose suggestive of
further inquiries (especially requiring careful comparison of Temperature
observations) that, though devoting to them all the time he could com
mand, the Member of the Expedition who is responsible for the whole,
save the Narrative of the First Cruise, has found himself unable to com
plete his portion of the Report at an earlier date.            Whilst expressing
his regret for the delay which has hence arisen, he ventures to hope that
 some compensation for it will be found in the greater completeness which
 the Report now possesses ; especially in that Section of it which treats
 of the Causal Relation between the double currents of the Straits of Gi
 braltar and Baltic Sound, and the General vertical Oceanic Circulation. —

                                INTRODUCTION.
                           Preliminary Proceedings.
    The following Extracts from the Minutes of the Council of the Royal
                                         '
 Society set forth the origin of the Porcupine' Expedition of 1870, and
 the objects which it was designed to carry out.
                                   March  24, 1870.
    A Letter was read from Dr. Carpenter, addressed to the President, sug
 gesting that an Exploration of the Deep Sea, such as was carried out
 during 1868 and 1869 in the regions to the North of the British Islands,
 should now be extended to the South of Europe and the Mediterranean,

1870.]                          Deep-sea Researches.                        147
and that the Council of the Royal Society should recommend such an
undertaking to the favourable consideration of the Admiralty, with a view
to obtain the assistance     of Her Majesty's Government    as on the previous
occasions.
 Resolved,   — That    a Committee, consisting of the President and Officers,
    with the Hydrographer, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, Mr. Siemens, Professor
    Tyndall, and Dr. Carpenter, with power to add to their number, be
    appointed, to consider the expediency of adopting the proposal of Dr.
    Carpenter, and the plan to be followed in carrying it out, as well as the
    instruments and other appliances that would be required, and to report
    their opinion thereon to the Council ; but with power previously to com
    municate to the Admiralty a draft of such report as they may agree
    upon,  if it shall appear to them expedient to do so in order to save time.
                                  April 28, 1870.
    Read the following Report      : —
    " The Committee
                          appointed on the 24th of March to consider a proposal
 for a further Exploration of the Deep Sea during the ensuing summer, as
 well as the scientific preparations which would be required for a new expe
 dition, beg leave to report as follows : —
    " The general course proposed to be followed, and the chief objects ex
pected to be attained in a new expedition, are pointed out in the following
extract from the letter of Dr. Carpenter, read to the Council on the 24th
ult., which was referred to the Committee.
    " ' The   plan which has been marked out between my Colleagues in last
year's work and myself is as follows : —
    " ' Having reason to hope that the ' Porcupine ' may be spared towards
the end of June, we propose that she should start early in July, and pro
ceed   in a  S.W. direction towards the furthest point to which our survey
was carried last year ; carefully exploring the bottom in depths of 400 to
800 fathoms, on which,       as experience has shown us, the most interesting
collections are to be made ; but also obtaining a few casts of the Dredge
with Temperature-soundings at greater depths, as opportunities may occur.
    " ' The course should then be nearly due South, in a direction of general
parallelism with the coast of France, Spain, and Portugal, keeping gene
rally within the depths just mentioned, but occasionally stretching west
wards into yet deeper waters.         From what has been already done in about
400 fathoms' water off the coast of Portugal, there is no doubt that the
ground is there exceedingly rich. When approaching the Straits of Gi
braltar, the survey, both Physical and Zoological, should be carried out with
great care and minuteness ; in order that the important problem as to the cur
rents between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Seas, and the relation of the
Mediterranean      Fauna to that of the Atlantic (on which Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys
                                                                  o2

148                      Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys on                      [Dec. 8,
is of opinion that the results of our last year's work throw an entirely new
light), may be cleared up.
  " ' Mr. Gwyn   Jeffreys is prepared to undertake the scientific charge of
this part of the expedition ; and if Prof. Wyville Thomson should not be
able to accompany him, it will not be difficult to find him a suitable
assistant.
  " * The ship would probably reach Gibraltar early in August, and there
I should be myself prepared to join her, in place of Mr. Jeffreys, with one
of my sons as an assistant. We should propose first to complete the sur
vey   of the Straits of Gibraltar,      if
                                    that should not have been fully accom
plished previously ; and then to proceed eastwards along the Mediterranean,
making stretches between the coasts of Europe and Africa, so as to carry
out as complete a survey, Physical and Zoological, of that part of the
Mediterranean basin as time may permit.        Malta would probably be our
extreme point    ;   and this we should reckon to reach about the middle                of
September.
   " * It is well known that there are questions of great Geological interest
connected with the present distribution of Animal life in this area ; and we
have great reason to believe that we shall here find at considerable depths
a large number       of Tertiary   species which have been supposed to be extinct.
And in regard        to the Physics     of the Mediterranean,      it appears, from all
that we have been able to learn, that very little is certainly known.                  The
Temperature and Density of the water, at different depths, in a basin so
remarkably cut off from the great ocean, and having a continual influx
from   it,
        form   most interesting subject of inquiry, to which we shall be
                a
glad to give our best attention,   the means are placed within our reach.'
                                        if
   " Considering the success of the two previous Expeditions, and espe
cially that of the Porcupine last year, the Committee are persuaded that
                     '              '
no less important acquisitions for the furtherance of scientific knowledge
would be gained by the renewed exploration as now proposed       and they   ;
accordingly recommend that    representation to that effect be made to the
                                    a
Admiralty,  with  view
                     a to obtain the aid of Her Majesty's Government as
on the previous occasions.
  " The Committee approve of            a    proposal made   by   Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys to
accept the services      of Mr. Lindahl, of Lund, in the expedition             as unpaid
Assistant Naturalist.
   " As regards scientific instruments, the Committee have to report that
those employed in last year's voyage will be again available for use and           ;
Mr. Siemens hopes to render his electro-thermal indicator of more easy
employment on ship-board.
  " The  Committee, having learned that Dr. Frankland has contrived an
apparatus for bringing up the deep-sea water charged with its gaseous con
tents, have resolved to add his name to their number               ;   and they request
leave to meet againin order        to complete the arrangements and make           final
                                                                                   a
report to the Council."

   Resolved,   — That the Report now read          be received and adopted, and that

     on   the arrangements when finally decided on.
  Besolved, — That the following          draft of a Letter to be addressed          to the
     Secretary    of the Admiralty     be approved, viz.    :—
     "Sir, — I     am directed by the President           and Council       of the Royal
 "
    Society to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Commissioners
 " of
       the Admiralty, that, considering the important scientific results of the
"Physical and Zoological Exploration of the Deep Sea carried on in 1868
"and 1869 through the aid of Her Majesty's Government, they deem it
"highly desirable that the investigation should be renewed during the
"
   ensuing summer, and extended over a new area.
    " The
             course which it would be proposed to follow in a new Expedition,
"
   the principal objects to be attained, and the general plan of operations,
" are
         sketched out in the inclosed extract from a Letter addressed to the
"
   President by Dr. Carpenter, and have in all points been approved by the
"Council.
    " The
             President and Council would therefore earnestly recommend such
 " an
        undertaking to the favourable consideration of My Lords, with the
 "
    view of obtaining the assistance of Her Majesty's Government so libe-
"
   rally accorded and effectively rendered on the previous occasions.
     " The
              scientific conduct of the expedition would, as in the last year, be
 "shared by Dr. Carpenter, Professor Wyville Thomson, provided that
 "
    gentleman is able to undertake the duty, and Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys.                    It is
"   also proposed that Mr. Lindahl, a young Swedish gentleman accustomed
 "to marine researches, should accompany the expedition as Assistant
"Naturalist.
    " I have to add that whatever
                                          appertains to the strictly Scientific equip.
"
   ment     of  the Expedition   will,  as formerly,   be at the charge       of the Royal

                                    Equipment.
    1.  The equipment of the ' Porcupine        '
                                                  for the previous Expedition had
been   found   so complete   and satisfactory  that   nothing more was considered
necessary to prepare her for the -work of the present season than the over
hauling of her gear, and the manufacture of new dredges, sieves, and other
apparatus, on the patterns of those which had already proved most serviceable.
We had the advantage of the same excellent Commander, now promoted to
the rank of Staff-Captain, with his able staff of Officers ; and we would take
this opportunity of again expressing our deep sense of obligation to them all
for their hearty co-operation in our scientific work, and for the unvarying
personal kindness by which our voyage was rendered a most agreeable one.
A considerable part of the Crew, also, consisted of the same steady and
experienced men.        The Meteorological Department supplied eight of the
protected Miller-Casella Thermometers, including the two with the per
formance of which we had been so thoroughly satisfied last year ; and we
usually employed one of these in conjunction with one that had not been
used in the previous Expedition.
   2. At the request of the Committee,         Mr. Siemens undertook to devise
an Apparatus      for testing the depth of Sea-water to which Light, or at least
the Actinic rays, can penetrate. The foundation of the apparatus which
he constructed for this purpose is a horizontal wheel with three radii, each
of them carrying a glass tube in which a piece of sensitized paper is sealed
up.    The rotation of this wheel round a vertical axis brings each of the
tubes in succession out of a dark chamber in which it ordinarily lies,
exposes   it to light in an uncovered space, and then carries it into darkness
again. This movement is produced by a spring ; but it is regulated by a
detent that projects from the keeper of an Electro-magnet, which is made
and unmade by the completion or breaking of a circuit that connects it with
a Galvanic battery.       When the magnet is made, it lifts the keeper with its
projecting detent ; and this allows the wheel to be carried by the spring
through one-sixth of its rotation, whereby the first of the tubes is
brought out into the open space.          There it remains until the circuit is
broken, whereby the magnet is unmade ; the keeper then falls, and the
wheel is allowed to move through another sixth of a rotation, so as to carry
on the tube into the dark chamber.          A  repetition of the making and un
making of the magnet brings out the second tube, and shuts it up again ;

and another repetition does the              like with the third tube.             This apparatus,
with a deep-sea lead attached to                  it,        suspended by an insulating cable
                                                    is is
that contains the wires whereby               it            connected with the battery in the
vessel.   Being lowered down to any desired depth, the circuit    com                      is
pleted, the magnet made, and one of the tubes exposed for as long  time                        a
as may be wished    the circuit
                      ;          then broken, the magnet unmade, and
                                             is
the tube       shut up again.The second tube may be exposed for         longer             a
time in the same place, or the apparatus may be lowered to             greater          a
depth, at which the experiment may be repeated        and the third tube may
                                                                       ;
then be dealt with in like manner.   — The Committee having been satisfied
with the performance of Mr. Siemens's apparatus,       had been arranged that
                                                                       it
trial should be made of      and also of his Differential Thermometer, now
                                 it,
provided with an improved Galvanometer       and he had undertaken to send
                                                             ;
out  a qualified Assistant to take charge of these instruments during the
Mediterranean Cruise.     The declaration of war between France and Ger
many, however, unfortunately interfered with this arrangement         the As           ;
sistant   German) being recalled to his own country, and no other com
          (a
petent person being available on short notice.
                                          a     Under these circumstances
itwas thought better that the Differential Thermometer should not be sent
out  ;but was hoped that such trial might be given to the Photometric
           it                                a
Apparatus       as should      at any rate determine                 whether
                                                        satisfactory results
might be anticipated from its use, or whether any modifications in its con
struction might be needed.      The apparatus was sent out to Gibraltar
under charge of Dr. Carpenter, and was got into working order by his Son
and himself in Gibraltar Harbour. It proved, however, that the action of
sea-water on the bearings, — increased as this was by the galvanic current
arising out of the contact of iron and brass in them, — so embarrassed its
Mechanical arrangements, that no fair trial could be made of its Photo
metric efficiency.  But the experiment served the important purpose of
showing  the  weak points of the apparatus  and neither Mr. Siemens nor
                                                             ;
Dr. Carpenter entertains any doubt that         may be so reconstructed as to
                                                             it
answer the purpose  for which    was  devised.

   3. The work of this year's Expedition was divided, according to the plan
originally marked out, into two Cruises     the first to examine the Deep-sea
                                                        :

examination of the western basin of the Mediterranean between Gibraltar
and Malta, and to determine its Physical and Biological relations to the
Atlantic, with special reference to the Gibraltar Current. — The First
Cruise was under the scientific direction of Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, who was
accompanied by    young Swedish Naturalist, Mr. Josua Lindahl, of the
                     a
University of Lund,      Zoological Assistant
                          as                   whilst Mr. W. L. Carpenter,

as before, took charge of the Chemical department, —his special work, on
this occasion, being the determination, by Volumetric analysis, of the pro
portion of Chlorine in samples of Atlantic water taken from the surface, the
bottom, and from intermediate depths, so as to serve as      basis of com      a

Second Cruise it had been arranged that Dr. Carpenter and Prof. Wyville
Thomson should co-operate as before ; but the latter being unfortunately-
prevented by serious illness from taking part in

                                                 the whole charge of this
Cruise rested with Dr. Carpenter.   He was fortunately able to retain the
assistance of Mr. Lindahl   and the Chemical work was continued (as in

  4. After leaving Falmouth on the 4th of July,   thick fog and contrary
                                                                a
wind delayed our voyage to such an extent that Captain Calver considered
itadvisable to put into Mount's Bay, as we could make but little way,
and were  uselessly expending coal. We remained there at anchor all the
next day. The wind having moderated, we started at daybreak on the 6th,
and steamed westward. During the day we used        towing-net (constructed
                                                               a

     a   of Lieut. Palmer), while the vessel was going at speed of between
                                                                        a
five and six knots an hour, and caught myriads of small oceanic Crusta
                                                                    a
cean, Cetochilus Helgolandicus.
     5.   In the evening of the
                         ne xt day (7th of July) we reached that part of the
slope extending from the  entrance of the British Channel to the Atlantic
deeps, which appeared from the chart and our sounding to be promising
ground    and here our first dredging was made in 567 fathoms (Station 1).
           ;
There being little or no wind, the contents of the dredge were very small,
but proved extremely interesting.    Among the Mollusca were Terebratula
septate, Limopsis borealis, Hela tenella, Pecchiolia (or Verticordid) abyssi-
eola, and   fine species of Turbo, which wewere subsequently enabled to iden
               a
tify with Trochus filosus of Philippi, of which his T. glabratus              is
                                                                       variety.    a
The last-named species and its variety are only known at present as Tertiary
fossils of Calabria and Messina.     The three species first named likewise oc-
eur in the Pliocene beds of Southern Italy and these, as well as the Pec
                                                       ;
chiolia or Verticordia, live in the Norwegian seas. The other species of
Mollusca now dredged are also northern, with the exception of Ringicula
ventricosa (one of our Crag fossils), which was obtained in last year's
expedition, not far from our present position, in 557 fathoms. The Rev. Mr.
Norman notices among the Crustacea new species of Ampelisca and of six
other genera.    Of Echinoderms the pretty Echinus elegans was the most
conspicuous.  We lay-to at nightfall, so as to keep near the same ground.
   6. On the 8th the weather was very fine     but there was not sufficient
                                                         ;
wind to give the necessary driftway for dredging.    Our first attempt in
305 fathoms (Station        2)    was almost   a   failure.   Later in the
                                                                    day dredgings
in 690 fathoms (Station       3)   and about 500 fathoms produced some important
results, viz.      Mollusca   :   Rhynchonella      Sicula,   Seguenza      MS.   (a   Sicilian

 1870.]                            Deep-sea Researches.                         153
fossil),    Pleuronectia    sp. n., Actceon sp. n., besides  Limopsis borealis, L.
aurita, Dentalium       abyssorum, Puncturella     noachina, Hela tenella, Rissoa
Jeffreyri,    Natica   Montaeuti,   Admete viridula, Pleurotoma      carinata,  and
other northern species.         Crustacea : Mr. Norman reports as to the 690
fathoms      (No.  3),  "A    most  important dredging;     the results among the
Crustacea being more valuable than all the rest put together — at any rate
of the First cruise.        It contains almost all the choicest of the new species
in last year's expedition, and four stalk-eyed Crustaceans        of great interest,
three    of which   are new, aud the. fourth   {Geryon trident) is a fine Norwe
gian species."       And he adds that "     with these are associated two forms
of   a more southern character, Inachus        Dorsettensis and Ebalia Cranchii,
which     I should  not have expected at so great a depth." Echinodermata :
Cidaris      papillata (from which, according to Professor Wyville Thomson,
ft hystrix is not specifically distinct), Echinus elegans, Astropecten arcticus,
A. Andromeda, A. Pareli, and A. irregularis. Annelida : Dr. M'Intosh
notices, as a species supposed to be specially northern, Tkelepus circin-
natus of Fabricius from 690 and 500 fathoms. Hydrozoa: a new and beau
tiful tree-like form of a deep orange-colour.        Spongia : Holtenia Carpen-
 teri in considerable numbers and of all ages. Professor Wyville Thomson is
 fully convinced that the H. Grayi of Kent is only a variety of this species.
 The dredges did not fill ; and most of the above results were obtained by
 means of the " hempen tangles," which were in 1 869 for the first time
 attached     to the dredge, and used with such wonderful success.
     7. July 9th. Dredged all day ; but the wind was too light, and the drift
therefore insufficient for effective work. We began dredging in 7 1 7 fathoms
 (Station 4), and afterwards shifted the ground, getting 358 fathoms
 (Station 6), when we left off. This was about 185 miles from Cape Clear
and    Ushant, and     165 miles from the Scilly Isles.   The Fauna was generally
 of a northern character, and included among the Mollnsca Terebratella
Spit zb erg ensis (Arctic and Japanese), Pecten vitreus, P. aratus, Leda per-
nula, Axinus eumyarius, Rissoa turgida, Trochus suturalis (a Sicilian fossil),
 Odostomia nitens (Mediterranean), Taranis M-drchi, Befrancia sp. n., and
 Pleurotoma hispidula or decussata=P. concinnata, S. Wood (Sicilian fos
 sils, the last being Coralline Crag also), Ringicula ventricosa, Actceon sp. n.,
and Bulla propinqua.         Some species were common to the North Atlantic and
 the Mediterranean.         Among the Echinoderms was a fine specimen of Bri-
singa endecacnemos       ; and the Corals were represented by Amphihelia oculata
and Besmophyllum          crista-galli. Among the Annelids were Pista cristata
of O. F.      Muller, and Trophonia glauca of Malmgren, both Arctic species.
    8. We lay-to on Sunday the 10th         ; and the next day we resumed        our
soundings and dredgings on the Channel slope at depths ranging from
257 to 690 fathoms (Stations 8, 9), occasionally changing the ground.
The Fauna was everywhere northern, with a few exceptions. As to the
  Mollusca      may be mentioned Terebratula       septata (intermediate in shape
 between the typical kind and Waldheimia         Floridana),Leda(Toldia)     obtusa,

 154                    Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys on                [Dec. 8,
 Pecckiolia granulata, Trochus suturalis,      T. reticulatus, Rissoa subsoluta
 (the last four Sicilian and Calabrian fossils), Scalaria sp. n., Solarium fa l-
 laciosum, Fusus Bernieiensis, F. fenestratus, Pleurotoma hispidula, and
 Bulla propinqua.        The Crustacea included Oyclaspis longicaudata (Nor
 wegian)   and  Polyeheles typhlops (Mediterranean), besides some new and
peculiar species. A stony Coral of an undescribed genus and species also oc
curred, together with Caryophyllia cyathus, var. clavus. In the evening we
steamed southwards, with a leading wind, for the deepest water in this part
 of the North Atlantic. We were afraid to continue the dredgings on the
 Channel slope towards the French coast, because the submarine telegraph-
cable between     Brest and North America might possibly be iujured, and no
information had been given, or could be obtained, as to the line of its direction.
    9.  July  12.  On reaching the trough in the Bay of Biscay (or rather in
that part of the Atlantic which lies outside the Bay), the sea became too
high and the wind too strong for either sounding or dredging.           This was
from 250 to 300 miles south of the Scilly Isles, and about 200 miles north
of Vigo. Our object was to get a cast in the greatest depth ; and we lay-to
all the day, waiting patiently for the chance of more favourable weather.
But the wind did not take off at sunset, and the prospect did not improve ;
so it was determined not to lose any more time.       At 10.30 p.m. steam was
got up, and we went on towards Vigo. Rain fell at night ; and the sea was
brilliantly illuminated by the phosphorescent Noctiluca and other animals.
Some of these, especially the smaller oceanic Hydrozoa, gave a much
brighter and steadier light than the rest ; so that they might fancifully be
compared to planets among stars. The next day (13th) was fine overhead ;
but there was too much swell to have carried out our intention of dredging
in the deepest water.
    10. Thursday,     July 14, passed Cape Finisterre, and dredged in 81
fathoms (Station      10), about nine miles from the coast of Spain.       Fauna
mostly southern     ;  although Mr. Norman notices among the Crustacea a
new    species of Mysis, and the following British and Norwegian kinds,
Galathea Andrewsi and Grangon nanus ; and Dr. M'Intosh gives Tere-
bellides Stroemii and      Praxilla gracilis, both Norwegian Annelids.        We
then steamed out, and dredged in 332 fathoms (Station 11).           The bottom
was rocky or stony; and the dredge fouled.           On the tangles were two
specimens (one adult and the other young) of that singular Echinoderm,
or soft sea-urchin, belonging to the Diadema family, which was procured
last year in nearly 60 degrees of North Latitude.       It will be soon described
by    Professor   Wyville Thomson     under   the name of Calveria       hystrix.
With this Echinoderm were the arms of Brisinga endecacnemos, and a
specimen of a northern Mollusk, Rissoa Jeffreysi.         Another dredge being
put down on the same ground, was unfortunately lost, with some rope.
    11. The following day (15th) we sounded in 128 and 232 fathoms
(Stations 11, 12) about forty miles from Vigo, but used tangles only in con
sequence of the rocky nature of the bottom. The only noticeable Mollusk

was Rissoa      Jeffrey si ; and we also got an undescribed Polyzoon (Idmonea

 16th. Dredged twice in Vigo Bay, at a depth of about 20 fathoms.                This

M'Andrew's dredging-operations in the spring and autumn of 1849. We
obtained a few species of Mollusca new to this locality ; and two of these
(Tellina     compressa   and Nassa semistriata) are interesting, as having been
described and figured by Brocchi from the Subapennine Tertiaries.                 The
latter species is one of our Crag fossils, under Mr. J. Sowerby's name of
.Buccinum labiosum.          Mr. Busk mentions Lepralia unicornis,        a Polyzoon
previously known as from the Coralline Crag and Italian Pliocene, as well
as Mediterranean.         Vigo was our first anchorage after leaving England ; and
 on Sunday we attended Divine Service, and dined with the late Capt. Bur-
 goyne,    on board his ill-fated     but noble vessel the ' Captain,' which also
 had just arrived, after encountering some rough weather on her way out.
     12. We left Vigo Bay at daybreak on Monday the 18th.              It blew strong
 from the north-east      ; and after going about forty miles westward, and try
 ing in vain to sound, we drifted along till the evening, and then steamed
 slowly in the direction of Lisbon, which was distant about 200 miles. The
 following day (19th) we sounded and dredged at depths of 100 and 220
 fathoms (Station 13) from thirty to forty miles west of Cape Mondego, on
 the coast of Portugal.        The Fauna at the lesser depth was southern and
 local, and at the greater depth comprised the following interesting species
 of Mollusca : — Terebratula cranium, Limopsis borealis, L. aurita, Dent a-
 Hum abyssorum, Trochus amabilis,            T. suturalis, Trophon costifer (Coral
 line Crag), Fusus       antiquus,  monstr.   contrarium, F.fenestratus, and Pleu-
 rotoma carinata.         Among the Foraminifera were specimens of the beau
 tiful Orbitolites tenuissimus (sp. n., Carp.) found last year on the north
 west of Ireland (Report, par. 36), and some other peculiar forms.
     13. Wednesday, July 20th. Dredged all day with considerable success
  at depths of from 380 to 994 fathoms (Stations 14-16), the wind and sea
  having now gone down ; and we took with the scoop-net a few living spe
  cimens of Clio cuspidata.        The dredgings in 380 and 469 fathoms yielded
  among     the  Mollusca    Leda  lucida (Norwegian, and a Sicilian fossil ; pro
  bably included in Philippi's description of Nucula pellucida), Axinus eumy-
  arius (also Norwegian), Necera obesa (Spitzbergen to the west of Ireland),
  Odostomia sp. n., O. minuta (Mediterranean), and Cerithium sp. n. ; and
  among the Echinoderms were Brisinga endecacnemos and Asteronyx Loveni.
  But the results of the Dredging in 994 fathoms were so extraordinary as to
  excite our utmost astonishment.          It being late in the evening, the contents
  of the dredge could not be sifted and examined until daylight the next
  morning.      We then saw a marvellous assemblage of Shells, mostly dead,
  and consisting     of Pteropods, but comprising certain species which we had
  always regarded as exclusively Northern, and others which Mr. Jeffreys
  recognized as Sicilian Tertiary fossils, while nearly forty per cent. of the
  entire number of species were undescribed, and some of them repre

 as well as several other known species in this dredging, are also fossil in
  Sicily.   Nearly all these Shells, as well as a few small Echinoderms, Corals,
  and other organisms, had evidently been transported by some current to
 the spot where they were found ; and they must have formed a thick de
  posit, similar to those of which many Tertiary fossiliferous strata are com
  posed. It seemed probable also that the deposit was partly caused by tidal
  action, because a fragment of Melampus myosotis (a littoral Pulmoni-
  branch) was mixed with deep-water and oceanic Pectinibranchs and La-
  mellibranchs.     None of the shells were Miocene, or of an older period.
     14.  This remarkable collection, of which not much more than one half is
  known to Conchologists, notwithstanding their assiduous labours, teaches
 us how much remains to be done before we can assume that the record of
  Marine Zoology is complete. Let us compare the vast expanse of the sea
  bed  in the North Atlantic with that small fringe of the coast on both sides
 of it which has yet been partially explored, and consider with reference to
 the dredging last mentioned what are the prospects of our ever becoming
 acquainted with all the inhabitants of the deep throughout the globe ! We
 believe, however, that a thorough examination of the newer Tertiaries
 would materially assist us in the inquiry ; and such examination is feasible
 and comparatively easy.       Much good work has been done in this line ;
 but although the researches of Brocchi, Bivona, Cantraine, Philippi, Cal-
  cara, Costa, Aradas, Brugnone, Seguenza, and other able Palaeontologists in
  the South of Italy have extended over more than half a century, and are
  still energetically prosecuted, many species of Molluscous shells are con

fossil in Sicily, and one of them in the Coralline Crag of Suffolk. Pro

Corals, Catnocyathus sp. n., and an undescribed species of an unknown genus
allied to Bathycyathus.   Holtenia Carpenteri and other rare Sponges, with
Brmnga endecacnemos            and various Echinoderms equally interesting, formed
part     of our treasures      but the greatest prize of all was a noble Pentacrinus,
                               ;
about        a   foot long, of which several specimens came up attached to the
tangles.          This discovery of a true Pentacrinus in the European seas crowned
the day's         work.    Mr. Jeffreys has named it P. Wyville-Thotnsoni ; Dr.
Carpenter          will describe    it,

up from  soft mud or ooze, and that its base was entirely free.   Portions
 ofthe arms occurred in several other dredgings on the Lusitanian coasts                     ;
and joints of apparently the same species have been found        Professor         by

      16.    July    22nd.     We tried to dredge among the Berling Isles, but
could        do nothing.       The ground was rocky, and the charts were incorrect.
The sounding-lead was deeply indented, and                 a   water-bottle   torn away and
 lost.       A    dredge   was     afterwards put down twice in        a   trough or gulley

 then steamed for Lisbon, where we arrived the next day.

creased so much that, after fruitlessly endeavouring to dredge, we anchored
in the evening for shelter in Setubal Bay. We there dredged, with no
special result.   Professor Bocage had kindly given us at Lisbon a letter of
introduction to the coast-guard Officer at Setubal, who was said to know
the only place where the deep-sea Shark and the Hyalonema are taken by
the fishermen ; but the state of the weather unfortunately prevented our
availing ourselves of it.
    18. July 26th. Although the wind was rather high and the sea rough,
we contrived (owing      to the admirable management of Captain Calver) to
dredge off Cape Espichel in 740 fathoms (Station 20) ; and later in the
day, having stood out further to sea, in 718 fathoms (Station 22.). Deeper
water is sometimes    found to be near land than at a distance from it. The
Mollusca were mostly of the same kind as those from No. 16 (994 fathoms),
but included Leda pusio, Limopsis pygmaa (Sicilian fossils), and Peechio
lia acuticostata.     The last-named species is extremely interesting in a
geological as well as geographical point of view.         It is a fossil of our
Coralline Crag and the Sicilian pliocene beds ; and it now lives in the
Japanese archipelago.       Some Japanese Brachiopods and Crustacea also
inhabit the Mediterranean.      It may be difficult to account for this migra
tion to or from Northern Asia, except through the Arctic ocean ; but we
would again venture to call attention to the suggestion made by Mr. Jeffreys
as to the communication which probably existed, at a period subsequent
to the Middle Tertiary or Miocene epoch, between the North Atlantic and
the Mediterranean, in the direction of the Languedoc canal or Canal du
Midi, from the Bay of Biscay to the Gulf of Lyons. The Straits of Gibraltar
do not appear to afford the means of such migration or transport of auy
northern Fauna to the Mediterranean, because the current which flows into
it from the Atlantic is superficial only, and does not reach the bottom,
which the Peechiolia inhabits.       This Mollusk has no power of swimming,
like many univalves ; nor does its fry rise to the surface and become for a
 short time oceanic, as in certain species of Trochus and Doliutn.         Any
 current which flows out of the Mediterranean at its bottom into the
 Atlantic would transport the fry of the Peechiolia southwards, or at any
 rate could not withstand the great northern current which brings Arctic
 mollusca to the Lusitanian seas.      Now the greatest height above the sea
 in the line of the Canal du Midi from Bordeaux to Narbonne is stated to
 be 189 metres,   or about 615 feet.     M. Reboul, in his "Me'moire sur les

 recent of the Tertiary period.     No lists of the shells, or any definite par
 ticulars of the deposits, however, have been published by French geologists ;
 and it is to be hoped either that this deficiency will be supplied by them,

of Crustacea belonging to four genera.
    19.  July 27th.    Dredged  a  few miles north of Cape St. Vincent, in 292
and 374 fathoms (Stations 24, 25). Ground rocky ; and in the evening a
dredge, with 400 fathoms of 3-inch rope, was unavoidably lost.            The last
haul yielded two Siliceous or Vitreous Sponges of an enormous size, one of
them measuring nearly 3 feet in diameter at the top, of the kind called
" Neptune's           "                 Setubalense, Kent), besides that lovely
                 Cup     (Askonema
sponge,    Aphrocallistes Bocagei.      The Mollu9ca were mainly northern, and
included fresh-looking fragments of the gigantic Lima excavata, besides
Limopsis minuta (distinct from L. borealis), Pecchiolia acuticostata, P.
granulata, Trochus suturalis, and Pleurotoma hispidula or decussata, all of
which are Sicilian fossils. Two undescribed species of Crustacea, which Mr.
Norman      proposes to name Amathia Jeffrey si and Ethusa mirabilis, were
here obtained.    — At night we steamed slowly south, and doubled Cape St.
Vincent.       The electric telegraph-cable between Falmouth and Gibraltar
sadly hampered our movements in this part of the cruise, by occupying
the ground which we were most desirous of exploring.              It was not con
sidered safe to dredge within eight or ten miles on either side of it. This
was a serious drawback ; since it obliged us to dredge either in water which
is too deep for systematic or continued          exploration, or in comparatively
shallow water near the coast, where the ground is rocky and the dredge
liable to be lost.
    20.  July   28th. Dredged several times off Cape Sagres in from 45 to
 58 fathoms.       Fauna southern.       Venue multilamella, Tellina cotnpressa,
 and   Halia Priamus occurred living ; and Dr. M'Intosh says that two
 Annelids (Glycera capitata and Praxilla pratermissa) had not been
 hitherto observed south of the track in last year's expedition.          The sea
 being rough     and  wind high,  we   anchored  off  Lagos.
    21. July 29th. Steamed south, and dredged in 364 and 322 fathoms
 (Stations 26, 27). The water was of an indigo-blue colour.              Weather
 fine, but rather windy.      For the first dredging 700 fathoms of rope were
 payed    out,  and  two  weights of 100 lbs. were attached at 350 fathoms
 from the dredge. The Mollusca comprised some of the new and remark
 able species procured in Station 16 (994 fathoms) and other dredgings, as
 well as Terebratula vitrea, T. cranium, Pholadomya sp. n., Trochus ama-
 bilis, Pyramidella plicosa (Belgian and Coralline Crag), Tylodina Bubeni
  (Norwegian), Cancellaria mitrceformis, C. subangulosa (both Coralline
 Crag), Pleurotoma galerita, and Actaonpusillus.             The Crustacea of most
 interest were Pagurus platycheles (sp. n.), and an undescribed species of
  Munna.      The Corals were Flabellum distinctum (the same as in Station
  16) and Amphihelia oculata.          The Hydrozoa in 364 fathoms included a
  new and beautiful species of Plumularia.              But the most remarkable
 novelty here obtained was a large collection of thin sandy disks, from 0*3 to

0*4 inch in diameter, with a slight        central prominence ; for these proved
on subsequent      examination to contain an entirely new type of Actinozoon,
extraordinarily flattened in form, and entirely destitute of tentacles.           Dr.
Carpenter, by      whom  this  curious   organism   will be  described, has  assigned
to it  the name    of Ammodiscus Lindahli.
   22.   July 30th. Sounded and dredged at two stations on our way to
Cadiz in 304 and 280 fathoms (Stations 28, 28 a).                   At the first of
these   stations Flabellum     distinction   and   a new   species  of Garyophyllia
occurred.      At the latter station    we got the same undescribed species of
Pholadomya, being       the   second   species known in a recent or living state ;
the other is extremely rare, and West Indian. With the Pholadomya
were Trochus crispulus and Odostomia           plicatula (Sicilian fossils), and Ac
tion exilis, besides undescribed species of Poromya, Mitra, and Mar-
ginella.    Anchored off Cadiz, near H.M.S. 'Cruizer;' where we had
at first some difficulty in being allowed to land, in consequence              of our
not being provided with a bill of health, and there being no surgeon on
board.
   23. Left Cadiz on Tuesday, 2nd August, and steamed west, so as to
get on the seaward side of the provoking cable.           Dredged in 227 and 386"
fathoms (Stations 29, 30).          There was an admixture of northern and
southern species, including a fragment of Fusus antiquus, var. carinata ;
and the Ammodiscus here also presented itself, with a test composed of
coarser sand-grains than before,       and frequently including Foraminifera.
   24. Aug. 3rd. Dredged at three more Stations (31, 32, 33), in 477,
 651, and 554 fathoms, across the entrance to the Straits of Gibraltar, and
towards the Morocco coast ; and we shifted our ground at night.                   The
Fauna was northern, but scanty ; the bottom being stiff clay, and nearly
unproductive.       Undescribed species of Cioniscus and Bulla were among the
Mollusca    ; a  remarkable Sponge, eighteen inches long, which Prof. Wyville
Thomson       considers the type of a new genus allied to Esperia (Ohon-

taken.     Part of a large Ribbonfish (Regalecus gladius) was caught float

bitten off and devoured by a Shark or Swordfish.
   25. Aug. 4th. Dredged again off the Straits and on the coast of Africa
in from 414 to 72 fathoms (Station 34). In the greater depths was the
same stiff and nearly azoic clay ; and in the lesser depths were broken
and dead shells of southern species.          The Fauna in the former was chiefly
northern, and comprised Rissoa          turgida (Norwegian) and Holtenia Car-
penteri. Capt. Spratt suggests that the clayey bottom may have been
formed by continual deposits from the great and muddy rivers Guadal-
quiver and Guadiana.        Such deposits would to a considerable extent inter

    26. Aug. 5th. Steamed into Tangier Bay, after ineffectually trying to
dredge in 1 90 fathoms (Station 37) off Cape Spartel.         The bottom in this
part of the Straits is everywhere rocky ; and there is reason for believing that
it must be swept by the undercurrent in the middle, and by the tide at the
sides.    Sargasso or Gulf-weed was found floating off the Cape.          In Tan
gier Bay we dredged twice at a depth of about 35 fathoms.              Fauna prin
cipally   British, with   a few  more  southern  forms : the last include, among
the Mollusca, Pythina ? Macandrece, Cyclostrema sphceroideum (Coralline
Crag), Rissoa sculpta and R. substriata (Calabrian and Sicilian fossils),
Adeorbis supranitidus (Coralline Crag); and among the Polyzoa, Cupularia
Canariensis, which inhabits Madeira and the Canaries, and occurs in the Co
ralline Crag as well as other tertiaries of the same age. Sphenotrochus inter
medins (a Coralline Crag Coral) was the only other acquisition worth notice.
    27. On the following day (6th August) we arrived at Gibraltar.            Mr.
Jeffreys   was  there   succeeded   by Dr.  Carpenter j  and  the  former went  on
to  Sicily vid Malta, for the purpose of examining the newer tertiary forma
tion in the south of Italy, and the collections of fossil shells at Catania,
Messina, Palermo, and Naples, in connexion with the results of his cruise.
    28. The quantity and variety of Zoological materials is so great that we
have distributed     it  as follows: — Crustacea, Rev. A. M. Norman and Mr.
 George S. Brady ; Polyzoa, Mr. Busk ; Annelida, Dr. M'Intosh ; Corals
 or Stony Anthozoa, Professor Duncan ; Horny or Flexible Anthozoa, Mr.

and the Pentacrinus, Ammodiscus, and Foraminifera by Dr. Carpenter, who
also undertakes to discuss the Physical       results.
    29. Throughout the whole of this Cruise the Temperature of the Sea-
 bottom was taken by the protected Miller- Casella Thermometers in nearly
 every Sounding, with the results tabulated in p. 220.         As, for the reason
 already mentioned (§ 9), no extreme depths were sounded, and as the
 general rate of the diminution of temperature on the margin of the North-
 Atlantic basin seemed to have been established by the Serial Soundings
 taken in the Expedition of the preceding year, it was not thought necessary
 to repeat these ; more especially as the variety of depths at which the
 ItorYoin-temperatures were ascertained gave adequate data for comparison
 with the results then correlated. It will be shown hereafter (§ 79) that this
 comparison leads to some very interesting conclusions, fully confirming the
 view advanced in the last Report (§119) as to the slow northward move
 ment of an upper stratum of warm water 700 or 800 fathoms in depth,
 and   of the southward movement of the whole           deeper  stratum, bringing
 water  of an almost icy coldness frorr the Arctic basin into the Temperate
 and even the Intertropical      Zone.

   30. During the whole of this Expedition the Temperature of the surface
of the Sea was ascertained and recorded every two hours, both by day and
by night ; as were also the readings of the Dry and Wet-bulb Thermo
meters, which were placed in a small penthouse on deck, in which they
were freely exposed to the surrounding Air, but secluded from direct
or reflected Solar heat. — The Temperature of the surface-water, from the
time of our leaving the British Channel in Lat. 48° N. to our turning the
corner of Cape St. Vincent in Lat. 36° 50' N., increased at a rate which bore
a pretty regular proportion to the Southing.         Thus, at the " chops of the
Channel," it averaged 62° for five days ; whilst by the time we approached
Cape St. Vincent it had gradually risen to above 69°. After passing that
point, however, we found both the surface- and the 6o^om-temperatures to
present certain variations, which, though not considerable in themselves,
proved to be of great interest when taken in connection with the peculiar
condition of the embouchure of the Strait of Gibraltar.            These points,
however, will be more fitly discussed hereafter (§ 73 et seq.) ; and we
shall now only notice a sudden rise in Surface-temperature of about 3°
which showed itself as we turned the corner of Cape St. Vincent and
entered the north side of the embouchure, and a sudden fall of nearly
6° (to 66°"4) which was encountered when we entered the mid-stream           of the
narrower part of the Strait as we proceeded towards Gibraltar.
   31. In the course of the First portion of the Cruise between Falmouth
and Lisbon (beyond which point Mr. W. L. Carpenter was unable to pro
ceed), thirty-six quantitative determinations were made, by Volumetric
analysis, of the amount of Chlorine in as many samples of Atlantic water,
taken (1) from the surface, (2) from the bottom at various depths, and
(3) from various intermediate depths. The greater part of these, as will
be shown hereafter    (§ 84), exhibited    a very close conformity to a uniform
standard of density,    as indicated    by a Specific Gravity of 1 '0268, and a
Chlorine proportion of 1 9 "84 per 1 000* ; the chief departures being observ
able in the lower density of the deepest waters, and in the occasional excess
of density in the surface-waters. The former is doubtless attributable to the
fact that the deepest water is essentially Polar, and therefore derives its
more dilute character from that source.           The latter we are inclined to
attribute to the influence of slight concentration by evaporation.

   32. Leaving Gibraltar early in the morning of Monday, Aug. 15, we
steamed out into the middle of the Strait, for the purpose of commencing
our experiments on the Gibraltar Current.           The point selected by Capt.
Calver    (Chart of Strait of Gibraltar, Station 39) lay midway between
Point Carnero, which forms the south-eastern boundary of Gibraltar Bay,

anomalous    at the time, was afterwards fully explained, and proved to be
of unexpected import.      The Temperature fell, at 50 fathoms from the sur
face, to 56°   ;at 100 fathoms   was 55°,7   at 150

that depth to the bottom, at 517 fathoms, there was no further descent.
Now    it   will    be shown hereafter            (§   83) that the thermal condition which
here so much surprised us by its contrast with that                   of the Atlantic waters,
isthat universally met with in the Mediterranean;        the Temperature of
which, whatever  may be its surface-elevation, falls to within 1° Fahr. above
or below 56° at   depth of 50 fathoms, to
                       a                   degree or two lower at 100a
fathoms, and then remains uniform down to the greatest depth (1743
fathoms) at which we examined it.   And   thus appears that whilst the

characterizes that of the Mediterranean                        basin, may be fairly regarded as

   34. This inference    in harmony with another fact ascertained on the
                               is
same occasion, viz. the great excess in Salinity shown by water brought up
from the depth of 250 fathoms over the water of the surface.     Whilst the
Specific Gravity of the latter was found to be     0271, that of the former
                                                                         1

of the water of the Atlantic ; whilst the water at 250 fathoms agreed equally
well with what proved to be the condition of the bottom water in the adja
cent part of the Mediterranean (§ 43). We were not a little surprised,
however, to find that the water here taken from the bottom (517 fathoms)
was of much less density, as indicated both by Specific Gravity and by
Chlorine percentage, than that of the intermediate stratum ; its Specific
Gravity being      1•0281, and its proportion          of Chlorine 21-465.         This ap
parent anomaly        (the existence     of which      was confirmed       by  observations
made on our return voyage, § 61) pointed to the existence of an out -car.
rent in the intermediate stratum as the probable explanation of the over
laying of the lighter by the heavier water.                 The Specific Gravity of the
6o£<o»i-stratum closely correspouded, as we subsequently found, with that
of the bottom-water over the deepest part of the area of the Western basin
of the Mediterranean (§ 93).
    35. These data having been obtained by the examination of the several
parts of the vertical column at one and the same point, and this point
being in the centre of nearly the narrowest part of the Strait, and at the
deepest part of the channel, we proceeded to test the actual movement of
water on the surface and at different depths beneath it.
    36. The rate of «ur/ace-movement was easily determined.                     The precise
 position of the Ship having been ascertained in the manner already stated, a
small fiat basket, presenting no such elevation above the water as would
 cause it to be influenced in any considerable degree by a moderate wind *,
was sent adrift, so as to be freely carried along by the current ; it was
allowed to float for       a determinate time, throughout which it was followed
 by the ship ; and when it was taken up at the expiration of that time, the
 place of the ship was again ascertained as before. The space between the
 two points being then determined trigonometrically, the rate of the flow
 per hour, and its precise direction, could be readily calculated.                  Thus on
 the morning of August 15th the float was followed by the ship for fifteen
 minutes, during which it was found to have moved 4377 feet in the direc
 tion E. by S.    |  S., or at the rate of 2-88 miles per hour (§ 40).
    37. For the determination of the movement                  of the water at different
 depths below the surface, a " current-drag

constructed by Capt. Calver on a plan suggested by his previous experience,
which had led him to the conclusion that a submerged basket lined with
sailcloth, which of course fills itself with water, presents a better resisting
surface than any vessel of wood or metal.                    Such a basket being made
the basis (so to speak) of the apparatus, its resisting surface was aug
mented by fixing two pairs of arms at right angles to one another across
    * It is obvious that the movement    of the Ship itself would   be liable to be consider
 ably affected by even a slight breeze, on account of the large surface of resistance    pre
 sented by its transverse   section (especially by its paddle-boxes) above the water.    This
 would cause its drift    to be more rapid than the current, if the direction of the    wind
 should be with that of the current, and    less rapid if the wind should be opposed to it.

To the lower part of this " drag             couple
of sinkers, of 1 1 2 lbs. each, were attached ;
and the     whole apparatus        was   supported
by    cords   meeting    in  a  ring  above   it, to
which the suspending line was          secured.
    38. This     "current-drag"      having been
transferred to a boat, was lowered down by
a couple of men placed in her, to the de
sired depth ; and the boat was then left
entirely free to move, being lightened by
the return of the men into the ship.            The
motion of the boat would be the composite
result of (1) the action of wind (if any)
upon the transverse section of the part of
of the boat above the water ; (2) the action of the surface-current upon
the transverse section of the immersed part of the boat ; (3) the action of
the upper current upon the suspending line ; and (4) the action of the
current in which the "drag" is suspended upon the drag itself.                   Putting
aside the first of these agencies, which will be of very little account if (as
in the experiment now narrated) the boat be small and the breeze be light,
it is obvious that the relative influence of the second and third to that of
the fourth will depend upon the proportion between the surfaces presented
by the boat, the line, and the "drag" respectively, and the strength of
the current acting upon each.             The surface given to the "drag" being
 larger than that of the boat and line taken together, the force acting on
the "drag" will dominate, if it hang in an opposing current superior,
equal, or even somewhat inferior in rate to that which acts on the boat
and line ; so that the boat would be carried along by the drag against the
surface-stream, at a rate proportioned to the excess. — If, again, the rate of
 the undercurrent should be greatly inferior to that of the surface, its
 action upon the
                     " drag " might still be sufficient to neutralize that of the
 surface-current upon the boat and line, and the boat would then remain
stationary or nearly       so. — A still   further reduction in the rate of the op
 posing undercurrent would make its action upon the
                                                                   " drag " less power
 ful than that of the surface-current upon the boat and suspending line ;
 and   the boat would then move with the surface-current, but at a rate of
which the great retardation would indicate an antagonistic force beneath. —

 Supposing, again, the water of the stratum in which the
 pended   to be stationary, the action of the surface-current upon the boat
  and line would be opposed by the resistance offered by the deeper water

to the movement of the drag ; and the retardation of the movement of the
boat would be less, though still considerable. — If, again, the stratum in which
the  "drag" is suspended should itself be moving in the direction of the
surface-current, but at a reduced rate, there will still be a resistance to the
movement of the "drag" at the more rapid rate of the surface-current ;
and this resistance will produce a proportional retardation in the motion
of the boat. — Finally, if the stratum in which the "drag" is suspended,
with the intermediate stratum through which the suspending line passes,
move at the same rate with the surface-current, the motion of the boat
with the whole suspended apparatus will have the same rate as that of the
simple float.
   39. Putting these respective cases conversely, it may be affirmed (1) that

   tralize the action of the upper stratum on the boat and suspending line.
    And this inference, which was strengthened by the indication already
     shown to he afforded by the extraordinary density of the water of this
     stratum (§ 34), was fully justified by the results of the experiments which
     we made on our return voyage (§ 62).
         4 1 . While these experiments were in progress, we had the pleasure of
     seeing the Channel Fleet, which was expected to meet the Mediterranean
     Fleet at Gibraltar, come in sight beyond Cape Tarifa ; its approach having
     been indicated, long before even the topsof the masts of thevessels composing
     it showed themselves above the horizon, by the number of separate puffs of
     smoke which the experienced eye of our Commander enabled him to dis
     tinguish. As soon as all possibility of doubt was removed by the appearance
     of the     masts, Capt. Calver    communicated        " Fleet in sight
                                                                             "

      the Admiral in Gibraltar Harbour, our position being such that we could
     be seen by him, though the Fleet could not.                In due time, the massive
      hulls of the Ironclads rose above the horizon ; and whilst we continued at
     our work, all passed us in sailing order at a distance of not more than a
      couple of miles, — the ill-fated Captain being the chief object of interest.

      A few hours later, the ' Monarch,' which had been detained for repair, but
     whose passage had been made in a shorter time by the free use of her steam-
       power, came in sight ; and passed on in solitary grandeur to join the
       Fleets now united in Gibraltar Bay.
          42. The whole of our first day having been consumed without our being
      able to work the " current-drag
                                              " in the
                                                         deepest stratum, we anchored for
      the night near Point Carnero, with a view to resuming our experiments on

168                    Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys on                    [Dec. 8,
the following morning.        We then ran out to a spot almost precisely iden
tical with that which had been our starting-point on the previous day ; and
commenced, as before, by testing the rate and direction of the surface-
movement.       Its rate proved rather slower, being 2'40 miles per hour,
instead of 2-88 ; and its direction was E. by N., instead of E. by S.              f S.
 Both differences seemed to be accounted for by the difference in the force
and direction of the wind ; which, having been W. by N. with a force of
4 on the previous day, was now W. £ S. with a force of only 2.                     The
 " drag " was then lowered to a depth of 400 fathoms ; but our expectation
 that it would there encounter a westerly (or outward) current sufficiently
 strong to carry the boat in that direction in spite of the antagonistic move
 ment of the easterly (or inward) surface-current, was not verified on this
 occasion ; for the boat slowly drifted in an E. £ N. direction, its rate being
 0*650 mile per hour. Whether this result should be taken to indicate a
 stationary condition of the deep stratum, or a slight movement in either
 direction (§ 39), could scarcely be affirmed with positiveness ; but from the
 indication afforded by the Specific Gravity of the water taken up from this
 depth (§ 34), it seemed probable that the general movement of this
 stratum was at this time rather westerly, or in conformity with that which
 we attributed to the intermediate stratum, though at a slower rate. — It will
 be shown hereafter (§ 62) that a decisive proof of such a movement was
 obtained on a subsequent occasion.
     43. Thinking it expedient to postpone the further prosecution of this
 inquiry until our return voyage, — when we should be able to repeat our
 experiments, not only at this narrow end of the Strait, but also at that
  shallowest portion to the westward where the Strait opens out into the
  Atlantic, — we put    steam on before mid-day, and entered        the basin  of the
  Mediterranean,    directing our course in the first instance to the spot (Lat.
  36° 0'  N., Long. 4° 40' W.)     at which the sample of bottom- water had been
  obtained by Admiral Smyth, which, when analyzed by Dr. Wollaston, was
  found to possess the extraordinary Specific Gravity of 1-1288, and to yield
  a percentage of 17*3 of Salt *.       As we were within sight of both shores,
  and could distinguish several remarkable mountain-summits which were
  accurately laid down on our Charts, the bearings of these enabled the situa
  tion of the Ship to be determined with great precision ; and Capt. Calver
  undertook to place her within a mile of the point at which Admiral Smyth's
  observation had been taken. Having reached this (Station 40) we took our
  first Sounding in the Mediterranean ; and awaited the result with no little
  interest.   The depth proved to be 586 fathoms, or 84 fathoms less              than
  that given by Admiral Smyth's sounding ; but as the latter was not            taken
  on the improved method now adopted, and as its correctness may have not
  improbably been affected by the strength of the easterly current which is
  here very perceptible, the discrepancy can scarcely be considered as of any
   real account as showing that the two points were otherwise than nearly

was found to have a Specific Gravity of 1-0292, whilst that of the surface-
water was I "0270.           The volumetric determination of the Chlorine gave
21-419 per 1000 for the bottom-water, as against 20-290 per 1000 for the
surface-water.         A decided excess of salt is thus indicated in the bottom-
water, as compared         on the one hand with the surface-water of the same
spot,    and  on  the    other  with the bottom-water of the Atlantic, which had
been generally found to show a rather smaller proportion of Chlorine than
the surface-water.         But this excess is extremely small in comparison with
that indicated by Dr. Wollaston's analysis.                  For, assuming his factor of
¦134 as representing, when multiplied                 by  the  excess of Specific Gravity
above that of distilled water, the total percentage of Salt, that percentage
is only 3*91, instead of 17*3 as stated by Dr. Wollaston.
     44. This result accorded so closely with that obtained by Dr. Wollaston
himself from the analysis of two other samples of bottom-water taken up
by Admiral Smyth, the one in Long. 1° 0' E. from a depth of 400 fathoms,
 and the other in Long. 4° 30' E. from a depth of 450 fathoms, — as well as
 with our own determinations of the Specific Gravities and Chlorine per
 centages of a great number of samples taken in different parts of the
 Western basin of the Mediterranean, — that we cannot hesitate in regarding
 it as representing the ordinary condition of the bottom-water at this spot.
 And it seems to us far more probable that the sample furnished by Admiral
 Smyth to Dr. Wollaston had been concentrated by evaporation in a badly
 stopped bottle, in the three years during which it had remained in Admiral
 Smyth's possession, than that any extraordinary discharge of salt from a
 brine-spring at the bottom (a sort of Dens ex machind invoked by Admiral
 Smyth to account for the occurrence) should have given rise, in the spot
 at which his Sounding was taken, to an exceptional condition of which no
  indication whatever was presented in our own.
      45. The Temperature-phenomena presented at this Station proved of
  singular interest.       The »ur/ace-temperature, 74°-5, was higher than any
  that had been encountered on the Atlantic side of the Straits, even in a
  latitude half a degree further south ; and the observations, which had been
  regularly taken every two hours, showed that it had increased nearly ten
  degrees as we proceeded eastwards from                 Station 39, between 10 a.m. and
  2 p.m.      A part of this increase was doubtless due to the heating effect of
  the mid-day sun ; but as the temperature of the air had not increased quite
  six degrees during the same time, and as it will be shown hereafter (§ 86),
      * Thus Admiral Smyth states (Mediterranean, p.                 the depth in mid-channel
                                                               159)

  little more than 500 fathoms.       " A little further to the eastward," he       " there is no
                                                                              says,

  the greatest depth as far east as Malaga Bay is now known not to exceed 750 fathoms.
  These errors are noticed in no invidious spirit, but merely to prevent their perpetua
   tion.  Admiral Smyth     doubtless   made the very best use of the means at his disposal ;
   but a far more satisfactory  method has now entirely superseded that formerly adopted.

 by a comparison of the diurnal averages of the surface-temperature of the
 Mediterranean with those of the Atlantic, that the latter are at least four
 or five degrees higher than the former, it may be fairly assumed that at
 least half the increase was due to the passage from the colder Atlantic
 water of the mid-channel into the warmer water of the Mediterranean
 basin, the temperature of the latter being even here somewhat reduced by
 the inflow of the former. — The iottom-temperature was found to be here
 55° ; and this corresponded closely with that which we had met with in
 the Strait (§ 32), while it was at least 5° higher than had been obtained at
 corresponding depths on the Atlantic side.     Being desirous of determining
 the rate of its diminution, we took serial soundings at intervals of
 10 fathoms  down to 50, and then at 100 fathoms, with the following                              re

It will be observed that       the surface-temperature varied between 69°"5 and
74°*5 ; and     that whilst the highest temperatures were shown at Stations
ue&r the African Coast, the lowest presented itself between Cape de Gat
and Cartagena.         Now the Gibraltar inflow is very sensibly felt at Cape
de   Gat, where the current usually runs at the rate of a mile an hour ; and
of the strength of this current we had unpleasant experience. For on the
 19th of August, as we were crossing from Station 46 towards the Spanish
coast, we encountered a strong             N.E.  breeze, which, meeting the current,
 worked up a considerable swell          ;   this prevented us from taking even a
 Temperature-sounding on that day, and gave our Ship a peculiar twisting
 or screwing movement, from which we were glad to escape by the subsi
 dence of the breeze during the following night.                  During this day the
 Surface-temperature of the Sea came down from the average of 72°-2, which
 it had maintained on the 18th, to (Hi •!). Had the weather been calm we
 might have attributed this reduction to the colder Gibraltar in-current ;
 but as the average temperature of the Air also fell from 73°-8 to 69c-8, and
 as  the strong N.E. breeze must have had a cooling effect upon the surface
 of the sea, we should have deemed it probable that the reduction of Surface-
 temperature was due at least as much to the latter as to the former of these
 causes, had    it not   been   that a set of Serial soundings which we took at
 Station 47 showed that the reduction extended very far down, as will be
 apparent on comparing the following results with those given in § 45 :

 It will  be seen hereafter that the observations made           on our return voyage
 gave    more  distinct   evidence  of   the   cooling  influence  of the Gibraltar in.-
 current(§ 86).
    48.   At most of   these Stations we explored the bottom by means            of the
 Dredge, with results much less profitable than we had anticipated.             Except

 172                 Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys      on            [Dec.   8»
 near the Coast, on either side, where the ground was rocky and unequal,
 the bottom was found everywhere to consist of a tenacious mud, composed
 of a very fine yellowish sand mixed with a bluish clay, — the former pre
 dominating in some spots, tbe latter in others.       Large quantities of  this
 mud were laboriously sifted, often without yielding any thing save a        few
 fragments of Shells, or a small number of Foraminifera ; and in no instance
 was it found to contain any considerable number of living animals of any
 description.   Our disappointment at this unexpected paucity of life was not
small ; and it was destined, as will hereafter appear, to continue through
the whole of our Dredging-exploration of the deeper portions of the Medi
terranean basin. The operation of Dredging in the shallower portions
nearer shore was rendered difficult by the rocky nature of the bottom, on
 which the dredge continually " fouled ;
                                           " and after the loss of two more
dredges and a considerable quantity of rope, Capt. Calver came to the
conclusion that the    " tangles " only should  be used where the inequality of
the soundings indicated danger to the Dredge.        Now the " tangles," whilst
gathering Polyzoa, Echinoderms, Crustacea, and the smaller Corals, some
times even better than the Dredge, pick up but few Shells ; and hence our
collection of Mollusca is altogether a scanty one.    Nevertheless many of the
types we did obtain were of considerable interest.     Thus at Station 45, at a
depth of 207 fathoms, we got Turbo Romettensis, Seguenza, MS. (Sicilian
fossil); Scalaria plicosa (Sic. foss.); Odoatomia obliquata,Ph. ; Philine, two
undescribed species ; and an interesting Coral (Dendrophyllia corrugosa).
    49. On the afternoon of Saturday, Aug. 20th, we anchored in Cartagena
Bay, in which we got Taranis Mbrchi, Malm (northern), and Pleurotoma
decussata, Ph. (Sic. and Cor. Cr. foss.).     We left this harbour on the fol
lowing Monday morning, and proceeded to a point (Station 48) at which we
expected to find deeper water than any we had previously sounded in this
year's work.    Bottom was here struck at 1328 fathoms ; and its tempera
ture, 540,7, proved still conformable to the uniform standard previously ob
served.    The density of the water was not as great as we had found it on a
shallower bed, its Specific Gravity being 1 '0282, and its proportion of Chlo-
rine2r32. The specimen ofthe bottom brought up by the Sounding-appa
ratus was not promising ; and when the dredge was hauled in, filled with
stiff mud, but without any sign of Animal life, we experienced the truth of
the beatitude
                " Blessed are they who expect nothing, for they shall not
be disappointed."      Large quantities of this mud were washed and sifted
without yielding more than a few comminuted fragments of shell ; and we
were reluctantly driven to the conclusion that there was "nothing in it."
The like result attended the exploration we made the next day at another
Station (49), where we found the depth to be 1412 fathoms, and the
Temperature and Density of the bottom-water to be almost exactly the
same as at the last Station.     We then steamed towards the Algerine Coast,
and took a dredging in shallow water 5-5 1 fathoms, which gave us a few
Shells of considerable interest : — Venus multilamella,      Lamarck (Monte

1870.]                         Deep-sea Researches.                          173
Mario foss.) ; Solarium pseudoperspectiwm, Brocchi (Sic. foss.) ; Mitra
zonula, Marryat (Sic. foss.) ; Mytilus incurvatug, Ph. (Sic. foss.) ; Sportella
Cailleti, Conti (Monte Mario foss.).
   50. During the night we again steamed out into Deep water, and on the
morning of Aug. 26th found at Station 45        a depth of 1415 fathoms, with
a  bottom-temperature      of 54°-7.   The  Density of the Bottom- water was
almost exactly the same as that of the two previous deep-water samples.
Our dredging was here more successful, the following species of Mollusca
being obtained: — Nucula, sp. n. (quadrata) ; N. pumila, Asbjornsen (north
ern) ; Leda, sp. n. (Portuguese also) ; Pecchiolia granulata, Seg. (Sic.
foss.); Hela tenella, Jeffr. (northern, and Sic. foss.); Trochus gemmu-
latvs, Ph. (Sic. foss.) ; Rissoa subsoluta, Aradas (Sic. foss.) ; Natica affinU,
Gmelin (northern, and Sic. foss.) ; Trophon multilamellosus, Ph. (Sic.
foss.) ; Nassa primnatica, Br. (Sic. foss.) ; Columbella haliceeti, Jeffr.
(northern, and Sic. foss.), 1=Buccinum acuticostatum, Ph. ; Pleurotoma
carinata, Cristofori and Jan (northern, and Sic. foss.) ; P. torquata, Ph.
(Sic. foss.) ; P. decussata, Ph. (Sic. foss.) ; Planorbis glaber, Jeffr. (fresh
water !) ; Spinalis physdides, Forbes, =£. recurvirostra, A. Costa.
   5 1 . Directing our course again towards the Algerine Coast, we kept nearly
parallel to it during the greater part of the next day, occasionally sweeping
the bottom with the " tangles," which gave us abundance of Polyzoa,
Echinoderms, &c. of well known types, without any specimens of novel or
peculiar interest, except (at Station 50, in 7-51 fathoms) a specimen of
Trochus biangulatus, Eichwald, fide Homes, = T. ditropis, S. -Wood, a Mio
cene and Coralline Crag shell. We reached Algiers on the afternoon of the
26th ; and as it was necessary to take in coal, we remained in harbour until
the 29th, when we resumed our easterly course, still keeping near the Coast.
The weather now began to be oppressively hot, the Surface-temperature of
the Sea rising to 76° or 78°, and that of the Air being often several degrees
higher.     Wishing to see what would be the point at which the effect of
this extreme superheating would cease to manifest itself, we took a set
of Serial soundings at Station 53, with the following result, which we in
cline to consider typical of the condition of the proper Surface-water of
the Mediterranean     in the Summer    season : —
                                                   0
                                                     Fahr.
                           Surface                   77
                             5 fathoms               76
                           10     „                  71
                           20     „                  61-5
                           30     „                  60
                           40     „                  57-3
                           50     „                  56-7
                          100     „                  55-5
 Thus the amount of heat lost in the first 20 fathoms is no less than 15°-5 ;
 and as much as 9°-5 of this loss shows itself between 10 and 20 fathoms.

   174                 Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys on                      [Dec.  8,
  Somewhat nearer the shore, at       a  depth of from 40 to 80 fathoms, we got
  the following Mollusca    : — Pecchiolia,Bp.   n. (Sic. foss.) ; Solarium pseudo-
  perspectivum (Sic. foss.) ;    Nassa semUtriata, Brocchi (Sic. foss., and Co
  ralline and Red Crag)=Ar. labiosa, S. Wood,         =N. tri/asciata, H. Adams ;
  and Bulla, sp. n.
     52. Again proceeding into deep water we perseveringly explored the
  bottom with the Dredge; and from a bottom of 1508 fathoms we brought
  up some hundredweights of the same barren mud as had previously given
  so much trouble and to so little profit.         The sieve and the washing-tub
  again returned for answer "barren all."           Disappointing as this negative
  result was to us as Zoologists, there are aspects under which it may be
  viewed that may give it no small value to Geologists.          On these, however,
  we can more fittingly enlarge hereafter (§ 102).         Once more, shifting our
  ground a few miles, we put down our dredge in 1456 fathoms' water, and
  brought it up loaded with a similar profitless freight.
     53. We now determined to keep closer to the Shore, and worked for
 several days along the   African Coast, for the most part using the      " tangles,"
 the   ground being too rocky for the dredge.          Here we came upon a small
 fleet of Coral-fishers ; and were not a little interested in finding that they
 employed
             "  tangles" similar to our own as their most effective method of
 collecting.    We swept the shore with these very assiduously, usually be
 tween 50 and 100 fathoms; and although we obtained Polyzoa, Echioo-
 derms, and Corals in considerable abundance, there were not many of
 special interest.    We may note, however, that several of the Polyzoa
 which occurred in the region in which the Red Coral is found, had, when
 fresh, a red colour nearly as brilliant as that by which it is characterized ;
 but this colour, in the Polyzoa, was quite evanescent.           At Station 55 we
 obtained the following Mollusca : — Leda acuminata, JefFr. (Sic. foss.),
 Dentalium abytsorum, Sars (northern), and Turritella aubangulata, Brocchi
 (Sic. foss.).
    54. The    extreme  heat of the weather having produced an exhausting
 effect upon our crew, especially on the engineers       and stokers, Capt. Calver
considered it desirable to give them rest ; and we accordingly made for the
 Bay of Tunis, which we reached at mid-day on Saturday, Sept. 3rd.
The town itself is situated at the head of a shallow lagoon or salt-lake,
that communicates with the sea by a narrow channel ; and at this entrance
there is   a  small sea-port named the Goletta, having a basin for vessels of
moderate size.      The lake, although about six miles long, has only from
six to seven feet of water at its deepest part ; and when the water is un
usually low, a small Steamer, which plies between the Goletta and Tunis,
is not always able to run, as happened at the time of our visit.           Owing to
the great evaporation, and the absence of any stream of fresh water, the
water of this lake is usually very salt ; but when heavy rains fall, the
level is considerably raised, and the saltness is diminished.              Thus the
condition of this lake in regard to that of the sea outside is sometimes that
of  (he Mediterranean    in regard   to that  of the Atlantic (§ 122), and     some

  times that of the Baltic towards the German Ocean     (§ 123) ; and we would
  suggest whether it might not be possible, through our Consulate (which
  has an office at the Goletta), to have a regular series of observations made
  upon the relative densities of the water of the lake and that of the sea, and
  upon the direction of the upper and under current in the channel of com
  munication between them, that might furnish valuable data for the com
  plete elucidation of the subject of currents occasioned by excess of evapo
  ration. We availed ourselves of this short rest to visit the town of Tunis,
  which, for the most part, retains its genuine Moorish characters ; as well as
  the ruins of Carthage, a few miles off, the most remarkable part of which
 consists of a series of immense reservoirs for water, supplied by an aque
 duct that brought it from a range of mountains at no great distance,
 from which also the modern town of Tunis is supplied.
     55. Quitting Tunis at mid-day on Tuesday Sept. 6, we resumed our
 Dredging-explorations    on more productive ground, — -the shallow between
 the Eastern and Western basins of the Mediterranean, that extends between
 the African coast and Sicily, and is termed the "Adventure Bank," from
 having been first discovered by Admiral Smyth when surveying in H.M.S.
 *Adventure.'      The depths   here  range from about 30 to 250 fathoms.
 When passing Cape Bon, we fell in with another small fleet of Italian Coral-
 fishers ; and were surprised at the large outlay incurred for such small re
 turns as they seemed to be obtaining. We here found, between 25 and
 85 fathoms, the following species of Mollusca : Trochus mturalis, Ph.
 (Sic. foss.) ; Xenophora crispa, Konig (Sic. foss.) ; Cylichna striatula,
 Forb. (Sic. foss.) ; C. ovulata, Brocchi (Sic. foss.). And seven miles off
 the point called Rinaldo's Chair, between 60 and 160 fathoms, we obtained
 TeUina compressa, Brocchi (Sic. foss.), a species possessing the following
 synonyms. — Tellina striatula, Calcara ; T. strigilata, Ph. ; Psammobia
  W*einkauffi, Crosse ; and Angulus Macandrei, Sowerby : also an interesting
 Annelid, Praxilla      prcetermissa, Malmgren (northern). Here, again, we
 brought up a great abundance of Polyzoa ; and many of these have proved
 of great interest. One, in particular, of a beautiful, very open reticular plan
 of growth, is the type of a new genus, of which another species had been
previously obtained by Mr. Busk from the Canary Islands, and which he will
 describe under the name of Climacopora.      Many of the species obtained had
 been previously known only as Tertiary Fossils. A complete account of them
will be published by Mr. Busk hereafter. Abundance of Shells were here
found ; among them we obtained a considerable number of living specimens
 of Megerlia truncata, including a whole series in various stages of growth, the
youngest of which presented a very remarkable character, — a set of seta pro
jecting from the margin of the shell, the length of which exceeded its own
long diameter. Among other species of interest were : — Kellia, sp. n. (Sic.
 foss.); Gadinia excentrica, Tiberi; Rissoa, sp.n.; Scalaria frondosa, J. Sow.
 (Sic.&Cor.Cr.foss.) ; Odostomia unifasciata, Forbes ; Pyramidella p-licosa,

sillui, Forb. (Sic. foss.). Among the Annelida was an interesting Northern
form, llyallnmcia tubicola, Miiller.      The Echinodermata were in consider
able abundance,    but were mostly well-known Mediterranean types. The
Cidaris hystrix was especially frequent ; and a comparison of the series
of specimens obtained in this and the preceding Cruise, with those obtained
last year in the Northern area, has enabled Prof. Wyville Thomson to
satisfy himself that C. hystrix, C. papillata, and C. affinis are specifically
identical.     The Corals found on the Adventure Bank have proved peculi
 arly interesting; and will be the subject of a special Report by Prof. Duncan.
 Among the Uydrozoa were two undescribed species of Aglaophenia.                 Al
 though    no  new  Foraminifera    here  presented   themselves,   yet it was very
 interesting to obtain (as we had previously done at several points on the
 African coast) specimens of the beautiful Orbitolites tenuissimus first dis
 covered last year in the Atlantic (Report, § 36), of which we had ventured
 to predicate the existence in the Mediterranean from having discovered an
 extremely minute fragment of it in one of Captain Spratt's jEgean dredg-
 ings ; also peculiarly large and elaborately finished specimens of the great
                                                             "
 Nautiloid Lituola, first met with last year, the " test of which is built up
 of sand-grains united by a ferruginous cement, with passages extending
 from the principal chambers into their walls, forming what is known as the
 " labyrinthic structure," of which the greatest development is found in the
 two gigantic Fossil types (Parkeria       and Loftusia) recently described      by
 Dr. Carpenter and Mr. H. Brady*.
      56. This part of our work having brought us to the neighbourhood of
 the Island of Pantellaria, we landed on it with the view of visiting, if pos
 sible, a cavern which had the reputation of being "of icy coldness."            As
 we found, however, that a whole day's delay would be involved, we gave
 up the idea ; and we afterwards obtained elsewhere the information we de
  sired (§ 89). — The continuance of the very hot weather having brought a
  large part of our Crew to a state of such exhaustion as to render a con
  tinuation of our operations undesirable, Captain Calver considered it ex
  pedient to proceed to Malta without further delay ; and we anchored in the
   Harbour of Valetta on the morning of Saturday, Sept. 10th. Here we
  found it necessary to remain for ten days, the illness of our Chief Engineer,
  which we at first hoped might be only temporary, proving sufficiently
  serious to require that a substitute should be found for him.            Our time
  was passed very pleasantly in visits to the various objects of interest in
  which the Island abounds, and in the enjoyment of the kind hospitality of
  His Excellency the Governor, Vice- Admiral Key, and other Officers             The
   time was too short for any careful examination of the Geology of the
   Island ; but one point which struck us as of special interest in relation to
  the deposit at present forming on the Mediterranean          bottom will be spe
   cially noticed hereafter (§ 102).
       57. As the instructions which we received at Malta required us to

 proceed   homewards     without unnecessary delay, and as Capt. Calver was
 desirous of avoiding, if possible, the necessity of going into port for coal
 between Malta and Gibraltar, we found ourselves obliged to relinquish the
hope we had entertained of being able to resume our Dredging-explora-
 tions in deep water along a different line on our return voyage.         But, de
 siring to gain what addition we could to the information already acquired
 respecting the Physical condition of the Mediterranean, we arranged so to
shape our course on leaving Malta as to enable us ( 1 ) to obtain a deep
Sounding in the Eastern basin, and (2) to ascertain the Bottom-tempera
ture on an area of Volcanic activity.
    58. Quitting ValettaT Harbour at mid-day on September 20th, we
steered in a N.E. direction towards a point about 70 miles distant, at
which a depth of        1700  fathoms was marked on the Chart.            This we
reached early the next morning (Station 60) ; and a Sounding being taken,
 1 743 fathoms of line ran out.        As this was the greatest depth we had
anywhere met with in the Mediterranean, and as the Basin in which the
Sounding was taken is cut off by the shallows between Sicily and Tunis
from all but superficial communication with the Western basin, we watched
the heaving in of the Sounding-apparatus and its accompaniments with no
little interest.    The Thermometers recorded a Temperature of 56°, which
was one degree higher than that which we had met with in our two deepest
Soundings (1456 and 1508 fathoms) in the Western basin. The sample
of the bottom brought up in the tube of the Sounding-apparatus indicated
the prevalence of a yellowish clayey deposit so similar to that which had
 elsewhere proved so disappointing, that we could not feel justified in pres
sing Capt. Calver for the sacrifice of nearly a whole day, which would have
been required for a single cast of the Dredge at this depth.            The speci
men of Bottom-water brought up by          our Water-bottle   surprised us by its
very small excess of Density above the Surface-water ; the Specific Gravity
of the former being only l-0283, whilst that of the latter was 1-0281 ; and
the proportion of Chlorine per 1000 being 2T08 in the former, whilst that
of the latter    was  20*77.    The Surface-water being   here   more dense than
 the average,   the Bottom-water     was less dense — a result which a good deal
surprised us at the time, but which subsequent comparison         with the densi
ties  of specimens taken from the greatest depths we had sounded in the
Western basin (§ 93) showed to be by no means exceptional ; and when
we came to reason out the mode in which surface-evaporation may be pre
sumed to operate in augmenting the density of the water beneath, we found
it to be quite in accordance with d priori probability, that the deepest
water should show the least excess of density above the water at its sur
face   (§94).
    59. Having thus satisfied ourselves, so far as we could do by a single
set of observations, that the Physical conditions which we had found to
prevail in the Western basin of the Mediterranean present themselves also
in the Eastern,      we steered   for the Coast of Sicily ;  and in   a few hours

We    steamed quietly along the Sicilian coast during the night, so that
sunrise the next morning found us in the narrowest part of the Strait of

                                           ;

the once-dreaded Charybdis, the dangers of which are rather poetical than
real, and leaving on our right the picturesque castle-crowned rock of
Scylla, we passed out of the

extremity to about      miles, into the open sea to the North of Sicily,

10 a.m. to take     Sounding (Station 61). This gave us

water scarcely in excess of that of the Surface-water     and   ; was evenit
lower than that of the Surface-water in another Sounding taken somewhat
further on (Station 62), and at the depth of 730 fathoms, which gave a
Bottom-temperature of 55°-3.

                                                                ;
inclined to attribute    to the decrease of surface-evaporation consequent
                         it
upon the marked decrease in the heating-power of the Sun, which showed
 itself in the change of the relative Temperatures of the Sea and Air for         ;
 whilst, for some days before we put into Malta, the Surface-temperature of
 the Sea had ranged between    6° and 78°, and the Temperature of the Air had
                               7
 been usually about 1° higher,    we now found that while the Surface-tem
 perature of   the  Sea ranged between  73°-6 and 76°-6, the Temperature of
 the Air was between 2° and 4° lower.      This difference continued to show
 itself nearly  all the way to Gibraltar   the daily averages of the Surface-
                                           ;

 the temperature of the Air ranged between 68°-5 and 72°.          We now ap
 proached the rugged cone of Stromboli, from the summit         of which there
 was constantly issuing, — as has been the case since the time when the neigh
 bouring island of Hiera was fabled to be the workshop of Vulcan,
                                                                     — cloud     a

   of smoke, indicative of active changes in the molten depths beneath.         Of
   this activity, however, we had found no special indication in the Tempera
   ture-soundings taken nearest to the island. Whether the general prevalence
   in the neighbourhood of Sicily of a Bottom-temperature averaging about
   a  degree above that of the Western part of the Mediterranean is due
   to Subterranean     heat, is a question which can only be determined by a
   larger number of observations than we had the opportunity of making.
   As we neared Stromboli, we were much struck with the height to which the
   energetic industry of its inhabitants had carried the vine-cultivation all
  round the cone, save on two slopes looking N.W. and S.E., over one or
  other of which there is a continual discharge of volcanic dust and ashes.
  Although no flames were visible during daylight, we could distinctly per
  ceive occasional flashes as night came on. — Our course was now laid straight
  for Cape de Gat, which we passed on the 27th of September, arriving at
  Gibraltar on the evening of the 28th. The only Scientific observations
  which we had the opportunity of making during this part of our voyage
 were confirmatory of those which we had made at the commencement of
 our Mediterranean Cruise, as to the lower Temperature and inferior Den
 sity of the Surface-water, both which we attribute to the inflow from the
 Atlantic.      (See §§ 86, 92).
     61. Having taken in at Gibraltar as much coal as we could carry, we
 left the harbour at 9 a.m. on the 30th Sept., and proceeded at once towards
 the   scene   of our previous observations.   We thought it worth while, how
 ever, to take     a Sounding in our way towards this, near the 100-fathom line
 (Station    63),  for the sake of ascertaining the Temperature and Specific
 Gravity of the bottom-water.        The depth was found to be 181 fathoms,
 showing that the      slope from the shallow to the deep portion  of the channel
 is here very rapid.       The bottom-temperature was   54°-7, that of the surface
 being 68°; and the Specific Gravity of the bottom-water was 1•0280, that
 of the surface being 1*027 1 . This bottom-water thus agreed closely in both
particulars with that of the deep mid-channel, as ascertained in our first
set of observations (§ 34), which were afterwards confirmed by our second.
We then steamed out to a point (Station 64) nearly identical with
that from which our previous investigations had been carried on ; and
commenced our work with a Temperature-sounding.              The surface-tempe
rature (65°-6) proved to be here less by 2°-4 than it had been found to be
at Station 63 ; and this although it was taken     an hour later in the forenoon,
when an increase might have been expected.          It thus corresponded closely
with what had been previously found to be the average temperature of the
Strait in mid-channel, both during the first approach to Gibraltar from the
westwards (§ 30), and during our own experiments at the commencement
of the Mediterranean Cruise (§ 32) ; and the continuation of the like ob
servations during the remainder of the day and ensuing night (§ 65) gave the
same remarkable result, the rationale of which will be considered hereafter
(§ 74). The depth was somewhat less than at the neighbouring Station 39,
                                                                    Q 2

being 4C0 fathoms instead of 517 ; but the bottom-temperature was a little
lower, being 54°' 7 instead of 55°5.  The respective Specific Gravities of
the Surface- and Bottom-waters, and of that of the Intermediate stratum of
250 fathoms, were found to coincide almost exactly with those previously
determined, as the following comparative statement shows : —

     Now the density of the fio«o»t-water      corresponds so exactly with
                                                  here
that which prevails over the deeper bottom of the Western basin of the
Mediterranean, whilst it so considerably exceeds that of the bottom- as well
as   of the ««r/ace-water of the Atlantic, thatwe cannot fail to recognize it
as belonging to the  Mediterranean   basin ; so that, if it has any motion at
all, we should expect that motion to be from east to west.     Still more cer
tainly may this  be affirmed  of the  intermediate   stratum,  the density of
which corresponds with that of the bottom-water of the shallower part of
the Mediterranean basin    the greatest depth (586 fathoms) at which such
                               ;
water was obtained being at Station 40, the nearest point to the Strait from
which a specimen of bottom-water was obtained (§ 43).        And it may be
further predicated that a stratum of water of a density of 1029*3 could not
overlie water of the density of 1028-1, unless it moved over the stratum
below,— that is, unless (1 ) the two strata were moving in opposite directions,
or (2) were moving at different rates in the same direction, or (3) the upper
stratum were in motion in either direction, and the lower stratum were
stationary. It will presently appear that the second of these conditions is
the one which obtains in the present case.
   62. We now proceeded to repeat our experiments with the
                                                                  " current-
drag," with the view of obtaining, if possible, unequivocal evidence of the
existence of that Westerly undercurrent which so many considerations
combined to render probable. — The direction of the Wind during this set
of experiments was from the East, or opposite to that of the surface-current ;
and its force (3 to 4) was sufficient, by its meeting the current, to produce
aconsiderable swell, which necessitated the employment of a larger boat,
and rendered it unsafe to allow her to drift without men. The sectional
area   of the boat   was therefore greater than on the former occasion,giving
the in-current              hold upon her; but, on the other hand, the
                    a stronger
surface she presented to the wind was also greater ; and as this acted in
the opposite direction, the latter increase might be considered to neutralize
the former, or even rather to exceed           it,
                                              so as to render the boat more
capable of being carried westwards       the " current-drag,"

 acted on by an outward undercurrent.           The      rate   of surface-movement    was
 tested as before    (§   36), and proved to be   1   -823 mile per hour, its direction

      being    N.E. by E. £ E. This was a retardation of more than a mile per
      hour,  as compared with the former observation ; and that it was not attri-
     butable   to the mere surface- action of the easterly wind, was clear from the
    result of the next observation, which showed that the retardation extended
   to a depth /ar below the influence of surface-action. — The "current-drag"
  having     been lowered to 100 fathoms' depth, the drift of the boat was
  reduced     to 0"857 mile per hour, or less than half its surface-drift ; its
 direction     was nearly the same as that of the surface-current, viz. E. by
 N. j N.      The    "   current-drag
                                        " was then lowered to a
                                                                   depth of 250 fathoms ;
and in    a short time the         boat was seen to be carried along by it in a direction
(W.N.W.)         almost exactly        opposite to that of the middle in-current of the
Strait.     The rate        of   outward   movement      of the boat was 0--100 mile per
                                             Station 04.

    Wit ; but from the considerations formerly stated (§ 39), it is clear that
     the actual rate of the undercurrent must have exceeded that of the boat
      on the   surface.  — The   "current drag" was then lowered down to a depth of
      400   fathoms    ;  and again the boat was carried along in nearly the same
       direction as in the previous experiments, namely N.W. £ N. ; but more
      slowly, its rate of movement being 0'300 mile per hour.
          63. Thus, then, our previous deductions were now justified by a con
      clusive    proof that   there  was at this    time a return-current    in the mid-
      channel of this narrowest part of the Strait, from the Mediterranean
     towards the Atlantic, flowing beneath the constant surface-stream from
     the Atlantic into the Mediterranean ; and it will be shown hereafter
     (§ 115), by a comparison of all the results of our observations, that a
    strong presumption may be fairly raised for the constant existence of such
    a return-current, though its force and amount are liable to variation.
          64. As the determination of the boundaries of this return-current, and
     of the amount and conditions of its variation, could only be effected by
    multiplied simultaneous observations at different points, with ample license
     as to time, neither of which fell within the scope of the present Expedi
     tion, we were obliged to content ourselves, as regards this locality, with
    what we had found ourselves able to accomplish ; and at the conclusion of
     this    day's work we proceeded      westwards under easy steam, so as to be able

  to resume our experiments the next morning in the shallowest part of the
  Strait.
     65. The average Surface-temperature of the Mid-stream during our
  outward passage through the Strait proved to be 66°, thus corresponding
  exactly with what we had found it to be on our inward passage seven
 weeks previously     (§ 30). This depression, as compared with the surface-
  temperature    of  the  Strait itself nearer the shore, both north and south,
 and with the temperature of the Mediterranean to the eastward and that
 of the Atlantic to the westward, is extremely remarkable.                  We shall here
 after inquire how it is to be explained (§ 74).
     66. The breadth of the Channel between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar
 (Chart II.) is about 23 nautical or 26| statute miles. Its northern half
 is much shallower       than the southern, as is shown in Section b b                ; the
  100-fathom line off the Spanish coast running at about twelve miles'
 distance from Cape Trafalgar, whilst along the African coast it keeps much
 nearer the shore, being at only two miles' distance from Cape Spartel.
 Between these two lines, the greatest depth marked in the Chart is 194
fathoms ; and this occurs off Cape Spartel, at less than a mile from the
 JOO-fathom line.        Between this and the opposite border of the deeper
channel, the depths vary from 130 to 180 fathoms ; the abruptness of the
differences at neighbouring points indicating a rocky bottom, of which we
soon had unpleasant experience.

    67.   We commenced our observations on the morning of Oct.                  1st at the
point of greatest depth (Station 65).           The temperature of the         surface   at
6   a.m. was only 63°, which was at least eight degrees lower than the
average temperature at that hour within the Mediterranean.                   The bottom-
temperature at 1 98 fathoms was 54°-5, and the Specific Gravity of the
bottom-water was 1 028-2. The coincidence both in temperature and Sp. Gr.
with the bottom-water at Station 64 was thus very close.                     The place of

  the Ship having been determined by angles taken with the shore, the rate
  of the surface-movement was tested as on former occasions, and was
  found      to be   1*277  mile   per hour, its direction being E. \ S.         The
  "current-drag" was then sunk to 150 fathoms, the greatest depth at
  which it was thought safe to use it ; and the boat from which it was
  suspended moved E.         | N. at the rate of 0*840 mile per hour. This
  observation indicated a very considerable retardation in the rate of inflow,
  but gave no evidence of an out&ow.         It did not, however, negative the
  inference deducible from the Temperature, and still more from the Specific
  Gravity, of the water beneath, that an outflow takes place in that lowest
  stratum which we could not test by the " current-drag."
     68. We then steamed         across  the deep channel towards the Spanish
  side   ; and passing a bank    of 45  fathoms which rises near its middle, we
 sounded again at Station 66, about six miles to the northward of Station
  65. The surface-temperature at 9 a.m. was here found to have risen to
 69°   ;   and since   not more than    half this increase   could   be  attributed,
 according to our general experience, to the increase      of direct solar radiation
 at this period     of the day, the cause of the additional elevation has to be
 sought     elsewhere   (§ 78). The length of soundiug-line run out was 147
 fathoms ; but on attempting to reel it in, the lead was found to have fixed
 itself between rocks ; and all Capt. Calver's skill in the management of
 his ship proved inadequate to free it. As we were thus anchored by our
 sounding-line, it was requisite to set ourselves free, by putting a breaking
 strain upon it ; and we thus lost, with the lead, one of our Water-bottles,
 and a pair     of Thermometers,    one  of which was specially valued by us as
 having been used throughout the 'Porcupine' Expedition of 1869, in
 which the Temperature-soundings had proved of peculiar importance. The
 "current-drag" was here let down to 100 fathoms; and the boat from
 which it was suspended moved along in the direction of the surface-
current, and at the rate      of 1*280 mile per hour, which was almost precisely
that of the surface-current in the previous observation.
     69. Deeming it important to obtain the Temperature and Specific
Gravity of the bottom-water on the Spanish side of the deeper portion of
the channel, we slightly shifted our ground, and again let down our lead,
with Thermometers and Water-bottle, at Station 67, where the depth
proved to be 188 fathoms.          On beginning to reel in the line, we found the
lead to have anchored as before, and for some time feared that we should
sustain a second loss of the Water-bottle and Thermometers attached to it.
The    means     taken by Capt. Calver for its extrication, however, proved on
this occasion successful ; and we had the satisfaction of seeing the whole
apparatus safely brought up, — the lead bearing evident marks of having
been jammed between rocks and then violently strained.           The Temperature
of the bottom proved to be 55°*3, that of the surface being 73° ; and the
Specific Gravity of the bottom-water was 1028-1, that of the surface
being 1026-8.        Here again, therefore, the evidence afforded by the Tem

perature and Specific Gravity of the bottom-water was conclusive as to its
Mediterranean character.    Its Density corresponded rather with that of
the bottom-water than with that of the intermediate stratum, at the
opposite end of the Strait ; but the more rapid Westerly motion of the
latter     (§ 62) would
                      seem to indicate that the water which here flows
                 "

                                    rather than from the deeper layer, and
that its diminution in density     due to the dilution

undercurrent must flow up-hill    but the incline

tracted by the long chains of Aggregate Salpa which were floating close to
the Ship near the surface of the very calm sea.       We were able to collect
four or five different species of these, and to submit them, during life, to
Microscopic examination.      The reversal of the direction of the Circulation
took place in all at more regular intervals than we have usually found to be the
case in the Compound Ascidians      ; and we were able to distinguish an unmis
takable rudimentary eye, which had not, we believe, been previously noticed.
We hope to be able hereafter, by the detailed study of these specimens,
to make some additions to the knowledge previously acquired of this very
interesting group. — As the nature of the bottom put     out of the question
                                                                  it

these brought up     afew Echinoderms and Polyzoa of no special interest             ;

gled feelings of disappointment and satisfaction.    The Zoological results
of our Cruise had been by no means equal to our expectations but, on        ;
the other hand, we could console ourselves with the belief that our deter
mination of the peculiar Physical conditions of this great Inland Sea, and
in particular our elucidation of the mystery of the Gibraltar current, would
be fairly regarded as     success
                           a        and we venture to think that this will

be admitted by such as may follow us through the discussion of General
Results to which we shall presently proceed.
   72. As Capt. Calver considered himself bound not to make any unne
cessary delay in returning homewards, and to take every advantage of the
continuance of the fair weather and favourable breeze which we enjoyed
during nearly the whole remainder of our voyage, we were reluctantly com
pelled to give up the idea of prosecuting any further researches in the Deep
Sea and devoted ourselves to the examination of the specimens previously
       ;
collected, and to the correlation of our Temperature and other results, — spe
cially directing our attention, however, to the Surface-temperature of the
embouchure     of the Strait, with the view of ascertaining whether         a   sudden
       would be observable on quitting       it,   corresponding to the rise which had

proved to be very decided.        As we   kept along the Southern Coast of Por
tugal towards Cape St. Vincent, the Surface-temperature averaged 730-5.
At 6 p.m. we were turning the corner of the Cape, and found the Surface-
temperature 72°#5 ; and at 8 p.m., when we were fairly in the Atlantic,
we found that the Surface-temperature had fallen to 69°, thus showing a
difference of 4°"5. On the following day, when we were off Lisbon, the Sur
face-temperature was 69°*5 ; and it gradually diminished as we proceeded
Northwards from that point. — Although the season of the year led us to
expect a rough passage across the Bay of Biscay, the weather continued
remarkably fine until we reached the
                                             " Chops of the Channel," where we
fell in with a rather fresh breeze    ; this did not interfere, however,   with our
anchoring at Cowes on the afternoon of the next day (Oct. 8th), after an
absence of just two months, during which a greater number of most im
portant Public events had occurred than had ever before been crowded
within   so short a period.

     [For this portion of the Report Dr. Carpenter is alone        responsible, ,]
    73. Surface-Temperature. —The Temperature of the surface-water at
the Chops of the Channel (Stations 1-9) averaged 62° for five days ; and
 it rose gradually in conformity with the Southing, until at Cape St. Vincent
 it stood at 69°.    The Temperature of the Air, which averaged 63°*4 in the
 former locality, rose to about 69° in the latter ; but it is specially note
worthy that whilst, as we crossed the Bay of Biscay and drew southwards
 along the coasts of Spain and Portugal, the temperature of the Air was
 almost always higher by from 2° to 5° than that of the Sea, this difference
 ceased to show itself as we neared Cape St. Vincent, and was even replaced
 by a slight difference in the contrary direction. The excess in the Surface-
 temperature of the Sea above the temperature of the Air became still more
 marked after we had passed the Cape, and had changed our course to the
 East ; a sudden rise of from 2° to 4° then showing itself in the former,
 whilst the latter did not rise by more than half that amount.            Thus on
 July   30, between    Stations  27  and   28,  on our  way   to  Cadiz,  in about
 Lat. 36j° N. and Long. 7£° W., the surface-temperature of the Sea exceeded
  74°, whilst the temperature of the Air was only 72°. The like condition
 showed itself after leaving Cadiz, on August 2, between Stations 29 and 30 ;
 the surface-temperature of the Sea being 73°*2, whilst the temperature of
 the Air was 71°'4.      That this excess did not depend upon a reduction of
  evaporation, consequent upon a peculiarly damp condition of the atmo
  sphere, appeared   from the fact that the Wet-bulb thermometer during this
  period  stood  at from  3° to 4° below the Dry a difference fully equal to

186                    Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys on                [Dec. 8,
the general average of our observations. — Having thence crossed the em
bouchure of the Strait of Gibraltar, so as to approach the coast of Africa,
the three following days were passed in Latitudes averaging about a degree
further south than those in which the previous observations had been
noted    ;  yet the surface-temperature of the Sea then fell again to an average
of 72°, whilst that of the Air averaged 730,7, thus nearly restoring the
usual ratio between the two. — It was not a little perplexing to find, when
we had fairly entered     the Strait and were proceeding along the mid-channel
towards Gibraltar, that the surface-temperature of the Sea. fell still further
to 66°-4, whilst the temperature of the Air rose to 76°-6, thus showing the
then unprecedented difference of 10o-2 between the two.
    74. These remarkable phenomena caused us to give particular attention
to the Surface-temperature in the mid-stream of the Strait, and on the
northern side of its embovchure,     on our return voyage ; when our first series
of observations derived full confirmation from another series taken with
the greatest care nearly two months afterwards. For when we left Gibraltar
 Harbour on the morning of September 30th, we found, on proceeding into
the mid-stream, that the surface-temperature fell from 70°- 7 to 65°- 6, al
though the latter observation was made towards noon ; that it remained at
nearly the same point through the remainder of that day and the succeed
ing night, during which we were slowly proceeding eastwards, — still in
the mid-current ; and that it stood as low as 63° at six o'clock on the fol
lowing morning (Oct. 1), when we had reached Station 65, in the deepest
 part of the channel over the ridge not far from the African coast. Having
thence moved towards the Spanish coast, we found the surface-temperature
at Station 66 to have risen to 69° ; and a little further, at Station 67, it
was found to have risen to 73°. — These observations make it clear that in
the line of the strongest surface-inset, the temperature of the current is
several degrees lower than that of the surface-water of the Atlantic from
which it is directly derived ; and the fact would seem to indicate either that
the water of which this current consists is drawn from a part of the Atlantic
at least as far north as Lisbon, or (which may be thought more probable)
that it is derived from a stratum of the neighbouring ocean somewhat beneath
 the surface, so as to have received less of the solar superheating than the
actual surface-water. — It would be a matter of much interest to trace this
colder current to its source, and thus to ascertain how it makes its way
through a sea at least five degrees warmer than itself.
    7:>. Our second series of observations upon the Surface-temperature        of
the Northern side of the wide embouchure of the Strait were also quite con
firmatory of the inference to which the first seemed to point, — that there
is a surface-outflow of Mediterranean water along the Spanish coast, by
which the Temperature is kept up above the ordinary standard of Atlantic
water in that latitude    ; for during the remainder of Oct. 1 , the following
night,     and  the greater part of the next day, the surface-temperature was
between 70° and 72°-5, being a degree or two higher than the temperature

                                          was 73°-5    ;   at   6
Cape St. Vincent, it was 72°-5; and at 8 p.m., when we were fairly in the
Atlantic, it was at 69°. The average of the next two days, while we were
proceeding steadily Northwards, was maintained at nearly the same point ;
and the surface-temperature                   of the   Sea was now pretty           constantly lower
than that of the        Air.
  76.     The most probable explanation                         of this   excess    seems        to    lie in
the fact that, besides           the mid-current almost invariably setting eastwards,
there are two lateral streams,          of which the direction is sometimes reversed
under tidal influences (§ 106) ; and that warmer water from the Mediter
ranean basin thus finds its way outwards, chiefly along the Spanish shore.
— That the surface indraught is greatest on the African side of the Strait,
and that the surface onflow is greatest on the Spanish side,     we under                 is,

between  64°-l and 65°-6, — being apparently that of the mid-strait to the
eastward, — whilst the temperature of the Air ranged between 72°-9 and
77°-2, the greatest difference between the two being 12°-5.         During
most of this time the wind was easterly, and the wet-bulb thermometer
ranged from 4°-l to 8°-2 below the dry      but the increased evaporation
                                                                ;
that would result from the atmospheric condition thus indicated, could
scarcely have produced the marked depression observable in the surface-
temperature of the water more especially as our general experience was that
                                  ;
the surface-temperature in the comparatively                        shallow water of        a        Harbour
was rather higher    than in the deeper sea outside. — No such depression
presented itself on our return voyage.  On approaching Gibraltar from the
Mediterranean side, there was      gradual reduction from 74°, which had
                                                a
been  the average of several previous days, to 72°, apparently                                   in   conse
quence of the influx of the colder Atlantic water   the water     the Bay ;                     in
itself had an average surface-temperature of nearly 71° and the surface-       ;
temperature did not fall until we came out into the mid-channel, where we
encountered the colder indraught as already described      61). Hence the      (§
depression observed during our first visit must be occasional only; and may
perhaps be attributable to    deflexion of the mid-current into the Bay, by
                                          a
the opposing influence of the easterly wind which then prevailed. — This                                    is
one of the points as to which further inquiries, such as may be easily in
stituted      by
            the Government authorities at Gibraltar, would doubtless fur
nish information of great interest.

phenomena of the Atlantic Basin by those of the

distinct separation          between an upper warm and a lower cold stratum as
presented     itself   in   the   channel between the Shetland and the Faroe Islands ;

300 fathoms,         it   lies   in the former between        800 and 1000 fathoms.        It
seems perfectly clear that the lower stratum must have had a Polar source ;
but there is at present no distinct evidence that the upper stratum is de
rived from any source nearer the Equator. Its temperature, indeed, is lower
by 4 or 5 degrees than that of the Mediterranean in the same parallel of
Latitude at corresponding depths ; and since the temperature of the latter
may be considered as the normal of the Latitude, — this great Inland Sea
being virtually excluded from participation in the general Oceanic Cir
 culation, — it would seem that the effect of that circulation is rather to
 lower than to raise the temperature of the upper stratum of this portion
 of the Atlantic. Its *Mr/ace-temperature also, as already shown (§ 45),
 is decidedly lower than that of the Mediterranean under the same parallel ;
 and the limitation of the superheating to its most superficial layer is in
 entire accordance with our Mediterranean                    observations upon this point
 (§ 87). — Hence it            seems a justifiable conclusion that neither the super
 ficial layer nor any portion of the upper stratum of the Atlantic water
 that laves the coasts of Spain and Portugal receives any accession of heat
 from the extension of the Gulf-stream into its area*.
     8 1 . "When, however, we compare the Temperatures of this upper stratum
 at different depths with those which are met with at Stations much further
 North (as tabulated in Par.            110   of the Report for 1869), there is found to
 be a remarkable correspondence in the general rate                of reduction with depth,
 except in this particular,          — that the influence of the cold stratum beneath
 begins to be decidedly marked much nearer the surface; so that instead of a
 very slight reduction between 500 and 800 fathoms, and then a very rapid
 passage through          a   "stratum of intermixture" of 200 fathoms,            as in the

 temperature of this marine area, is "not proven" as regards its winter temperature
 The data furnished, however, by the comparison of the Winter climates of stations
 along the Atlantic Sea-bord, with those of Mediterranean Stations in corresponding
 Latitudes, indicate that it is as true for Winter as for Summer. (See ' Proceedings of
 the Royal Geographical Society'        for Jan.  9, 1871.)

 Southern     stations, there is     a  more gradual reduction of about the same
 amount (9°) between 500 and 1000 fathoms. Now this resul tis in remark
 able conformity with what might be anticipated on the hypothesis advanced
 in the last Report.         For if the whole upper stratum of Oceanic water be
 slowly moving northwards from the region with which we are now concerned
 towards that explored in the Third Cruise of 1869, whilst the lower stratum
 is slowly moving       southwards beneath this, it might be expected that the
 further North the warm stratum advances, the more would it show the
 influence of the colder stratum beneath, in the lowering of the Temperature
 of the portion that immediately overlies it. And conversely, in proportion as
 the cold stratum advances          Southwards, we might anticipate that the tem
 perature of its upper layer would be gradually raised, so that even when
 the " stratum of intermixture
                                      " has been
                                                  entirely passed through, we should
 find the Temperature at corresponding depths somewhat higher than at
 stations further north, — which is just what seems actually to be the case*.
    82. The data at present in our possession seem to point to the inference that
 the relation between the upper warm and the lower cold strata of the Ocean,
 on different parts     of the surface of the Globe,      is such as may be diagram        -
 matically expressed       thus : —

     At the Poles (p     p, p p) the cold stratum occupies      the whole depth, from
 the surface to the bottom ; but as we pass towards the Equator we find it
lying further and further down, its surface forming an inclined plane
on which the warm stratum rests.             The warm stratum, on the other hand,
has its maximum depth at the Equator, and gradually thins-off towards the
 Poles. — This is just what would be expected on the hypothesis of a General
Vertical Circulation (§ 1 24 et seq.); since in the Polar-Equatorial flow of the
cold stratum its surface would be continually gaining heat by contact
with the warm stratum          above, so that its superficial portion would be (so to
speak) progressively       transferred  to the warm stratum ; whilst, on the other
    * Prof. Wyville Thomson, in his Lecture on "         Deep-Sea   Climates " (' Nature,'
July 28, 1870), has expressed the opinion that the cold stratum in the North Atlantic
is derived rather from the Antarctic than from the Arctic basin.        Putting aside the
difficidty of accounting for a constant inflow of Antarctic water into the Northern
Hemisphere, without a corresponding oafflow, a strong argument against it may be
drawn from the facta stated above. For if the cold stratum have a Southern Bource, we
should expect its own temperature to be lower, and its effects upon the superincumbent
stratum to be more marked, the further south it is examined, — the contrary of which
proves to bo the case.

hand,   in the Equatorial-Polar flow of the warm stratum its lower layer would
be  gradually reduced in temperature by moving over with the cold stratum
beneath*.        Moreover     as its surface would be        exposed    to  a  lower and
yet lower Atmospheric temperature the further North it moves, each super
ficial layer aa it is cooled will descend into the colder stratum, of which the
thickness will be progressively augmented at the expense of that which
overlies it.
   83. The Third group of .BofYofw-temperatures,             which includes those taken
within the embouchure of the Strait of Gibraltar (Nos. 25-28, p. 220),
presents some peculiarities which are worthy of notice, when taken in con
nection with the fact already stated as to the constant Temperature of about
55° found in the water of the Mediterranean at depths greater than 100
fathoms.       For if we compare the Bottom-temperatures of Stations 25, 28,
29, 30, and 38, with those of Stations 31, 32, 33, and 34, we find in the
former a distinct elevation above the latter. Thus at Stations 25 and
28    the   temperature      was   530-5,   at 374 and 304 fathoms respectively ;
at Station 29 it was 55° at 227 fathoms ; at Station 30 it was 52°7 at
386 fathoms ; and at Station 58 it was 54° at 503 fathoms : whilst at
 Station 31 it was 50°-5 at 477 fathoms ; at Stations 32 and 34 it was 50°
 at 651 and 414 fathoms respectively ; and at Station 33 it was 4 9°' 7 at
 554 fathoms.        This difference    seems   fairly attributable to the influence of
 the undercurrent which is now known to carry out the warmer Mediterra
 nean water to mingle with the colder water of the Atlantic, and which, after
 flowing over the ridge between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel (§ 69), may
 still for a time maintain its distinctness on the descending slope of the
 Atlantic basin.       It would probably not be difficult to trace its further
 course by a sufficient number of observations on the Temperature and Spe
 cific Gravity of the bottom-water to the west of the Strait ; and it would
 be very interesting thus to ascertain how far this undercurrent makes its
 way before blending with the general mass of Atlantic water.
                                                                          — If a detailed
 examination of the phenomena of the double current should be undertaken
 by the Authorities at Gibraltar, this point should not be neglected.

 lantic Ocean as a basis for comparison with that of the Mediterranean Sea,
 the proportion of Chlorine in 34 samples of the former, taken between Fal
 mouth and Lisbon, was determined by Volumetric analysis.                  Of these sam
 ples,   12  were   of  surface-water,    12  of  bottom-water    from   various   depths
 down to 1095 fathoms, and 12 of intermediate water. The results are
 expressed in Grammes per 1000 Cubic Centimetres of water.

          was long ago shown by Dr. Arnott, in his Elements        of Physics,' that if two
 layers of water originally of different temperatures, separated by a good conductor, move
 in contrary directions, they will gradually exchange temperatures ; and this principle is
 now applied in the construction of Coolers for Brewories and Distilleries, in which a
 hot liquid which it is desired to cool is made to impart nearly all its heat to     a cold
 liquid whose temperature it is desired to raise.

 It appears from these Analyses that there is a slight excess of Salinity
 in the surface- water of the Atlantic, as had been previously observed by
 Forchhammer * ; the excess, however, being so small as not to neutralize
 the excess of Density which the deeper water derives from its lower Tempe
 rature and from the Pressure of the superincumbent column.                    Five de
 terminations of the Chlorine contained in samples taken at the same spot,
 from the Surface, and from 10, 25, 50, and 100 Fathoms, gave the follow
 ing results   : —

A comparison of        these seems to indicate that the excess of density, being
limited to a mere superficial film, is entirely due to evaporation ; and the
reason why this more concentrated film does not sink, as it does in the
Mediterranean (§ 90), is that its excess of Salinity is so small, that even at
the depth of 10 fathoms its effect on Specific Gravity is neutralized by the
greater density arising from reduction of Temperature. — The differ
ence between the maximum and minimum, which in Surface-water is only
 I -5 2nd part of the whole, and in Intermediate water only l-83rd part
of the whole,     is in Bottom-water l-38th of the whole; and the minimum
of the whole series, namely, 19-46, presented itself in a specimen of
Bottom-water taken from a depth of 994 fathoms.               This proportion might
have been presumed to represent the inferior Salinity of the Polar stream,
from which the Temperature of the sample indicated its derivation, were
it not that another sample from a depth of 1095 fathoms was found to
yield 1973, or nearly the average proportion, of Chlorine.               Two samples,
taken respectively from 700 and 322 fathoms, gave 19-63 ; and the maxi
mum of 1 9 •98 occurred in a sample from 717 fathoms . These anomalies are
somewhat perplexing, yet the whole range of variation is really very small.
Similar anomalies presented themselves in the results of Dr. Frankland's
Analyses of samples of Bottom-water collected in the Cold area (Report
for 1869,     p. 489) ; for whilst the proportion of Chlorine in a sample
(No. 64) taken from a depth of 640 fathoms, at a Temperature of 29°-6, was
19-88, that of the Surface at 49°7 being 19-96, it was 20-14 in another
sample (No. 54), which, though taken at little more than half the depth

sibly, as suggested by Dr. Forchhammer (loc. cit.), the several parts of the
Polar stream may vary in density, according to the amount of nearly fresh
water which each may have derived from the icebergs that have liquefied
in   it.
     85.Specific Gravity. — As the determination of Specific Gravity by obser
vations taken with the Hydrometer on board ship is open to two sources of
error, — that of the instrument, and that of the reading (which, when the
vessel is unsteady, cannot be precise), — we deem it safer to depend upon
the more exact determination of the Specific Gravity of a smaller number
of samples by means of the Balance, and to estimate that of others by the
Chlorine-determinations.                 In this manner          we   arrive at   a range     of from
1*02G1,  the Specific Gravity of the sample of Bottom-water of minimum
density, to 1#0269, the Specific Gravity of the sample of Surface-water of
maximum density ; the average of all being 1 '0265.  This agrees very well
with the results obtained by Forchhammer.

   reduction showed itself in the uppermost        stratum of 10 fathoms;       but
   though the further reduction took place at     a very slow rate, the tempera
   tures at this Station were decidedly below those at the other two, down to
   100 fathoms, at which there was not a difference     of 1° among the three.
      88. Bottom-Temperature. —The uniformity which showed itself in the
  Temperature of the bottom (see Table, p. 221), at all depths below 100
  fathoms, was very remarkable. The lowest bottom-temperature we anywhere
  met with was 54° ; and this presented itself at a depth of 790 fathoms.      The
  highest we anywhere met with was 56°,5 ; and this presented itself in three
  instances,   at depths of 266, 390, and 445 fathoms.       But that the trifling
  elevation   was not  in any way dependent upon the smaller depth of these
  Soundings, was obvious from two considerations : — first, that our deepest
  sounding gave a temperature of 56° on a bottom of 1743 fathoms, whilst
  we found 55° at depths of 1456 and 1508 fathoms ; and second, that the
  slight variations observable among the Sottom-temperatures occurred also
  between    the temperatures taken at 100 fathoms.        In fact, whatever the
  temperature was at 100 fathoms, that was the temperature of the whole
  mass of water beneath, down to the greatest depth explored.         In that part
  of the Western basin of the Mediterranean which lies between Gibraltar
  and Sardinia, the bottom-temperature ranged between 54° and 55°-5, the
  average    being 54°-9.    East of this, in the neighbourhood     of Sicily, the
  bottom-temperature ranged between 55° and 56°,5, the average being
  55°-8. It was because we thought it possible that the slight excess of
  Bottom-temperature on this area might be due to Volcanic heat beneath,
 that we directed our homeward course by way of Etna and Stromboli, for
 the purpose of ascertaining if the near neighbourhood of a constantly
 active Volcano has any influence in raising the temperature of the bottom.
 No such influence, however, was perceptible ; the Temperatures obtained
 at Stations 61 and 62,— namely 55°-7 at 392 fathoms, and 55°-3 at 730
 fathoms, — being rather below than above the average.
     89. The remarkable contrast thus presented to the slow but continuous
 reduction of temperature encountered in the successive strata of Oceanic
 water in the great Atlantic basin, and to the sudden fall which presents itself
 as the Thermometer       descends to its lower depths (§ 79), excites enquiry
into the    cause of the difference. It is now clear that no amount of surface-
heat has power directly to affect the temperature of sea-water to a greater
depth than 100 fathoms, the elevation of temperature it produces below
30 fathoms being very slight ; and it seems also clear that the uniform
temperature of from 54° to 56°,5 encountered below the 100 fathoms'
stratum, represents the permanent temperature of the great mass of water
which occupies the Mediterranean basin. Now this mass is entirely cut off
from the infl ue of the General Oceanic Circulation, the surface-inflow
through the Strait of Gibraltar having no other effect than slightly to lower
the general temperature at the western extremity of the basin. And the
uniform permanent temperature of the mass of Mediterranean water may
                                                                   r   2

thus be considered as representing the mean temperature of the Earth in
that region, slightly raised, perhaps, by a downward convection of heat from
the surface in the manner to be presently described (§ 90). "With such an
allowance it corresponds closely with the determinations of the mean tempe
rature of the Crust of the Earth, made by sinking Thermometers into the
ground to such a depth as to seclude them from the direct influenceof Summer
heat or Winter cold, but not to bring them within the direct influence of
the Internal Heat of the earth. Thus Quetelet found that a Thermometer
sunk to a depth of 24 feet at Brussels showed an annual average of 53°'4,
the range of variation being only 2°,5 ; and Bischoff found a Thermometer
sunk to a depth of 3C feet at Bonn give an annual average of 51°, with a
range of only l0-5. The Temperature of deep Caves gives another set of
data of the like     kind,   which   accord  very closely with the foregoing.
Thus   we have been informed by      Mr.  Pengelly that the temperature in the
part of Kent's Hole at Torquay which is furthest from its entrance varies
but little from 52° throughout the year. There is a cave in the island of
Pantellaria, lying between Sicily and the African Coast, which is reputed
to be of   "icy coldness;" but Lieut. Millard, of H.M.S. 'Newport,' who
has lately been making a careful survey of the Island, informed us that,
although he felt it "very cold" on passing into it out of a very hot sun
shine, its actual temperature, taken by Thermometer, was 54°. And
we have also learned on good authority         that this is the temperature of
the bottom of the deepest tanks in which water is stored up in Malta,
provided that these are excavated (as is very commonly the case) be
neath the houses, or are in any other way secluded from the direct rays of
the sun.
   90. Now let it be supposed that the superficial stratum of the water of
the Mediterranean had been cooled down by a severe winter to the uniform
temperature of the depths below; we have to enquire in what manner
it would be affected by the heating-power of the summer sun. This, it is
obvious, can be only exerted directly upon the actual surface ; for the
eonducting-yower of water is so small that very little downward trans
mission of heat would take place through its agency. Further, as the
application of heat at the surface will render the superficial layer specifically
lighter, no such convection will take place in the downward direction as
takes place upwards when heat is applied at the bottom.            But another
agency comes into play in the case of Sea-water.        The rapid evaporation
produced by powerful     solar radiation, especially when aided by the hot dry
winds of Africa, occasions such a concentration of the surface-film, that, in
spite of its elevation of temperature, it becomes specifically heavier, and
descends, — to be replaced by a fresh layer.       In this manner it will carry
down an excess of heat, which diffuses itself through the subjacent layer,
of  course  producing the greatest elevation of temperature in the stratum
nearest the surface.    The continual repetition of this process through the
hot season will carry the elevation of temperature further and further

down ; but so soon as the temperature of the Air falls much below that
of the Sea, the surface-layer being cooled will become heavier and sink, and
will thus carry down cold instead of heat, so as to lower the temperature
of the stratum below. In no instance, however, so far as we can learn, has
the surface-temperature          of the Mediterranean   ever been seen so low as 56°,
even in midwinter.
    9 1 . That it is by this sinking of the surface-films successively concen
trated by evaporation that the Solar heat, which acts so powerfully on
the Mediterranean           basin during the summer, is transmitted downwards,
appears      certain    from  the fact, of which the particulars will be presently
given, that the Salinity of the water of the Mediterranean is greater below
the surface than at the surface, instead of diminishing as it does in the
Atlantic (§ 84)       ;   and we thus   see how important an influence is exerted by
that Salinity in diffusing the heat imparted to the surface through the waters
beneath.        In the great /re«A-water lakes of Switzerland, the deeper water
retains all through the year a temperature but little above 39°, the small
excess being probably derived from the warmth of its bed ; for the whole
mass      of water down     to the bottom must be cooled to this degree in winter
 before any ice can form on its surface ; and as the heating of the surface
in summer makes all the water affected by it specifically lighter, none
of it will descend and carry heat downwards, as it does in the Mediter
 ranean.
    92. Density. — The determination of the actual Salinity of the water of
 the Mediterranean basin, alike at the Surface and at various Bottom-depths,
 was one of the special objects of our inquiries ; for although various Ana
 lyses had been previously recorded, they had been made upon samples of
water which had been kept in bottles for a more or less considerable period ;
 and the depths from which those samples had been collected were not by
 any means the greatest known to exist iu this basin. — The number of Chlo
 rine-determinations of Sur/ace-water was 25 ; and their Geographical
 range was from the Strait of Gibraltar to the edge of the Eastern basin
 (Station 60). A marked difference in density was observable between the
 Surface-waters of the Western and of the Eastern portions of this area ; for
 whilst those of the latter invariably showed a considerable excess in Salinity
 above the maximum of Atlantic water, that excess was so much reduced in
 some     of the samples taken nearer to the Strait, as almost certainly to show
 that    the  surface- stratum there consists in great degree of Atlantic Water.
 Thus at Station 47, in which a like indication was given by the Tempera
 ture of the Surface-water (§ 87), we found the proportion of Chlorine to
 be 20-46, or only 0*27 above the maximum we had encountered in Atlantic
 water    ; and when we crossed to the neighbourhood of the opposite Algerine
 Coast (where, however, the density of the Surface-water was probably re
 duced by the entrance of Kiver-water), we found the proportion of Chlo
 rine as low in one case as 19*69, and in another as 19"99.                 When ap
 proaching     the  Strait  on  our  return  voyage, we took  a series of five samples

198                     Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys         on               [Dec.  8,
for the purpose of testing the reality of this difference ; and we found the
proportions of Chlorine to be respectively 2077, 20-67, 20-56, 20*51, and
20-47.       The mean of these five determinations, together with the one pre
viously taken at Station 47, but excluding the two taken on the coast of
Algiers, is 20-57; and the mean Specific Gravity was 1-0274. On the
other hand, at the Sicilian end of the basin, where the water was that of
the Mediterranean proper, the mean of ten Chlorine-determinations was
21-05, with a corresponding Specific Gravity of 1-0280. The maximum of
Chlorine was there 21*32, with Specific Gravity 1*0284 ; and the minimum
20'77, with Specific Gravity 1*0277. The combination of these 16 obser
vations gives a mean of 20*87 for the Chlorine, and 1*0278 for the Specific
 Gravity, of the Surface-water of the Mediterranean generally *.
     93. The number of Chlorine-determinations of Bottom-water taken in
the proper Mediterranean basin, at depths between 207 and 1700 fathoms,
 was 20.      They show a general excess of Salinity over the Surface-water,
 the mean of the whole being 21*38 (as against 20*87), with a maximum of
 21*88 (Sp. Gr. 1*0292) and a minimum of 21-08 (Sp. Gr. 1-0281).                      On
 grouping them into three Series           according to their depth, we arrive at a
 curious result : —
            Fathoms.                                          Chlorine      Sp. Gr.
          200 to    400, Mean of     7  observations           21*53        1*0287
          400 to    800,     „       7       „                 21*38        1-0285
        1300 to 1700,        „       6       „                  21-21       10283
      94. Thus it appears that the excess of Salinity is greatest in the shallower
 water, and that it gradually diminishes with the depth.              This is also shown
 most strikingly by comparing the sample taken from the least depth
 (207 fathoms) with that taken from the greatest depth (1703 fathoms) ;
  for it was the former that showed the maximum of 21*88, and the latter
 that showed the minimum of 21*08. — Now this fact, though at first unex
  pected (since we had supposed that the heaviest water would gravitate
  to the greatest depths), seems not difficult to account for, if we consider
 the mode in which the concentration of the surface-film will be likely to
  affect the water below.       For it can be shown experimentally, by pouring a
  strong saline solution tinged      with colour upon the top of a weaker colour
 less solution, that the former will in the first instance sink " bodily," but
  will gradually impart its excess of salt to the liquid through which it falls ;
  the descent of the coloured stratum becoming slower and slower, and its
     * This mean accords closely with that of 20-845 obtained by Prof. Forohhammer from
  his examination of samples collected at different times and by different persons from,
  various parts of the surface of tho Mediterranean (Phil. Trans. 1865, p. 252).       His
  maximum of Chlorine, 21-718, was higher than ours ; but this seems to have been an
  exceptional easo ; and tho sample may have undergone sorao concentration in keeping.
  On tho other hand, his minimum was lower, being only 20' 16 ; but this sample, having
  been takou in tho Strait of Gibraltar, contained a large proportion of Atlantic water.

colour being more and more imparted to the general mass of the liquid.
The proportion of salt will in time be made uniform throughout the whole
column by " diffusion." Now it is obvious that if each column rests (so to
speak) on its own base, the degree in which the Salinity of the whole mass
is raised by the addition of a more concentrated solution will depend ceteris
paribus upon its height ; and thus where the depth of the Mediterranean
basin is only between 200 and 400 fathoms, we should expect the Specific
Gravity of its water to        be more raised by the successive    concentration   of its
surface-films, than where the depth ranges from    1300 to 1700 fathoms.

appears justifiable — that there is an extremely small amount of movement

The inflow of lighter surface-water through the Strait, and the outflow of
denser water from the comparatively shallow stratum of the neighbourhood,
will probably produce no change whatever at depths greater than 500
fathoms. And the same may be said of the supply of fresh water brought
in either      by              for this will at once go to make up the loss
                    rain or rivers   ;

                                         these waters were continually subject
 to horizontal displacement,      might be expected either that the heaviest
                                     it
 water  would gravitate to the greatest depths, or that the density of the
 entire contents of the deeper portion of the basin would be equalized;
 neither of which happens.    On the contrary, as just shown, the density
 varies with the depth in so marked     degree, as to indicate that the water

 periods of time.
    96. Solid Matter in Suspension. — The water of the Mediterranean         di    is
 stinguished  from that of the Atlantic,  not  only in the larger proportion  of
 Saline matter which      it  holds in solution, but also in having diffused through
 its whole mass, in     a   state of suspension, particles of solid matter in an ex
 tremely fine state of division.  This statement may seem strange to those
 who are familiar, either by personal observation, pictorial representation, or
 verbal description, with the (apparently) clear deep blue of the Mediter
 ranean Sea.   But the two phenomena will be presently shown not only to
 be compatible, but to stand to each other in the relation of cause and
 effect.

200                     Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys          on         [Dec. 8,
   97. Our attention was drawn to this point, in the first instance, by-
finding that the bottom-water brought up by the Water-bottle was nearly
always turbid, and that this turbidity was with difficulty removed by fil
tration.   The bottom-water brought up from sandy or gravelly bottoms
is always clear  and though that which was brought up from the area
                  ;
                      " Atlantic" was often turbid, it was
covered by the             mud                             readily cleared
by passing through filtering-paper, the deposit on which was found to
consist of very minute Globigerints, which had been apparently floating
in the stratum immediately above the Sea-bed.     As the clearing of the
Mediterranean water was requisite for our Chlorine-determinations, it was
passed twice or thrice through the filter, and the solid matter left upon
the paper consisted entirely of Inorganic particles of extreme minuteness.
Now it is a fact well known to Chemists and Physicists, that the length of
time required for the deposit of a precipitate increases with the fineness
of the division of its particles, notwithstanding that the material of which
they are composed may be of very high Specific Gravity.           Thus it was
shown by Faraday that precipitates of Gold may not subside for a month ;
and Mr. Babbage has calculated that, in the case of lighter substances, a
period of hundreds of years may be required for the gravitation of very
finely divided particles through a considerable mass of fluid.
   98. Taking into account, therefore, that the deep waters of the Medi
terranean are not only cut off from the General Oceanic Circulation, but
that they are almost entirely destitute of vertical circulation amongst
themselves (§ 95), it may be fairly considered that the perceptible turbi
dity of the bottom-water is due to the imperceptible diffusion of the same
finely divided matter throughout the entire mass of superincumbent water.
And that tliis is really the case, is shown by two different methods of
proof.   We learned from the Engineer of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company's Steam-ship by which we proceeded to join the 'Porcupine' at
Gibraltar, that the deposit removed from the boilers after working in the
Mediterranean differs from that left by Atlantic water, not only in its
larger proportion of salt, but in having a very finely divided mud diffused
through    it,which      is,
                         of course, derived from the evaporation of surface-
water. The result of this large-scale experiment harmonizes exactly with
that of Prof. Tyndall's examination of small sample of the surface-water
                                           a
of the Mediterranean by the Electric light for he found
                                                 ;                to be highly
                                                                     it
charged   with   minute particles in suspension, as     also the water of the
Lake of Geneva.      And he has further shown that      it is
                                                           in each case to the
                                                                is
presence   of  these particles that we are to attribute the peculiar intensity
of the blue colour      by
                        which both these waters are characterized*.
   * See 'Nature,' Oct. 18, 1870. — We may take leave to mention that the same
                                                                                 idea
of the agency of the suspended particles in intensifying the blue colour of the water
had previously occurred to ourselves, and had been made the subject of conversation
on our voyage home, the probable community of the source of tho suspended particles
in the Mediterranean and the Lake of Geneva respectively having especially presented

   99.   But further, when we come to enquire into the source of these sus
pended particles, the progressive subsidence of which gives rise to the fine
muddy deposit that covers all the deeper parts of the Mediterranean, we
find that (so far, at least, as the Western basin is concerned) they have
been in all probability brought down into it by the Rhone.          The upper
part of that river, as is well known, is constantly transporting a vast mass
of sedimentary matter into the Lake of Geneva ; and while the deposit of
the coarser particles of the sediment at the upper end of the Lake is causing
a progressive formation of alluvial land, the water which passes off at the
lower end, though apparently clear, is still charged with particles in a
finer state of division. " Scarcely," says Sir C. Lyell*, "has the river passed
out of the Lake of Geneva, before its pure waters are again filled with sand
and sediment by the impetuous Arve, descending from the highest Alps,
and bearing along in its current the granitic sand and impalpable mud
annually brought down by the glaciers of Mont Blanc.    The Rhone after
wards receives vast contributions of transported matter from the Alps of
Dauphiny and the primary and volcanic mountains of Central France ; and
when at length it enters the Mediterranean, it discolours the blue water
of that sea with a whitish sediment for the distance of between six and
seven miles, throughout which space the current of fresh water is percep
tible." — Thus the Western basin of the Mediterranean stands in the same
relation to the lower part of the Rhone and to the tributaries which dis
charge themselves into       that the Lake of Geneva does to its upper part.
                                it,
And      like universal diffusion of fine sedimentary particles through the

tary particles, then,   the source of large part of the material of that fine
                           is                  a
tenacious Mud which, mingled with       larger or smaller proportion of Sand,
                                               a
partly calcareous and partly siliceous, constitutes the deposit at present in
progress on the deeper parts of the Mediterranean sea-bed.     The source of
 the Calcareous sand, which  itself    state of very minute subdivision,
                                      is       in   a                                           is
 probably to be found in the abrasion of the Calcareous Tertiaries which
 form the shore-line round       large part of the Western basin. This abra

 The singular barrenness of this deposit in regard to Animal life forced itself
 upon our attention during the whole of our dredging-operations in the
 Mediterranean      (§§ 48-52) and whilst disappointed as Zoologists in not

 much importance to the fact in its Geological and Biological relations.

202                   Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys     on            [Dec.  8,
the negative   result of our sedulous investigations may have an important
Geological bearing.
    101. It will be borne in mind that our previous researches have fully
demonstrated the fact that the Depth of from COO to 1200 fathoms is not
per se inconsistent with the existence of a varied and abundant Fauna ; and
that the reduction which shows itself at from 1200 to 2435 fathoms seems
to depend as much on depression of Temperature, as on increase of Depth -
Hence it was fairly to be expected that a varied and abundant Fauna —
probably containing a number of Tertiary types supposed to have been
long extinct — would have been found between 500 and 1500 fathoms, on a
bottom of which the temperature seems never to fall below 54°. Now
the question as to the cause of the deficiency of Animal Life on this
bottom naturally connects itself with the old Geological difficulty, of which
the inquiries of Prof. Edward Forbes were long supposed to afford a
Satisfactory solution ; viz. the existence of vast thicknesses of sedimentary
strata, almost or entirely destitute of Organic Remains.       The explanation
which has been accepted for many years, — that these deposits were formed
in Seas too deep to allow of the existence of Animals on their bottom, —
having been now shown to be untenable, the old difficulty recurs ; and it
is obvious that if it can be shown that a condition prejudicial to Animal
Life now prevails on the Mediterranean bottom, which also prevailed
when other azoic deposits were formed, a great step will have been gained.
Such a condition is to be found — we are disposed to think — in the turbidity
of the bottom-water. All Marine animals are dependent for the aeration
of their fluids on the contact of water either with their external surface,
or with special (branchial) prolongations of it.        Now if this water be
charged   with  suspended particles of extreme   fineness,  the deposit of these
particles upon the respiratory surface will interfere with the aerating
process, and will tend to produce asphyxia. This is not a mere hypothesis.
It is well known that Oyster-bed3 cannot be established in situations to
which fine mud is brought by any fluvial or tidal current.            And our
Colleague Mr. Jeffreys, when dredging some years ago in the neighbour
hood of Spezzia, having on one occasion passed a little out of the Bay, from
a sandy bottom rich in Animal life to a muddy bottom (this mud being
doubtless a part of the Rhone deposit), without any considerable increase
of depth, was forcibly struck by the barrenness of the latter.
    102. It will be for Geologists to say how far this explanation can be
applied to the case of the azoic sedimentary deposits of former epochs.
One very notable case of the kind has been communicated to us by Dr.
Duncan, that of the Fleisch, a stratum not less than 6000 feet thick,
extending from Mont Blanc to the Styrian Alps, which must have been
deposited in the condition of extremely fine arenaceous mud, and in which
there is an almost entire absence of Fossils.       We are disposed to believe,
also, from the results of such inquiries as we have been able to make, that
the   extremely fine Calcareous sandstone    of Malta, though reputed to      be

rich in Fossils, will be found to contain these fossils, for the most part,
in its coarser beds ; which were probably deposited in shallower waters,
like those which we found rich in Animal life along the shores of the
Mediterranean.        The extremely fine stone that is used for carved work, —
                                    "
                            " grain that carvings executed in it look like casts
to entirely wanting in
in Plaster of Paris, — contains, we were assured, few fossils except Sharks'
teeth, which, of course, dropped into it from above.            We commend this
enquiry to the attention of Maltese Geologists, as one having an impor
tant bearing on the solution of a problem of the highest interest.
     103. There is another condition, however, which maybe not less potent
in restraining within very narrow limits the Animal Life of the deeper parts
of the Mediterranean         Basin, — namely,    the stagnation  produced by the
 almost entire absence      of Vertical Circulation.    In the great Oceanic  ba
 sins,   if our doctrine (§ 124 et seq.) be correct, every drop of water is in
its turn brought to its surface and exposed to the purifying influence of
prolonged exposure to the air.          From this movement, the water of the
 Mediterranean      may be said to be virtually excluded ; and, as has been
 already shown (§ 95), the deeper part of the basin has no Circulation of
 its own, either horizontal or vertical, which will have the effect of bring
 ing its water to the surface. It is difficult, in fact, to conceive of any
 agency that can disturb the stillness of the abyssal depths of a basin which
 is completely shut in by a wall that rises more than 10,000 feet from
 its bottom.       How far this affects the condition of such depths, in respect
 to the diffusion of the Organic matter and the Oxygen required for
  the support of Animal life, must be a matter of future inquiry.
                               Gibraltar Current.
      104.   The term "Strait of Gibraltar" is usually applied to that space
  between     the coast-lines of Spain and Morocco which is bounded on the
  west    by Capes Trafalgar       and  Spartel,   and on the    east by the two
  " Pillars of Hercules," — namely Europa Point, which forms the southern
  extremity of the Bock of Gibraltar, and Jebel Musa or Apes Hill on the
  Barbary side.      As Admiral Smyth justly remarks *, however, we may cor
  rectly include in the Strait the whole of that funnel-shaped entrance from
  the Atlantic, of which the western boundary is formed by a line from Cape
  St. Vincent     on the north to Cape Cantin on the south, the whole of the
  water within this entrance being affected by the surface-draught into the
  Mediterranean.       It was considered by Major Bennell that there is a general
  "  set
         " of Atlantic    water between   Lat. 30° and 45° N., and from 100 to
   130 leagues off the land, towards the entrance of the Strait, the rate of
  movement being as much as from 14 to 17 miles per day. This estimate,
  however, is regarded by Admiral Smyth (loc. cit.) as excessive ; although
  he thinks that such an indraught may possibly occur during the long        pre-
                              * The Mediterranean, p. 158.

  valence   of particular winds. We have been informed by Admiral Ommaney
  that, according to his own experience, the inset is most considerable towards
  the African coast, while the outset occasionally observed (§ 106) is most
  decided on the Northern coast ; and this statement derives very remarkable
  confirmation from the Thermometric observations already detailed.               For
  these show that the lower temperature         of the iw-current is specially notice
  able near Cape Spartel (§ 73) ;         whilst the higher temperature, which is
  traceable westwards along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts as far as Cape
  St. Vincent, and there suddenly falls to the ordinary standard of the Atlantic,
  seems to be derived from an efflux of the Mediterranean water           (§ 75).
     105. The length of the narrower portion of the Strait (see           Chart II.),
 sometimes     distinguished as the Gut, is about 35 miles.          Its width, which
 is about 22 miles between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel, gradually diminishes
 to somewhat more than 9 miles between Tarifa and Alcazar point ; and
 then increases until it reaches 1 2 miles between Gibraltar and Ceuta, east
 ward of which the Strait terminates abruptly in the wide basin of the Medi
 terranean. The deepest portion of the Strait is at its eastern extremity ;
 its depth between Gibraltar and Ceuta reaching 517 fathoms, and averaging
 about 300 (Section c d.). From this the bottom gradually but irregularly
 slopes upwards (Section a b) as far as the western extremity of the Gut,
 where the shallowest water is to be found.               The northern half of the
 channel across the section between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar (Section e f)
 scarcely anywhere exceeds 50 fathoms ; whilst its southern half does not
 seem anywhere to reach 200, and may be considered to average 150 fathoms.
 On the Atlantic side of this ridge the bottom gradually slopes downwards,
 until it reaches, at 40 miles westward, a depth about equal to that which
 it has between Gibraltar and Ceuta. This ridge, therefore, constitutes a
kind of marine " watershed," separating the Inland basin of the Medi
 terranean from the great Oceanic basin of the Atlantic.
     10G. Through the central part of this Strait a current almost invariably
sets eastward, or from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean.             This current
is most rapid in the narrower part of the Gut, where the inflow usually
has a rate of from two to three miles an hour ; this rate sometimes rising
to four miles, or even occasionally (as stated by Gibraltar pilots to Admiral
Smyth) to five ; whilst the current is sometimes so reduced in speed as to
be scarcely perceptible,       even giving place (though very rarely) to a con
trary   movement     or  outflow  from the Mediterranean towards the Atlantic.
These variations are partly due to Tidal influence, which is here very de
cided, and which may either concur with or oppose the general current.
When the tide is flowing, its motion is westwards, or in opposition to the
current   ;  and at spring-tide this motion may be sufficiently powerful to
check the current, or even to reverse its direction for a short time.           When
the tide is ebbing, on the other hand, its motion is eastwards, or in the
direction of the current     ;  and it is to the ebb of spring-tides that the occa
sional augmentation in the rate of the current to        5 miles an hour is probably

attributable.  These effects will, of course, be most marked when the tidal
movement is augmented by a strong wind in its own direction*. — The
constant current does not occupy by any means the entire breadth of the
Strait. In its narrowest part the rapid central in-current is said by Admiral
Smyth not to average more than 4 miles in width ; and on either side the
stream when moving inwards is usually much less rapid, its rate, indepen
dent of tide, being about 1 mile per hour in the neighbourhood of Tarifa,
and 2 miles an hour on the coast of Africa. These lateral currents are
much more affected    than the central current by the Lunar tide, which
produces a complete periodical reversal of them ; the flood at springs run
ning westwards off Tarifa at the rate of from 2 to 3 miles per hour, whilst
even at neaps it runs westwards at 1 mile per hour.  The ebb, on the other
hand, concurs with the general current, and augments both its volume and
its rate. Thus, when the water is falling, the whole stream is running
eastwards      ;    but when it is rising, the tide on either shore sets westwards.
By taking          advantageof this periodical westerly flow in the lateral streams,
it is possible for sailing-vessels to make their way outwards f in opposition
to a continued westerly wind.
   107. The rate of the general in-current diminishes immediately that it
discharges itself into the Mediterranean basin, over the surface of which
it seems to spread itself, in virtue of its lower Specific Gravity (§ 92).
But the influence of its motion is sensibly experienced along the Spanish
Coast as far as Cape de_Gat, and along the African Coast even as far as
the Bay of Tunis, —its force and direction, however, being greatly affected
by the prevalent winds.
   108. Various hypotheses have been put forward at different times to ac
count for this continual influx of Atlantic water into the Mediterranean.
The motion of             an undercurrent flowing in the opposite direction was very
                                            J
early suggested by Dr. Smith ; but he did not attempt to show in what
way motion is given either to the surface inflow or to the deep outflow.
Quite recently the extraordinary hypothesis has been seriously put forward,
that the influx through the Strait may be due to a gradual depression of
the bottom now going on§.   The explanation usually received is that first
offered by Dr. Halley||, who attributed it to the excess of evaporation
from the surface of the Mediterranean Sea over the whole amount returned
to its basin either directly by rainfall or by the rivers which discharge
themselves, into it ; so that the level would be progressively lowered, if not
kept up by an inflow from the Atlantic. The obvious objection to this
explanation         is,
              that as the water which passes off               by
                                                  evaporation leaves
its Salt behind            it,   and as the water which enters through   the Strait   is

charged with the ordinary proportion of salt, there must be a progressive
increase in the density of the water of the Mediterranean until it reaches
the point of saturation.  This objection has been met by another hypo
thesis, viz. that although the surface-water of the Mediterranean shows
very little excess of density, there may be a great increase in the propor
tion of salt held in solution in the waters of its abyssal depths ; and it has
even been surmised that a deposit       of salt is taking place on its bottom.
   109.   This hypothesis seemed to derive support from the analysis made
 by  Dr.  Wollaston   in 1828*, of a sample of bottom-water brought up by
 Admiral Smyth from a depth of 670 fathoms, at a point about 50 miles
 within the Strait; which analysis gave the extraordinary percentage of
  17*3 parts of Salt, with a Sp. Gr. of 1-1288, — the proportion of Salt in
 ordinary sea-water being about 3-5 per cent., and its usual Sp. Gr. about
 T027. But as Dr. Wollaston's analyses of two other samples of Mediter
 ranean water, taken respectively from depths of 450 and 400 fathoms, at
 distances of G80 and 450 miles eastward of the Strait, showed that their
 density but little exceeded that of ordinary sea- water, it was pretty clear
 that the first result was anomalous, and that in whatever way it was to be
 accounted fort, it did not represent the general condition of the deep
water of the Mediterranean.       (See §§ 43, 44.)
    110. The inquiries detailed in the previous Section of this Report have
conclusively shown (1) That there is a general excess of Salinity in the
water of the Mediterranean over that of the Atlantic; (2) That this
excess does not pass beyond very narrow limits ; (3) That it is least in
*ur/ace-water the proportion of salt in which is only about 4'7 per cent,
above that contained in the surface-water of the Atlantic;        (4) That
it is greatest in bottom-v/Ater the proportion of salt in which may reach
about 9 per cent, above that contained in the bottom-water of the Atlantic,
this last not being more — and apparently somewhat less — dense than the
surface-water of the same ocean.         Our inquiries were almost entirely
limited to the Western basin, in which bottom-water of the highest density
seemed to prevail at the shallower depths (§ 93).      The single sounding
which was taken in the Eastern basin, at a depth greater than any else
where reached, gave us a sample of which the excess was 6-7 per cent.
  111. From these results it seems a justifiable inference that the evapora
tion from the water of the Mediterranean basin is in excess of the amount
of fresh water returned into     occasioning an increase of its density but
                                 it,                                           ;
that this increase, notwithstanding the constant influx of salt water from
the Atlantic, is  in some way kept in check, probably through an efflux of
the denser water    by   an undercurrent, as originally    by Dr. Smith
                                                          suggested
in 1673. This     the view adopted

accounts that have been recorded of vessels sunk in the narrower part of
the Strait having floated up near Tangier*. But to these accounts no great
importance is assigned by Admiral Smythf, who seems inclined to attribute
the occurrences — if they really took place as narrated — to the action of
the lateral Surface-outflow.
   112. The only objection that has been advanced, so far as we are aware,
to the hypothesis of a westerly undercurrent, is based on the existence of
the comparatively shallow ridge which (as already stated) crosses the
western end of the Gut between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel.         The exist
ence of this ridge, in the opinion of Sir Charles Lyell J,
                                                           " has dispelled the
idea which was once popular that there was a counter-current at a consi
derable depth in the Straits of Gibraltar, by which the water which flows
in from the Atlantic is restored to that ocean." — But the validity of this
objection has been disputed, and we think successfully, by Captain Maury,
who, after citing many cases in which a deep current comes up to near the
surface, concludes as follows : — " To my mind the proofs derived from rea
son and analogy are as clear          in favour of this undercurrent from the Me
diterranean, as they were            in favour of Leverrier's planet before it was
seen through the telescope          at Berlin "§.
   113. The analogy of the Red Sea and the incurrent through the Strait
of Babelmandeb, which is adduced by Capt. Maury in support of this view,
is a very cogent one.   The evaporation from the Red Sea is well known to
be enormous, its annual amount being estimated by Dr. Buist as equal to
a sheet of water eight feet thick, corresponding in area with the whole ex
panse of that sea.    Of the whole amount of fresh water thus drawn off,
scarcely any is returned either by rivers or rains.   But the level is kept
np by a strong current that continually sets in through the Strait of
Babelmandeb ; and as this current brings in salt water, there would be
a continual and very rapid accumulation of salt in the trough of the Red
Sea if the denser water were not carried off by an outward current beneath.
Now since all the observations hitherto made upon the density of the water
of the Red Sea show it to be very little greater than that of the Indian
Ocean     there would seem no escape from the conclusion that such

the surface inflow     ;  and  (2) to determine, by the Temperature, the Specific
 Gravity, and the Composition of         samples of water taken up at different
points   and   from   different  depths, whether they had been drawn from the
Atlantic or from the Mediterranean basin. — The mechanical method was
entirely devised and carried out, with the practical ability for which he is
eminently distinguished, by our excellent friend Staff-Captain Calver (see
§ 37). The physical and chemical observations, which were made under
our own direction, gave results which harmonize completely with those of
the mechanical, where both could be employed together ; and supply a
deficiency which the impossibility of applying the mechanical test on the
uneven bottom       of the shallow ridge would otherwise have left, in the proof
of the outflow of Mediterranean water over it.
    115. Our investigations were first made in the mid-stream between
Gibraltar and Ceuta, at nearly the narrowest part of the Strait, where its
depth exceeds 500, fathoms (Chart II. Section c d).          The decided retarda
tion of the   boat     the  "              " at 100 fathoms in both sets of experi
                   by         current-drag
ments (§§ 40, 62) showed that the in-current at that depth has less than half
the velocity of the surface-current.       When the " current-drag " was lowered
to 250 fathoms, there was in the First set of experiments simply a further
increase  of retardation, the boat being kept almost in a stationary position :
we felt justified, however, in inferring that the strain of the " current-drag
                                                                                  "
could not have so nearly neutralized the action not only of the surface-
current, but also of the wind, upon the boat from which it was suspended,
if it had not been itself acted on by a counter-current. And this view
derived very strong confirmation from the evidence afforded by the Tem
perature, the Specific Gravity, and the Density of the water in the 250
fathoms' stratum. For, in the first place, the surface-temperature being 66°,
and the temperature at 1 00 fathoms having fallen to 550,7, no further reduc
tion showed itself below that stratum ; the water at 250 fathoms, like the
bottom-water at 517 fathoms, having exactly the same temperature as the
water at   1 00 fathoms. This, as we have seen, is the uniform rule in the Medi
terranean,    whilst far otherwise in the Atlantic. Further, the Specific Gravity
and the proportion of Salt in the water at 250 fathoms indicated a density
which no Atlantic water possesses, and which was not exceeded in any
sample obtained from the Mediterranean.             There could be no question,
therefore, that the stratum at 250 fathoms must be Mediterranean water ;
so that, if not absolutely stationary, it must be moving westwards.           Now
this westerly movement was distinctly demonstrated in our Second set of
 experiments, by the motion of the boat from which the
                                                                 " current-drag "
 was suspended      (§ 62) ; and since the observations on the Temperature,
 Specific Gravity, and Salinity of the water in this stratum, which were
 then repeated, gave results almost precisely identical with those made on
the previous occasion, it seems fair to conclude that there was a westerly
 current in this stratum in the First, as well as in the Second instance,
though its effect on the current-drag was masked by the stronger antago-

 nistic forces acting on the boat. — The same observations apply to the 400
 fathoms' stratum.         In the First    set of experiments, the boat moved with
 the surface-current,       but at little more than a quarter its rate ; and this
 retardation, taken in connection with the distinct Physical and Chemical
 indications that the 400 fathoms' stratum was Mediterranean and not
 Atlantic water, might fairly be taken as evidence that the force acting on
the "current-drag" was antagonistic in its direction to the surface-forces
acting on the boat, though less powerful than in the 250 fathoms' stratum.
This inference also was justified by the results of the Second set of experi
ments (§ 62), which showed us the boat carried westwards, though at a
                              "       "
less  rate than when the        drag      hung in the 250 fathoms' stratum. — It was
not a    little remarkable to find in both sets of observations, that the water
of this lower stratum is of less density than that which overlies it at 250
fathoms, though still unmistakably Mediterranean ; and it may hence be
pretty certainly inferred that the denser middle stratum is drawn by cur
rent-action       from some intermediate part of the Mediterranean basin at
which the maximum density prevails (§ 93), and that it is flowing with a
gradual upward inclination, so as at last to pass over the ridge at the op
posite extremity       of the Strait.     On no other hypothesis does it seem pos
sible to explain the persistence of this condition, — supposing it to be uni
form, as the close conformity of observations made after an interval of six
weeks would indicate that it is.
    116.     Although   we should have been very glad to repeat our experiments
at some     intermediate Section, yet, as our time did not allow of our carrying
them out in more than one other locality, we considered               it desirable to
proceed at once to the western extremity of the Strait, where its breadth
greatly increases, whilst its depth is yet more than proportionally reduced.
As already stated (§ 66), the bottom is here characterized by great in
equalities; channels of from 150 to 190 fathoms' depth existing in the
immediate neighbourhood of shallows of not less than 50 fathoms (see
Section e      f).   In  accordance   with the greater breadth of this part of the
Strait, the easterly surface-current flows at a much lower speed than in
its narrower channel ; its rate being reduced from nearly 3 miles to little
more than 1| mile per hour.                The use of the "current-drag" at 100
fathoms from the surface, in a part of the channel of which the depth was
 147   fathoms, did not indicate any reduction in this rate; but a decided
reduction was shown when the "drag" was lowered to 150 fathoms in a
part    of the channel of which the depth approached 200 fathoms (§ 67).
As Capt. Calver deemed it inexpedient to lower the "current-drag" to a
greater depth, since it would         have   been  certain to foul against the rocky
bottom, we were unable to ascertain by Mechanical means that the stratum
of water immediately overlying that bottom has an outward movement ;
but whilst the existence       of such   an outflow may be regarded as a necessary
 inference     from the existence of       a powerful outward undercurrent at the
opposite extremity of the Strait, valid evidence of it was afforded by the

fact that both the Temperature and the Density of the bottom-water
brought up at two stations (Nos. 65 and 67), from 198 and 188 fathoms
respectively, unmistakably indicated its derivation from the Mediterranean
basin. Although its density corresponded rather with that of the 400
fathoms' stratum than with that of the 250 fathoms' stratum at the other
end of the Strait, yet it may be very well conceived to be the water of the
250 fathoms' stratum reduced in density during its outward flow through
the Strait by intermixture with the less dense water of the in-current.
    1 1 7. It now no longer then admits of doubt that the water of the deeper
part of the Mediterranean basin, which has undergone concentration by
evaporation, is continually flowing outwards into the Atlantic, notwith
standing that in doing so it has to be brought nearer the surface, so as to
pass    over  the ridge  ;  and that the increase of density in the Mediter
ranean water, which would otherwise           go on without check so long as the
loss by evaporation is in excess of the fresh water returned into the basin,
is thus kept within a very narrow limit.
    118. The essential phenomena of the Gibraltar Current having been
thus determined, we have to consider how they are to be accounted for j
that is to say, to inquire (1) what is the power which gives motion to
the enormous body of water continually flowing from the Atlantic into
the Mediterranean      ;  (2) what it is which not only        gives   motion to the
undercurrent flowing from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, but draws
up the heavier water from the depths of the former to the comparative
shallow of its limiting ridge ; and (3) in what way the power is generated
 in each case.
    119.   These questions have been answered — as we believe correctly-s-by
Captain Maury*, on the hypothetical assumption of the existence of an
undercurrent, which has now been verified.             He shows that in each case
 Gravity is the impelling power      ;   and that in both cases this power ori
ginates from a common source          — the    excess of evaporation beyond the
return of fresh water by rain and rivers, which produces at the same time
a reduction of the level, and an increase in the density, of the water
•within the Mediterranean       basin  ;  the former drawing in surface-water by
gravitation from the higher level outside, whilst the latter forces out deeper
 water by the excess of pressure of the superincumbent column.                As the
vertical circulation thus occasioned has not yet, so far as we are aware, been
formularized     under First Principles, and as these principles have a much
more extended application than Capt. Maury himself seems to have sup
posed, we shall now present them in a systematic form.
    120. The following appear to be self-evident propositions: —
    I. That wherever there is a difference of level between two bodies of Water
 in free communication with each other, there will be a tendency towards
the equalization of their levels by a surface-flow from the height towards
 the lower.

1870.]
    II.   That    so long  as the difference      of level is maintained, so long    will
this flow continue ; and thus any agency which permanently keeps the level
of one body of water below that of the other (unless it directly antagonize
the downward pressure         of the higher water*), will maintain a permanent
surface-flow from the higher towards the lower.                This constant tendency
to equalization will keep the actual difference of           level within very narrow
limits.
    III.   That wherever there is      a want  of equilibrium arising from difference
of density      between two columns      of water in communication with each other,
there will     be a tendency towards the restoration of equilibrium by a flow
from the lowest stratum of the denser column towards that of the lighter,
in virtue of the excess of pressure to which the former is subjected.
    IV. That so long as the like difference of density is maintained, so
long will this flow continue ; and thus any agency which permanently dis
turbs the equilibrium in the same sense, either by increasing the density
of one column, or by diminishing that of the other, will keep up a perma
nent flow from the lower stratum of the denser towards that of the less
dense. — This constant tendency to restoration of equilibrium will keep the
actual difference of density within definite limits.
    V. That if there be at the same time a difference                 of level and    an
excess    of density on the side of the shorter column, there will be a ten
 dency    to  the restoration of the level by a a«r/ace-flow from the higher to
 the lower, and a tendency to the restoration of the equilibrium by an under-
 flow   in the opposite direction from the heavier to the lighter column.
    VI. That so long as the difference of level and the difference of
 density are maintained, in the same sense, so long will each flow continue ;
 and thus a vertical circulation will be kept up by any continuous agency
 which alters at the same time both the level and the density of the two
 bodies of water, —provided that the excess of density is on the side of the,
 lower column.
    VII.     That the rate of each flow, where it is not confined within defi
 nite limits,    will depend simply upon the amount of disturbauce, in the one
 case of level, and in the other of density ; and when this disturbance is
 small, it may be so slow as to be almost imperceptible, though not less
real and effective.        But if the communication between the two bodies of
water take place through a long narrow channel, the rate of movement will
increase so as to produce a decided current in each direction ; since the
     * Thus it has been shown by Archdeacon Pratt, that in eonsequenoe of the local
 attraction produced by the high land of Asia, with nothing but Ocean to the southward,
 the sea-level at the mouth of the Indus is no less than 515 feet above that at Cape
 Comorin (Philosophical Transactions, 1859, p. 795). So, again, if Barometric pres
 sure be lower over any Oceanic area than on other parts of the surface, there will be an
 elevation of the water-level in that area, equilibrium being reached when the excess of
Water-pressure becomes equal to the deficiency of Air-pressure.     (See Mr. T. (J. Brent
 in Philos. Transact. 18G7, p. 5.)
                                                                          b2

moving force will then act as a constantly accelerating one, until any further
increase in rate is prevented by the opposing influence of friction, &c.
    121. Now such an agency as that which is required by Principles VI.
and   VII. to maintain a double current in a narrow Strait actually exists
in the cases of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.             It must be borne in
mind in considering these, that whilst their basins are limited, the Ocean-
 basins at the other end   of their respective   Straits are practically unlimited ;
so that the levels and densities of     the  latter may be regarded as constant.
 Now as the excess of evaporation in the Mediterranean basin at the same time
lowers the level and increases the density of the water which remains, the
 reduction of the level gives rise to a continual surface-inflow.        But, on the
 other hand, the restoration of the level by an inflow of salt water, the den
 sity of the contents of the Mediterranean basin being already in excess,
 occasions a constant want of equilibrium between the columns of water at
the two extremities of the Strait ; and as the lighter water of the Atlantic
 cannot balance the heavier water of the Mediterranean, a portion of the
latter is forced outwards as an undercurrent, — thus again producing a de
pression of the level, to be again restored by a surface-inflow from the At
lantic. —Thus the original moving force of both currents is the heat of the
 Sun.
    122. The case may perhaps be made still plainer, by considering the effect
 of changes in its conditions.     If the  whole amount lost by the evaporation
from the surface of the Mediterranean were replaced by the fresh water of
rain and rivers, there would be neither lowering of its surface nor increase
of its density   ; and there would be neither influx nor efflux through the
 Strait of Gibraltar. If, again, with the present excess of evaporation, the
Atlantic were to supply fresh water instead of salt, the influx through the
 Strait of Gibraltar would be only that required to maintain the level, and
thus to supply the loss by excess of evaporation ; and as the columns at the
two extremities of the Strait would remain in constant equilibrium, there
would be no efflux.         But as the water which flows in from the At
lantic is salt instead of fresh, and is itself rendered still more dense by con
centration in the Mediterranean,         the constantly renewed excess in the
weight of the Mediterranean column can only relieve itself by as continual
an efflux : this efflux, by lowering the surface-level, in its turn occasions
an indraught to maintain it ; and thus the in-current has to replace not
only the fresh water lost by excess of evaporation, but also the denser water
forced out by its excess of weight.         These two agencies, like the pertur
bations of the Planets, are so balanced against one another, as to maintain
a constant mean. If the evaporation were to increase, more Atlantic water
would flow in    ;  but the increase    of density in the Mediterranean water
would cause more of it to flow out, which again would occasion a larger
indraught of the less dense water of the Atlantic. And thus the excess
of density would    be kept down to a very moderate amount, — as is actually
found to be the case in the Red Sea, notwithstanding             that the enormous

  loss by evaporation from its surface is scarcely at all replaced by fresh water
  either from rain or rivers.
      123.  Now   if it can be shown that a similar     vertical circulation is main
  tained in the opposite direction, when the conditions of the case are altogether
 reversed, the explanation above given may, it is submitted, be regarded
  as having a valid title to acceptance.        Such a converse case is presented
 by the Baltic, an inland basin which communicates with the German Ocean
  by three channels — the Sound, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt— of
 which the Sound is the principal.         The amount of fresh water discharged
 into the Baltic is largely in excess of the quantity lost from its surface by
 evaporation ; and thus its level would be continually raised, if it were not
 kept down by a constant surface-current, which passes outwards through
 the channels just mentioned.       But the influx of fresh water reduces the
 density of the Baltic water ; and as the water which the outward current
 is continually carrying off contains a large quantity of salt, there would be
 a progressive reduction of that density, so that the basin would at last come
 to be filled with fresh water, if it were not for a deeper inflow.            Such an
 inflow of denser water might be predicted on Principle VI. as a Physical
necessity, arising from the constant want of equilibrium between the lighter
column at the Baltic end of the Sound and the heavier column at its out
let in the German Ocean ; and that such an undercurrent into the Baltic
has an actual existence, was proved two hundred years ago by an experiment
 of the same kind as that by which we have recently proved the existence
of an undercurrent out of the Mediterranean.             This experiment    is cited by
Dr. Smith (loc. cit.) in his discussion of the Gibraltar Current, as supply
 ing an analogical argument for his hypothesis of the existence of an under
current in the Strait of Gibraltar ; but he does not make any attempt to
assign a Physical cause for the movement in either case*. —The condition of
the Euxine is precisely parallel to that of the Baltic ; and a surface-current
is well known to be constantly flowing outwards through the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles, carrying with it (as in the case of the Baltic) a large
 quantity of salt.      Now as the enormous volume of fresh water discharged
into the Euxine by the Danube, the Dnieper, and the Don would in time
wash the whole of the salt out of its basin, it is obvious that its density can
only be maintained at its constant amount (about two-fifths that of ordinary
sea-water) by a continual inflow of denser water from the JEgean, — the
existence    of which inflow, therefore, may    be predicted on the double ground
of   a priori and a posteriori necessity.
                       General Oceanic Circulation.
     124. The difference as to Level and Density between two bodies of sea-
water, which produces the vertical circulation in the Strait of Gibraltar
    * Prof. Forcbhammer fully confirms Dr. Smith's  statement ; and further shows that
the water which thus returns to the Baltic has the density of Sound water, the surfaces
current being formed of the much lighter Baltic water.

214                       Messrs. Carpenter and Jeffreys on                        [Dec« &i
and the Baltic Sound,   may be brought about otherwise than by the
excess of evaporation which maintains it in the one case, or by the
continual dilution with fresh water which maintains it in the other.
It   may be easily shown that a constant and decided Difference of Tem
perature must     have exactly the same effect. Let the Mediterranean
basin be supposed to be filled with water of the same density as that of
the Atlantic, and up to the same level ; and to be then cooled down below
the freezing-point of fresh water by the withdrawal of Solar heat, whilst
the surface of the Atlantic continues to be heated,                  as at present, by the
almost tropical sunshine of the Gibraltar summer. The cooling of the
Mediterranean column, reducing its bulk without any diminution of weight,
would at the same time lower its level and increase its density.     An in
draught of Atlantic water must take place through the Strait to restore that
level   ; but this indraught would augment the weight of the column, giving
it   an excess above that of the column at the other end of the Strait ; and
to restore the equilibrium a portion of its deeper water must be forced out
as an undercurrent towards the Atlantic, thus again reducing the surface-
level of the Mediterranean.     Now so long as the warm Atlantic water
which comes in to maintain that level is in its turn subjected fo the same
cooling, with consequent lowering of level and increase of density, so long
would the vertical pressures of the two columns, which would be speedily
restored to equilibrium if both basius were subjected to the same heat or
the same cold, remain in a constant state of inequality; and so long,
therefore, on Principles V. &        VI. (§      120), must this vertical        circulation
continue.
    125. Now the case thus put hypothetically has a real existence. For the
Mediterranean cooled down by the withdrawal of Solar heat, let us sub
stitute the Polar Basin ; and for the Atlantic, the Equatorial Ocean. The
antagonistic conditions of Temperature being constantly sustained, a con
stant interchange between Polar and Equatorial waters, through the seas
of the Temperate Zone, must be the result. The reduction in the tem
perature of the Polar column must diminish its height whilst augmenting
its density ; and thus a flow of the upper stratum of Equatorial water
must take place towards the Poles, to maintain the level thus lowered.
But when the column has been thus restored to an equality of height, it
will         such an excess of weight that its downward pressure must
        possess
force out a portion of its deeper water ; and thus an underflow of ice-cold
water will be occasioned from the Polar towards the Equatorial areas.
   126. The agency of Polar Cold will be exerted, not merely in reducing
the bulk of the water exposed to       it,
                                   and thereby at the same time lowering
its level and increasing its density, but            also     in imparting   a   downward
movement        to each    new surface-stratum       as     its    temperature isreduced,
whereby continual indraughtVill be occasioned
            a                                                     from the warmer surface-
stratum around.     For the water thus newly brought under the same cool
ing influence will descend in its turn  and thus, as the lowest stratum will

be  continually flowing off, a constant motion from above downwards will
continue to take place in the entire column, so long as a fresh stratum is
continually being exposed to the influence of surface-cold.
   127- On the other hand, the agency of Equatorial Heat, though directly-
operating on only a thin film of surface-water, will gradually pump-up (so
to speak}   the Polar water which has reached its area by creeping along
the deepest parts of the intermediate Oceanic basins.        For since, as already
shown, an indraught of the upper stratum surrounding the Polar basin must
be continually going on, the place of the water thus removed must be sup
plied by water drawn from a still greater distance ; and thus the movement
will be propagated backwards, until it affects the upper stratum of the
Equatorial area itself, which will flow off Pole-wards, bearing with it a
large measure of Heat.        The cold and dense Polar water, as it flows in at
the bottom of the Equatorial column, will not directly take the place of
that which has been draughted off from the surface ; but this place will
be filled by the rising of the whole superincumbent column, which, being
warmer, is also lighter than the cold stratum beneath.         Every new arrival
from the Poles will take its place below that which precedes             since its it,
temperature will have been less affected               by
                                                 contact with the warmer water
 above it.   In this way an ascending movement will be imparted to the
 whole Equatorial column, and in due course every portion of                   will      it
 come under the influence of the surface-heat of the Sun.          This heat will
 of course raise the level of the Equatorial column, without augmenting its
 absolute weight and will thus add to the tendency of its surface-stratum
                  ;
 to flow towards the lowered level of the Polar area.          But as the super
 heating extends but        short way down, and as the temperature of the
                             a
 water beneath, down to the " stratum of intermixture
                                                            " 80), very mo(§       is
 derate, whilst the water below that stratum          almost as cold as that of
                                                             is
 the Polar basin,  it    evidently in the latter that the force which maintains
                        is
 this vertical circulation chiefly originates.
     128. Here, then, we have         a   vera causa for    a   General Oceanic Circulation,
 which, being sustained only by the unequal distribution of Solar Heat,
 will be entirely independent of any peculiar distribution of Land and
 Water, provided always that this does not prevent the free communication
 between the Polar and Equatorial Oceanic areas, at their depths as well as
 at their surface.   That this agency has been so little recognized by
 Physical Geographers, we can only attribute to the prevalence of the
 erroneous idea of the uniform deep-water temperature of 39°, of which
 the Temperature-observations    made in our Expeditions     of 1868 and
 1869 have shown the fallacy.    Until      clearly apprehended that Sea-

to the application of heat at the bottom, the motor power of which is
universally admitted, — being practically utilized in keeping up the circula
tion through the hot-water Warming-Apparatus               now in general use *. The
movement thus maintained would not, on the hypothesis, be a rapid one,
but a gradual creeping flow ; since the absence of limit would prevent the
power which sustains it from acting as an accelerating force, as it would
do if the Equatorial and Polar areas were connected only by a narrow
channel,     like the Atlantic     Ocean and the Mediterranean             Sea  (§   120,
Princ.    VII.).
    129. That the Vertical Circulation here advocated on a priori grounds
actually takes place in any mass of Salt water of which one part is exposed
to surface-Cold and another to surface-Heat, is capable of ready experi
 mental proof: — Let a long narrow trough with glass sides be filled with
 salt water ; and let heat be applied at one end (the Equatorial) by means
 of a thick bar of metal laid along the surface, with a prolongation carried
 over the end of the trough into the flame of a spirit-lamp ; whilst cold is
 applied at the other (the Polar) by means of a freezing-mixture contained
in a metallic box made to lie upon the surface, or (more simply) by means
 of a piece of ice wedged in between the sides of the trough.              A circulation
 will immediately commence in the direction indicated by the theory ; as
 may be readily shown by introducing some blue colouring liquid at the
 Polar surface, and some red liquid at the Equatorial surface.                 The blue
 liquid, as it is cooled, at once descends to the bottom, then travels
 slowly along it until it reaches the Equatorial end of the trough, then
 gradually rises towards the heated bar, and thence creeps along the surface
 back to the Polar end ; the red liquid first creeps along the surface
 towards the Polar end, and then travels through              exactly the same course
 as the blue had previously done         f.
     130.   That such  a Vertical Circulation really takes place in Oceanic "Water,
 and that its influence in moderating the excessive Cold of the Polar Areas
 and the excessive Heat of the Equatorial region is far more important than
 that of any surface-currents, seems to us a legitimate deduction from the
 facts stated in the Report of the ' Porcupine' Expedition for 1869.                 For,
 on the one hand, it was shown (§§ 1 16-1 18) that there is a general diffusion
 of  an almost glacial    temperature on the bottom of the deep Ocean-basins,
    * The only scientific writer who  has even approached what appears to us the truth
 on this point is Captain Maury, who has put forward the doctrine of a general inter
 change of water between the Equator and the Poles, resulting from a difference of
 Specific Gravity caused inter alia by difference of Temperature. But, as Mr. Croll
  remarks, " although Cnpt. Maury has expounded his views on tho causo of Ocean-
 currents at great length in the various editions of his work, yet it is somewhat difficult
 to discover what they really are. This arises from the generally confused and sometimes
 contradictory nature of his hydrodynamical conceptions." See Mr. Croll's Paper " On

" stratum of intermixture," in which there is such a rapid change of Tem

movement cannot be attributed to any such local influences as those which
produce the Gulf-stream or any other currents put in motion by surface-
action.     Of such a movement, it was contended, we have a marked example
in that north-easterly flow which conveys the warmth of Southern latitudes
 to the West of Ireland and Scotland, the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe
 islands, Iceland, Spitzbergen, and the Polar basin generally.            This flow,
 of whose existence conclusive evidence is derived from observations of the
 Temperature of these regions, is commonly regarded as a prolongation of
 the Gulf-stream    ;  and this view is maintained not only by Dr. Petermann*,
 who     has recently collected and digested these observations with the
 greatest   care, but also    by Prof. Wyville Thomson f, as well as by Mr.
 Croll %. Having      elsewhere   fully stated our objections to this doctrine, and
 discussed the validity of the arguments adduced in support of it §, we
 shall here only record the conclusions which a careful examination of the
 present state of our knowledge of the subject has led us to form : —
     I. That there is no evidence, either from the Surface-temperature
  of the Sea or from the temperature of sea-bord Stations along the
 western coast of Southern Europe, that the Climate of that region is
  ameliorated by a flow of Ocean-water having a temperature higher than
  that of the Latitude, — the surface- temperature of the Mediterranean Sea,
  which is virtually excluded from all Oceanic Circulation, being higher than
  that of the eastern margin of the Atlantic in corresponding latitudes, and
  the Climate of sea-bord Stations on the Mediterranean being warmer than
  that of Stations corresponding to them in Latitude on the Atlantic Coast ;
  and this    not merely in summer, but also in winter.                 This Oceanic
  region may    therefore  be  designated   the neutral  area.

   II. That the evidence of Climatic amelioration increases in propor
tion as we pass Northwards from the neutral area, becoming very decided
at the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe islands ; but that, as was shown by
       *
the        Porcupine' Temperature-soundings               of   1869, the flow   of warm water
which  produces this amelioration                    extends to a       depth of at least 70O
fathoms.
     III.
        That this deep stratum of Warm water can be shown, by the corre
spondence in the rate of its Diminution of Temperature with depth, to be de
rived from the neutral area to the south-west ; where, as is shown by the
•
     Porcupine' temperature-soundings of                1870,   it is         by a distinct
                                                                        separated
*'
     stratum of intermixture
                             " from the                          stratum that carries Polar
                                                       deeper
waters towards the Equator.
  IV. That the slow north-easterly movement                         of such
                                                         a mass of water
cannot, on any known Hydrodynamical     principles, be attributed to pro
pulsive power derived from the Gulf-stream ; the last distinctly traced
edge of which is reduced to a stratum certainly not exceeding 50 fathoms
in depth, and not improbably less.
   V. That, on the other hand, this alow Pole-ward movement of the upper
warm layer of the North Atlantic, down to the " stratum of intermixture,"
is exactly what might be expected to take place as the complement of the
flow of glacial water from the Polar to the Equatorial area, the two
movements constituting              a   General vertical Oceanic Circulation.
     VI. That                           that the quantity of Water dis
                      there is a strong probability
charged by the Gulf-stream has been greatly over-estimated, in consequence
of the rate of the surface-current having been assumed as the rate of
movement through the whole sectional area, which is contrary to all
analogy ; whilst there is also a strong probability that there is a reverse
undercurrent of cold water through the Narrows, derived from the Polar
current that is distinctly traceable nearly to its mouth. The upper stratum
of this southerly current comes to the surface between the Gulf-stream
and the coast of the United States ; whilst its deeper and colder stratum
underlies the Gulf-stream itself*.
   VII. That there is a strong probability that the quantity of Heat
carried off by the water of the Gulf-stream has been greatly over-estimated ;
                                                                         '
the Temperature-soundings taken during the Cruise of the ' Porcupine in
the Mediterranean having shown that the very high temperature of the
surface       extends    but   a   little way down, whilst the Temperature-observa
tions in the Atlantic show that the              descent into a cold stratum beneath
     * That   there is a slow southerly movementof Arctic water beneath the Gulf-stream
is indicated by the fact that icebergs  hare been seen moving southwards in direct op
position to its surface-flow, their deeply immersed portion presenting a larger surface
to the lower stratum than their upper part does to the more superficial layer, — as in
the case of our " current-drag."     And similar evidence is afforded by the southward
drift of the buoy winch was attached to the Atlantic Cable of 1865, but which broke
away from       it,
                apparently carrying with      great length of the wire rope by which
                                                ita                                          it
had been attached.

may be very rapid.          Hence the average of 65° assumed by Mr. Croll on
the basis of observations made at considerable intervals of depth is alto
gether unreliable.
    VIII.     That the most recent and trustworthy observations indicate
that the edge of the Gulf-stream to the north-east of the Banks of
Newfoundland, is so thinned out and broken up by interdigitation with
Polar currents, that its existence as a continuous current beyond that
region cannot be proved by observations, either of Temperature or Move
ment.
    IX.     That the Gulf-stream       and other local        currents put in motion
by the Trade-winds or other influences acting on the surface only, will
have as their complement in a horizontal circulation return surface-
currents    ; and that the horizontal circulation of which the Atlantic Equatorial
Current and the Gulf-stream constitute the first part, is completed — so far
as the Northern Hemisphere is concerned — partly by the direct return of
one large section of the Gulf-stream into the Equatorial Current, and,
as to the other section,        by the superficial Polar currents, which make
their way southwards, the principal of them even reaching the commence
ment of the Gulf-stream.
     132.  In   conclusion it may be added that the doctrine of a General
Vertical Oceanic Circulation is in remarkable accordance with the fact now
placed beyond doubt by the concurrent evidence of a great number of
 observations, that whilst the Density of Oceanic water, which is lowest in
the Polar area, progressively increases as we approach the Tropics, it again
 shows a decided reduction in the Intertropical area.               It has been thought
that an explanation of this fact is to be found in the large amount of rain
 fall, and of inflow of fresh water from great rivers, in the Intertropical
 region ; but it is to be remembered that the surface-evaporation also is
there the most excessive j so that some more satisfactory account of the
 fact seems requisite.       Such an explanation is afforded by the doctrine here
 advocated,     the Polar water which flows towards the Equator along the
 bottom of the ocean-basins being there (so to speak) pumped up and brought
 to the surface *.     And it is not a little confirmatory of the views advanced in
 this Report, that in a recent elaborate discussion of the facts relating to
 the Comparative Density of Oceanic Water on different parts of the Earth's
 surface, the doctrine of a General Vertical Circulation is advocated as
 affording the only feasible rationale of them f.
    * That   water of a lower should thus underlie water of a higher degree of Salinity,
 in travelling from the Pole to the Equator, is not difficult to account for, when the rela
 tive Temperatures of the two strata are borne in mind.

     In
      this paper the author, embodying with his own the observations of
previous writers on the physical geology of Great Britain, especially those
of Murchison, Godwin-Austen, Ramsay, Phillips, and the late Professor
Jukes, showed that the Coal-measures were originally distributed over
large tracts of England, to the north and to the south of central ridge or
                                                                  a
barrier of Old Silurian and Cambrian rocks, which stretched across the country
from North Wales and Shropshire into the Eastern Counties, skirting the
southern margin of the South Staffordshire Coal-field.      This barrier, or
ridge, was  land-surface till the close of the Carboniferous period.
              a
   To the north of the central barrier, the highlands of Wales, the moun
tains of the Lake-district,and probably small tracts of the southern uplands
of Scotland formed land-surfaces skirting portions of the Carboniferous
area, while the Carboniferous tract to the south of the central barrier was
probably bounded       land-surface trending along the southern coast of
                       by   a
England.   The distribution of the Coal-measures at the close of the Car
boniferous period was illustrated by Map, No.
                                          a             1.
  It  was then shown that the whole Carboniferous    area was subjected to
disturbances through the agency of lateral forces, whereby the strata were
thrown into folds along axes ranging (approximately) in east and west
directions and as denudation accompanied and followed these disturbances,
              ;
and acted chiefly over the arches (or anticlinals), large tracts were divested
of Upper Carboniferous strata, and thus the first phase in the marking out
of the limits of our present coal-fields was brought about. The effects of
these movements      and denudations were illustrated        by
                                                           Map No. 2.
      The disturbances which     ensued   after the deposition of the Permian

1870,]                the Newer Formations         of England.                   223
strata, and which produced the discordances of stratification between the
newer Palaeozoic    and Mesozoic formations, were shown to have acted along
lines ranging approximately north and south, parallel to the axis of the
Pennine Chain, and consequently in a direction transverse to those of the
previous period.     These disturbances were also accompanied by the denu
dation of strata from off the anticlinal arches, and the consequent dis
severance   of the Coal-measure tracts over certain definite areas. The re
sults of these movements       (the second phase in defining the bounds of the
coal-fields) were illustrated by Map No. 3.
    From a consideration of the foregoing observations, the author came to
the conclusion that the tendency of the British coal-fields to arrange them
selves into the form of " basins
                                        "
                                          (sometimes partially concealed by newer
strata), a tendency strongly insisted on by Prof. Ramsay, F.R.S., was due
to the intersection of the two systems of flexures above described, one
anterior to the Permian period, the other anterior to the Triassic period,
and that the actual disseverance of the coal-fields into basins was due to
denudation acting with greatest effect along the anticlinal arches of these
flexures.
    The inference that the Yorkshire and Durham              coal-fields   are really
basins rising to the eastward        under the Mesozoic strata was drawn, an in
ference   supported by the easterly rise of the Coal-measures along the
 sea-coast from the Coquet to the Tyne.
    Guided by these principles, the author maintained that we are now in
 a position to determine with great accuracy the actual limits of the Coal-
 measures under the Mesozoic formations over the area to the north of the
 central barrier ridge (as indicated on Map No. 3) ; and that to the south
 of the ridge the application of the same principles would assist towards
 the solution of the question, though in a less degree, owing to the fewer
opportunities for observation of the Palaeozoic formations.
    The author, however, concurred in the views advanced by Sir R. I.
 Murchison*, that in consequence of the great amount of denudation which
the Carboniferous rocks had undergone over the area of the south of
England previous to the deposition of the Mesozoic formations, little coal
was to be expected     to remain under the Cretaceous rocks.

 224            On the Constitution of the Crust of                     the    Earth.          [Dec. 22,
 thesis regarding the Constitution of the Earth's Crust, which he pro
 pounded in 1864, viz. : that the variety we see in the elevation and depression
 of the earth's surface in mountains and plains and ocean-beds has arisen
 from the mass having contracted unequally in becoming solid from a fluid
 state ; and that below the sea-level,              under mountains and plains, there is
 a deficiency     of matter approximately             equal in amount to the mass above
 the sea-level   ; and that below ocean-beds there is an excess of matter ap
 proximately equal to the deficiency in the ocean when compared with rock ;
 so that the amount of matter in any vertical column drawn from the sur
 face to a level surface below the crust is now, and ever has been, approxi
 mately the same in every part of the earth.
    In order to make this hypothesis the subject of calculation, the author
 takes the case of the attenuation of matter in the crust below mountains
 and plains, and the excess of matter below ocean-beds, to be uniform to
 a depth m times the height above the sea-level                              or the depth of the
 ocean, as the case may be.
    The results    are shown in the following              Table, in which the numbers are
 the last figures in the ratio of the differences of gravity to gravity itself,
 carried to seven places of decimals.                The decimal point and ciphers are

    The author points out from this Table that Dr. Young's, or the usual
method of correction for local attraction, so fur from improving matters,
introduces very large residual errors of the are and ocean stations ; and, at
places on the arc        of meridian, all lying on          the same side with reference to
Punme.       He    observes   that neither the usual method nor his own much

 1870.]            On Actinometrical Observations in India.                     225
 affects  the coast stations ; and attributes this to the want of more complete
 knowledge of the contour of the surface, both above and below the sea-
 level, in these parts.    But his own method, in the case m=50, remarkably
 reduces the effects of local attraction at stations on the arc of meridian
 and out at sea (in Minicoy, an island 250 miles west of Cape Comorin or
 Punnee); for the sensible negative quantity at Damargida and positive quan
 tity at Kalianpur indicate a deficiency of matter below the first and an
 excess below the second,     which exactly tally with the results independently
 brought out by relative deflections of the plumb-line as obtained by the sur
 vey : and the two large and most important effects, negative at Kaliana and
 positive at Minicoy, may be said to be almost annihilated by this method
 of correction. This last case of an excess of gravity out at sea (where the
 surrounding ocean has a deficiency of matter) being explained by his me
 thod, he regards as a very strong argument in its favour.         And he finishes
 by saying that if his method is thus far successful in the particular sup
 position of the distribution below, whether in excess or defect, being uni
form, which is most likely not strictly the case, there is every reason for
 concluding that pendulum-observations give support to the hypothesis
 regarding the Constitution of the Earth's Crust, when viewed on a large
 scale, admitting of local peculiarities, like the deficiency of matter near
 Damargida and the excess near Kalianpur, and the similar deficiency near
 Moscow.
 III.   "Actinometrical Observations made at Dehra and Mussoorie in
        India, October and November 1869, in a Letter to the Pre
        sident."    By Lieut. J. H. N. Hennessey. Communicated by
        the President.    Received September 7, 1870.
                                                         Mussoorie, July 22, 1870.
    My dear Sir, — In continuation of my last communication,           dated  April
 25, 1870,   I have now   the pleasure to forward the actinometrical observa
 tions taken, during portions of October and November 1869, with the in
 struments of the Royal Society, and in compliance with the suggestions
 which the Committee of the Society made for my benefit.
    (2) The two actinometers      are of the kind invented by the Rev. G. C.
 Hodgkinson,     and   described   by him in the Proceedings of the Royal
 Society, No. 89, vol. xv.      Further description or allusion is therefore un
 necessary,  unless  I add  that the instrument is easily and accurately worked
 after but moderate practice, and that it is little liable to accident if rolled
up in a padded sheet and packed within its own metal tube.            It, however,
imposes sensible drawbacks, from the delays incurred in throwing off a
suitable amount of fluid into the chamber ; and as this adjustment becomes
deranged by any considerable alteration in the radiation, it is impossible to
    VOL. XIX.                                                          T

226                    Lieut. Hennessey       on  Actinometrical           [Dec. 22,
continue a series of observations for any lengthened period (as, say, two
hours) without introducing breaks of several minutes in its continuity.
    (3) The two instruments used have been lettered by the observers A
and    B. The glasses, too, have been suitably marked as suggested by Sir
John Herschel in the 'Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry.' Actino-
meter B was used at Dehra by Mr. W. H. Cole, M.A., whose observations
in sun and shade number 405 in all.            The observations at Mussoorie were
made by myself with actinometer A; they are 315 in number.                    And as
respects    the chronometers,      barometers, and thermometers         employed,   I
need hardly add that these instruments were of a superior order and well
verified, or that they are in ordinary use at the head-quarters of Colonel
Walker, R.E., Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of
India.
    (4) And with     every facility for reading the last-named instruments,         I
regret having    omitted    to arrange for a more frequent reading of the baro
meter, and that the wet- and dry-bulb thermometers were not recorded.
It, however,    so happened that during        the days of observation in October
and November last the sky was beautifully clear, with the trifling excep
tions noted in the records of observations ; and there is no reason to sup
pose that any sudden changes          occurred in the hygrometric conditions of
 the atmosphere.        In future, however, when the actinometers can again be
worked, more numerous readings of the barometer and thermometers will
be duly'recorded.
    (5) The stations of observation      were Mussoorie and Dehra.         The direct
 distance^between     them is about nine miles.       The former    stands on one  of
 the southernmost ranges of the Himalayas; the latter is in the valley Dehra,
 or Dehra Dhoon.          The hypsometrical elements for these stations, given in
 the result-abstract and elsewhere,      are taken   from the records of the Trigo
 nometrical    Survey of India.      It appears from these values that Mussoorie
 station is above that at Dehra about 4700 feet.
     (6) The procedure agreed on between Mr. Cole and myself was to ob
 serve daily a simultaneous series at      1 lh 40m a.m.
                                                           (mean of all the observed
 times),   another  series  at noon,  and  a  third at  0h 20m p.m., the reckoning
 being in apparent time. The slight deviations from these times which
  appear in the result-abstract are due to little accidental causes almost in
 separable   from simultaneous work.        After four days of these series, each ob
  server was to determine the amount      of heat stopped by the glass of his instru
  ment employed.       In these experiments I was too busy otherwise to recipro
  cate  Mr. Cole's observations of November 1. On the 3rd of November,
  however, we both observed the intended succession of groups (nearly) ; so
  that several of these are made to discharge a double duty, and are intro
  duced in the after- discussion of relative radiation.         On November 4 we
  each   obtained a complete hourly series about the hours of 8 a.m. to
  4  p.m.    These results terminated for the time the reciprocal series of ob
  servations Mussoorie-Dehra.         Subsequently, in April    1870, when we were

both at Dehra,            we carefully    compared the two actinometers A and B
together.        This    was   the only occasion during all our observations when
light clouds occasionally passed over the sun. But as the two instruments
were set up within 3 or 4 feet            of  one another,    and as we both used               the
same chronometer and read our scales at the same instant                         of time, there
appears      no reason        why the results should         not be accurate,           relatively
speaking.

    Nine ditto, ditto, gave 5 and 5.
    Ten ditto, ditto, gave 6 and 5.
    Eleven ditto, ditto, gave 5, 4, and 4     ;  and so on.
    (9) The mean results by each group were next all corrected for excess
of temperature above 32° Fahr., the Table of expansion for alcohol by
Kopp, given in Gmelin's 'Chemistry,' being employed for this purpose.
After this step the results by A were entered in the result-abstract Table
and the corresponding values, in terms of A glass off, found by means of
factor No. 1 . The results by B were further corrected in the record of
observations by means of factor No. 3.           Being now in terms of A glass on,
they were introduced into the result-abstract Table, and there reduced to
A glass off, by means of factor No. 1.
    (10) Thus the result-abstract Table contains the values obtained by
each actinometer expressed in terms of A glass on as well as glass off.
The latter values     are those made      use   of in projecting the actinometric
curves, and in the discussion of the observations.          The former values will
be useful should the Royal Society see fit to send me a third actinometer
whose constant for reduction to the Kew standard has been duly ascer
tained.    At present the required relation is wanting       ; for though Professor
Stokes was so exceedingly kind as to visit Kew with the object of getting
the actinometers A and B verified, the necessary observations could not be
made from want       of time.
    (11)  Turning,    now, to the diagram of actinometric curves and to the re
sult-abstract Table, it is readily seen that the solar radiation decreases
from some time about apparent noon both towards sunrise and sunset. This
hour-angle change is least perceptible for some + 1 hour (or less) from
noon — a condition which indicates that observations for relative or abso
lute intensity are most valuable when made during this interval.             Indeed
even desultory observations might         acquire importance by being restricted
to these   hours,  the  absence  of cloud,   mist, haze, or other abnormal inter
position being always supposed.
    (12) But besides the hour-angle         change, the intensity is liable to rises
and falls brought about in only a few minutes of time. Any observer who
has used the instrument could venture to affirm that these fluctuations are
not due to fallibility of observation. Whether their magnitude varies with
that of the intensity or otherwise may be a matter of interest to ascertain ;
and to this end series of observations, continued for as long a period as the
construction of the instruments will permit, appear desirable.
    (13) Again, there is a change of intensity from day to day, apparently
 not due to alteration in the sun's declination, so that the average daily
 curve (about noon) is higher or lower without any visible reason.              It is
 interesting  to  notice  that this daily  change   was common     to Mussoorie  and

 appears that while the radiation at both stations increases                       from 8 a.m. and
 4  p.m. towards some time about noon, the difference                           M— D diminishes.
 In other words, the radiation at the lower station increases more rapidly
 than at the upper ; and while at both stations the change is more rapid
 in the afternoon than in the forenoon, the relative change between forenoon
 and afternoon is greatest at the lower station.

  I. " On Fluoride of Silver.— Part      II."    By George Gore, F.R.S.
                         Received September 22, 1870.
                                    (Abstract.)
     This paper contains an exhaustive account of the behaviour of argentic
 fluoride in vessels of platinum, carbon, and various fluorides in contact
 with chlorine, bromine, and iodine at various temperatures. When argentic
 fluoride is completely decomposed by chlorine in platinum vessels at        a red
 heat, the reaction agrees with the following equation :
                         4AgF+4Cl + Pt=4AgCl, PtF4.
     Vessels of cryolite and of fluor-spar were found incapable of retaining
 argentic fluoride in a melted state.    Other vessels were also made by melt
 ing and casting various mixtures of earthy fluorides at a high temperature ;
 and although      forming beautiful products, probably capable of technical
  uses, they were not capable of retaining silver fluoride in a state of fusion.
  Numerous vessels were also made of seventeen different fluorides by
  moulding them in the state of clay and baking them at suitable tempera
  tures  ; these also were found incapable  of holding melted fluoride of silver.
  Argentic fluoride was only superficially decomposed by chlorine at 60° Fahr.
  during thirty-eight days.      When heated to 230° Fahr. during fifteen days
  in a platinum vessel in chlorine, it was very little decomposed.       Chloride
  of silver heated to fusion in a platinum vessel in chlorine corroded the
   vessel and formed a platinum-salt, as when fluoride of silver was employed.
      An aqueous solution of argentic fluoride agitated with chlorine evolved
   heat and set free oxygen, in accordance with the following equation     : —
               8AgF+8Cl+4HaO = 5AgCl + 3AgC10             + 8HF+0,
   or
              7Agni + AgC103 + 8HF+0.
   Dry hydrochloric    acid gas completely   decomposed    argentic fluoride in    a
   melted state, but only acted upon it superficially at 60° Fahr. A satu
   rated aqueous solution of argentic fluoride was not precipitated by chloric
   acid.
      Perfectly anhydrous fluoride of silver was only superficially decomposed
    by contact with bromine in a platinum vessel during thirty-six days at
    60° Fahr., or during two days at 200° Fahr.      At a low red heat in vessels
    of platinum, argentic fluoride   was  completely decomposed     by a   current

 236             Mr. C. F. Varley on       the Discharge       of Electricity           [Jau. 12,
 of bromine vapour,   a portion of its fluorine being expelled and a portion
 corroding the  platinum and forming an insoluble compound of fluoride of
 platinum and bromide of silver.    In carbon boats at the same temperature
 the whole of the silver-salt was converted into bromide, the boat being cor
 roded and the fluorine escaping in chemical union with the carbon.        The
 action of bromine on an aqueous solution of argentic fluoride was similar to
 the action of chlorine.   A solution of argentic fluoride yielded copious pre
 cipitates both with  hydrobromic and bromic acids.
    Under the influence of a temperature of 200° to 600° Fahr. in closed
 platinum vessels, iodine very slowly and incompletely decomposes argentic
 fluoride without corroding the vessels, and produces a feeble compound of
argentic iodide, fluorine, and iodine, from which the two latter substances
are expelled at a red heat.   At a red heat in platinum vessels, iodine pro
duces argentic iodide, and in the presence of free argentic fluoride corrodes
the vessels in consequence of formation of platinic fluoride ; iodine and
fluorine pass away together during the reaction.     In vessels of carbon at
the same temperature argentic iodide is formed, the vessels are corroded,
and a gaseous compound of fluorine and carbon is produced.    By treating
an aqueous solution of argentic fluoride with iodine, similar results are
produced as with bromine and chlorine ; a similar solution yields copious
precipitates both with hydriodic and iodic acids.
   A mode of analysis of iodine is also fully described in the paper. A
known weight of iodine was dissolved in absolute alcohol, a strong solution of
argentic nitrate of known strength added to              it,
                                                 in portions at    time, with     a
stirring until the colour of iodine exactly disappeared. The mixture was
evaporated,   the free nitric acid expelled        by
                                              careful heat, and the residue
weighed. The residue was then heated to fusion, to convert the iodate of
silver into iodide, and again weighed. Two experiments of this kind yielded
accurate results, and the process was easy and expeditious.

     After the labours of Mr. Gassiot,       one approaches this subject              with diffi
dence, lest he should appear to be attempting to appropriate the glory
which so justly belongs to that gentleman and to Professor Grove.     The
nature of the action inside the tube   at present involved in considerable
                                             is
mystery,   but some  light    thrown
                                 is   upon  the subject by the following
experiments.    Before describing them, however, the author wishes to ob
serve that he has seen Mr. Gassiot's last paper*, and finds that, so far
as regulating the strength of the current    concerned, he has been pro

   The tube principally used in these experiments is shown full size in pho
tograph No. 1 (PI. II.); it contains two aluminium wire rings, the one -^j inch
in diameter, the other   ^ inch,    and separated           -j^-   inch   :   the tube was   1   \ inch
in diameter, 3| inches in length        ;   it   was one    of Geissler's manufacture,             was
very well exhausted, and professed to contain hydrogen.                         A U-shaped        glass
tube containing glycerine and water was placed in circuit.                        Two aluminium
wires inserted in this tube gave a ready means of reducing or augmenting
the resistance at pleasure.   Glycerine affords an easy means of producing
very great resistances.
  The battery used in this experiment was a Daniell's battery, each cell
having a resistanceof from 50 to lOOohms. The resistance of the glycerine-
and-water tube was between 2 and 3 megohms ; this latter resistance was
made large, in order that the resistance of the tube and battery might be
neglected without entailing error.
   The following laws were found to govern the passage of the current : —
1st, each tube requires a certain potential to leap across ; 2nd, a passage
for the current having     been once established, a lower potential is sufficient
to continue the current;    3rd,   if   the minimum potential, which will maintain
a current through the tube, be          P, and the power be varied to P+l, P + 2,
&c. to    P+n, the current will vary in strength, as 1, 2, &c. n.
   Tables   I. & II. (p. 242) illustrate this ; there is a little irregularity in
the figures due to the irregularity of the battery, although it was recharged
for the occasion.
   It    thus appears that a certain amount of power is necessary to spring
across     the vacuum ; after that it behaves as an ordinary conductor, ex
cluding that portion of the battery whose potential is P, and which is used
to balance the opposition of the tube. In these experiments P was 304
cells. The tube in question could not be persuaded to allow a current of
less than 323 cells to pass ; but when once the current had established a
channel, on lowering the potential by short circuiting portions of the
battery, so as not to break the circuit, the current would flow when the
battery was reduced to 308 cells. By, however, passing a current from
600 cells, in the manner shown in PI.                III.
                                              fig. 1, through the second tube,
filled with pure glycerine, and offering several thousand megohms resistance,
au extremely feeble current, too weak to affect                     the galvanometer, kept a
channel open by its passage ; with this arrangement the figures in Table II.
were obtained, which are more regular at the commencement,      and a power
of P     would pass across the tube.

   The positive pole   alone was        observed        to be luminous when the current
was very minute, and the negative only was luminous when the current
was strong.     The following experiments               were tried, and the results, which
have been photographed, accompany this.
  A  current was passed through the   tube and the vacuum

dually reduced. At the commencement it was more than 10,000 megohms                  ;
the upper or small ring was positive, the lower ring was negative.
   The power was so reduced that the faintest possible light only was visible        ;
in this   case the positive wire alone       was  luminous,   whether it were the
large or small ring that was positive. No. 2 (PI. II.) is a photograph of this.
The light was so feeble that, though the experiment was conducted in a
perfectly dark room, we were sometimes unaware whether the current was
passing or not.      An exposure of thirty minutes' duration left, as will be
seen, a very good photographic record of what was taking place; this
means of viewing light too feeble for the eye may receive other applica
tions.    The  resistance   was   then reduced, when the light became much
more brilliant,   —a  tongue   of light projected from the positive pole towards
the negative, the latter being still almost completely obscure.
   The light around the positive pole was to all of our eyes white, while the
projecting flame was a bright brick-red.          This bright brick-red, however,
possessed great photographic        power, as  will  be seen by photograph No. 3.
The negative wire at this stage began to show signs of luminosity.
   As the power was increased, the flame became detached from the
positive pole, as shown in photograph 4.
   On still further increasing the power, the positive pole ceased to be
luminous, as in photograph 5 ; and on still further increasing the power, by
removing the U tube altogether, the phenomena presented themselves which
are shown in photograph 6, in which the light surrounded the negative wire.
The photograph shows         a white flattened hour-glass, apparently detached
from the wire   ; to the eye, however, the wire appeared to be surrounded by a
bright blue envelope      I inch in diameter, which did not possess sufficient
photographic power to leave a record of itself, while the red portion did so :
this photograph was exposed only ten seconds to the light.
   A large condenser was now attached to the battery, and discharged
through the tube (the condenser had a capacity of 27 microfarads) ; this
was equivalent to a momentary contact with a battery            of little or no   re
sistance.    The flash     was exceedingly     brilliant to the   eye : it could   be
heard outside the tube with a sharp click       ; the eye, however, was so dazzled
as not to be able to see its shape.
    Photographs 7 a and 7 b show that the light was confined entirely to
the positive pole ; thus, then, as the power is increased from nothing up
wards, the first pole to become luminous is the positive ; secondly, the
two poles become luminous ; thirdly, the negative pole alone is luminous ;
and fourthly, with au instantaneous discharge, the positive pole only is
luminous.     The eye and the collodion-plate do not, however, tell the same
tale in photograph 6.
   When the resistance      in the   U tube   was greatly reduced,    and a  galvano
meter (not very sensitive) was inserted, so that the chief resistance in
circuit was that of the exhausted tube, as the potential was augmented cell

by cell, the changes took place abruptly and suddenly.   For example,
when the power was so low that the positive pole only was visible, the
current was feeble, and kept augmenting in power as cell after cell was
added on.  Suddenly the luminous red flame (phot. 3) made its appearance,
and the galvanometer showed that the current had suddenly augmented
three or four times in power.   As the power was again further increased
cell by cell, the current again steadily augmented in proportion, until the
luminous tongue suddenly disappeared, and the appearance         in 6 was
shown, the galvanometer showing a still further sudden increase in the
current.
   The phenomena shown in 4 and 5 can only be obtained by inserting a
large resistance.

   To endeavour to ascertain the nature of this arch,            tube (PI.   a                III.
fig. 2) was constructed.      piece of talc, bent into the form U, had fibre
                               A                                                         a
of silk stretched across  it;on this fibre of silk was cemented   thin strip         a
of talc,  inch in length, -^ iuch broad, weighing about -fa of grain.
           1                                                            The      a
tube was sealed up and exhausted carbonic acid and potash were used to
                                             ;
get high vacuum.
    a                  When the magnet was not magnetized, the passage of
the current from wire to wire did not affect the piece of talc. When the
magnet was charged, and the luminous arch was made to play upon the
lower portion of the talc,  repelled

current was passing.
   When the tube was shifted over the poles of the magnet so as to project
the luminous arch against the upper part of the talc, the upper end of the
talc was repelled in all instances    the arch, when projected against the
                                             ;
lower part of the talc, being near the magnet, was more concentrated, and
the angle of deviation of the talc was as much as 20°.   When the upper
part of the arch, which was much more diffused, was thrown upon the
upper part of the talc,  was repelled about 5°.

  This experiment, in the author's opinion, indicates that this arch com                 is
posed   of attenuated particle* of matter projected from the negative                         pole
 by electricity in all directions, but that the magnet controls their course              ;   and

these particles seem to be thrown by momentum on each side     of the nega
tive pole, beyond the limit of the electric current.
   This arch requires time for its formation, for when a charged condenser
is discharged through the tube no arch is produced.     The arch from the
negative pole is a hollow cylinder ; the little talc tell-tale against which
the arch was projected cut out the light, and a corresponding dark space
existed throughout the remainder of the course of the arch.
   There was on the talc, at the spot where the arch struck  little bright            it, a
luminous cloud, as though the attenuated luminous vapour were condensed
 by this material obstruction.
   Great care had been taken not to let the arch strike the single filament
of silk which suspended the talc. Having demonstrated that the talc was
repelled as described, the arch was allowed to play against the silk fibre,
which the author expected would have been instantly burnt such, however,          ;
was not the case. Even when powerful induction-coil replaced the battery,
                                        a
the fibre remained unhurt.

about an inch in diameter) — Tie to the negative pole

                                    a           towards the positive.
                                                             it          On
rotating the machine, two bright spots are seen upon the positive pole.                                   If
the positive pole be made to rotate upon its axis, the luminous spots do not
rotate with   it ;  however, the negative pole, with its filament of wood, be
                     if,
rotated, the spots on the positive pole obey it, and rotate also. The in
 sertion of anon-conductor, such as     strip of glass, in front of the pro
                                                    a
jecting wooden end, obliterates the luminous spot on the positive -pole.
 Wheu the author first discovered this, he, seeing apparently pieces of dirt
on the positive pole, wiped            it   clean   with   a   silk handkerchief,             but there

1871.]                                through Rarefied Media,       t$c.                                 241
they remained in spite of all wiping ; he then examined the negative pole,
and discovered a minute speck of dirt corresponding to the luminous spots
on the positive pole.
   When the filament of wood is removed from the negative pole, there is
sometimes a luminosity or glow over a large portion of the surface of the
positive ball. If in this state three or four little pieces of wax, or even a
drop or two of water, be placed upon the negative pole, corresponding non-
luminous spots will be found upon the positive pole, which rotate with the
former, but do not with the latter.
   It   is therefore evident that there are lines                 of force existing           between    the
  vo poles, and by these  means one is able to telegraph from the negative
   the positive pole to a distance of 8 inches through the air, without any
other conductor than that which the electrical machine has constructed for
itself across the non-conducting gas.
   The foregoing seems to the author to give                               a possible explanation           of
"ball-lightning."    If it be possible for there to                        be a negatively electrified
cloud sufficiently charged to produce a flash from the earth to the cloud, a
point in the cloud would correspond to the wood projection on the negative
conductor             if
                such a cloud exist, a luminous spot would be seen moving
                  :
about the surface of the earth, corresponding to the moving point of cloud
over    it,
        and thus present phenomena similar to those described by the pri
vileged few who have witnessed this extraordinary natural phenomenon.
   The following experiment shows that, prior to the passage of the electric
spark,   a    channel            is   prepared for this spark to pass.
    The positive and negative balls of the machine were separated to                                        a
distance of or inches, and common candle-flame was placed midway be
                  6         7                      a
 tween them. On rotating the machine, the flame was drawn out on each side
just prior to the passage of the spark, as shown in the accompanying sketch
 (PI. III. fig. 3). Sometimes extended to a width of or inches this
                                                   it                            5        6          ;
took place every time the spark passed.                        It   is   well known that the dura
tion of this spark                 is   less than the   ^^   part of     a   second   ;   the flame occu
pied the or   g part of second in flying out to make the conducting chan
                           -j^            a
nel through which the discharge went.
  The author   has been informed more than once, by captains of vessels,
that when  men  have been struck by lightning burn has been left upon the
                                                                    a
skin of the same shape as the object from which the discharge flew.    In
one   instance he was informed that some brass numbers attached to the
rigging, from which the discharge passed to the sailor, were imprinted upon
his skin.

        is                  perfectly possibleis the discharge be   if                           a   nega

       by Prof. Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S.             Received October 5, 1870.
                                     (Abstract.)
    Platinum plates immersed in sulphuric acid and water, as in a decompo
sition-cell, require a potential of about 1*7 Daniell's cell to decompose the
water ; with potentials of less amount the platinum plates can be charged
and discharged like condensers.         They have enormous electrostatic capa
city.    Mercurial surfaces equally admit of polarization with hydrogen.             A
surface of mercury in dilute sulphuric acid, when made negative to the water
by means of a powerful battery, flattens out.          If the mercury be replaced
by an amalgam      of proper consistency, the flattening out   is increased   ; the re
versal of the current restores the amalgam to its original dimensions.              By
reversing the process, electric currents can   be obtained from mechanical force.
    A large   vessel on a board has    within it two shallow funnels, which are
connected by means of glass tubes with similar vessels outside of the large
one.     Pure mercury is poured into the funnels until they and the outside
vessels are one-third filled.      By tilting the board, mercury runs into the
one funnel and out of the other, and thus the surface in the one is made
to increase while that in the other decreases.            Dilute sulphuric acid is
poured into the larger vessel so as to cover the two funnels             ;  the latter
are connected     together through a galvanometer.
    If the  mercury be pure and free from polarization, the tilting of the
board produces no electric current.         On polarising one of the surfaces with
hydrogen by a battery, it gives rise to a current through the galvanometer,
and thus shares the polarization over the two surfaces.             If the batteiy be
removed, on augmenting the one surface and diminishing the other, a cur
rent of electricity is seen to pass through the galvanometer.
    A convenient method of showing this experiment on a large scale is to
procure a gutta-percha trough 4 inches deep and 4 by 2 inches broad.                  A
partition of the same material 2 inches high divides the lower half into two
separate chambers : these are partly filled with mercury ; amalgamated
platinum     plates, hung from a balance-lever, dip into the mercury.               On
depressing one set of plates the others are elevated, and thus the mercurial
surface exposed     to the fluid is alternately augmented and diminished           to a
large   amount.     Twelve of these arranged in series give a current of rather
more potential than one cell of Daniell's battery when the mercury is polar
ized with hydrogen.       The addition of a minute fragment of zinc to the
mercury maintains the polarization for a very long time, and the power is
considerably increased thereby. When a large surface of mercury (25 cir
cular inches) has been polarized with a power of half a Daniell's cell and is
rapidly reduced to the diameter of J5 inch, by letting the mercury flow out
                                                                        u 2

244                   Mr. C. F. Varley on Polarisation of                  [Jan. 12,
of the funnel,    some bubbles   of hydrogen   gas appear  just  as the last   of the
mercury is running out, the decrease of surface evidently augmenting
the potential sufficiently to decompose the water : floating a small piece of
platinum on the mercury renders this phenomenon much more distinct.
    All attempts to polarize the mercury with oxygen        have   failed to give a
current.      By depolarizing the mercury with a battery until no current is
generated by varying the dimensions of the exposed mercury surface, a me
tallic surface neutral to the fluid is obtained.
   The    second part  of the paper refers to the electrostatic capacity of plati
num plates in dilute acid and water.
    In order to determine this point, it is necessary to use sensitive, rapidly
oscillating, reflecting galvanometers of very small resistance. The author
has succeeded     in measuring the charge which a square inch of platinum ex
posed to another square inch of platinum surface receives from potentials
varying from 0-02 of a Daniell's cell up to 1*6 Daniell's cell.          From a po
tential of 0•02 to 0 08 the capacity remains sensibly constant; that is,
the discharge from the plates varies directly as the potential.           When the
potential increases beyond 0*08, the charge which the plates receive in
creases in a greater     ratio, the   capacity being 3-3 (in one experiment)
and 3-1 (in another experiment) times as great with a potential of 1*6
as it was with the potential of 0*1 .
   There is great difficulty attending accurate determination of the latter
amounts ; but the author expects that this increase of capacity will be
found to vary as the square root of the potential.          The capacity of the
platinum plates with varying powers is shown in the accompanying Tables.
   The author thinks these experiments tend to show that the fluid does
not actually touch the platinum plate, but is separated from it by a film,
which film, if a pure gas, must be less than the , ^ gB0 Ml) part of an inch,
when very small potentials are used.       This distance decreases as the poten
tial rises.    Inasmuch as two surfaces equally electrified with the opposite
electricities attract each other with a power varying inversely as the square
of the distance, the experiment would seem to indicate that at very small
distances the platinum repels the water with       a power varying      inversely as
the cube of the distance.
   The phenomena of electrification render accurate determinations of the
capacity extremely difficult.     The fact of the phenomena of electrification
being present, leads the author to think that the separating film (if
such a film exists) is not a pure gas, but has five or more times as much
electrostatic capacity as pure gas.
   A useful inference drawn from the above experiments is the impossibility
of working through any considerable length of uninsulated wire in the ocean.
   The French Atlantic cable from Brest to St. Pierre works, upon the
average,    ten words per minute    ; the author   calculates  that    a  solid con
ductor of the same weight per mile as that used between the above stations
must be reduced to     a length of less than 1 100 yards in order that the rate
of signalling through it shall be not slower than through 2500 miles of

     At the    close    of  my last paper
                                                 " On the Skull of         the Common         Fowl," I

 the osseous fish.      I   was working   at the early conditions of the salmon's
  skull  at the time.
     I was, however, led to devote my attention to another and more instruc
 tive type early in the following year ; for it was then (January 1869) that
 Professor Huxley was engaged in preparing his very important paper " On
 the Representation of the Malleus and Incus in the other Yertebrata" (see
 Zool. Proc. May 27, 1869).
     In repeating some of his observations for my own instruction, it occurred
 to me to renew some researches         I had been making from time to time on
 the frog and toad. The results were so interesting to us both, that it was
 agreed for me to work exhaustively at the development of the frog's skull
 before finishing the paper on that of the salmon.              On this account Pro
 fessor   Huxley mentions in his paper {op. cit. p. 406) that he leaves the
 Amphibia out of his demonstration, and that they are to be worked out
 by me. The amount of metamorphosis demonstrable in the chick whilst
 enclosed in the egg suggested a much more definite series of changes in
 a low, slow-growing Amphibian type.               I think that this has been fully
 borne out by what is shown in the present paper.
    The first of the ten stages into which I have artificially divided my sub
ject is the unhatched embryo, whilst its head and tail project only mode
 rately beyond the yelk-mass.         Another stage is obtained by taking young
 tadpoles   on  about  the   third day after they have escaped from their glairy
envelope j a few days elapse between the second and third stages, but a much
longer time between the third and fourth, for the fourth stage is the perfect
 tadpole, before the limbs appear and whilst it is essentially a fish with
mixed Chimaroid and Myxinoid characters.                 Then the metamorphosing
tadpole is followed until it is a complete and nimble frog, two stages of
 which are examined       ;  and then old individuals are worked out, which give
 the culminating characters of the highest type of Amphibian.
    The early stages were worked out principally from specimens hardened
in  a solution   of chromic acid    ; and the rich umber-brown        colour of these
preparations made them especially fit for examination by reflected light.
    Without going further into detail as to the mode of working my subject
out, and without any lengthened account of the results obtained,                I may
state that the following conclusions have been arrived at ; namely, that the
skull of the adult is highly compound, being composed of: —
    1st.  Its own proper membranous         sac ;
    2nd. Of a posterior part which is         a   continuation,  in an unsegmented
form, of the vertebral column ;
    3rd.   Of laminae which grow upwards from the first pair         of facial arches,
and which      enclose the fore part    of the membranous sac, just as the " in
                " of the cranial
vesting mass                       part of the notochord invests the hinder part.

definite patches ; these are the cranial roof-hones. Around the mouth
there are cartilages like those of the Lamprey and the Chimsera ; but
these yield in interest to the propir facial bars, which are as follows,
namely    :   —
  First pair,       the
                          " trabecular."
  Second pair, the mandibular arch.
  Third pair, the hyoid arch.
  And fourth         to seventh pairs       :   these are the branchials.
  These are all originally          pairs of cartilaginous rods ; and from
                                      separate
these are developed all the complex structures   of the mouth, palate, face,
and throat. The pterygo-palatine arcade is merely a secondary connecting
bar developed, after some time, between the first and second arches.
  Meckel's cartilage arises as a segmentary bud from the lower part of the
second,       and   the    " stylo-cerato-hyal,"          as a similar       secondary segment,
from the third arch.
  By far the greater part of the cranium (its anterior two-thirds) is                           deve
loped by out-growing laminae from the trabecules, which after a time be
come fused with the posterior or vertebral part of the skull.
   When the tadpole is becoming a frog, the hyoid arch undergoes a truly
wonderful amount of metamorphosis.
   The upper part, answering to the hyomandibular of the fish (not to the
whole of    but to its upper half), becomes the " incus," and
              it,                                                 detached            a

total resistance of the whole between        j   and y, can be easily ascertained by
simple and well-known         formulae.
                   nm j
      But let    a leakage   r, which   we   will suppose gives perfect earth, be
 applied at some point in the shunt A B, the deflection previously produced
 on G by a current arising in L will probably be considerably changed.              I
 say probably, because by sliding the leakage r along the whole length of
 the shunt, we shall at last find a point Z at which the needle will return to
 its original deflection ; the position of Z being ascertained, any resistance
                                 " dead earth    "
 varying      from infinity to                       may be applied without causing
 any change in the deflection of the needle.
      It is evident that, although the total resistance of the circuit between x
 and y has been lessened by the insertion of the leakage, a proportionately
 larger amount of current is diverted from the galvanometer by that part of
  the shunt between L and the leakage at Z.
      Presuming the electromotive E in L to remain constant, and taking
  r=0, we have the intensity of the current passing through G represented
  by the equation

  As the condition that the galvanometer deflection remains unchanged, the
   first of these equations must be equal to the second, from which we obtain
   the formula
                                         L=R4
   the    resistance    Q being immaterial.        It will therefore be  seen that  R
   always bears the same proportion to L that B does to A, the latter
   branches bearing some analogy to the proportion-coils of a Wheatstone
   testing bridge.

at all.  In a submerged cable there is frequently sufficient earth-current
to supply the electromotive force in the branch L ; if not, a small battery
can be inserted to maintain a steady current, and the internal resistance of
the cells afterwards deducted.         The polarization-current    leakage offrom      a
low resistance in a cable would enable us to find the resistance from either
side through the fault without the application of a battery.    And, lastly,
this method may be used to ascertain the internal resistance of a battery.
   The above method occurred to me about two years since during some
experiments made to determine the resistance of the bridge-circuit and
the exact proportion of current traversing each branch of the Wheatstone
balance when the potentials at \V and Z are unequal.

                                     from L into     the   branch    G.    I may therefore
  assume that, although the total resistance

    The following method of taking the internal resistance of            a battery will
 be found to give excellent results when several cells are to be tested.
    Take  one element from the rest      of the cells and arrange the circuit as in
 the annexed figure.      Connect the poles of the battery under observation
 by a shunt S, and adjust the resistance of the latter till zero is obtained
on the galvanometer.
    Let E he the number of cells tested,
        e number of cells opposed,
        S = resistance of shunt,
        R= internal resistance of E.

   In practice I usually returned the         detached    cell to the battery when
S X  E gave the    internal   resistance  of the whole within     a fraction of a unit.
   It is assumed   that the electromotive force in       e equals   that of the whole
battery multiplied by       ; the chance of error on account of this not being
exactly the case would be lessened by detaching a larger number of cells
than one when the internal resistance of the remaining portion would be
given by the first formula.

IV. " Modification of      Wheatstone's Bridge to find the Resistance of
      a Galvanometer- Coil from a single deflection of its own needle."
       By Prof. Sir William Thomson, F.R.S. Received January
       19, 1871.
   In any useful arrangement in which     a galvanometer or electrometer and
a galvanic element or battery are connected, through       whatever trains or
network of conductors, let the galvanometer and battery be interchanged.
Another arrangement is obtained which will probably be useful for a very
different, although reciprocally related object.   Hence, as soon as I learned
from   Mr. Mance his admirable method of measuring the internal re
sistance of a galvanic element (that described in the first of his two pre
ceding papers), it occurred to me that the reciprocal arrangement would
afford a means of finding the resistance of a galvanometer-coil, from a
single deflection of its own needle, by a galvanic element of unknown re
sistance.    The resulting method proves to be of such extreme simplicity
that it would be incredible that it had not occurred to any one before,
were it not that I fail to find any trace of it published in books or papers ;
and that personal inquiries of the best informed electricians of this country
have shown that, in this country at least, it is a novelty.        It consists
simply   in making   the  galvanometer-coil  one of  the four conductors  of a
"Wheatstone's bridge, and adjusting, as usual, to get the zero of current
when the bridge contact is made, with only this difference, that the test of
the zero is not by a galvanometer in the bridge showing no deflection, but
by the galvanometer itself, the resistance of whose coil is to be measured,
 showing an unchanged deflection.      Neither diagram nor further explana
tion is necessary to make this understood to any one who knows Wheat-
stone's bridge.
V. "On       a  Constant Form     of Daniell's    Battery."     By Prof.   Sir
       William    Thomson,     F.R.S.     Received   January 19, 1871.
    Graham's   discovery of the extreme slowness with which one liquid
diffuses into another.and Fick's mathematical theory of diffusion, cannot fail
to suggest that diffusion alone, without intervention of a porous cell or
membrane, might be advantageously used for keeping the two liquids of a
Daniell's battery separate.    Hitherto, however, no galvanic element with
out some form of porous cell, membrane, or other porous solid for sepa
rator, has been found satisfactory in practice.
   The first idea of dispensing with a porous cell, and keeping the two
liquids separate by gravity, is due to Mr. C. F. Varley, who proposed to
put the copper-plate in the bottom of a jar, resting on it a saturated solu
tion of sulphate of copper, resting on this a less dense solution of sulphate
of zinc, and immersed in the sulphate of zinc the metal zinc-plate fixed

254                          Sir William Thomson on                  a                [Jan. 19,
near the top of the jar.          But he tells       me that batteries on this plan, called
"gravity-batteries,"       carefully tried in the late Electric and Inter
                           were
national Telegraph Company's establishments, and found wanting in
economy.   The waste of zinc and of sulphate of copper was found to be more
in them than in the ordinary porous-cell batteries.       Daniell's batteries
without porous cells have also been tried in France, and found unsatisfactory
on account of the too free access of sulphate of copper to the zinc, which they
permit.  Still, Graham's and Fick's measurements leave no room to doubt
but that the access of sulphate of copper to the zinc would be much less rapid
if by true diffusion alone, than it cannot but be in any form of porous-cell
battery with vertical plates of copper and zinc opposed to one another, as are
the ordinary telegraphic Daniell's batteries which Mr. Varley finds superior
to his own " gravity-battery." The comparative failure of the latter, there
fore, must have arisen from mixing by currents of the liquids. All that seems
necessary, therefore, to make the gravity -battery much superior instead of
somewhat inferior to the porous-cell battery, is to secure that the lower
part of the liquid shall always remain denser than the upper part.   In seek
ing how to realize this condition, it first occurred to me to take advantage
of the fact that saturated solution of sulphate of zinc is much denser than
saturated solution of sulphate of copper.   It seems* that, at 1 o° tempera
ture, saturated aqueous solution of sulphate of copper is of 1-186 sp. gr.,
and contains in every 100 parts of water 33*1 parts of the crystalline salt ;
and that at 15° the saturated solution of sulphate of zinc is of sp. gr.
T44, and contains in every 100 parts of water 140*5 parts of sulphate of
zinc, both results being from Michel and Krafft's experiments f.  Hence
I made     an element with the zinc below             ;    next it saturated solution     of Sul
phate of zinc, gradually diminishing to half strength through a few centi
metres upwards ; saturated sulphate of copper resting on this ; and the
copper-plate fixed above in the sulphate-of-copper solution.         In the be
ginning,  and  for some time after, it is clear that the sulphate of  copper can
have no access to the zinc otherwise than by true diffusion.       I have found
this anticipation thoroughly realized in trials continued for several weeks ;
but the ultimate fate of such a battery is that the sulphate of zinc must
penetrate through the whole liquid, and then it will be impossible to keep
sulphate of copper separate in the upper part, because saturated solution
of sulphate of zinc certainly becomes denser on the introduction of sul
phate of copper to it. To escape this chaotic termination I have intro
duced a siphon of glass with a piece of cotton-wick along its length inside
it,so placed as to draw off liquor very gradually from      level somewhat      a
nearer the copper than the zinc            ;  funnel, also provided with
                                               and   a    glass                                a

element thus arranged will undoubtedly continue remarkably constant for
many months ; but it has one defect, which prevents me from expecting
permanence for years.          The zinc being below, must sooner or later, ac
cording   to   the    less  or greater vertical dimensions of the cell, become
covered with precipitated copper from the sulphate of copper which finds
its way (however slowly) to the zinc. On the other hand, if the zinc be
above, the greater part of the deposited copper falls off incoherently from
the zinc through the liquid to the copper below, where it does no mischief,
provided always that the zinc be not amalgamated, — a most important con
dition for permanent batteries, pointed out to me many years ago by Mr.
Varley.    Placing the zinc above has also the great practical advantage that,
even when after a very long time it becomes so much coated with metallic
copper as to seriously injure the electrical effect, it may be removed,
cleaned, and replaced without otherwise disturbing the cell ; whereas if
the zinc be below, it cannot be cleaned without emptying the cell and
mixing the solutions, which will entail a renewal of fresh separate solutions
in setting up the cell again.            I have therefore planned the following
form of element, which cannot          but  last until the zinc is eaten away so
much as to fall to pieces, and which must, I think, as long as it lasts, have
a very satisfactory degree of constancy.
   The cell is of glass, in order that the condition of the solutions and
metals which it contains may be easily seen at any time.                It is simply
a cylindrical      or rectangular jar with a flat bottom.            It need not be
more than 10 centimetres deep ; but it may be much deeper, with ad
vantage in respect to permanence           and ease of management,        when very
small internal resistance is not desired.         A disk of thin sheet copper is laid
at its bottom.       A properly shaped mass of zinc is supported in the upper
part of the jar.       A glass tube (which for brevity will be called the charging-
tube)  of a  centimetre     or more internal diameter, ending in a wide saucer or
funnel above, passes through the centre of the zinc, and is supported so as
to rest with its lower open end about a centimetre above the copper.                A
glass siphon with cotton- wick core is placed so as to draw liquid gradu
ally from a level about a centimetre and a half above the copper.
The jar is then filled with semisaturated sulphate-of-zinc solution.                A
 copper  wire   or  stout  ribbon  of copper   coated  with  india-rubber   or gutta
percha passes vertically down through the liquid to the copper-plate
below, to which it is riveted or soldered to secure metallic communication.
Another suitable electrode is kept in metallic communication with the
zinc above.      To put the cell in action, fragments of sulphate of copper,
small enough to fall down through the charging-tube, are placed in the
funnel above.        In the course of a very short time the whole liquid below
the lower end of the charging-tube becomes saturated with sulphate of
copper, and the cell is ready for use.           It may be kept always ready by
occasionally (once a week for instance) pouring in enough of fresh water,
or of water quarter saturated with sulphate of zinc at the top of the cell,

cover may be advantageously added above, to prevent evaporation.                     When
the cell is much used, so that zinc enough is dissolved, the liquid added
above may be pure water          ;  or if  large internal resistance is not objected to,
the liquid added may be pure water, whether the cell has been much used
or not ; but after any interval, during which the battery has not been
 much in use, the liquid added ought to be quarter saturated, or even
stronger solution of sulphate of zinc, when it is desired to keep down the
internal resistance.      It is probable that one or more specific-gravity beads
kept constantly floating between top and bottom of the heterogeneous
fluid will be found     a useful adjunct, to guide in judging whether to fill up
with pure water or with sulphate-of-zinc solution.                They may be kept in a
place convenient for observation by caging them in a vertical glass tube
perforated sufficiently to secure equal density in the horizontal layers of
liquid, to be tested by the floaters.
   An extemporized cell on this plan was exhibited to the Royal Society,
and its resistance (measured as an illustration of Mance's method, de
scribed in the first of his two previous communications) was found to be
•29 of an Ohm (that is to say, 290,000,000 centimetres per second).                    The
copper and zinc plates of this cell, being circular, were about 30 cen
timetres in diameter, and the distance between them was about 7'5 centi
metres.     A Grove's    cell,  of such dimensions that forty in         series would give
an excellent electric light, was          also   measured  for resistance,    and found to
be "19   of  an Ohm.       Its intensity      was found to be      1*8  times that of the
new cell, which is the usual ratio            of Grove's to Daniell's ; hence seventy-
two of   the  new  cells would     have    the  intensity of forty of Grove's.      But the
resistance of the seventy-two in series would be 209 Ohms, as against 76
Ohms of the forty Grove's ; hence, to get as powerful an electric light,
threefold    surface,  or else diminished resistance          by diminished     distance  of
the plates, would be required.               How much the       resistance    may be dimi
nished by diminishing the distance rather than increasing the surface, it is
impossible to deduce from experiments hitherto made.
   Two or three cells, such as the one shown to the Royal Society, will be
amply sufficient to drive a large ordinary turret-clock without a weight ;
and    the expense of maintaining them will be very small in comparison
with that of winding the clock.              The prime cost of the heavy wheel-work
will be avoided by the introduction of a comparatively inexpensive electro
magnetic engine.        For electric bells, and all telegraphic testing and signal
ing   on  shore,  the  new     form of battery will probably be found easier of
management, less expensive, and more trustworthy than any of the forms
of battery hitherto used.          For use at sea, it is probable that the sawdust
Daniell's, first introduced on board the 'Agamemnon' in 1858, and ever
since that time very much used both at sea and on shore, will still probably
be found the most convenient form ; but the new form is certainly better
for all ordinarv shore uses.

   The principle which     I   have adopted for keeping the sulphate            of copper
from the zinc     to allow
                 is             no access to the zinc except
                               it                                        by

This principle  would   be violated    the
                                      if   whole  mass of the liquid contiguous
to the zinc is moved toward the zinc.      Such    motion actually takes place

                                                  represented   in the drawing,
and which   is undoubtedly the better form of the two) every time crystals
of sulphate of copper      are dropped into the charging-tube.  As the crystals
dissolve, the liquid again sinks, but not through the whole range through
which  it rose when the crystals were immersed.        It sinks further as the
sulphate of copper     electrically precipitated on the copper plate below in
                      is
course  of  working  the  battery.   Neglecting the volume of the metallic
copper, we may say, with little error, that the whole residual rise       that    is
corresponding to the volume of water of crystallization of the crystals which

258                On a Constant Form     of Daniell's Battery.          [Jan. 19,
have been introduced and used.        It becomes, therefore, a question whether
it may not become a valuable economy to use anhydrous sulphate of copper
instead of the crystals ; but at present we are practically confined to the
 " blue vitriol "
                   crystals of commerce, and therefore the quantity of water
added at the top of the cell from time to time must be, on the whole, at
least equal to the quantity of water of crystallization introduced below by
the crystals.      Unless a cover is added to prevent evaporation, the quantity
of water added above must exceed the water of crystallization introduced
below by at least enough to supply what has evaporated.            There ought to
be a further excess, because a downward movement          of the liquid from the
zinc to the level from which the siphon draws is very desirable to retard
the diffusion of sulphate of copper upwards to the zinc.       Lastly, this down
ward movement is also of great value to carry away the sulphate of zinc as
it is generated in the use of the battery.        The quantity of water added
 above   ought to be regulated so as to keep the liquid in contact with the
zinc a little less than half saturated with sulphate of zinc, as it seems,
from the observations of various experimenters, that the resistance of water
semisaturated with sulphate of zinc is considerably less than that of a sa
turated solution.      A still more serious inconvenience than a somewhat in
creased resistance has been pointed out to me by     Mr. Varley  as a consequence
of allowing sulphate of zinc to accumulate in the battery. Sulphate of zinc
crystallizes over the lip of the jar, and forms pendents like icicles outside,
which act as capillary siphons, and carry off liquid.        Mr. Varley tells me
that this curious phenomenon is not unfrequently observed in telegraph-
batteries, and sometimes goes so far as to empty a cell and throw it alto
gether out of action.      Even without this extreme result, the crystallization
of zinc about the mouth of the jar is very inconvenient and deleterious.
 It is of course altogether avoided by the plan I now propose.
    In conclusion, then, the siphon-extractor must be arranged to carry off
all the water of crystallization of the sulphate of copper decomposed in the
use   of the cell, and enough of water besides to carry away as much sulphate
of zinc as is formed in the use of the battery.       Probably the most conve
nient mode of working       the system in practice will be to use a glass capillary
siphon, drawing quickly enough to carry off in a few hours as much water
as is poured in each time at the top ; and to place, as shown in the draw
ing, the discharging end of the siphon so as to limit the discharge to a
level somewhat above the upper level of the zinc grating.         It will no doubt
be found convenient in practice to add measured amounts of sulphate of
copper by the charging-tube each time, and at the same time to pour in a
measured amount of water, with or without a small quantity of sulphate of
zinc in solution.
    As 100 parts by weight of sulphate of copper crystals contain, as nearly
as may be, 36 parts    of water, it may probably answer very well to put in, for
every kilogramme of sulphate of copper, half a kilogramme of water. Expe
rience (with the aid of specific-gravity beads) will no doubt render it very

 easy, by a perfectly methodical action involving very             little labour, to keep
 the battery in good and constant action, according to the circumstances of
  each case.
     When,   as in laboratory work, or in arrangements for lecture-illustrations,
 there may be long intervals of time during which the battery is not used,
 it will  be convenient to cease adding sulphate of copper when there is no
 immediate prospect of action being required, and to cease pouring in water
 when little or no colour of sulphate of copper is seen in the solution below.
 The battery is then in a state in which it may be left untouched for months
 or years. All that will be necessary to set it in action again will be to fill
 it up with water to replace what has evaporated in the interval, and stir
 the liquid in the upper part of the jar slightly, until the upper specific-
 gravity bead is floated to near the top by sulphate of zinc, and then to
 place a measured amount of sulphate of copper in the funnel at the top of
 the charging-tube.
VI. "On         the Determination of a Ship's Place from Observations of
   Altitude."       By Sir William Thomson.                 Received     Feb. 6, 1871.
     The ingenious and excellent      idea  of calculating the longitude from two dif
ferent assumed latitudes with one altitude, marking off on a chart the points
thus found, drawing a line through them, and concluding that the ship was
 somewhere on that line at the time of the observation, is due to Captain
T. H.     Sumner *.      It is now well known to practical navigators. It is de
scribed in good books on navigation, as, for instance, Raper's (§§ 1009-
 1014).      Were it not for the additional trouble of calculating a second
triangle, this method ought to be universally used, instead of the ordinary
practice of calculating a single position, with the most probable latitude
taken as if it were the true latitude.           I believe, however, that even when
in a channel, or off a coast trending north-east and south-west, or north
west and south-east, where Sumner's method is obviously of great practical
value, some navigators do not take advantage of it ; although no doubt the
most skilful use it habitually in all circumstances in which it is advantageous.
I   learned it first in 1858, from Captain Moriarty, R.N., on board H.M.S.
'                     He used it regularly in the Atlantic Telegraph expeditions
   Agamemnon.'
of that year and of 1 865 and        1866, not merely at the more critical times, but
in connexion with each day's sights. Instead of solving two triangles, as di
rected by Captain Sumner, the same result may be obviously obtained by

Sumner.     Boston, 1843.    " In 1843, Commander Sullivan, R.N., not having heard of
" this work, found the line of equal altitude on entering the Biver Plate ; and identifying
" the ship's place on it in 12 fathoms by means of the chart, shaped his oourse up the
" river. The idea may thus have suggested itself to others ; but the credit of having
" reduced it to a method and made it public belongs' to Capt. Sumner." (Raper's Na
vigation, edition 1857.)

finding a second angle (Z) of the one triangle (P Z S) ordinarily solved (P
being the earth's pole, Z the ship's zenith, and S the sun or star).             The
angle ordinarily calculated is        P, the hour-angle.      By calculating   Z, the
sun's azimuth also, from the same triangle, the locus on which the ship must
be is   of course found by drawing on the chart, through           the point which
would be the ship's place were the assumed           latitude exactly correct, a line
inclined to the east and west at an angle equal to Z.           But, as Captain Mo-
riarty pointed out to me, the calculation of the second angle would involve
about as much work as solving for P a second triangle with a slightly dif
ferent latitude      ; and Capt. Sumner's own method has practical advantages
in affording a check on the accuracy of the calculation by repetition with
 varied data.
    A   little experience at sea suggests that it would be very desirable to
 dispense with the morning and evening spherical triangles altogether,
 and to abolish calculation as far as possible in the ordinary day's work.
 When we consider the thousands of triangles daily calculated among all the
 ships at sea, we might be led for a moment to imagine that every one has
 been already solved, and that each new calculation is merely a repetition of
 one already made ; but this would be a prodigious error ; for nothing short
 of accuracy to the nearest minute in the use of the data would thoroughly
 suffice for practical purposes.       Now, there are 5400 minutes in 90°, and
 therefore there are 5400s or 157,464,000,000 triangles to be solved each for
 a single angle.       This, at 1000 fresh triangles per day, would occupy above
 400,000 years.         Even with an artifice, such as that to be described below,
 for utilizing solutions of triangles with their sides integral numbers of de
 grees, the number to be solved (being 90* or 729,000) would be too great,
 and the tabulation of the solutions would be too complicated (on account
 of the trouble of entering for the three sides) to be convenient for prac
 tice ; and Tables of this kind which have been actually calculated and
 published (as, for instance, Lynn's Horary Tables *) have not come into ge
 neral use.
     It  has occurred to me, however, that by dividing         the
 problem      into the solution of two right-angled triangles,
 it may be practically worked out so as to give the ship's
 place as accurately as it can be deduced from the ob
 servations, without any calculation at all, by aid of a table
 of the solution of the 8100 right-angled spherical triangles
 of which the legs are integral numbers of degrees.
     Let O be the point in which the arc of a great circle
 less than 90° through S, perpendicular       to P Z,   meets  PZ
 or   P  Z produced.
     If  the data were S P,     P Z, and the hour-angle P, the solution of the
 right-angled      triangle S  P O would give P O and S O. Subtracting P Z

   1871.]             Ship's Place from Observations       of Altitude.              261
   from   P O,   we have   ZO    ;  and this, with S O in the triangle S Z O, gives
   the zenith distance, S Z, and the azimuth, S Z O, of the body observed.
      Suppose, now, that the solution of the right-angled spherical triangle
   S  PO    for P O and S O to the nearest integral numbers of degrees could
   suffice.    Further, suppose P Z to be the integral number of degrees closest
   to the estimated co-latitude, then Z O will be also an integral number of
   degrees.      Thus the two right-angled spherical triangles S P O and S Z O
   have each arcs of integral numbers of degrees for legs.            Now I find that
   the two steps which I have just indicated can be so managed as to give,
   with all attainable accuracy, the whole information deducible from them
   regarding the ship's place. Thus the necessity for calculating the solutions
   of spherical triaugles in the ordinary day's work at sea is altogether done
   away with, provided a convenient Table of the solutions of the 8100 triangles
  is available.     I have accordingly, with the cooperation of Mr. E. Roberts,
  of the 'Nautical Almanac* Office, put the calculation in hand ; and I hope
  soon to be able to publish a Table of solutions of right-angled spherical
  triangles, showing co-hypotenuse* and one angle, to the nearest minute,
  for every pair of values of the legs from 0° to 90°.           The rule to be pre
  sently given    for using  the   Tables will be readily understood   when it is con
  sidered that the data for the two triangles are their co-hypotenuses, the
  difference between     a leg of one and a leg of the other, and the condition
  that the other leg is common to the two triangles.           The Table is arranged
  with all the 90 values for one leg (b) in a vertical column, at the head of
  which is written the value of the other leg (a). Although this value is
  really not wanted for the particular nautical problem in question, there are
  other applications of the Table for which it may be useful.            On the same
  level with the value of b, in the column corresponding to a, the Table shows
  the value of the co-hypotenuse and of the angle A opposite to the leg o.
  I take first  the case in which latitude and declination are of the same name,
 the latitude is greater than the declination, and the azimuth (reckoned from
 south or north, according as the sun crosses the meridian to the south or
 north of the zenith of the ship's place) is less than 90°. The hypotenuses,
 legs, and angles P and Z of the two right-angled triangles of the preceding
 diagram are each of them positive and less than 90°, and the two co-hypo
 tenuses are the sun's declination and altitude respectively.           We   have then
 the following rule : —
     (1) Estimate the latitude to the       nearest  integral number   of  degrees by
 dead reckoning.
     (2) Look from one vertical column to another, until one is found in
which co-hypotenuses approximately agreeing with the declination and
altitude are found opposite to values of        b   which differ by the complement
of the assumed latitude.
     (3) The exact values of the co-hypotenuse and the angle A corresponding
    * It is more convenient that the complements of the hypotenuses should be shown
than the hypotenuses, as the trouble of taking the complements   of the declination and
the observed altitude is so saved.

262                  Sir W. Thomson on         the Determination       of a      [Jan. 19,
 to these values of    b are  to be taken as approximate declination, hour-angle,
 altitude, and azimuth.
     (4) Either in the same or in a contiguous vertical column find similarly
 another set of four approximate values, the two sets being such that one of
 the declinations is a little less and the other a little greater than the true
 declination.
     (5) On the assumed parallel of latitude mark off the points for which
 the actual hour-angles at the time of observation were exactly equal to the
 approximate hour-angles thus taken from the Table. With these points as
 centres,   and with    radii equal (miles for minutes) to the differences of the
 approximate altitude from the observed altitude, describe circles.                  By aid
 of a parallel ruler and protractor *, draw tangents to these circles, inclined to
 the parallel of latitude, at angles equal to the approximate azimuths taken
 from the Table.        These angles, if taken on the side of the parallel away
 from the sun, must be measured from the easterly direction, or the westerly
 direction, according as the observation was made before or after noon. The
 tangent must be taken on the side of the circle towards the sun, or from
 the sun, according as the observed altitude was greater or less than the ap
 proximate altitude taken from the Tables in each case.                 The two tangents
 thus drawn will be found very nearly parallel.                Draw a line dividing the
 space between them into parts proportional to the differences of the true
 declination, from the two approximate values taken from the Tables. The
 ship's place at the time of the observation was somewhere on the line thus
found.
     To facilitate the execution of clause (2) of the rule,         a narrow slip of card
 should be prepared with numbers 0 to 90 printed or written upon it at
 equal intervals, in a vertical column, equal to the intervals in the vertical
 column of the Table, 0 being at the top and 90 at the bottom of the column
 as in the Table.      Place number 90 of the card abreast of a value             of co-hy
 potenuse in the Table approximately equal to the declination, and look for
 the other co-hypotenuse abreast of the number on the card equal to the
 assumed latitude.         Shift the card from column to column according to
 this condition until the co-hypotenuse abreast of the number on the card
 equal to the assumed latitude is found to agree approximately enough
 with the observed altitude.
     When the declination           and latitude    are   of contrary names and the
 azimuth less than 90°, or when they are of the same names, but the
 declination greater than the latitude, the sum, instead of the difference, of
 the legs b of the two triangles will be equal to the complement of the
 assumed latitude ; and clause (2) of the rule must be altered accordingly.
 The slip of card in this case cannot be used ; but the following scarcely
 less easy process is to be practised.          Put one point of a pair of compasses
 on a position in one of the vertical columns of the hypotenuse abreast of
     * A circle divided  to degrees, and haying its centre at the centre of the chart, ought
  to be printed on every chart.     This, rendering in all  cases the use of a separate  pro
 tractor unnecessary,   would be useful for many purposes.

that point of the column of- values of b corresponding to half the comple
ment of the assumed latitude ; this point will he on a level with one of
the numbers, or midway between that of two consecutive numbers, accord
ing  as the assumed        latitude is even or odd            :  then use the compasses          to
indicate pairs of co-hypotenuses equidistant in the vertical column from
the fixed point of the compasses, and try from one column to another until
co-hypotenuses approximately agreeing with the observed altitude and the
correct declination are found.             It   is easy to modify           the rule so as to suit
cases  in which the azimuth is           an obtuse angle ; but           it is not worth while to
do so at present, as such cases are rarely used in practice.
   The following examples will sufficiently illustrate the method of using
the Tables : —
   (1) On 1870, May              16,   afternoon,      at 5h.     42m. Greenwich         apparent
time, the Sun's altitude was observed to be 32° 4'                    : to find the ship's place,
the assumed latitude being 54° North.
   The Nautical Almanac gives at 1870, May 16, 5h. 42m. Greenwich
apparent time, the Sun's apparent declination N. 19° 10'. On looking
at the annexed Table (which is a portion of the solutions of the
8100 right-angled         spherical triangles) under the heading a = 56°, and
opposite b = 54°, the co-hypotenuse (representing the Sun's declination)
is 19° 11', and opposite b = 18° (differing from 54° by the complement of
the assumed latitude), the co-hypotenuse (representing the Sun's altitude)
is 32° 8', which are sufficiently near the actual values                     ; we therefore select
our sets of values from these columns as follows : —

264                Sir W. Thomson on the Determination                     of a      [Jan. 10,
   This example is represented graphically                   in the first diagram annexed.
The second set of values could have been                   selected equally well from the
contiguous columns (a=57°),                 which      on trial    will be found    to give an
almost identical result.
    Again, (2), on 1870, May 16, afternoon, at 5h. 42m. Greenwich ap
parent time, the Sun's altitude was observed to be 30° 30' : to find the
ship's place, the assumed latitude being 10° North.
    The Sun's declination from N. A. is N. 19° 10', and the half comple
ment of the assumed latitude 40°. By a few successive trials, a=56° will be
found to contain values of co-hypotenuses approximately equal to the Sun's
declination and altitude at the time, and which are equidistant from 40° ;
we therefore select the following sets of values from this column as
follows : —
                                     Co-hyp.         A.

     In this case the sun passes the meridian to the north of the ship's
 zenith, the azimuth, from the Tables being less than 90°, is measured from
 the north towards the west.               In this case also the second set of values

his investigation of the meteorites of Breitenbach and of Shalka.                                                  A

Meissen  to Breitenbach, the author proceeds to describe the individual
minerals which constitute the mass of the Siderolite.
  These are: first, a bronzite with the formula (Mg« Fei ) Si 03, or-
thorhombic    in its crystalline form. The crystallography of the mineral
was investigated by Dr. Viktor von Lang at the British Museum, and has
been published in Pogg. Annalen, vol. cxxxix. p. 315.   Secondly, a mineral
composed of silica, having the specific gravity of quartz after fusion, and
crystallized in the orthorhombic system.
   Since his preliminary notice was published, the crystallography of this
substance has been carefully studied by the author,                                     and the details are
given in the memoir.
     The   elements     of the crystal             are
                             a   : b :   c   :     =         17437    :   1   :   33120.
     The   angles are    :   —
                             100:101                   =      27°46'
                             100:110                  =       60° 10'
                             110:101                  =       63° 19'
   The optic axes lie in a plane parallel to the plane 0 10; the first mean
line being the normal to the plane 10 0.
   They are widely separated, presenting in air an apparent angle of
about 107°.
     There     can thus be no question that this mineral                            is orthorhombic   ;   and
if   the tridymite of Vom Rath                         is,

of this meteorite (Pogg. Annalen, vol. cxlii. p. 275), and finds in it a
bronzite associated with 1 2 per cent, of olivine.              It is probable that the
meteorite varies in its composition in different parts, aud that Prof. Ram

preciable preponderance.
   The mottled kind was treated with hydrogen chloride in the cold, and
subsequently with potash, and again with hydrogen sulphate and potash,
but in each case it was noticed that the action of the acid was confined to
that of a solvent.       A little meteoric iron was dissolved, but no appreciable
amount     of  olivine  was  found in the portion examined in the Laboratory at
the British Museum.
II. "On      the Organization          of the Catamites of the Coal-measures."
    By W. C. Williamson, F.R.S., Professor of Natural History in
    Owens College, Manchester.                   Received November 11, 1870.
                                          (Abstract.)
   Ever   since    M. Brongniart established his genus Calamodendron, there
has prevailed widely         a  belief that two classes of objects had previously
been included under the name of Catamites — the one a thin-walled Equise-
taceous plant, the Catamites proper, and the other a hard-wooded Gymno-
spermous Exogen, known as Calamodendron.                    This distinction the author
rejects  as   having   no  existence,    the  thick-  and  thin-walled examples having
precisely the same typical structure.             This consists of a central pith, sur
rounded by a woody zone, containing a circle of woody wedges, and enclosed
within   a bark of cellular parenchyma.
    The  Pith     has been solid in the first instance, but very soon became
fistular, except at the nodes, at each one of which a thin diaphragm of
parenchyma extended right across the medullary cavity.                    Eventually the
pith underwent a complete absorption, thus enlarging the fistular interior
until it became coextensive with the inner surface of the ligneous zone.
   The    Woody Zone. — This commenced in very young states by the
formation of a circle of canals stretching longitudinally from one node to
the adjoining one.          Externally to, but in contact with, these canals a few
barred or reticulated vessels were found ; successive additions to these were
made in lines radiating from within outwards ; hence each wedge consisted
of  a series    of radiating     laminae,    separated    by medullary rays, having a
peculiar mural structure.             At   their commencement these wedges were
separated by      wide  cellular   areas,   running continuously from node to node      ;

1871.]                   Calamites      of the  Coal-measures.                      269
as the woody tissues increased exogenously,            these   cellular  tracts also ex
tended outwards.        Radial longitudinal sections exhibited in these the same
mural tissue that occurs in the woody wedges.               Hence the author gives to
the former the name of primary medullary rays, and to the latter that of
secondary ones.        The structure of the medullary and ligneous zones is
compared     with  that  of the stem of a true Exogen of the first year, of which
transitional   form Calamites may be regarded as a permanent representative.
Tangential    sections  of this woody zone exhibit parallel bands of alternating
vascular and cellular tissue, running from node to node.                   At the latter
points   each   vascular band      dichotomizes,   its divergent    halves  meeting cor
responding ones from contiguous wedges, and each two unite to form one of
the corresponding bands or wedges of the next adjoining internode.
    The Bark, hitherto undescribed, consists of a thick layer of cellular
parenchyma, undivided into separate laminae, and not exhibiting any special
differentiation of parts.        This structure exhibits no signs of external ridges
or  furrows,  being apparently smooth.          The stem was enlarged at each node,
but the swelling    was less due to any increased thickness of the bark at these
points,   than   to an expansion of the woody layer at these points, both ex
ternally and internally.         This was the result of the intercalation of nume
rous short vessels, which arched across          each   node, their concavities being
directed inwards, and which            constituted   the portion of the woody zone
that encroached upon the constricted pith at these nodes.                  Several modi
fications of the above type have been met with, most of which may have
had a specific value.          In  one form no canals exist at the inner angles
of the woody wedges          ;   in another,    laminae,   like  those of the woody
wedges, are developed in the more external portions of the primary me
dullary rays, those occupying the centre of each ray being the most ex
ternal and latest formed.           The primary ray is thus transformed into            a
series  of secondary    ones.
   In another type the vascular laminae of each woody wedge are few in
number, and the component vessels are the same ; but the latter are re
markable for their large size.           In a fourth variety, the exterior of the
woody zone has been almost smooth, instead of exhibiting the usual ridges
and furrows : this variety is also remarkable for the large size of its me
dullary cells, compared with that of the cells and vessels of the woody
zone.
   But the most curious modification is seen in a plant previously described
by the author under the name of Calamopitus, in which round or oblong
canals are given off from           the medullary cavity, and pass horizontally
through each primary medullary ray of the woody zone to the bark. These,
being arranged in regular verticils below each node, are designated the
infranodal canals.       The verticils of small round or oblong scars, seen at
one extremity of the internodes of some Calamites, are the results of this
peculiar organization.         In one species of this Calamopitus, instead of the
longitudinal canals of the woody           wedges   terminating      at the nodes,  they

bifurcate, like the wedges with which they are associated,         and are con
tinuously prolonged from internode to interaode.
  The ordinary structureless fossils found in    shales and sandstones receive
a definite interpretation  from  the  specimens described.    The tistular me
dullary cavities due in the first instance, not to decay of the tissues, but to
the rapid growth of the stem, became further enlarged by the entire absorp
tion of the true pith, which commenced after the latter had fulfilled
its purpose in the origination of the woody wedges.     This process ter
minated at an undulating line of arrested absorption, the convexities of
which projected outwards, opposite the primary medullary rays, and in
wards, opposite the woody wedges ; and the inorganic cast of the cavity thus
formed by a physiological action constitutes the Calamites commonly seen
in collections.  Hence they are not, like the Sternbergiae, casta of a cavity
within   a truepith, but their form represents that of the exterior of the
medullary tissue. The ridges and furrows of these internal casts are not
identical in position with the similar undulations of the exterior of the
woody zone, but alternate with them ; so that the ligneous cylinder pro
jects both externally and internally where the woody wedges are located,
and contracts, in like manner, at the intermediate points opposite to the
primary medullary rays.     The thin carbonaceous film which frequently
invests these     cnsts   is the residue of the altered elements
                                                          of the woody
zone, and possibly also of the bark, which latter has been very liable to
become detached from the former.     The surface-markings of this carbo
naceous film have usually no structural significance, being merely occasioned
by the impression of the hardened casts which they invest.
  Two kinds of branches are given off by Calamites, — the one subterranean,
springing from peculiarly formed rhizomes, and the other aerial, attached
to the upright unbranched stems.   The former of these are of compara
tively large size, the nodes from which they have been detached being
marked by large concave lenticular scars as phragmata.    These branches
appear to have been given off from central rhizomes in accordance with a
regular phyllotaxis, but which varied in different species.   The aerial
branches, on the other hand, were merely slender appendages to a virtually
unbranched stem ; they were arranged in verticils round the nodes, in
variable numbers.   Each branch sprang from the interior of one of the
woody wedges, the two halves of which were forced asunder to admit the
baseof the appendage, and from which its constituent vessels were derived.
The branch, deprived of its bark, never appears to have had a diameter
equal that of tw6 of the woody wedges, and the rarity of their occurrence
attached to the stem seems to indicate that they were deciduous.    The bark
investing them is not yet known,  and the exact  nature of the foliage which
they bore is also uncertain, owing to discordant testimony respecting it ;
but there appears no reason for doubting that some of the verticillate
Asterophyllites or Annulariee represent        it,
                                            though there           is   uncertainty
respecting the actual forms to be identified with Calamites.             The roots

were given off from the lower part of each intemode, but above the
node, and were apparently epidermal.
  There is also considerable doubt respecting the fructification of Catamite*.
Some of the Volkmannise have evidently belonged to this group ; but only
one example retaining its minute organization has yet been found in which
the structure of the central axes corresponded with that of the Catamites.
The relationship to Catamites of the fruits figured by Binney, under the
name of Calamodendron commune, which are identical wth the Tolkmannia
Binneyi of Carruthers, is more than doubtful, because of the anomalous
structure of their central axes.
  After a careful comparison of the organization of Catamites with
that of the recent Equisetaceae, the author prefers constituting the former
an independent order, distinct from, though allied to, the Equise turns,
under the name of Calamitaceee, and characterized by cryptogamic fructifi
cation and verticillate foliage, associated with an exogenous axis. The
latter feature probably involved the existence of something resembling a
cambium layer, furnishing the material for the new tissues.
     It         proposed to divide these plants into two generic groups,
          is further
viz. Catamites and Catamopitus ; the former to comprehend those un
provided with intranodal canals, and the latter those which possess them.
The existing specific distinctions       appear to have    little or no scientific
value.

     Dear Sir, — I       to-day received the
                       have                   '
                                                Proceedings of the Royal
Society' containing your paper
                                " On Approach  caused by Vibration," which
I have read with great interest.   The experiments you describe constitute
very beautiful illustrations of the established theorem for fluid pressure in
abstract hydro-kinetics, with which I have been much occupied in mathe
matical investigations connected with vortex-motion.
     According to this theorem, the      average pressure at any point   of   an   in
compressible frictionless     fluid
                              originally          but set in motion and
                                               at rest,
kept in motion by solids moving to and fro, or whirling round in any
manner, through a finite space of
                                         it,
                                         equal to
                                         is       constant diminished by
                                                       a
the product of the density into half the square of the velocity.  This im
mediately explains the attractions demonstrated in your experiments     for   ;
in each case the average of square of velocity  greater on the side of the
                                                  is
card nearest the tuning-fork      than on the remote side. Hence obviously
the card must be attracted       by
                                 the fork as you have found    to be
                                                                 it  but ;         it
is not so easy at first sight to perceive that the average of the square of
the velocity must be greater on the surfaces of the tuning-fork next to the

card than on the remote portions of the vibrating surface.        Your theoreti
cal observation, however, that the attraction must be mutual, is beyond
doubt valid, as we may convince ourselves by imagining the stand which
bears    the tuning-fork and the card to be perfectly free to move through
the fluid.     If the card were attracted towards the tuning-fork, and there
were not an equal and opposite force on the remainder of the whole surface of
the tuning-fork and support, the whole system would commence moving, and
continue movingwith an accelerated velocityinthe direction of the force acting
on the card — an impossible result.       It might, indeed, be argued that this
result is not impossible, as it might be said that the kinetic energy of the
vibrations could gradually transform itself into kinetic energy of the solid
mass moving through the fluid, and of the fluid escaping before and closing
up behind the solid.        But " common sense" almost suffices to put down
such an argument, and elementary mathematical theory, especially the
theory of momentum in hydro-kinetics explained in my article on
                                                                           " Vor
tex-motion," negatives it.
    The law of the attraction which you observed agrees perfectly with the
law of magnetic attraction in a certain ideal case which may be fully speci
fied by the application of a principle explained in a short article communi
cated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in February last, as an abstract
of an intended continuation of my paper on " Vortex-motion."              Thus, if
we take as an ideal tuning-fork two globes or disks moving rapidly to and
fro in the line joining their centres, the corresponding magnet will be a
 bar with poles of the same name as its two ends and a double opposite
 pole in its middle.      Again, the analogue of your paper disk is an equal
 and similar diamagnetic of infinite diamagnetic inductive capacity.          The
 mutual force between the magnet and the diamagnetic will be equal and
 opposite to the corresponding hydro-kinetic force at each instant.             To
 apply the analogy, we must suppose the magnet to gradually vary from
 maximum magnetization to zero, then through an equal and opposite mag
 netization back through zero to the primitive magnetization, and so            on
 periodically.    The resultant of fluid pressure on the disk is not at each    in
 stant equal    and    opposite to the magnetic force at the corresponding      in
 stant, but the average resultant of the fluid pressure is equal to            the
 average   resultant of the magnetic force.      Inasmuch as the force on the
 diamagnetic is generally repulsion from the magnet, however the magnet
 be held, and is unaltered in amount by the reversal of the magnetization,
 it follows that the average resultant of the fluid pressure is an attraction
 on the whole towards the tuning-fork into whatever position the tuning-
 fork be turned relatively to it.
    Your seventh experiment* has interested         me even more than any of
 the others.    It illustrates the elementary law of pressure in hydro-kinetics,
not by showing effects of fluid pressure on portions of a solid bounding

   No branch of abstract dynamics has had greater charm for the ma         a
thematical worker than hydro-kinetics, but     has not hitherto been made
                                                                      it

notably to give to this branch of dynamics quite different place in populara
estimation from that which        has held   but what

   I  will now consider some interesting results in definite integrals obtained
from the solution of linear differential equations.
    Let us first consider the linear differential equation
where b,=     1.

equation, and following the usual method, we find

   This paper    describes   the instruments and processes employed in a series
of experiments on the specific inductive capacity of paraffine, and the
effect upon it of variations of temperature.          The instruments described are
the platymeter and the sliding condenser.              The former of these was, in a
rudimentary form, shown to the Mathematical and Physical Section of the
 British Association at its Glasgow Meeting in 1855, by W. Thomson.                 It
consists of two equal and similar condensers employed for the comparison of
electrostatic capacities. The sliding condenser is a condenser the capacity
of which may be varied by known quantities by altering the effective area
of the opposed surfaces. By means of these two instruments, along with
the quadrant electrometer, the capacity of a condenser may be determined
by equalizing the sliding condenser to it.             The method of working, and
the electrical actions upon which it depends, are described in detail.              In

order to determine the capacity of the sliding condenser at the lower extre
mity of its range, a spherical condenser, so constructed that its capacity
could be accurately determined in absolute measure, was employed.         An
apparent discrepancy  in the results obtained, arising from an  inequality in
the condensers   forming the platymeter, is then considered, and the method
of deducing the true result investigated.    A series of experiments is then
described which gave 1*975 as the specific inductive capacity of paraffine,
that of air being taken as unity, but failed to show whether this alters with
variations of temperature.   An improved form of condenser, composed of
concentric brass cylinders with paraffine for the dielectric, and the results
obtained from it, are then described. The measurements made at different
temperatures show no variation of specific inductive capacity.    In order to
allow to the paraffine freedom of expansion with temperature, another
form of condenser was employed, and the same results obtained. A series
of experiments     was then made on the expansion   of paraffine with tempera
ture, in .order to estimate the effect of this upon the capacity of paraffine
condensers. As a mean of the results, it was found that the linear expan
sion of paraffine at 9° C. is '000237 per degree.      Some further measure
ments of the cylindrical condenser were made with the same result as
before.    Thus all the measurements of this condenser made at temperatures
ranging from — 1 2°- 1 5 to 24*35 C. show no variation of specific inductive
capacity of paraffine with temperature.      This was found to be 1*977, that
of air being taken as unity.
   In a note added to the paper a description is given of an improved form
of sliding condenser.

 molecule of the liquid so disturbed.
    This problem, however, i3 by no means so difficult as the other. There
is, indeed, a case in which it admits of solution.              It is that of a liquid
flowing from a reservoir, in which its surface is kept always at the same
level, through a circular pipe which is perfectly straight, and of the same
 diameter throughout, and of a uniform smoothness or roughness of internal
 surface, and always full of the liquid. The liquid would obviously in such
a pipe arrange     itself in infinitely thin cylindrical films coaxial with the pipe,
 all the molecules in the same film moving with the same velocity, but the
 molecules of diiferent films with velocities varying from the axis of the pipe
 to its internal surface.       The direction of the motions of the molecules of
 such a liquid being known, and all in the same film moving with the same
 velocity, which velocity is a function of the radius of the film, and the law
of the resistance of each film to the slipping over it of the contiguous film
being assumed to be known, as also the head of water, it is possible to
 express mathematically
    (1st) the work done per unit of time by the force which gives motion to
 the liquid, and
    (2nd) the work per unit of time of the several resistances to which the
liquid in moving through the pipe         is subjected, and
    (3rd)   the  work  accumulated per    unit of time in the liquid which escapes —
and thus to constitute an equation in which the dependent variables arc
the radius of any given film, and the velocity of that film.            This equation
being differentiated and the variables separated, and the resulting differen
tial equation being integrated, there is obtained          the formula
                                               250 r
                                          V      l    '
where     v  is the velocity of the film whose radius is r, and e0 that of the
central   filament,  and I the length of the pipe — the unit of length being one
metre, and of time one second.
    The method by which the author has arrived at this formula is substan
tially the same as that which he before used in a paper read before the
Society on the
                     " Mechanical Impossibility of the Descent of Glaciers by
their weight only," and which he believes to be a method new to me
chanical science.       It was indeed to verify it in its application to liquids
that he undertook the investigations which he now submits to the Society,
which, however, he has pursued beyond their original object.
    The recent experiments of MM. Uarcy and Bazin* have supplied him
with the means of this verification.           These experiments, made with ad
mirable skill and precision, on pipes upwards of 1 00 metres in length, and
varying in diameter from 0m,0122 to 0m,5, under heads of water varying

in height from    Om-027 to 30m,714, include (together with numerous experi
ments on the quantity of water which flows per second from such pipes
under different conditions) experiments on the velocities of the films of
water at different distances from the axes of the pipes, made by means of
an improved form and adaptation of the well-known tube of Pitot.           These
last-mentioned experiments afford the means of verifying the above-men
tioned formulae. With a view to this verification, the author has compared
the formula with sixty of the experiments of       M. Darcy, and stated   the re
sults in the first two Tables of his paper.
   The discharge per     1" from a pipe   of  a given radius may be calculated
from the above formula in terms of the velocity of the central filament.
This calculation the author has made, and compared it with the results of
eleven   of M. Darcy 's experiments.
   Where in the formula which thus represents the discharge from a pipe
of given radius, in terms of the velocity of the central filament, the radius
is made infinite, an expression is obtained for the volume of liquid of a
cylindrical form, but of infinite dimensions (laterally), which would be put
in motion by a single filament of liquid which traversed its axis j and, con
versely, it gives the volume of such a liquid in motion which would be held
back by a filament of liquid kept at rest along its axis.       Thus it explains
the well-known retarding effect of filaments of grass and roots in retarding
the velocities of streams.
   It is the relation of the velocity of any film to that of the central fila
ment which the author establishes in the above formula.         To the complete
solution of the problem it is necessary that he should further determine the
actual velocity v0 of the central filament.     This is the object of the second
part of his paper. This velocity being known, the actual discharge per
 1" is known.     The following is the formula finally arrived at : —

    The author compares this formula with sixty-two of M. Darcy's experi
ments, and records the results of this comparison in the last three Tables
of his paper.
    The paper concludes with an investigation of the rise in the temperature
of a liquid flowing through a pipe caused by the resistances which its
coaxial films oppose to their motions on one another (or, ns it is termed,
their frictions on one another) and on the internal surface of the pipe.

    The object of the author in carrying out the experiments recorded in the
present paper was to inquire whether the regulating-power of the organism
held good under great variations of muscular exertion. For this purpose
he made frequent daily examinations of his own temperatures during a
short walking tour in Switzerland, and found that the effect of continuous
muscular exertion upon himself was to sharpen the curve of daily varia
tion— the culmination being one or two tenths higher than usual, and the
evening fall coming on more rapidly and somewhat earlier.        Charts of the
 daily temperatures were handed in with the paper.       The author made re
ference also to some observations of M. Lortet, which differed from his
 own.    These observations, which did not come into Dr. Clifford Allbutt's
 hands until his own experiments were partially completed, were adduced
by M. Lortet to prove that the human body was very defective in regu
lating-power under the demands of the combustion needed to supply the
 force expended in muscular exertion.       Dr. Clifford Allbutt's results were
 very decidedly opposed   to those  of M.  Lortet ; for only on two occasions
 did he note the depressions of temperature which M. Lortet regards as
 constant.   It would seem, however, that the body is more or less liable
 to such depressions when engaged in muscular exertion ; but the cause of
 them is very obscure. Of the two low temperatures noted by the author,
 one occurred during a very easy ascent of lower slopes, and the second was
 observed during a descent.    The author think; that they may be due to
 some accidental deficiency in combustion, and inquires whether the capa
 city of the chest in different individuals  may account for the varying in

II. " Observations        of the Eclipse at Oxford, December            22, 1870."
       By John Phillips, M.A., D.C.L., F.H.S., Professor of Geology
       in the University of Oxford.           Received    December 28, 1870.
   At my observatory, situated about         one third  of a  mile eastward from the
great establishment founded in the name of Dr. Itadcliffe, the beginning of
the eclipse was obscured by n passing cloud : the end was recorded at
13" 38' 38"= lh 35' 0"-9 Oxford mean time.
   The progress of the obscuration was observed at unclouded intervals in
the first half of the period, continuously during a clear sky in the latter
half. Finding it impracticable to observe and measure with ordinary
micrometers in the early part of the phenomenon,            I arranged to throw the
image on a screen, and make my measures on it.
   The driving-clock was affected by the extreme cold, so as to make it
difficult to keep the sun's image to one place, and it was convenient for
other reasons sometimes       to shift the image vertically ; the method which        I
employed,      however,   was   independent of these displacements, and allowed
of as many measurements of the cusps as might be desired.
   It  consisted simply in marking at any moment with pencil the situation
of the cusps on the screen, and appending to each dot the time by the
sidereal clock.      Joining, after the eclipse, these dots by a straight line, and
then transferring a parallel line of equal length to meet internally a circle
representing the limb of the sun, of the same diameter as the solar image,
the chord of the cusps at the given time was obtained, from which, by an
easy method, the place of the moon's centre at the moment was derived.
The apparent diameters of the          sun and moon were obtained by measure        of
arcs on the screen.
   The diagrams exhibit the whole process.               In diagram fig.   1,  four of
the lines are drawn from the dots on the screen,          A A, B B, C C, D D.
   In fig.   2, equal and parallel lines are transferred to the solar circle, whose
centre is S, so as to touch    it internally at A' A', B' B', C C, D' D'. For each
of these lines the centre of the moon's place is marked (A", B", C", D") ;
thus the line of the motion of the moon's centre is given, and the phase of
greatest   obscuration determined.
   The line of motion of the moon's centre is obtained by ruling through
the mid points between A" and B", B" and C", C" and D". The point
on this line reached by the moon's centre at the moment of greatest ob
scuration is found by bisection in M.            Drawing through M and S the bi
secting line of greatest obscuration, the length of the sagitta         m  * is deter
mined.

              the places   of the   moon's centre for the cusps A', B', C, D\
    These     numbers, according to the proportions given in the Nautical
Almanac for the Radcliffe Observatory, would have been : —

    The    agreement     is quite close enough to         justify the belief that, in skilful
hands, the method described may be in some cases very useful,                         it being by
no means limited to eclipses.                It is so simple that one can hardly suppose
it not to have been already employed ; but I have met with no notice of
such being the case.
    During the progress of the eclipse three thermometers were observed-
One north of the house, screened from the sun and sky, sank from 20°
at ll-MO"1 to 24°- 4 at l" 2am.                   One south of the house, indirectly in
fluenced by solar radiation on neighbouring objects, rose from 26°-75 at
 1 1" to 27°8 at noon, then sank to 26° at 12h 40m, and rose to 27°'3 at lh 35ra.
A third, on grass open to the sky, sank from 27°-8 at 1 lh 40m to 23°-5 at
 lh 25", and remained at this point till lh 35ra. Though on a limited scale,
the influence both of solar and sky radiation is traceable in these observa
 tions.

  -The problem of the in and circumscribed triaugle is a particular case of
that of the in- and circumscribed polygon : the last-mentioned problem may
be thus stated — to find a polygon such that the angles are situate in and
the sides touch a given curve or curves. And we may in the first instance
inquire as to the number of such polygons.  In the case where the curves
containing the angles and touched by the sides respectively are all of them
distinct curves, the number of polygons is obtained very easily and has a
simple expression i it is equal to twice the product of the orders of the curves
containing the several angles respectively into the product of the classes of
the curves touched by the several sides respectively j or, say, it is equal to
twice the product of the orders of the angle-curves into the product of the
classes       of the side-curves.    But when    several   of the curves     become one and
the same curve, and in particular when the angles                are all     of them situate
irt and the sides all touch one and the same curve,             it is   a   much more diffi
cult problem to find the number of polygons. The solution of this problem
when the polygon is a triangle, and for all the different relations of identity
between the different curves, is the object of the present memoir, which is

     The object of this paper       isto bring within the grasp of calculation what
the author considers        a   much neglected division of shipbuilding science and
art, by investigating the actual longitudinal bending- and shearing-strains to
which the structure      exposed in ships of various forms under the varying
                           is
conditions  to  which  all ships are more or less liable. The weakness exhi
bited by many ships has long pointed to the necessity of further investiga
tion    this direction
         in            and two modern events (the use of iron and steel
                            ;                                                             in
shipbuilding, and the introduction of armoured ships) have added much to
the urgency of the inquiry.
  After glancing briefly at the state of the question as presented in the
¦writings of Bouguer, Bernoulli, Euler, Don Juan D'Ulloa, Romme, Dupin,

vl871.]                  of Weight and Support in Ships.                        293
  and Dr. Young, the author proceeds to show that the introduction of steam
  as a propelling agent, and of largely increased lengths and proportions for
  ships, has brought about a comparative distribution of weight and buoy
  ancy very different from that which those writers contemplated.            He has
  taken the cases of three or four typical modern ships, and has had the re
  lative distributions of the weight and buoyancy very carefully and fully
  calculated and graphically recorded.         Owing to the great labour involved,
  only the most meagre       and  unsatisfactory attempts to measure and exhibit
  the actual strains of ships had previously been made ; and the author's
  results are wholly unlike any that have before been worked out and published.
  The first case is that of the royal yacht ' Victoria and Albert,' which re
  presents the conditions of long fine-lined paddle-steamers, with great
  weights of engines, boilers, and coals concentrated in the middle, combined
  with very light extremities. The second case s that of the 'Minotaur,'
  which represents long fine-lined ships with great weights distributed along
  their length.     The iron-clad ' Bellerophon ' is the third case, representing
  shorter ships with fuller lines and very concentrated midship weights ; and
                                                 '
  the last case is that of the ' Invincible class, in which the weights of
  armour &c. are still more concentrated.         All these ships are divided into
'
  very numerous short lengths ; and the weight of hull, weight of equipment,
  and buoyancy or displacement of each short length are separately calculated,
  curves of weight and buoyancy being constructed from these items used as
  ordinates.     A third curve, of which the ordinates are the differences be
  tween the curves of total weight and of displacement, known as the curve
  of loads, is constructed. By summing the ordinates, or calculating the
  areas of this curve, from point to point, a curve of shearing or racking
  forces is formed ; and by employing the products of the areas of the curve
   of loads (taken step by step) into the distances of their centres of gravity
   from one end as ordinates of a new curve, a curve of bending-moments is
   constructed.
      These operations are performed for all the ships previously named, first
   when they are floating in still water, next when they are respectively float
   ing on the crests of waves of their own lengths, and thirdly when they are
   floating in the hollow of two adjacent waves of those lengths.        The maxi
   mum breaking-strains      of all the ships when  supported on  shore, first at the
   extremities and next at the middle, are also calculated, and compared with
   the still-water and sea strains.
      In  considering still-water strains, the author shows that remarkable con
   trasts of strain occur between ships light and laden, and that the theories
   of former writers on the subject require to be greatly modified. In some
   cases the breaking-strain     is increased as the ship is lightened.       In dis
   cussing the shearing-strains, he points out that the sections of maximum
   shearing-strain in a ship coincide with the balanced or
                                                                 " water-borne sec
          "

maximum shearing-force occupies very different positions in different types
of ship. Sections of zero shearing-force coincide with " sections of water-
borne division," on either side of which the weight balances the buoj-ancy ;
and their number is usually odd.            He afterwards shows that maximum and
minimum       bending-moments are experienced by sections of water-borne
division, and that between two sections of maximum "hogging "-lmment
there must fall either   a  section of minimum hogging-moment or a section
of maximum "sagging "-moment, and that it is an error to suppose (as
all former writers on the subject have done) that the absolute maximum

named moment is in the forebody           ; in  the     Bellerophon
it is in the nfterbody.    The effect of the horizontal fluid pressure in the
longitudinal bending-moments is also discovered, and shown to be important.
   The dynamical aspect of the question — showing the strains brought upon
ships at sea — is admitted to be both the more difficult aud the more im
portant.     In discussing the strains, the author calculates them approxi
mately under the following assumptions: — (1) That for the moment the
effect of the ship's vertical motion may be neglected.                   (2) That for the
moment the ship may be regarded as occupying a position ol hydrostatical
equilibrium.     (3) That the methods of calculating bending- and shearing-
strains previously used for still water may be employed here also, in order
to approximate to the momentary strains.                The following particulars of the

     None of the organs of the body are more visibly affected by great changes
of climate than   these, and their secretions, the urine and perspiration. As
with             and other internal viscera, the congestion of the kidneys
          the lungs      t
lessens,while that of the skin increases, when the blood     attracted to the                        is
surface          by
            heat. The reverse happens when            driven inward     cold.      it     is                                by
This involves their special and vicarious, waste-product and water-excreting
functions alike.               In the tropics the skin doubtless
                                                    excretes much of the
water thrown off               by
                     the kidneys and lungs in colder regions, as well as the
nitrogen and carbon of the former, and carbonic acid of the latter.     The
elimination of surplus water, one of the most important  uses  of all of the
four great depurating organs,      largely effected by these two.

293                          Dr. A. Rattray          on the    Effects of                   [Feb. 16,
    The following experiments             were made         on myself (set. 39), on a voyage
from England          to Bahia     (lat.  11°   S.),   between      June and September 1869.
During 21 days, from Plymouth to the thermal Equator, drink (tea or
coffee) being limited to 39 oz. daily, tbe
                                                             urine gradually decreased from
39 to 30 oz., which merely proved that iu semitropical, as in temperate
 climates, free fluid is chiefly thrown off by the kidneys, and that this
 diminishes as the heat increases.
     The following Table gives the                 results of the two subsequent days,
while passing through the equatorial doldrums or greatest heat, the drink
 being suddenly increased to 88 oz. daily :

      Thus nearly 37 oz. were excreted by the kidneys, leaving 51 oz. to be
  accounted for.         Now the bile is scarcely if at all increased in the tropics,
  bo  that    the  liver  gives little aid.       Dalton* gives -fa of the drink as the
  average thrown off in this form and by the bowels in temperate latitudes.
      Taking this for the tropics also, allowing a little increase for bile, we have
  4-4 oz.       And reducing the water exhaled by the lungs in the temperate
  zone (which, according to Dalton, is % of the drink or 22 oz.)by the same
  ratio as the respired air, viz. 11 per cent, or 2*42 oz., we have 19'58 oz. as
  that for the tropics.           The sum of these two is 23*98 oz. Then the
                              51 oz. not thrown off by the kidneys
                           — 23*98 oz. excreted by the lungs and bowels
                       gives  2/-02 oz. for the skin to exhale.
   So that the 88 oz. free          fluid were got rid of thus : —
               Urine 37 oz., skin 27"02 oz., lungs               19*58 oz., faeces 4*4 oz.
       Had the water in the solid ingesta                 been reckoned, a         difficult matter on
   shipboard, the experiment would have been                        more satisfactory.          But this
   gives a fair approximation, inasmuch as any excess from this source would
   only have gone to increase the perspiration.
       The relative excretion of free fluid by the skin, kidneys, lungs, and bowels,
    thus, differs in temperate and tropical latitudes, as they doubtless do in
   arctic regions (Table          II.).

    While the urine thus        decreases from 59 \ to 42 per cent., the perspiration
rises from 8|    to  30   per  cent.,  there being a slighter fall of 4£ per cent, from
the lungs, and a trifling rise from the bowels. The kidneys are thus the
chief eliminators of surplus water in the tropics as in temperate regions ;
but in the former it is the skin,           as in the latter it is the lungs that rank
next.    If suddenly stressed,, however, by excessive imbibition, and the
safety-valve action of the kidneys or skin be brought into play, these pro
portions doubtless differ.         "Will they hold good for permanent residents in
the tropics, foreign or native 1
    The increased perspiration in the tropics or in artificial heat, and dimi
nished urinary and pulmonic water-excretion by 22 per cent., is equal to a
proportionate increase in the cutaneous circulation and corresponding with
drawal of blood from the kidneys to the extent of 17 \ per cent., and lungs
of A\ per cent. Moreover this diminished exhalation of watery vapour
from the lungs, by vicarious action of the skin, still further decreases the
amount of blood circulating through them, already shown to be reduced by
 12*24 per cent., or 16'62fl.oz. by a diminished excretion of carbonf.                   The
total decrease in the lung circulation is thus :          —
                   16-62 fl. oz.

                =23-04 fl. oz.       as the total permanent withdrawal of blood
                                from the lungs by an average temp, of 80-83° F.
    These facts appear highly interesting in the etiology of these and other
important internal and external organs, as well as hygienically and thera
peutically suggestive.

  doubtless involves not only the urea and chloride of sodium*, but all of its
 ordinary ingredients.         Both would be far more regular if the system could
 be kept day by day in strictly similar conditions as to exercise, clothing,
 draughts, food, and especially drink — a difficult matter nt sea, though pos
 sible on shore.      So that by limiting the drink and increasing it only as
 thirst prompted, the quantity of urine would keep at a uniform and perhaps
healthier standard.         The individually different quantities necessary to ac
complish this may be easily ascertained. Thus , allowing 25 oz. free fluid
to be what my system requires daily in the average temperature of London
(50° F.), the addition of 1 fl. oz. for every degree above, or its deduction
for every degree below that, would keep the urine pretty equable, even
though its    specific gravity aud solids might alter           (Table   IV.).

    Here both the quantity and specific gravity increased somewhat ; so that
 the urine is perhaps not so often or much diminished in the tropics as usually
believed.      It is so when the drink is stinted, and when, though ample, it is
 not increased and decreased with the temperature (Table III.) ; but when
this is done it remains pretty uniform (Table V.), as it often does even when
taken in excess.       It is not so much the nephritic as the cutaneous secretion
which alters with variations in the amount of drink in the tropics, and in
temperate climates the reverse.             The functionally excited skin acts as a

safety-valve for the kidneys in warm, as the latter do for the former in
colder ones.     While the perspiration depends much on the temperature,
the urine is most influenced by the drink. Although heat, or its absence
(cold), is thus the chief agent in causing these fluctuations, the humidity,
velocity, &c. of the air are not altogether negative.           The first acts by sti
mulating or checking the sudatory glands, and all three by favouring or
opposing evaporation.       Frequent change of climate tends to develope the
ordinary and safety-valve range of action in both organs.               In these facts
lie several important hygienic and therapeutic indications for the tropics,
with a view to prevent or lessen distressing hyperemia of the skin and
excessive perspiration, both the result of undue imbibition, and the latter
highly dangerous when suddenly checked, and a frequent cause of disease.
By them the reason of the efficacy of tropical, and especially subtropical
 climates in the prevention when imminent, and cure or relief when actually
present, of many diseases of internal organs, not of the abdomen alone, but
 of thoracic ones, is explained. The sanatory haematic and secretive de
 rivative action of natural (tropical) and artificial heat has been already
 pointed out with regard to the lungs*.           Might not the practical phy
 sician more frequently act on this hint as to the means and extent by
 which both the circulation and the function of diseased or over-taxed in
 ternal organs may be relieved by thus transferring their blood-current and
 secretion to sounder ones 1 Is" not this great and general law of a deriva

    V. The Influence of Tropical Climates        on the Weight and Strength.
    Besides the already discussed functional, vascular, and other changes in
 the lungs, skin, kidneys, and other organs of vegetable life, which follow
 a transition from temperate to tropical climates, various phenomena affecting
 those of animal life are also common — e.g. languor of body and brain, and
 generally a loss of weight.     More tardy and less evident, but equally worth
 study, these are not due, like the former, to the general diversionjn the
 blood-current   from internal to external parts, but to changes in the blood
 itself and the tissues which it nourishes, to be hereafter investigated.
     Occasionally an individual fattens on going to the tropics, and, instead of
 losing, gains health and strength.     Again, a corpulent person may decrease
 considerably   in  weight,  while his health,   so far from impairing, actually
 improves.     But such cases are exceptional, and, doubtless, consist merely
 in vitally unimportant fluctuations in the     adipose    tissue  ; and as   a rule  the
 issue includes a loss in both respects,   which,   if not    disease, is closely allied
  to it.  An opposite result usually follows    a contrary change        of climate.

     The following experiments to illustrate this were made in H.M.S. ' Sala

years on the east coast of Australia, while making triannual trips between
Sydney (lat. 34°) and Cape York, Torres Strait (lat. 10|° S.), a distance of
 1 700 miles in a nearly north and south direction.                              The crew numbered

     Thus 192 (91*86 per cent.) were under thirty-five, which may be con
sidered the prime of life among seamen ; while the whole were healthy.
They were weighed as far as possible in the same clothes, and between
6 and 7 p.m., about two hours after a                   light   " supper" of           tea and biscuit,
in order to reduce error from variations in the state of the bowels, stomach,
bladder,      &c, to a minimum. Their faulty diet, however, unmodified for
temperature, and containing salt meat and other hurtful articles, was an
unavoidable disadvantage.               Fortunately this enables us to observe the effect
of an agency far more under control for modification or removal than climate.

added to tbese results; and to make tbe experiment thoroughly satisfactory,
fresh meat should alo ne be issued — almost an impossibility in the present
transition state of naval dieting.   Still the event is sufficiently decisive to
prove the prejudicial  influence  of tropical climates on the physique, at all
ages.    Of 15 officers and men subsequently tested after 17 days more
prolonged and direct solar exposure, but with a larger allowance of fresh
(preserved) meat, 1 1 had lost from 1 to 9 lbs. (average 3^T), 1 being un
changed, while 3 had gained.    Of the latter, one was a black (and there
fore in his native climate), who increased 1 lb., the other two being healthy
boys who gained 1 and 2 lb. respectively.      This shows that the wasting
effect of tropical weather in the adult white is not preventible even hy a
iudicious regimen.

      Table    III.,   the record of another trip to Torres Strait, also during the
S.E. monsoon, shows that the body is still further affected when                               a  third
injurious influence, viz. hard subsolar work, is added to these.                            Thus, of
 103 weighed, 1 per cent. lost flesh to an average of 7 lb. nearly ; the
number of boys and young men being large, because most employed,
although the average individual loss was greatest among the seniors — thus
 6 lb., 7 lb., and 9 lb. under 25, 35, and 45 respectively.                          This did not
 arise    from a reduced diet ; for the daily average consumption at the end
 of the period, when thus losing, had increased by 3| oz. per man.
      A contrast of Tables IV. and V. further shows that season materially
 influences this reduction in weight.                 Table IV. gives the results of 46 days
 during the cool dry S.E. monsoon (aver. temp. 82° F.), which lasts for
 9 months ; and Tabic V. of 54 days during the sultry rainy N.W. mon
 soon (aver. temp. 87° F.), an exaggerated form of tropical weather related
 to the other as are the winter and summer in temperate latitudes.                               While
 the number who lost flesh during the dry season was 44 per cent., it was
 70 per cent. during the wet monsoon.                     The small per centage of gain even
 among the strong and vigorous juniors in the wet season, viz. 10 and 14|
 per cent., is worthy of contrast with that of the dry season, viz. 59| and
43£ per cent., as it shows that even the healthiest age cannot long with
 stand the emaciating influence of the worst season of the tropical year. The
 high average percentage of loss              (71b.)    and low percentage of gain, 2f lb.,
 during       the wet, contrasted with that of the dry monsoon (31b. and
        lb.), which equally affects all ages, further illustrates this. The in

304                             Dr. A. Rattray          on the     Effects        of                   [Feb.    1G,
creased ingesta towards                the end of both experiments could not prevent
these results       ;   nor is the difference between the two seasons ascribable to
a   material dissimilarity           in the quantity of the food.

fresh meat and vegetable diet, light work, frequent leave, &c.   Thus after
a 54 days' stay at Sydney in spring, notwithstanding the debilitating effect
of 35 salt meat days before and after the experiment, no fewer than 90 per
cent. had either gained flesh or lost nothing, the average gain being large
(6 lbs.). In the 9| per cent. who lost, this was probably due, as it occurred
among the juniors, to those excesses so common after long confinement on
board.
   Thus, during the three years over which these triannual trips from Syd
ney to Cape        York         the weight of the crew was continually oscil
                            extended,
lating, increasing at the former, and again decreasing on returning to the
tropics.    Frequent, sudden, and great changes of temperature and climate
like this, are doubtless fertile causes in undermining the constitution and
inducing premature old age.  But for the re-invigorating influence of the
periodic return to cool weather, many more would have succumbed to
broken health.           As it    is,   Table   VII.      years 44 per cent.
                                                        shows that after     1|
of those who originally went out in the ship had lost flesh, while other evi
dence showed that the health and strength of all had declined, there being
moreover no proof of the occurrence in any of that doubtful event, accli
matization.         The appetite          and   consumption       of food had          also diminished
from the same cause.

     Thus Table IX. shows that after a 55 days' passage from the cool
climate of England across the equator to the south temperate zone, 65
per cent. of the crew had lost flesh to an average of 7 lb. nearly — the
juniors suffering, though not so much as the seniors. An increased sick-
 list at the close corresponds to this. These results were not due to a
 decrease     in the ingesta, as the daily consumption during the last averaged
 6 oz. more than during the first week. The cause was therefore partly
 climatic and partly dietetic, salt meat being issued most of the time.

308                         Dr. A. Rattray on         the   Effects of                      [Feb. 16,
    Very different    was the effect     of the 44 days' continuation of the voyage to
 Sydney along the 40th parallel of south latitude, after a health-infusing stay
 of fifteen days at Simons Bay (Table X.). Although the usual sea dietary
was continued, the exit from the tropics was an evident relief to the system,
 which, but for the diet, would have retained its vigour throughout.                               As it
was.only 26, = 1 9"69 per cent., lost flesh slightly. All the boys, who had the
 strong vital resilience of youth in their favour, gained in weight, and also
the younger men, while the seniors lost.                    An increase in the ingesta of
 7  drams    daily  towards   the    end  of the   period is too trivial to have influenced
these results.       This shows how long the system will ward off the scorbutic
 diathesis when opposed by no other serious adverse agency, provided lime-
juice is given as a prophylactic.              The increased sick-list and intensity of
the ailments, however, towards the end of the period, show that the immu
nity was passing off. The difference in the percentage of those who lost
 flesh in this and the former part of the voyage (Table IX.), is evidently
the effect of climate, and indirectly confirms Tables I. and II.
    To   the bracing effect      of the S.    temperate       zone     we must chiefly ascribe
the recovery of the crew. Wasted while crossing the equator, only 29 per
cent, were below their original weight in England on arrival at Sydney.
This loss, though evident among the juniors, was chiefly among the adults
and older men (Table XI.).               The superior health and efficiency of a crew
in cool climates is an evident indication in planning long voyages. And
 we have only to recollect the position and direction of the chief winds and
ocean-currents usually followed, to see how much these favour the mainte
nance of health as well as rapidity of progress.

    Thus, though 55 days in all were spent at Madeira, Simons Bay, Sydney,
and Brisbane, on a health-giving fresh meat and vegetable diet (see Table
VI), and lime-juice freely given, the monotony -and confinement of 175 days
at sea, with 156 salt-meat days, a double exposure to the tropics, and fre
quent changes of temperature, had increased the number who had lost
weight since leaving England to 65 per cent. — a decided index of failing
health and near approach to disease, and perhaps the scorbutic climax.
    Similar fluctuations in weight, subsequently observed in the larger crew
of H.M.S. 'Bristol' during               a voyage of 88 days from England to Bahia
 (lat.  1 1°
              S.)  and   back,  are   equally interesting and instructive (Table XIII).
    Thus the warm weather and salt-meat diet of the first 57 days caused
85 per cent. to lose weight, which rose to 88 per cent. as the time lengthened
to 88 days.          The return to the north temperate zone, however, speedily
reduced this to 47 per cent. As the diet was the same, the latter event
 must have been purely climatic — an opinion confirmed by the subsequent
 effect of 28 days' harbour-life in England, when the number who lost went
 down to 10*7 per cent., no fewer than 89 per cent. regaining flesh and
 more than making up for the previous loss.

    Thus    85 per cent,   of the men lost flesh during the first 57 days, but only
56 per cent, of the boys, and 58 per cent, of the cadets.                    Again, during
                                                     —
the first 88 days the percentages were men 88, boys 60, cadets 65.
Further, while 53 per cent, of the men began to recover weight on reenter
ing cool weather, 73 per cent, of the boys and 58 per cent, of the cadets
did the same.        Lastly, in England, while 89 per cent, of the men gained,
among the boys we find 90| per cent., and among the cadets 100 per cent.
The     advanced age, greater strength, and rougher early life of the boys
enabled them to bear the voyage better, and recover sooner under genial
agencies than the younger delicately-reared cadets.                 On the other hand,
a generous diet and better regulated life caused the latter to increase more
in England.        Under favourable conditions, as to climate, diet, &c, the
weight of men, and particularly boys, should not fluctuate thus.                      Nor can
such changes be salutary.           As a rule adults, with fully developed frames,
should remain pretty stationary in weight.              Boys, however, should increase
not only in weight, but in height and breadth of chest. For the former
to emaciate, or the latter to grow taller and broader, while the weight
remains the same or lessens, is a sure sign of present or impending mis
 chief.     The average of l£ lb. per week by which these cadets increased at
home, may be considered the healthy rate of growth for boys of their age.
And we may give Table XV. to show the effect of subsequent longer leave
 in England on the physique of a larger number of cadets.

    Thus, of 52 cadets) 93 per cent, either did not lose or gained flesh to the
 average of 1 lb. per week, while 63 per cent, increased in height, and no
 doubt in capacity of chest ; but the time was too short to obtain satisfac
 tory results as to this. Obviously, therefore, if cadets are long subjected
 to influences which retard their growth, even               if disease    does not ensue,
 their future strength, both of body and brain, is apt to be impaired ; while
 ship's boys and young seamen are not likely to become physical athletes*
 nor adults to retain their vigour as fighting men.             These conclusions neces
 sarily apply to all similarly situated.

      If   we can isolate the effects         of tropical weather     so as to contrast them
  with those of other health-impairing                agencies,   it will   be both interesting
  and practically useful.           Table   XVI.    shows when we find the greatest gain
  or greatest loss of weight.            Life under the healthiest conditions, in which
  the highest gain (90£ per cent.) and lowest loss                  (9| per cent.) occurs, is
  first given as a standard for comparison and index                of what should be aimed
  at in all latitudes and circumstances.

     We here notice a progressive decrease in the number who gain or do not
 lose   in weight, and necessarily a corresponding increase' in the percentage
 of those who lose, according to the variety and intensity of the adverse
 agencies.        Thus fewest emaciate when the influences are altogether genial,
viz. 9-64 per cent.           An injurious diet raises this to 19-69 percent. Under
tropical     climate   it rises  to 64-/l.     Under the latter and salt meat combined,
it again rises to 65-22 per cent., and in the rainy season to 76-34 per cent.
When, besides this, hard work is undergone, it mounts to 91*26 per cent.
The average gain and loss columns show a similar though less regular in
crease and decrease.             Tropical climate is thus by far the most injurious
influence     ; and its effects are materially aggravated by other adverse agencies.
[And       the   Tables show that these facts apply to the junior as well as the
senior ages, though occasionally more apparent in the latter. — Feb. 27.]
     We must know the nature of these universal and marked changes in the
weight, and the tissues involved, before we can decide whether they are
physiological or pathological, and, if the latter, satisfactorily direct our
hygienic or therapeutic efforts to prevent or remedy them.                         We cannot
ascertain by anatomical or histological investigation ; but we may fairly
suppose that every or nearly every tissue is more or less implicated — those

  which carry on the functions of animal life being most affected, especially
  such as form the great bulk of the body.                It would be difficult to say
  whether the watery part of the blood and body generally is reduced by ex
  cessive perspiration.     The osseous system and thoracic and abdominal viscera
  are probably little changed.         The fibrous and gelatinous are perhaps more
  altered ; but it would be difficult to separate this from the change in the
  fatty muscular and nervous tissues, the three doubtless most of all affected.
  In warm latitudes less fat is required than in cold ones to keep out cold and
  generate internal heat or muscular force.           Hence nature uses it up in its
  vital processes, and thus first gets rid of what does not itself play a vital
  part in the human economy, or materially influence health by its removal,
  and would only prove an encumbrance.               The prevalent languor of body
  and mind no doubt arise partly from diminished energy in the nervous and
  muscular tissues j but are they not also, and perhaps principally, due to a
  decrease   in their bulk, similar to that in other tissues 1 Strength is the
  manifestation of muscle acted on by nervous influence; and, from several
  experiments made on the officers and crew of H.M.S. 'Bristol,' strength
  decreases and increases with the foregoing changes in weight — a fact which
  goes far to prove that       though loss of strength may be partly of nervous
  origin,  the muscular tissue is also largely involved in its production, and
 is probably      both    physiologically      weakened    and physically       altered    in
  texture*.
      The cause of this reduction in weight in the tropics is threefold            : — first,
 a diminished      necessity   for surplus fat, which becomes        absorbed    ;   second,
 that peculiar and not easily explained physiological effect of heat, which
 causes the tissues to decay faster than in cold latitudes ; third, diminished
 lung-work and blood-oxygenation, and thereby an imperfect renewal of
 tissue.    On the other hand, the languor and weakness are due, first, to loss
 and relaxation of the muscular substance             ;  second,   to a similar loss of
 nervous tone and matter          ;  third,  to suboxidation     of the bloodf, which
 impairs the activity not only of the        muscles,   but of the nerve-centres which
 originate, and nerve-cords which transmit motor and sensory impressions ;
 [and, fourthly, in their early stage, to a reduced supply of their vital stimu
 lant the blood, diverted from the internally situated nerve centres, nerves,
and muscles, to the cutaneous surface. — Feb. 27.] The early and primary
 results of tropical warmth on the tissues are probably chiefly physical and
quantitative ; but when prolonged, especially if conjoined with an erroneous
 diet, their composition is affected, and they are also chemical and qualitative.
     What are the true bearings and diagnostic value of this closely-allied loss
of weight and strength ? Are they solely physiological ? or when do theV
become pathological ?          Do they always, or at what stage do they indicate
    * These data  were scarcely ample enough for tabulation.     The ship's motion, imper
fect testing apparatus, and difficulty of finding one equally suited for all men, in whom
the best-developed sets of muscles often differ, make this a troublesome inquiry.

        a    loss  of vitality or health ? If decreased weight originates merely in an
        absorption of fatty tissue, and no strength is lost, the result is at least not
        unhealthy.          But when other tissues are involved (and it would be difficult
        to decide when they are, as this doubtless varies even in the same individual),
        it is then, if not disease, closely allied to it — and certainly an indication of
        an impaired and debilitated           physique, prone to succumb to other morbific
        agencies, and ultimately to induce premature decay and old age.                    Physio
        logical in their earlier stage, they soon become of doubtful nature, and
        finally decidedly pathological.           And that there is a special and not merely
        a general relation between these phenomena and the health appears, first,
        from the results being so marked, uniform, and generally prevalent ; second,
        from concurrent indications of debility, shown by a progressive iucrease iu
        the amount and severity of sickness ; and, third, by a marked decrease in
        the loss of weight and strength in the tropics, when some of the agencies
        which indirectly augment its influence are removed, as will be proved by
        the following Table, which shows the effect of an improved diet.
             During a similar voyage from England to the South Atlantic, in two of
        Her Majesty's ships, both crews were subjected to a corresponding amount
        of tropical weather ; but the number of salt-meat days in H.M.S. ' Bristol'
        was twelve fewer than in H.M.S. 'Salamander' *, the result being that in
        the former the number of those who lost flesh and strength was reduced by
        22 per cent.

The general loss of flesh (in other words, absorption of internal tissue)
which results from the salt-meat dietary of long voyages, and which is here
seen   to be so greatly intensified in and by tropical climate, is really the
essence and- primary stage of scurvy, and corresponds in principle and
nature with the visible, external, and superficial breaking down and loss of
substance in the phlegmous abscesses, ulcers, &c, still too prevalent in the
service, and in its more serious and advanced forms of the dysentery, and
putrid ulcer,     once   so common and fatal ; while the intensity, obstinacy,
and sometimes       the  origin of many other local and general diseases frequent
among seamen, e. g. rheumatism, syphilis, struma, various fevers, con
tinued,    contagious and periodic,           &c, have doubtless       an   equally   close
alliance.— Feb. 27.]
   These experiments were carried out in super-oceanic climates.                 It would
be interesting to know how the weight and strength are affected in conti
nental ones, where the range of temperature and humidity &c. are greater,
as, for example, when troops are moved from the cool hilly regions of India
to its sultry lowlands.
   These facts suggest important hygienic and therapeutic indications                 ;  for
example    : —
   First. That the tropics, especially during the rainy season, should be
avoided by natives of colder latitudes.
   Second. That the young, the debilitated, and the diseased should espe
cially shun warm regions.
   Third. That none but full-grown healthy adults should go there.
   Fourth. That with all, even the latter, a speedy exit should be made
therefrom, when great loss of flesh and strength give warning of approach
ing disease.
   Fifth. That such injurious agencies as may increase the weakening or
disease-inducing influences of tropical climates, of themselves irremediable,
should be avoided, e. g. faulty diet, over fatigue, impure air, &c.
   Sixth. That, to preserve health, a tropical climate should be frequently
changed for the more temperate ones of higher altitudes or latitudes.

                                  VI.  Conelvsion.
   The ultimate object of these varied functional and organic changes
induced in the human frame by change of climate, is to accommodate it to
altered meteorological and other conditions, and assimilate it to those of
native races.    It  is the ease   or difficulty with which different varieties of
mankind, ages, sexes, and idiosyncrasies become accustomed to this that
indicates their capability for what we term acclimatization.        [Would not a
more intimate acquaintance than we yet possess with the differences
in the minute anatomy and functions of the various tissues and orgaus
of these different races and families, and also their correlation and capability
or not of assimilation under change of climate, go far to decide the long-
vexed questions as to the unity or plurality of species and of creative centres ?
— Feb. 27.] In these important changes, moreover, especially that in the
current of the blood from the interior to the surfaceof the body on proceeding
to the tropics, there is an evident analogy with certain great operations which
take place under similar circumstances in the inorganic world.        The air and
ocean likewise heat as they proceed towards the equator, and finally overflow
to form those beneficent winds and sea-currents which play so important a
part in the economy of the globe, and influence its hygiene, therapeutics, and
etiology, not less than its commerce. And although in these it acts on what
may be termed the centre of their circulation, whereas in the human frame it
operates  on its periphery, the agent in all three is the same, viz. the sun's
heat, as is the primary effect, viz. a change in the direction of original
currents, as well as the final results, viz. purification and modification of
temperature.      The general physical and general hygienic and curative
schemes of nature are thus evidently connected.           Without these pheno
mena the heat    of tropical lands and seas, and cold of other regions, would be
intolerable, and that of the skin and body too high or too low for the main
tenance of their vitality ; while both the air, ocean, and blood would rapidly
become impure and unfit to sustain life.
   Deriving   its first and chief impulse from the heart, the blood merely
undergoes redistribution — the current in cold and temperate climates being
directed towards internal, and in the tropics towards external organs, espe
cially the skin.     In either   case it flows from cooler towards more h:ghly
heated regions.     Is not this vital process, therefore, in this respect also, at
least partly akin to the allied phenomena in the air and ocean, and physical
as well as physiological 1      The blood generally being probably somewhat
warmer in the tropics than elsewhere, does not the heating of the surface
and contents of the turgid cutaneous capillaries act as a vis hfronte in in
ducing it to flow towards and accumulate here, as the warm interior does
in cold regions   ?

      II. " On a Registering Spectroscope." By William Huogins,
             LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S. Received January 14, 1870.
     The short duration of the totality of the solar eclipse of December last,
 led me to seek some method by which the positions of lines observed in the
 spectrum of the corona might be instantly registered without removing the
 eye from the instrument, so as to avoid the loss of time and fatigue to the
 eye of reading a micrometer-head, or the distraction of the attention and
 other inconveniences of an illuminated scale.
     After consultation with the optician Mr. Grubb, it seemed that this
 object could   be satisfactorily accomplished by fixing in the eyepiece of the
 spectroscope a pointer which could be moved along the spectrum by a
 quick-motion screw, together with some arrangement by which the
 position of this pointer, when brought into coincidence with a line, could
 be instantly registered.
     I was furnished by Mr. Grubb with an instrument fulfilling these con
 ditions, and also with a similar instrument with some modifications by
 Mr. Ladd, in time for      the observation      of the eclipse.
    Unfortunately at my station at Oran, heavy clouds at the time of totality
 prevented their use on the corona ; but they were found so convenient for
 the rapid registration of spectra, that it appears probable that similar in
struments may be of service for other spectrum-observations.
    In these instruments the small telescope of the spectroscope is fixed,
 and at its focus is a pointer which can be brought rapidly upon any part
 of the spectrum by a screw-head outside the telescope. The spectrum and
 pointer are viewed by a positive eyepiece which slides in front of the tele
scope, so that the part of the spectrum under observation can always be
 brought to the middle -of the field of view.            The arm carrying the pointer
is connected by a lever with a second arm, to the end of which are attached
two    needles, so that these move over about two inches when the pointer is
made to traverse the spectrum from the red to the violet.               Under the ex
tremity    of the arm  fitted   with   the   needles  is  a  frame  containing a card,
firmly held in it by two pins which pierce the card. This frame containing
the card can be moved forward so as to bring in succession five different
portions of the card under the points of the needles ; on each of these
portions of the card a spectrum can be registered.
    The mode of using the instrument is obvious. By means of the screw-
head at the side of the telescope, the pointer can be brought into coin
cidence with a line ; a finger of the other hand is then pressed upon one of
the needles at the end of the arm which traverses the card, and the position
of the line is instantly recorded by a minute prick on the card. A bright
line is distinguished from a dark line by pressing the finger on both needles,
by which a second prick is made, immediately below the other.                   In all
cases the position   of  the  line  is  registered by    the  same  needle, the second
needle being used to denote that the line recorded is a bright one.

 318      Mr. A. H. Garrod    on the relation   of  the Cardiograph     [Feb. 23,
    It was found that from ten to twelve      Fraunhofer lines could be regis
tered   in about 15 seconds,  and that, when the same lines were recorded five
times in succession    on the same card, no sensible difference of position
could be detected     between   the pricks    registering the same line    in the
several   spectra.
   It  is obvious that, by registering the spectra of different substances on
the card, a ready method is obtained of comparing the relative positions
of the lines of their spectra.
    Each spectroscope was furnished with a compound prism, which was made
by Mr. Grubb, and gave a dispersion equal to about two prisms of dense
glass with a refracting angle of 60°.

I. " On the Mutual Relations of         the Apex Cardiograph and the Radial
        Sphygmograph Trace."            By A. H. Garrod, of St. John's
       College, Cambridge.       Communicated by Dr. Garrod. Received
       January 18, 1871.
   A   desire to acquire an accurate knowledge of the relation borne by the
commencing contraction of the heart to the origin of the primary rise in
the pulse at the wrist, led the author to construct an instrument which
has enabled him to determine, with considerable accuracy, the mutual
relation of these two points, and to demonstrate one or two unexpected
results, not altogether without interest.
   The cardio-sphygmograph above mentioned consists of a piece of board,
 10 inches long by 5 Ranches broad, and about half an inch thick, along one
side of which a sphygmograph can be laid, as shown in fig. 1.             On the
opposite side a spring (a) like that employed in the sphygmograph is
attached to a moveable support (b), so that its tension can be modified.
To the free end of the spring a small pad (c) is fixed, which is in com
munication with the cardiograph apparatus by means of a silk thread (d).
This latter instrument consists of    a  light lever (e), a little over 2 inches
long, connected to the board first mentioned by a frame (/) which is just
free from the sphygmograph when the latter is in position.            The lever,
which is one of the third system, is connected on either side, close to its

1871.]                and Radial Sphygmograph         Trace.               319
fixed end, to two silk threads, one of which (d) is attached to the pad and
spring above mentioned, and the other to a small spring (>/) which moves
it when it is less acted on by the stronger spring.        The apparatus is so
arranged that the lever works perfectly when it is so placed as to be above
the registering part of the sphygmograph, when the latter is in position.
The tip of the lever carries a steel pen (A) .
   To use the instrument, the sphygmograph is first fixed on the left arm
as usual, the recording paper being adjusted to its place. The arm is then
moved until the attached instrument rests on the board first mentioned ;
and it is maintained in position by certain pegs and holes in the board,
which respectively come into contact with the main parts, and receive the
projections of the instrument.
   The arm and attached apparatus are then moved until the pad of the
cardiograph spring is brought into contact with the spot, between the fifth
and sixth ribs, at which the heart's pulsation is most marked — the position
of the pad in relation to the board having been previously so fixed as to
enable this to be done with facility, the whole being maintained in the
horizontal position.    The contact of the pad with the chest-wall causes the
lever to recede ;  and  it is allowed to do so until its pen arrives above (he
recording-paper,   the whole apparatus being steadied by the right hand.
When the    levers  of the two instruments are both found to be moving
freely, the watchwork of the sphygmograph is set in action by means of a
string, connected at the other end with the stop-block of the train of
wheels  ; and when the recording-paper         has run its length, a combined
trace is found, as in figure 2.
                                      Fig. 2.
   The commencement of the two          traces is easily defined with precision;

820     Mr. A. H. Garrod on        the  relation   of the Cardiograph      [Feb. 23,
and as they are both recorded on the same paper, synchronous movements
must be at equal distances from the starting-points, and therefore they can
be projected on one another.         The results obtained by these projections
form the subject of this communication.
   All the observations were made on the same subject, setat. 24, in good
health.    They were all made in the sitting posture, as the apparatus could
then be held more firmly, or rested on the arm of a chair.
   To facilitate description, the following terms and symbols will be            em
ployed with regard to pulse-traces.
   1.  The rapidity of the pulse is symbolically represented by x.
   2. The first cardiac interval is that which occurs between the commence
ment of the systolic rise and the point of closure of the aortic valve, in
cardiograph traces.        The number of times that this interval is contained
in its component beat is represented by y ; and the law as to its length,
published elsewhere*, will be assumed; it may be stated thus :
                                     *y=20V*.
   3. The first arterial interval is that which occurs between the com
mencement of the primary rise and the termination of the major fall in
arterial sphygmograph traces.          The number of times that this interval is
contained in its component beat is represented by y'; and the law as to its
length at the radial artery, which is alone considered in this communica
tion, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (No. 120, 1870),
will  be assumed     ; it may  be thus stated    :
                                     xy'^Alf/x.
   4. The first cardio-arterial     interval is that which occurs between the
commencement of the systolic rise in the cardiograph trace and the origin
of the main rise in the sphygmograph trace. The number of times that
this interval is contained in its component beat is represented by z.
   5. The conjugate cardio-arterial interval is that portion of the first
cardiac interval which is synchronous with a portion of the first arterial
interval.      It is therefore the interval between the commencing sphyg
mograph     rise  and the point of closure of the aortic valve as represented in
the cardiograph trace.
   6.  The second cardio-arterial interval is that which occurs between the
point of closure of the aortic valve and its indication at the artery under
consideration.
   In commencing to work with the cardio-sphygmograph,                 measurements
were made      to find   the duration of the first cardio-arterial interval, as it
required but a few experiments to prove that the heart commences to
contract before the pulse is indicated at the wrist.
   By   means    of compasses,   or by superposing one trace on the other, the
commencing cardiograph rise was projected on the sphygmograph trace;
and the interval between this event and the origin of the radial rise was

 the formula xr=39V x. The chief source of error in these observations
 is the slight uncertainty in the rate of movement of the watchwork of
 the instrument, on which the calculation of the rapidity of the pulse
  depended.
     On comparing this equation, namely xz=39*/x, with the one above
  referred to as to the relations of the first cardiac interval, namely,
  xy— 20 V x, it is evident that the length of the first cardio-arterial interval
 is *5128, or just over half that of the first cardiac interval, whatever the
  rate of the pulse.
     This being the case, a more precise method is acquired of verifying the
  results arrived at; for by finding the number of times that the first

     It  is generally known that in the sphygmograph                 traces   of  most  slow
 pulses there is a notch in the first arterial interval, immediately preceding
 the major fall ; and one of the most marked results of the use of the
 cardio-sphygmogTaph is the determination of the fact that the point of
 closure of the aortic valve at the heart is always exactly synchronous with
 the lowest part of this notch, or the point of abrupt change of direction
 in the major fall of the sphygmograph trace.                 This leads to the almost
 necessary conclusion that the subsequent slight rise or change in direction
 of the trace is the result of the simultaneous movement of the whole
 column of blood produced by the suddenness of the shock of closure of the
 aortic valve, the secondary rise in the same trace being the more slowly
 transmitted pressure wave resulting from the same cause.
     The slower the pulse the more distinct is this notch ; and by comparing
  different rapidities, a gradual diminution in its conspicuousness is apparent,
  it rising higher and higher      above the point      of termination of the major       fall
  as  the pulse is quicker and quicker.           When the heart's rate is about 75 in
  a  minute, the notch is halfway down the major descent, and is partially
  blended with it ; when over 100 a minute, as the aortic valve closes when
  the ascent is at its maximum, the notch is so blended with                   the  pressure
  wave as not to indicate itself separately.
      In slow  pulses, the systolic main rise being quite over when the aortic

 valve closes, the shock wave indicates itself by an abrupt but not con
 siderable rise, breaking the very gradual major descent.
     This explanation being correct, another means is obtained of checking
 the results arrived at by the combined instrument; and Table III.
 Column II. contains a few measurements of the number of times that the
 conjugate arterial interval is contained in the first arterial interval, as found
 by measuring the ratio of the interval between the commencing arterial
 rise and the bottom of the notch in the major fall to the whole first arterial
 interval.    Column     III.   gives the theoretical        results necessitated     by  the
 equations given above.

     It may be mentioned that the reason why so few of these instances are
given, is that there is considerable difficulty in measuring these small
intervals into one another with precision ; but by practice a very fair esti
mate can be made of their value, and in all cases they seem to agree with
theoretical requirement.         The close accordance of the results obtained by
this    method  in very   slow   pulses, and the calculated results arrived at from
facts relating only to quicker ones, tends strongly to establish the correct
ness of the law given with regard to them.
     In Table IV. the lengths, in parts of         a minute,      of the different intervals
referred    to in this      communication,        are   given    as calculated     from  the
equations on which they have been shown to depend.                     With regard to the
second    cardio-arterial   interval,  a  reference    to  Column     VII.   will show that
it varies very slightly within the range of the heart's action, not being
 L  longer in a pulse of 36 than in        a  pulse of   1 69  in  a minute.

  In conclusion, the following           are the results that have been arrived at by
the use of the above cardio-sphygmograph : —
    1 . The first cardio-arterial interval varies inversely as the square root of
the pulse-rate.
   2. The conjugate cardio-arterial interval varies inversely as the square
root of the pulse-rate.
   3. The second cardio-arterial interval varies very little with different
pulse-rates, but is slightly longer in slower pulses.
   4. The depth of the notch in the first arterial interval of the sphygmo-
graph trace occurs at the moment of closure of the aortic valve.
   5. There is no definite indication in the sphygmograph                          trace    of    the
moment at which the arterial systole commences.
      II.   " On      the Thermo-electric        Action of Metals and Liquids."
          By George Gore, F.R.S.                   Received January          13, 1871.
   It is well    known that the degree of rapidity with which a metal immersed
in an acid, alkaline, or saline liquid is corroded varies considerably with
the temperature, and that the speed of corrosion usually increases with the
                                                                                    *
heat   ;  also a few experiments have           been    published (Gmelin's Haudbook
of Chemistry,' vol. i. p. 3/5) showing that changes of electrical state
occur in metals under such circumstances ; but a further examination of
the relations of the temperature and chemical change to the electrical state
has not, that I am aware, yet been made.
   In    an investigation on the development             of electric currents by unequally
heated metals in liquids          (Phil. Mag.     1857,   vol.xiii. p. 1),   I found that hot

platinum    was electro-negative to cold platinum in liquids      of acid reaction,
and positive to it in alkaline ones, provided in all cases chemical action was
completely or sufficiently excluded.         In the present experiments     I have
endeavoured to ascertain what electrical changes are produced in cases
where chemical action more freely occurs, and I have therefore employed
uot platinum plates, but plates composed of       a metal (copper) which is more
easily  corroded.
                                            I
   To effect the object I had in view, used the apparatus shown in sec
tion in fig. 1, and in perspective, with its wooden support, in fig. 2.
                                        Fig.   1.
                                       Fig.   2.
   A   and B, fig. I, are two open thin glass dishes, 6£ inches diameter,
and   1£ inch deep, with open necks. The dishes are joined together, water
tight, by a bent glas3 tube, C, about I inch in diameter ; and the whole
arrangement is securely fixed upon a wooden frame or stand, so that it
may be at once placed in an exactly horizontal position, or inverted to pour
out its contents. D and E are two dishes of sheet copper of moderate
thickness, made from contiguous portions of a sheet of metal to ensure
electrical  homogeneity in the experiments.          Wires of similar metals are
attached to the dishes for the purpose of connexion with a galvanometer.
A   galvanometer, containing about 180 turns of moderately fine copper
wire, is sufficiently sensitive for the experiments.      The outside of the metal
dishes must be made perfectly clean and bright immediately before each
experiment.
   In using the apparatus it    is first set exactly horizontal, and a known and
measured volume of the clear liquid to be examined, at the temperature of
the atmosphere and sufficient to fill it to the line F F, is poured in ; the
metal dishes are then steadily placed in the glass vessels and connected with
the galvanometer, taking care that no air-bubbles remain beneath them.

As                   soon as the galvanometer-needles have settled                 at zero, one   of   the   dishes
is quicklyfilled with boiling water, and the directions and amounts of                                          the

  The following are Tables of results obtained with various liquids,                                            the
solutions being diluted in each case to a specified measure by addition of
distilled water. Those of the experiments in which 20 ounces of liquid
was used, were nearly all of them made with an apparatus in which the
connecting-tube C was of somewhat less diameter ; and the deflections
obtained by that apparatus were less in extent than those obtained with
the " new apparatus," because in the latter the conduction-resistance was
somewhat less.  The values of the deflections given in the Tables are in
all cases those of the temporary ones                         ;   and the liquid used for diluting               the
solutions was in all cases water.

      The hot plate

in strength  from  50 to 3200   grains in 20 ounces of liquid, more feeble
results, even, than those with tartaric acid were obtained, and the plates
were not tarnished.           Probably, with this substance and with others                      where
the resulting         currents were very feeble, more distinct effects would

tained by employing a galvanometer of much greater electrical resistance.
   Several experiments similar to those already described were made with
the apparatus shown in fig. 3. The apparatus consists of a glass beaker
containing the liquid, and two platinum electrodes — A being a disk of                               pla
tinum rivetted to      platinum wire enclosed by
                               a                    glass tube, B, and

  The negative condition excited in the hot platinum cup in the solutions
of citric and tartaric acid agrees with the results obtained with copper
in those liquids.

                                                 1857. vol.
obtained with platinum electrodes are not due to the influence of atmo
spheric air upon the liquid and metal at their line of mutual contact ; for, in
the experiments there recorded, atmospheric air was entirely excluded, and
the liquids were previously well boiled.
                                                    I took a platinum dish,
   To test the influence of size of the cold electrode,
A (see    fig. 4),   5                 inch
                           inches wide and
                                   l£       deep, in  a glass vessel of the
annexed form, 15, closed at its lower end by  a cork, and containing in its
neck two platinum electrodes, one consisting of a wire, C, and the other of
a sheet 2 inches long and 2 inches wide              of a cylinder, D.
                                                     in   the form
    With   a cold mixture composed              of water and | of an ounce
                                             of 3|   ounces
by measure of strong sulphuric acid, and the sheet of platinum as the
lower electrode, on pouring boiling water into the dish a deflection of the
value   of -0064     was obtained, the cold electrode being positive            ;    but with
the wire as the lower electrode no perceptible deflection occurred. These
results were obtained repeatedly.    The electric currents are therefore
largely dependent upon the size of the cold electrode.
                                        General Results.
   The chief fact brought out conspicuously by these experiments with
 copper dishes       is,
                   that in many cases an increase of chemical action pro
 duced    by
           heat, instead of making the hot metal electro-positive, makes                      it
 considerably negative.
    The results show that hot copper was positive to cold copper      the fol       in
 lowing liquids —: hydrochloric, hydrocyanic, boracic, and tribasic or ortho-
 phosphoric acids chloride of copper (weak solution)

And negative in the following ones : — nitric, chloric, hydrobromic, hydro-
fluosilicic, and sulphuric acids ; ferrous sulphate ; chloride of copper (strong
solution) ; sulphate of copper ; sulphate of zinc (strong solution) ; nitrate
and iodide of sodium (weak solutions) ; bromide and iodide of potassium
(weak solutions) ; iodate of potassium ; chrome alum ; nitrate of ammo
nium ; oxalic, acetic, tartaric, and citric acids. The number of liquids in
which hot copper was positive was thirty-six, and of those in which it         was
negative was twenty.
   In several instances where the hot metal was negative with a weak solu
tion, it became positive with a strong one — for instance, with sulphate of
line, nitrate, iodide, and sulphate of sodium, bromide and iodide of potas
sium   ;  but with  chloride of copper the reverse occurred.       These results
may be connected with the fact that in weak neutral solutions the chemical
action is generally the most feeble, and therefore interferes the least with
the direct influence of the heat in producing electric currents.
   The influence of free hydrochloric, hydrocyanic, boracic, orthophosphoric,
and chromic acids was to make the hot copper positive ; whilst that of
nitric, chloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluosilicic, sulphuric, and some of the
organic acids was to make it negative.
   In consequence, probably, of the small amount of interference by che
mical action in solutions of oxalic, acetic, tartaric, and citric acids, the
direct influence of the heat made the copper negative — similar to its influ
ence on platinum in all acid liquids which do not attack that metal.
   The nature of the acid in a salt appears to exert much more influence
than that of the base on the direction of the current ; for instance, in
nearly all chlorides, including those of a considerable variety of bases, hot
copper was positive, probably because       copper is more readily attacked     by
acids than by bases.
   In all decidedly alkaline liquids the hot copper         was  positive ; this is
similar to the behaviour of platinum in such solutions, and is probably due
to the same cause, viz. the direct influence of the heat, as well as to che
mical action.
   The results   also show that the quantity    of the current obtained with any
given liquid generally increases    with the number of molecules of the sub
stance contained in the solution ; in some cases, however, as with sulphuric
acid, carbonate of potassium, chloride of ammonium, and acetate of zinc,
there was a limit to this inorease   ;  and beyond that limit the quantity of
the current decreased up to the point of saturation of the liquid.
   In the great majority of cases the value of the deflection increased much
more rapidly than the strength of the solution, particularly with solutions

of sulphate of magnesia, and        also of hydrochloric acid and of chloride of
sodium,    probably    because  two   causes operated, viz. increased strength of
solution and diminished conduction-resistance ; in a very few cases, how
ever, the opposite result took place, as with solutions of chloride and
nitrate of strontium.
    Inversions of the direction of the deflection by difference of strength of
the liquid occurred with solutions of chloride of copper, sulphate of zinc,
nitrate, iodide, and sulphate of sodium, bromide and iodide of potassium.
    Irregularities of the amount of deflection were very apt to take place
with liquids which gave strong deflections, or which acted much upon the
copper plates (for instance, nitric acid), especially if bubbles of air remained
under the plates, or the dishes were wetted on their side above the liquid
by the solution.
    In certain acid liquids, viz. nitric, chloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluosilicic,
and sulphuric acids, the hot copper was strongly negative (notwithstanding
the chemical action upon it was distinct, and 'in some cases even strong) ;
this is similar to the electrical behaviour of platinum in such liquids, and
may be attributed either to the more direct influence of the heat alone
(such as occurs with platinum plates), or to a different influence of the
chemical action produced by the heat. Both these causes probably ope
rate in such cases.
    It  is probable that in all cases where the hot copper was positive in
liquids of strongly acid reaction, the positive condition was due to chemical
action alone.
    With    some liquids,    especially with solutions of hydrocyanic, boracic,
acetic, tartaric,  and   citric acids, the deflections were very feeble, and the
chemical action on the plates not perceptible ; whilst with others, such as
nitric and chloric acids, solutions of the chlorides of strontium, sodium,
potassium, and ammonium, and of carbonate, acid carbonate, and cyanide
of potassium, the deflections were considerable, and the chemical action
 distinct, and in some cases strong.        In none of the liquids (except hydro
bromic and chromic acids) did the hot plate appear to be less stained or
corroded than the cold one ; probably in all cases it was the most corroded,
although in some cases the corrosion was not perceptible.
    The amount of deflection      was not always proportionate to the amount of
 chemical action    ;  for instance, with solutions of chloride of copper and
iodate of potassium there was considerable corrosion, but only feeble cur
 rents, probably because the plates became covered with a badly conducting
 film, whilst with hydrochloric acid, chloride of cobalt, chloride of manga
 nese, and nitrate    of potassium the reverse occurred.
     I consider the currents in all these experiments of difference of tempera
 ture to be due either, 1 st, to the direct influence of heat, the effect of which
 is to make the hot copper negative in acid liquids and positive in alkaline
 ones (see Phil. Mag. 1857, vol. xiii. p. 1); 2nd, to chemical action, which
 sometimes overpowers the direct influence of heat and reverses the effect ;

338                    Mr. 6. Gore    on the Thermo-electric             [Feb. 23,
or, 3rd, to both these      influences combined.    The more ultimate cause,
however, of the phenomena in these cases must be sought for in the mo
lecular movement* produced by heat in the metals and liquids.
    The currents obtained with copper plates were no doubt influenced in
their amounts (if not also in their direction) by the oxidizing action of the
air upon the liquid and metal at their line of mutual contact ; for we know
that metals in contact with liquids oxidize much more quickly if oxygen
has access to their wet surfaces.      And the currents were also influenced     by
the action of unequal temperature upon this air-contact line       ; for we know
that wet metals oxidize still more rapidly if heat is applied.
        Influence  of line of contact of liquid and metal with the air.
   That the length of line of contact of the liquid and copper with the
air is capable of producing electric currents was shown by the following
experiments    : —
    Two strips of   sheet copper   of the annexed form, fig. 5, | inch    wide, and
                  Fig.  5.                                      Fig.  6.
 12  inches long in the longest limb, were cut from contiguous parts of a
sheet of copper, and, after being perfectly cleaned, were coiled into the
shape represented by the annexed sketch, fig. 6.        They were then placed
in  a flat-bottomed     porcelain dish and connected with the galvanometer,
one of the spirals being supported at about \ inch higher than the other
by means of a triangle of glass rod.       The liquid to be examined was then
poured into the dish until it just (and completely) covered the lower spi
ral, and the direction and amount of the permanent deflection noted. The
positions of the spirals were then reversed and the electrical effects again
noted.
    Experiment 1. — With a liquid composed of 100 grains of cyanide of
potassium dissolved in 12 ounces of water, whichever of the spirals was
only partly submerged and therefore had the longest air-line, was strongly
electro-negative to the wholly submerged one.
    Experiment 2. — With a mixture of one measure of strong nitric acid and
ten measures of water, deflections of somewhat less amount, but in pre
cisely similar directions to those of experiment I, took place.
    Experiment 3. —With dilute hydrobromic acid the directions of the
 deflections were also similar, but still less in amount.
    Experiment    4. — With a half-saturated solution of borax very feeble       de

1871.]                   Action of Metals and Liquids.                            339
flections,  agreeing in direction with those of the other experiments, were
obtained.
    These results show the necessity (which           I have already mentioned) of
excluding    air-bubbles   from   beneath   the   copper dishes, and of not wetting
the sides of the dishes by the liquid above the level of their immersion.
    To ascertain the influence of difference of temperature of the air-contact
line I soldered two strips of perfectly similar sheet copper, each 1 2 inches
long and £ inch wide, in the form of circular hoops 4 inches in diameter upon
the bottoms of two tin cups, and ground the edges of the strips perfectly
level, and soldered copper wires to them for connecting with the galvano
meter.     Two glass triangles were now put into the apparatus, fig. 1, one
in each dish, to support the cups, and a mixture of one measure of nitric
acid and 12 measures of distilled water poured in until it just touched the
edges all round of the perfectly horizontal copper rims resting on the tri
angles.     After the needles of the galvanometer had settled at zero,' about
ten ounces of boiling water was poured into one of the cups ; a temporary
 deflection of the value "0560, and a permanent one of value "0759, were
 produced, the hot metal being negative. The direction of the current in
 this experiment agrees with that obtained with the same mixture and the
 copper dishes ; and the result indicates that a large proportion of the quan
 tity of the current obtained with copper dishes in dilute nitric acid was due
 to the action of the air-contact line.
    The influence of the air-line is largely chemical. " A piece of copper
 wire wholly submerged in the acid [dilute sulphuric] so as to entirely
 exclude any portion of it coming into contact with the air, has remained
 for many months without imparting the slightest tinge to the liquid."
 " But on suffering the liquid to evaporate so as to bring the upper end of
 the metal near to its surface, the instant the slightest portion becomes ex
 posed chemical action immediately begins."
     " Two equal portions of wire were similarly placed in acid, only that one
 was fully exposed to the atmosphere in an open tube, while the other was
 placed in a phial, the acid occupying half its height, and was kept closely
 corked for several weeks — after which the fully exposed metal had lost in
 weight two-fifths more than the one which had been excluded from contact
 with fresh portions of air, showing that contact with the atmosphere in
  bulk is necessary to the fullest action"*.
                  Experiments with Liquids        of unequal strength.
    To throw     some  light upon the questions, — 1st, Is the quantity of the
 current simply a result of the difference of number of molecules of liquid
 which touch the hot plate compared with those which touch the cold
 plate ? and, 2nd, What amount of difference of strength of a liquid is equal
 to the amount of difference of temperature employed ? — I brought the two

copper dishes into contact with liquids of unequal strength instead of        un
equal temperature.
   The tube C (fig. 1) was filled with the stronger mixture and closed at its
end in the dish A by an india-rubber bung, and the dish B filled to the line F
with the   same mixture ; the dish   A  was then filled with the weaker mix
ture up to the same level and the bung slowly withdrawn.          The two cop
per  dishes,  previously connected  with   the galvanometer,  were  next simul
taneously immersed in the mixtures and the effect noted.         The   following
are the results obtained by this method : —
                                  Nitric Acid.
   Experiment I . — In A,   1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes.         In  B,
 1 volume diluted to 40.       Copper in    A  was positive temporarily,     value
•02/0   ; and permanently, value "0198.
   Experiment 2. — In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.            In B,
 1 volume of acid diluted to 20 volumes.       The copper plate in A was first
positive temporarily, value of deflection "0064     ; and then that in B      per
manently, value "2850.
   Experiment 3. — In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.            In B,
 1 volume diluted to 10 volumes.      Copper plate in B was positive tempo
rarily, value "4863 ; and permanently, value -0819.
                              Hydrochloric Acid.
   Experiment 1. — In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.            In B,
 1 volume diluted to 20 volumes.     The copper in B was positive temporarily,
value -9608 ; and permanently, value *1087.         v
   Experiment 2. — In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.            In B,
1 volume diluted to 26"66 volumes.        The copper in B was positive tempo
rarily, value *34 79 ; and permanently, value '0702.
                                  Chloric Acid.
   In A,   1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes.      In B, 1 volume diluted
to 40 volumes. The copper in B was positive temporarily, value '0036 ;
and permanently, value *0009.
                                 Sulphuric Acid.
   In A,   1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes.      In B, 1 volume diluted
to 40 volumes.      The copper in B    was positive temporarily,   value "0467;
and permanently, value "0330.
   On examining these results, it will be perceived, 1st, that only in one
half the number of the experiments did increased strength of liquid pro
duce electrical currents similar in direction to those produced by increased
temperature ; and therefore the heat does not act simply hy causing »
greater number of molecules of each individual substance to touch the hot
plate ; and, 2nd, that only in one of the experiments was the copper in the
weaker liquid both temporarily and permanently positive to that in the

1871.]                   Action of Metals and Liquids.                     341
stronger  ;  whilst  in five of the experiments the copper in the stronger
liquid was temporarily and permanently positive to that in the weaker.
Increase of strength of the liquid therefore made the copper positive in five
cases out   of six.
    In the fourth experiment with hydrochloric acid with difference of    tem
 perature, and in the second one with difference of strength, the mixture in
each case consisting    of 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes with water,
an increase   of temperature from 16° to about 98° C. produced a deflection
of the value '2854, whilst an increase of strength to 1 volume in 26*66
gave a deflection in the same direction of the value "3479.        An increase
of temperature of about 82° C. was not quite equal in electrical effect to
an increase of 50 per cent, in the number of molecules of the acid which
touched the plates.
    In the third experiment with chloric acid with difference of temperature,
and in the single one made with difference of strength, the mixture in each
instance consisting of 1 volume of the acid diluted to 80 volumes with water,
an increase of temperature of about 82° C. produced an electrical effect of
 •0040; whilst an increase of 100 per cent, in the number of molecules of
the acid which touched the plates produced an opposite electrical effect of
•0036.
    In the third experiment with sulphuric acid with difference of tempera
 ture, and in the single one made with difference of strength, each being with
a mixture of 1 measure of acid in 80 of water, an increase of temperature
of about 82° C. caused an electrical effect of -0418, and an increase of 100
per cent, in the number of molecules of acid which touched the plates
caused an opposite electrical effect of -0467.
                        A liquid thermo-electric battery.
    Acting upon the general results thus obtained in this subject,      I  con
 structed a liquid thermo-electric battery consisting of twelve glass tubes,

form shown in fig. 7, each tube being filled with a conducting liquid,       and
its outer end closed by a cork, in which was fixed a second platinum         wire
to dip into the liquid.
    Fig. 8 represents the apparatus ; A A is a wooden stand supporting a tin
box, B. The box is water-tight, and has in its lower surface a long semi
circular cavity (shown by dotted lines) to receive the upper ends of the
twelve tubes. To the back of the box is fixed a short cylinder of tin, C,
closed at its outer end.     When the apparatus is in action, the box is filled
with hot water, and the water kept boiling by means of a lamp placed be
neath the tube C.       The twelve tubes were kept in position by divisions of
wood fixed to the back of the stand, as shown in the figure.
   The tubes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 were filled with a previously boiled and
cooled mixture of ] of an ounce of sulphuric acid, and 19 ounces of di
stilled water; and the others, viz. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, with a similarly
prepared solution of 110 grains of hydrate of potassium dissolved in            19
ounces of distilled water.
   The platinum wires were connected, in the order shown in the sketch,         by
means   of small binding-screws not represented in the figure.
   On connecting the terminals with a galvanometer containing about 130
turns of moderately coarse copper wire, and applying heat to the upper
electrodes and ends of tubes by means of the boiling water, no deflection of
the needles took place ; but on substituting     a Thomson's reflecting galvano
meter, which offered a resistance of 30407       B.A. units (=77872-327 miles
of copper wire -^ of an inch thick), a deflection of 40 degrees was readily ob
tained, the hot platinum wire in the dilute acid being negative, and that in
the alkali positive, as shown by the direction of the arrows in the sketch.
   From these results it is evident the quantity of the electric current pro
duced was exceedingly small, and its intensity considerable.      By employing
electrodes of larger   surface, such as spirals of platinum wire and more con
centrated liquids, the quantity of the current would be very largely in
creased.     (See Phil. Mag. 1857, vol. xiii.   p.'l.)

this arrangement must      be disposed  in the order represented by the figure.
                              Influence  of Friction.
    To ascertain if the friction of   one of the electrodes against the liquid
had similar effects   to  those  produced by the direct application of heat, I
employed the apparatus shown in fig. 10.            The sketch does not require
explanation.
                                        Fig. 10.
    Experiment 1 . — By immersing two stout copper wires vertically in an
 acidulated solution of cupric sulphate and rotating one of them at a speed
 of about 5000 revolutions per minute, the rotating wire became electro
 positive.
     Experiment   2. — With    a saturated solution   of borax, the rotating wire
 was positive.
     Experiment    3. —With a solution    of cyanide of potassium, the rotating
 wire   was negative.
     Experiment    4. — With stout platinum wires in an acidulated solution of
 cupric sulphate, the rotating wire became negative.
     Experiment 5. — With platinum wires in a solution composed of 200
  grains of carbonate of potassium in 40 ounces of distilled water, the rota
  ting wire was faintly positive, and similarly in a very dilute solution.
     Experiment 6. — With two platinum disks one above the other in a
  strong solution of carbonate of potassium, revolving the upper disk at a
  speed of about 5000 revolutions per minute made it electro-positive.
     Experiment 7. — With an acidulated solution of cupric sulphate, the
  revolving disk became feebly negative.
      On comparing these results with those obtained by unequal temperature,
  we find that the directions of the currents in the two classes of cases were
  reverse with copper in solutions of acidulated cupric sulphate and cyanide
  of potassium, and similar in a solution of borax ; and with platinum in
  solutions of acidulated cupric sulphate or carbonate of potassium the in

    fluence of friction and of increased temperature upon the direction of the

               Influence   of Magne-optic rotating-power of the Liquids.
       Being desirous of determining whether the thermo-electric properties of
   liquids were dependent on the molecular structure by virtue of which liquids
   under the influence of magnetism polarize light circularly, I made the fol
   lowing apparatus and experiment : —
                                                                    j
       A and B (fig. 1 1) are two straight glass tubes, about inch in diameter
   and 10 inches long, with two similar (but bent)
   tubes,   C and D, attached to their free ends by           I
  india-rubber tubing.         The sloping ends of the
  straight tubes are ground flat, and are joined
  together securely at their edges by melted shel
  lac, with a thin and projecting sheet of platinum
  between them to separate the liquids.             E and
  F    are two     strong electro-helices wound upon
  stout    tubes of soft iron which enclose the glass tubes.            The apparatus
  is secured     upon a board in an inclined position with the sloping ends
  of the tubes uppermost ; and the two helices are held together at their
 upper ends by an india-rubber band, G.               I filled one of the tubes with a
 clear and strong solution of perchloride of iron (of negative magne-optic
 rotatory power, see Verdet, Phil. Mag., June 1858), and the other with a
 similar solution of chloride of nickel (of positive magne-optic rotatory
 power), and connected the liquids in the bent tubes with a galvanometer
  16 feet distant by means       of the platinum wires H and I. I now excited
 the helices in various ways by means of 12 strong Grove's cells ; no cur
 rent was induced in the liquid.          I next heated the junction of the tubes
 gradually ; the solution of iron became tbermo-electro-positive, and a steady
 but feeble deflection of the needles took place ; and during the continuance
 of this current      I again excited the helices in various ways as before     ; again
 no electrical effects were produced.        The results of this experiment strongly
 support the conclusion that the thermo-electric properties of liquids are
 not dependent upon the magne-optic polarizing power of the liquids, nor
 upon the properties of their mass.
      On examining the thermo-electric properties of the solution of ferric
                                                                             *
 chloride with platinum plates in the apparatus described in the Philoso
phical Magazine,' 1857, vol. xiii. p. 1, the hot platinum was strongly
negative, value of temporary deflection "8475.               With the nickel solution,
similarly     examined,    the  hot  plate  was  also   negative, value of deflection
*0409.       These results agree with that obtained with the two tubes in the
last experiment, the more positive condition of the iron solution than
that of the nickel one determining the direction of the current in that
experiment.

    General Conclusion.     —The    electric currents produced by the direct in
fluence of unequal temperature or friction of platinum or copper electrodes,
in conducting liquids which do not act chemically upon those metals, have
their origin in temporary changes of cohesion of the layers of metal and
liquid which are in immediate and mutual contact, and may be considered
a very delicate test of the kind and amount of temporary molecular
movements produced by those causes.                                     %

I. " Further      Experiments on the effect of Diet and Exercise on the
       Elimination of Nitrogen." By E. A. Parses, M.D., F.R.S.
       Received     January 28, 1871.
    In  the Proceedings     of the Royal Society (No.     89, 1867, and  No. 94,
 1867) some experiments were published on the elimination of nitrogen,
during    exercise and rest, on a nitrogenous and a non-nitrogenous diet.
The result of both series was so far to confirm the experiments which show
that the changes in the nitrogen of the urine and faeces are small in extent
and afford no measure of the work ; but there did appear to be a slight
effect produced in two ways      : —
    vol. xix.                                                      2 E

350                  Dr. Parkes — Further Experiments on the                    [Mar.   2,
     1.   There was an increased,       though slight, outflow of nitrogen after work.
     2. There was apparently a slight lessening            of the outflow during work,
not dependent on diminution in the amount of urinary water. In the state
 of rest also, when the diet was equal, there was no lessening, but a slight
 excess, in the excretion        of nitrogen as compared with a period both of
 forced and ordinary exercise.
     Professor Karl Voit, of Munich, who has a worldwide reputation for his
numerous and important contributions to this subject, and who denies that
exercise     produces any change in the nitrogen, has taken exception             to some
of these experiments, on the ground more particularly that the daily               ingress
of nitrogen could not have been kept sufficiently stable. I believe                the  ex
 periments, showing as they do in two men a remarkable agreement                     in the
amount       of nitrogen eliminated, and         the fact that the two great articles of
 diet by which nitrogen enters (meat and bread) were selected and weighed
 with great care* and from the analyses appeared to be of constant compo
 sition, prove that the alterations in the daily inflow of nitrogen must hare
been very small and less than those            of the outflow.
     Undoubtedly, however, to insure an absolute uniformity in the entrance
of nitrogen in men, is a very difficult matter as long as only ordinary diet
is given. The employment of prepared or concentrated food, on the other
hand, cannot be considered           as good as common diet for such experiments             ;
for the body is unaccustomed to the particular form in which the food                      is
given.
     It was determined to repeat the experiments            in two or three ways. First,
not only to use      ordinary diet with the usual attention to keep it as uniform
as possible from day to day, but to select hours for rest and exercise when
the influence     of diet is   least perceptible, viz. twelve or fourteen hours after
food    ;  then in  a second    series   to use prepared food in which the amount
of nitrogen is absolutely constant ; and thirdly to use a diet without
nitrogen.
     Unfortunately the experiments on preserved food failed on account of
the health breaking down in a few days and before any exercise could be
taken. On the ordinary diet also an unexpected difficulty arose, but still
the results are worthy of record.           The experiments on the non-nitrogenous
diet are confirmatory of the former results, as far as the increased elimi
nation after exercise is concerned.
     As the details of the experiments would occupy too much space, I have
given only mean numbers when these were sufficient to fairly show the
results, and have omitted all details of the chloride of sodium, free acidity
of the urine, and other matters.
    The subject of the experiments             was  T. C,    a  perfectly healthy soldier
    * The meat was     beefsteak, and was selected   free from visible fat, and was always
cooked in the same    way, i. e. fried.   The bread was the hospital bread, mado daily with
the samo flour, water, and salt, baked at the same heat and for the same time, and
having the same amount of crust and crumb.

1871.]         Effect of Diet   fyc. on  Elimination of Nitrogen.              351
who had never had     a  day's illness in his life.     He was 25 years of age,
weighed usually 145 lbs., and is of very temperate habits.           He had been
an iron-worker before enlistment, and is an extremely powerful man ; the
girth of the chest was 37| inches.
                      First Series of Experiments.
                            Ordinary regulated diet.
   During   20 days the man received         daily beefsteak weighing    14 ounces
when raw,   1 ounce  of fat for cooking, 16 ounces of bread, 1 ounce of butter,
6 ounces of milk, 16 ounces of potatoes, 1£ ounce of sugar, 36 fluid ounces
of infusions of tea and coffee, and 16 ounces of water. The amount of nitro
gen was determined at 300 grains ; it might be a little more or less, but
still from day to day its amount was the same as far as it could possibly be
kept so. This diet was selected in this, as in the former experiments,
because it is the usual ration of the Army Hospital Corps to which this
man belonged, and therefore there was no fear of a change in the food itself
producing any effect.
    He took his meals always at the same time; viz. breakfast at 10 a.m.,
dinner at 3 p.m. (when he took the whole of his meat), and tea at \ to 6.
After tea he took 6 ounces of water at 10 p.m., but no solid food.
   The urine was collected from 10 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the following morn
ing; then from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. As all food
was taken between 10 a.m. and        6 p.m., it was expected that the urine from
6 a.m. to 10 a.m. (viz. from the 13th to the 16th hours after food) would
be of tolerably constant composition ; at any rate there would be less chance
of error from the effect of food. In this way, and by keeping as far as
possible an equal daily diet, it was hoped to lessen or remove the chances
of fallacy from varying ingress of nitrogen. An unexpected circumstance
partly disconcerted this hope.
    It was anticipated that the amount of urine passing in the two hours
from 8 to   10  a.m. would be less than in the two hours from 6 to 8, as
being further removed from the time when fluid was taken.            But the result
was otherwise ; there was always more urine passed from 8 to 10 a.m. than
in the previous two hours.      When this    was first noted, it was supposed  that
an error in collecting the urine had been made ; but day after day the
result was the same.      It seemed to be owing to the influence of sleep and
wakefulness.     From 6 to 8 the man slept, but from 8 to 10 he was not
only awake, but his mind was active, and he talked to two men who worked
in the room     where he slept ; and though       his body was kept as quiet as
during the previous two hours, the mental condition seemed to cause an
increased passage of urine ; at least there seemed nothing else to account
for the fact that on every day during       ten days while he was still in bed,
there was more urine passed from 8 to 10 than from 6 to 8 a.m., although
no water had been taken except at 10 the night before.              The result was

that the urea did not fall as was expected, though             its percentage was les
sened.
    Liebig's mercuric nitrate solution (the chloride of sodium being got rid
of and the usual correction for dilution being made) and Voit's plan for
the determination of nitrogen by soda-lime were both used, so as to afford
a control of the observations.
    The daily weight of the body, the temperature of the axilla and rectum,
the pulse, the weight of the stools, &c. were also determined.                 Almost all
the experiments were repeated, and several were performed three and four
times*.
    During the first ten days he remained in bed from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m.,
 taking during the day his ordinary exercise.              Daring the second 10 days
 he went to bed at 10 p.m. as before, got up at 6 a.m., worked for two hours,
 and then went to bed again at 8 a.m. until 10 a.m.                  The work consisted
in dragging a cart weighing 710 lb. 4 miles in two hours.                  Supposing the
coefficient of traction to be the same as in walking, the amount of work cal
culated by Haughton's formula would be equal to about 100 tons lifted
 one foot.     His weight at the commencement of the experiment was 1461b.
 2 oz. ; it fell regularly during 10 days to 144 lb. 10 oz., viz. 1 lb. 8 oz.
 During the second 10 days it fell to 142 lb. 12 oz., a loss of 1 lb. 14 oz.

      The results show no diminution              in the urea during the two hours of
  exercise    ;  the   slight increase may perhaps be disregarded.                    In the two
  hours of      rest,  there is equally inconsiderable increase after exercise ; the
  excess in the 4 hours of the second section of 10 days was 1*58 gramme.
  In the next 20 hours there was an increase of "828 gramme, equal to *3864
  gramme, or 6 grains of nitrogen.              The differences are so small as probably
  to fall within the       limit  of error, and it is impossible to affirm that exercise
  to the amount of 100-foot tons in two hours made any alteration in the
  urea.

     The nitrogen by soda-lime showed very slight variations.                       There was a
 slight decrease in the 2 hours' exercise and in the 2 hours' rest after exer
 cise over the corresponding period ; but it is so trifling that I hesitate to
 draw any conclusions.             The figures show that the slight increase in the
 urea was, as supposed, an unavoidable error.                  Looking to the figures of the
 nitrogen by soda-lime as more correct, it seems that 2 hours' additional
 exercise produced no marked change in the outflow when the inflow of
 nitrogen was constant.             This result, as far as it goes, certainly bears out
 Voit's assertion of the constancy of the nitrogen, but it does not destroy
 the conclusions formerly drawn that the nitrogen lessens during exercise
 and increases afterwards, because the amount of exercise was in the present
 case very much less ; and as the alteration in the nitrogen even                  in the former
 experiments,       with   much    more   severe   exercise,    fell within    narrow    limits, it
 might easily have been anticipated that work of only one-sixth the amount
 would be inappreciable.              The method of experimenting also does not
appear to me to be so good as that formerly used.

    It was composed      of bread, meat, potatoes, sugar, spices and salt dried to
 gether, &c, and    was stated to contain everything necessary for nutrition, so
that the troops on service would need no other food.              It contained 13*65
per   cent,  of water and 2*73035 per       cent, of nitrogen.     After preliminary
trials to know how much would satisfy hunger, 14 ounces were given daily,
containing 10-838 grammes of nitrogen.              The food, however, produced
such derangement in nutrition (indigestion, heartburn, and headache) that
after a few days the experiments were discontinued.             In spite of the con
stant ingress, the elimination of nitrogen varied greatly from day to day,
the extreme range being from 7*64 1 to 15*024 grammes ; and the man felt
so ill that he begged to discontinue the experiment.            It was interesting to
note that, in spite of the daily variations in the nitrogen, there passed out
in the 5 days nearly the same quantity as entered, viz. 54*920 grammes of
exit, as against 54*19 grammes of entrance.             He lost weight during the
trial. The experiment must         be therefore repeated on some future occasion
with other prepared food.
                                  Third Series.
                              Non-nitrogenous food.
   In the experiments formerly related in the         '
                                                        Proceedings' two men were
kept   for  2 days  at a time  without   nitrogen.   As   it seemed to do no harm,
the present experiments were now prolonged over 5 days on two occasions.
The first was after the man had been well fed with nitrogen, the second
after the body had become poor in nitrogen from the restricted supply
given in the concentrated food. The non-nitrogenous food consisted of
arrowroot, butter (deprived of casein), and lump sugar.              Infusion of tea
without milk was allowed, but this contained in the day only £ grain of
nitrogen.     Hunger was perfectly satisfied by this food ; the man felt quite
well and could have continued it.         The heartburn produced by the       concen
trated food was at once relieved by this starch and fat diet.
                  First Experiments      on Non-nitrogenous     Food.
                Previous daily entry of nitrogen=19.5 grammes.
   On the first day of non-nitrogenous food         he took his ordinary    exercise ;
on the 2nd took additional exercise, which consisted in digging up potatoes
over 576 square feet, lifting the weight (16 stone) into a barrow, and
wheeling them home for £ a mile.            On the 3rd day he rested, on the 4th
repeated the exercise, on the 5th rested.          He did the 4th day's work even
better than the 2nd, and could have worked on the 5th day.
   The amount of work done cannot easily be calculated ; it was a good but
not an excessive day's work.
   The weight on the first day was 142 lb. 7 oz., and on the last J41 lb.
10 oz.      He took daily 60 fluid ounces of water (=1/04 cub. centims.),
and as much arrowroot, oil of butter, and sugar as he liked.

      The   effects   of  and rest are complicated with the gradually de
                           exercise
 creasing elimination dependent on the supply of nitrogen being cut off,
 consequently nothing can be concluded from the lessening of nitrogen on
 the 2nd day (exercise).  On comparing the 3rd and 4th days (rest and
 exercise), the nitrogen by soda-lime shows a decrease on the exercise day;
 but as the ureal nitrogen is almost precisely the same on the two days, it
 does not seem possible to affirm a decrease.  The most positive result is
 the increase of nitrogen (as shown by both methods) on the 5th day (rest
 after work). There was a decided excess, amounting to "699 grammes or
 very nearly 19 per cent.   Such an increase occurring on the 5th day after
 the supply of nitrogen was cut off, seems inexplicable unless on the suppo
 sition that it was owing to the previous muscular exertion.
      I
      felt, however, that this experiment might be better conducted. The
 exercise was commenced too soon, and before                                                                     its

lowest point. The kind of exercise, too, viz. digging, which is often attended
with intervals of rest, was not a good choice. Moreover, on the 3rd and 4th
days he took some common salt, which might possibly have interfered, as
it is supposed that chloride of sodium augments the outflow of urea.
   The experiment was therefore repeated at the period when the body         was
poor in nitrogen from the use of the concentrated food.

    In this  series the man did his ordinary work, which was not severe, and
tolerably uniform, during the first 3 days.         Then on the fourth day he
 marched 32 miles on level ground, carrying the new valise equipment, the
 service-kit, 40 rounds of ball ammunition, rifle, bayonet, and great coat.
 In   all the weight was 43| lb., his own weight being 145^ lb. The work
 done was therefore 712-8 tons lifted a foot, or, in other words, it was an ex
 tremely hard day's work.        He did 26 miles quite easily, but then was
 greatly fatigued and got very tender about the feet, and had pains in the
 calves of the legs.    The next day he was, however, quite well, and declared
 that he did not feel in the least weakened from having been 5 days on
 starch and butter.       The march commenced at 8 a.m., and with intervals
 of  ly  hour for meals, lasted till 7.30, so that actual muscular work both of
 arms and legs was going on for 10 hours.        The daily ingress of chloride of
 sodium was uniform during the 5 days.

     The   effect of the previous small entry of nitrogenous            food is clearly seen  ;
  on the 1st day the nitrogen fell almost to the amount                   of the 2nd day in
  the previous experiments.         On the 3rd day, on the contrary, it was greater
  than on the corresponding day of the former series.
     The amount of nitrogen was actually greater on the 5th day than on the
  1st.   Except the excessive exercise of the 4 th day, no other obvious cause
  existed for this elimination on the 5th day.              No mistake seems possible;
  for the urinary water on the 5th day was less in quantity than on the 1st,
  2nd, and 3rd days, while the nitrogen was 2 grammes more than even on
 the 1st day after nitrogenous food was left off. An error in analysis is not
 possible, since not only were the analyses repeated, but the process by urea
 gave results corresponding        to that by soda-lime.         No constitutional condi
 tion which could cause excess in elimination was indicated either by the
 pulse or body temperature, and the man felt perfectly well.                   I need hardly
 say that no nitrogenous food was taken           ;    for it is quite certain that it was
 not.
     The  increase   in the 5th day in the 1st series, though less marked, is still
 unequivocal,     and  there seems therefore no rashness in stating that the con
 clusion of the experiments formerly laid before the Society is affirmed, viz.
 that severe exercise causes an increase in the elimination of nitrogen in the
 period of rest after the exercise.          It is noticeable that in this man the
 increased    elimination was not in the hours immediately succeeding, but on
 the following day, and lasted for some time.
     Whether during the period of exercise the nitrogen was lessened is not
 so clear, as the fall from 4-328 grammes on the 3rd day to 3-812 on the
 4 th or exercise day might be merely the continuing effect of the depriva
 tion of nitrogen.        The experiments formerly recorded seem to me better
 adapted     to  determine    this point, which, however, certainly requires more
evidence     in confirmation before it can be accepted.
    That    changes go on in the muscles during exercise which lead to an
increase    in the outflow of nitrogen afterwards must, I think, be admitted ;
and on this point       it seems that the statement of Liebig must be supported
against Voit.
    It may be interesting       to give the mean pulse and temperature during
these days of non-nitrogenous feeding for comparison with the normal.

     The    mean pulse on the 5th day            of the 1st series of non-nitrogenous food
was 69-3, and 67-9 on the 5th day of the 2nd series.                               Both these were
rest days, when the heart would naturally                     beat    rather     less.     Non-nitro
genous diet does not, therefore, materially affect the number of beats of the
pulse ; but it decidedly influenced its volume, rendering it smaller, far
6ofter, and more compressible when felt with the finger; and it gave a feeble
gphygmographic tracing.
     The sphygmographic              tracings show this clearly.               Ten tracings were
taken at 6 a.m. on successive days, when the man was on nitrogenous food,
 1 5 hours after dinner and 12 after the last food.                   They represent, therefore,
the tracings of inanition.               Five tracings were taken on successive days at
6 a.m. on the non-nitrogenous                food.     The    same instrument           and an equal
pressure were always used.                   The height to which            the lever was raised
(all    conditions    of pressure      &c.   being equal) will therefore show the expan
sion of the artery.          The tracings were carefully measured, and the following
is the result: —

    With    an equal pressure the lever was thrown almost double the height
when the man was on nitrogenous food. This feebleness of expansion shown
by the sphygmograph was quite in accordance with the impression given
to the finger.      The softness of the pulse proved it was not owing to in
creased resistance    of the arterial wall.
    With regard to the temperature, the        means  are so close to those      of  the
 days on ordinary diet, that having regard to the fact that the period was
 shorter and therefore more liable to error, and that some observations were
 omitted on the marching-day, it may be concluded that a non-nitrogenous
 diet continued for 5 days neither raised nor lowered the temperature of the
 axilla and rectum.
    It therefore appears that when the nitrogenous food of a healthy man was
 reduced to one   half for 5 days, and he was then kept for 5 days more without
 nitrogen, he was able on the 4th day after such deprivation to do a very
hard day's work.       The non-nitrogenous diet, consisting of butter oil, starch,
and sugar, kept him perfectly well ; all functions seemed natural, the tem
perature of the body was unaltered, the pulse became very soft, and the
sphygmographic tracings showed very feeble markings ; but it was not ma
terially altered in frequency.        The circulation appeared to be properly
                                   ¦
carried on, as far as could be judged of by the man's own feelings.                 The
health, as judged of by the man's feelings and the absence of objective
signs, was perfect. On account, however, of the feebleness of the heart's

action it was not thought right to continue the experiments, which had, I
believe, sufficiently proved that force necessary for great muscular work
can be obtained by the muscles from fat and starch, though changes in the
nitrogenous constituents of the muscles also go on which have as one effect
an increased though not excessive elimination of nitrogen after the cessation
of the work.

   Dear Friend, — Last summer I made a very interesting magnetic
voyage, being invited by Vice-Admiral Possiet to take part in the Arctic
Expedition with the Grand Duke Alexis, Lieutenant of the Navy.
   The first part of the voyage, from St. Petersburgh to Arkangeslsk ( 1 1 79
miles), by rivers and lakes, I made in a little screw cutter, 2/^ feet long,
                                                                     '           '
7% feet wide, and 2\ feet deep, belonging to the corvette              Variage ;    the
second part of the voyage (1716 miles) in the schooner ' Sextant.'
    I visited the White Sea and the coasts of the Arctic Ocean ; the end of
                                   '             '
the voyage was in the clipper        Jemchug (24 6 1 miles), from Norway to
Cronstadt.
    On the way    I made magnetic observations, the result of which I inclose
in this letter.    I will ask you to make them known to General Sabine and
to the Royal Society.
    The observations were      made   by   a small compass      which has the edge
needle, and which is able to turn from one side to the other.                Each ob
servation, the data of which are given,        was made   in  different directions of
the instrument, turning the instrument on 1 20° in azimuth, by which the
eccentric errors were taken off.         In each direction the needle was turned
on both sides for correcting the error of the magnetic direction in the
needle. Four observations were made for each position of the needle.                By
this mode of observation the error does not exceed more than +1'.
    In the declination table are given the day and the hour of           each observa
tion in order to judge of the daily disturbances of magnetism.             It would be
very interesting to compare these observations       with   those made at the same
time by photography at Kew, and thereby to deduce the magnetic disturb
ance due to the change      of magnetic latitude.
   The inclination was observed by a Kew Inclinometer belonging to the
Compass Observatory, made in London in* 1865, and examined by Mr.
Balfour Stewart. No doubt it is the most useful instrument for this kind
of observation.
   The horizontal    force was observed     by

of Vibration," by which      I made all my observations on the submarine boat
and on armour-plated ships.           In this instrument the needle is 3*2 inches
long and 0' 1 7 inch in breadth.
   The magnet is suspended on a silk thread and vibrates in a wooden box,
on the side of which there are the divisions in degrees to mark the angles
formed by the turning- needle ; for each observation I counted 700 vibra
tions.    I found that for such a voyage this instrument answers the purpose.
    The  exact drawing     of this instrument you will find in my book on the
"  Submarine Boat," 1867, Plate VI.           Drawings 6 and 8 give half the size
of the instrument, and drawing 7 the full size of the needle.
    I know that General Sabine and the Royal Society are much interested
now in the Northern Magnetic Observations, so I hastened to send the
results to you, as I know that they cannot be printed soon in Russian.

       zontal Force at Stonyhurst College Observatory, from April
       1863 to March 1870."            By the Rev. S. J. Perry.         Communi
       cated by the President.         Received    January 23, 1871.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The object of the present paper is to bring further evidence to bear upon
an important question of terrestrial magnetism.
    The existence of a sensible semiannual inequality in the earth's mag
netic elements, dependent on the position of the sun in the ecliptic, was
deduced by General Sir Edward Sabine from a discussion in 1863 of a
continuous series of the monthly magnetic observations taken at Kew.              A
previous   reduction  of   observations   made   at   Hobarton  aud at Toronto  had
first suggested the idea, and a new confirmation of the results has lately
been obtained by Dr. Balfour Stewart from subjecting a second series of
 Kew observations to the same tests as before. The observations, which
form the basis of the present discussion, extend over the period from
March 1863 to February 1870, during which time the same instruments
have been in constant use. These are a Jones unifilar and a dip-circle by
Barrow, both tested at Kew, and a Frodsham chronometer.                 Sir Edward
Sabine, who made the Stonyhurst Observatory one of his magnetic stations

   187 1.]      Observations at Stonyhurst      College Observatory.          369
  in the English survey in       1858,   greatly encouraged the undertaking of
  monthly magnetic observations, and the Rev. A. Weld procured in conse
  quence the instruments still in use.         Only occasional observations were
  made with these instruments for some years, and it was only in 1863 that
  a continuous   series  of monthly determinations of the magnetic elements
  was started by the Rev. W. Sidgreaves.         He observed regularly until Sep
  tember 1868, when     I returned to my former post at the Observatory, and
  I  have continued the same work ever since.
     A stone pillar was at first erected for the magnetic instruments in the
  open garden, and this remained in use from 1858 until the beginning of
  1 868, when a most convenient hut of glass and wood was built for the in
 struments in   a retired corner of the College garden.      This alteration was
 rendered necessary from the placing of iron rails in the vicinity of the old
 pillar ; and although it introduces into the results a correction for change
 of station, it has the great advantage of securing immunity from dis
 turbance for the future.
     Considering the object in view in drawing up this reduced form of the
 dip and horizontal-force observations, I have judged it advisable to adhere
 strictly to the tabular forms in which the matter has been presented in
 previous discussions of a similar nature.         Each element is the subject
 matter of these tables.     In the first are the monthly values of the element,
 the   deduced  mean value, and its secular variation.     Next in order comes
 the calculation   of the semiannual inequality.        The residual errors, and
 consequent probable weights of the observations and results, compose the
 third and last Table.
    The yearly mean values of the horizontal force are found to vary pro
gressively from 3-5926 to 361 78 in British units, the mean for Oct. 1st,
 1866, being 3-6034, with a secular acceleration of 00042.           Calculating
 from the monthly Tables the mean value of the horizontal force for the six
months     from  April to September, and for the semiannual period from
October to March, we find the former to be 0-0005 in excess over the
latter, showing that this component of the intensity is greater during the
summer than during the winter months.           Treating the dip observations in
a precisely similar way, we obtain 69° 45' 21" as the mean value of this
element for October 1st, 1866, subject to a secular diminution of 1' 49''-2 ;
the extreme yearly means being 69° 48' 47" and 69° 37' 52". The result
ing excess of 10" for the winter months in the computed semiannual
means is so small, that the observations tend mainly to show that the
effect of the sun's position is not clearly manifested by any decided varia
tion in the dip. Deducing the intensity from the above elements, we
obtain for the summer months the value 10-4136, whilst that for the
winter months is 10-4128.         The intensity of the earth's magnetic force
¦would thus appear to increase with the sun's distance, but the difference is
not large enough to have more than a negative weight in the question
under discussion. This weight, moreover, is lessened by the slight uncer

station.
    It is hoped that a second series of observations at the new station will
throw greater light on the fact of the sun's influence on terrestrial mag
netism, by either confirming the results obtained above, or by adding fresh
weight to the conclusions arrived at by the President of the Royal
Society.

     When    paraffin is exposed to a high temperature in a closed vessel, it
 is almost completely resolved, with the evolution of but little gas, into
 hydrocarbons which remain liquid at the ordinary temperature.
     This reaction will undoubtedly afford the most important insight into
 the constitution of this body.
     Accordingly we have repeated this conversion on a large scale, and from
  about 3$ kilograms of paraffin melting at 44°*5C. (prepared from shale) we
  have obtained nearly four litres of liquid hydrocarbons.       This mixture of
  hydrocarbons    commences    to  boil at about 18° C, but  the quantity coming
  over below 100° C. is comparatively small ; by far the greater portion
  boils between 200° and 300°. A preliminary separation shows that the
  four litres are made up of hydrocarbons boiling
                                                                   litres.

  Up to the present we have principally occupied ourselves with the investi
  gation of the fraction boiling below 100°, and have obtained conclusive
   evidence that it is mainly composed of olefines, the proportion of members
   of the CnH2,-(-2    series being but small.    By repeated fractionations over
   sodium we obtained perfectly colourless liquids boiling about 35° and 65°,
   which were attacked by bromine in the cold with the greatest energy. On
   adding the bromine slowly and in minute drops, and carefully cooling the
   hydrocarbon by a mixture of snow and salt, scarcely a trace of hydro-
   bromic acid was produced.         The portipn boiling at 36° may be either
   amylhydride or amylene, or a mixture of both ; the avidity with which
   the bromine combines with it shows that the latter body must be present in
   considerable quantity.      As soon as the drops of bromine permanently

 coloured the liquid, it was submitted to distillation.             Only a small portion
 came over below 40°; the thermometer rose rapidly to 180°, and nearly
the whole of the bromine-compound             distilled   at 184° to 188°.        This sub
stance is amylene bromide, C5 H10 Bra ; "Wurtz gives              the boiling-point of this
body at about 180°.             The portion therefore boiling            at 35° is mainly
amylene.
    Exactly similar results were obtained from the portion boiling at 65° to
 70°.   This, from its boiling-point, may be either C8 Hla or Ce H„, or a
mixture of both. Bromine disappears instantly on adding it to the care
fully cooled liquid, and on distillation by far the greater portion is found
to have combined with the halogen. The bromide thus obtained distils
with slight decomposition about 195°.               Pelouze and Cahours found that
hexylene bromide, C6 HlaBra, boiled at 192° to 198°.
    We are at present engaged in the further investigation of this subject,
and hope shortly to lay our results before the Royal Society.

       C. R. A. Wright, D.Sc.               Communicated by Professor Roscoe
       F.R.S. Received February 6, 1871.
    It has been shown by the late Dr. A. Matthiessen, in conjunction with
the writer *, that when codeia is heated with a large excess of strong hy
drochloric acid the following reactions successively take              place  : —
                        Codeia.                          Chlorocodido.

                   C„   Hao  CI NO,=CH3 C1+ C„ H„ NOa.
It appeared     of interest to examine the action of hydrobromic                acid under
similar circumstances, and for this purpose Messrs. Macfarlane, of Edin
burgh, with their wonted liberality, put a considerable quantity of pure
codeia at the writer's disposal.
    The aqueous hydrobromic acid employed was obtained by the action of
IIaS on Br in. presence of water, and subsequent rectification over pulver
ized K Br ; it was free from S04 Ha and other sulphur compounds, had a
sp. gr. of about 1*5, and contained about 48 per cent, of H Br.
    When codeia is heated with from three to six times its weight of this
acid, either on a water-bath or to gentle ebullition over a flame, the liquid,
which    at first produces no precipitate with          solution of carbonate      of soda,
gradually darkens in colour, and acquires the property of                 yielding a dense
white precipitate with this reagent. No appreciable quantity                     of methyl

bromide is evolved during the first stages of this change, but subsequently
this body is produced in some little quantity.
    The precipitate thrown down by carbonate of soda before this further
change ensues, appears to consist of a variable mixture of at least three
substances, two of which are readily soluble in ether, while the third is but
sparingly soluble in that menstruum ; all are bases, the one insoluble in
ether, and one of those soluble containing bromine : the one apparently first
formed is produced by a reaction precisely analogous to that whereby chloro-
codide is generated,      viz. —
                      Codeia.                         Broniocodide.
                    C„ HM NO, + H Br = Ha O + C19        H30 Br NO,,
 and is therefore termed bromocodide ; this base appears to be acted on
 further with great ease, giving rise ultimately to the other two, the first
 of which has the constitution of codeia less one equivalent of oxygen, or
 C H3, NOj, and is therefore provisionally named Deoxycodeia ; whilst the
 second has the composition of four molecules of codeia coalesced together,
 one of the 84 H atoms in the product being replaced by Br ; it is therefore
 provisionally termed Bromotetracodeia, the simplest mode of representing
•the simultaneous formation of these two bases being as follows : —
         Bromocodide.           Codeia.       Deoxycodeia.      Bromotetracodeia.
        C18 HM Br NO,+4       C19 H„ N03= CIa H„      NOa+     C7a H83 Br N4 Ou.
     Owing to the     ease   with which bromocodide is altered, it is a matter of
 some     difficulty to obtain    it in even an approximately pure condition, as
 the complete separation of deoxycodeia appears impracticable when this
 base has once been produced.           The product of the action of three parts
 48 per cent, ncid on one part codeia on the water-bath for from one to two
 hours is precipitated by excess of sodium carbonate and the precipitate
 collected on filters ; unaltered codeia is for the most part separated thus,
 being contained in the filtrate.          Extraction of the mass with ether and
 agitation of the ethereal solution with HBr furnishes crude bromocodide
 hydrobromate, which may be purified by a repetition of the process, frac
  tional precipitation being resorted to to get rid of traces of colourin"-
  matters : the purified hydrobromate thus obtained was a viscid colourless
  liquid which utterly refused to crystallize, and dried up to a gum-like mass
  over SO,,Ha. Dried at 100°, the powdered gum gave these numbers*:
     0-3500 grm. gave 0-6340 COa and 0-1580 H.O.

     The slight excess of carbon and deficiency in bromine thus found are
doubtless due to the presence of a little deoxycodeia, the hydrobromate of
which requires 59'34 per cent, carbon and 21-98 per cent. Br. Another
specimen of bromocodide hydrobromate, prepared as above from the pro
duct of three hours' digestion at 100° of one part codeia and three parts
48 per cent. HBr, yielded numbers indicating 51-6 per cent, carbon, 5-3
and 33-4 per cent. Br ; whilst a repetition of the purification process
scarcely altered the numbers.            Owing to the great difficulty in preparing
the pure salt in quantity, no attempt to isolate and analyze the base itself
was     made,    the more so        that   the precipitate    thrown    down by carbo
nate of soda from the pure hydrobromate               appeared to tally in every respect
with the chlorocodide formerly examined             ;  their qualitative reactions, too,
are identical.
     The crude bromocodide hydrobromate obtained after five or six hours'
digestion of codeia with from three to five times its weight of 48 per cent.
HBr deposited, on standing for some days, crystals not readily soluble in cold
water     ; recrystallized several times from boiling water, minute snow-white
crystals were ultimately obtained ; these slightly darkened on drying
over S04 H2, and more so at 100° and gave the following numbers on ana
lysis   : —
     0-3565 grm. gave 0-7760 C02 and 0-1960 HaO.

     The yield of this   base from     the codeia used being but small (about 4
  per cent.), no attempt was made to isolate the base itself; carbonate of
  soda throws down from the hydrobromate solution a white precipitate
  which is soluble in alcohol, ether, benzol, and chloroform ; by exposure
  to air it rapidly becomes coloured, and finally acquires a very dark green
 tint.    Its qualitative reactions are identical with those of apomorphia ; the
 colour-reactions    of the two with Fe2CI,,, N03 H, and S04Ha+K,
                                                                               CraOT
 being indistinguishable when examined side by side. Its physiological
 effects, however, are different ; three-tenths of a grain of the hydrobromate
 administered by the mouth to a dog producing no appreciable effect, whilst
 a much less dose of apomorphia produces speedy vomiting.
    The third base is conveniently obtained, as hydrobromate, by treating
 codeia with three times its weight of 48 per cent. H Br for two houre on
 the water-bath,     precipitating the product (diluted with water) by excess
 of  carbonate   of  soda, collecting on filters, and well draining from the
 mother-liquors,     and  finally extracting with ether until scarcely anything
 more is taken up ; care must be taken to have as little watery fluid as pos
 sible present, otherwise the insoluble substance forms a sort of lather, on
 agitation from which the ether will not separate.          The insoluble substance
is then dissolved    in the   least  possible quantity of weak hydrobromic acid
and fractionally precipitated by cautious addition of stronger acid ; the se
cond precipitate is dissolved up in water, in which it is readily soluble, and
a few drops of carbonate-of-soda solution added.             The filtrate from this
yields,  with  strong   H  Br,  nearly  white flakes, which are wholly void of crys
talline character under the microscope.            These remain solid at 100°' if
previously completely       dried  over  SO, Ha ; but if warmed while moist, be

 The qualitative reactions of bromotetracodeia appear to be identical with
 those of bromo- and chlorocodide.            The base itself, when freshly precipi-
 pitated, is slightly soluble in water, being thrown down again by addition of
 strong brine ; in ether and benzol it is almost insoluble, and in alcohol but
 sparingly soluble.
      When crude bromotetracodeia, got by extraction with ether of the mix
 ture of bases thrown down by carbonate of soda, is dissolved in weak hydro
 chloric acid, and precipitated twice or thrice by excess of stronger acid,
 nearly white flakes are ultimately obtained, resembling in all their physical
  properties the bromohydrobromate of tetracodeia. These flakes, however,
  contain no bromine, the absence of this element being ascertained by the ne
  gative results obtained on examining with chlorine-water and ether the
  acidified solutions of the lime-salts got by combustion with quicklime, and
  of the sodium-salts got by boiling with N03 H and AgN03, and fusing
  with   carbonate   of  soda the silver-salts thus got.      Dried     over S04 H2 and

I. "   Description     of Ceratodus, a genus of Ganoid Fishes, recently
       discovered in rivers of Queensland, Australia."                By Albert
       Gunther, M.A., Ph.D., M.D., F.R.S. Received February 7,
       1871.
                                     (Abstract.)
    After  some introductory    remarks the author proceeds to give a descrip
tion  of the external characters which appear      to indicate the existence of two
species, viz. Ceratodus forsteri, with fewer and larger, and Ceratodus
miolepis with smaller and more numerous scales.                 The microscopical
structure of the scales and teeth is treated of in two separate chapters, the
latter being compared with the fossils from the Triassic and Jurassic forma
tions, and found to be identical.         The resemblance to the dentition of
Protopterus, Psammodus, Dipterus and other fossil genera is pointed out.
    The skeleton resembles in its general characters, as well as in numerous
points of detail, so much that of Lepidosiren, that from this part alone the
conclusion must be drawn that these genera belong to the same natural
group of fishes.      It is notochordal, all its parts having a cartilaginous
basis, more or less incompletely covered by thin osseous lamellae.
    The ossifications of the skull are but few in number, and may be desig
nated thus    : — ethmoid ; a pair of
                                                                           " sclero-
                                       frontals separated by a single
parietal"; basal, with a tooth-bearing ptery go-palatine on each side, the
latter bones being suturally united in front ; vomer cartilaginous, tooth-
bearing.     Maxillary and intermaxillary elements are not developed, re
placed by    facial cartilages which are confluent with the suborbital ring, all
these parts being cavernous.        Tympanic pedicle cartilaginous, with ossified
lamella (os quadratum) and double condyle.           Mandible with an articulary
and dentary lamella.        Prceoperculum a rudimentary moveable cartilage.
A well-developed operculum and styliform suboperculum. Hyoid arch more
complex than in Lepidosiren, consisting of a pair of ceratohyals, a basi-
and glosso-hyal.       Branchial apparatus composed of five arches, of which
the last is rudimentary ; not differing from the Teleosteous type, but car
tilaginous.     In a vertical section of the head the parts of the brain-cavity
and of the acoustic cavity (which is entirely enclosed in the skull) are
explained.      A pituitary gland is present.
    The notochord forms the base for about 68 sets of apophyses, 27 of
which bear ribs. The various modifications in the different parts of the
column are described in detail ; and more especially attention is directed
to the first rib, which is very similar to that of Lepidosiren, where, from
its more intimate connexion with the skull, it was interpreted in various

Arrangement and detachment of dermoneurals as in Lepidosiren.
   The scapular arch and pelvis are more developed than, but typically
entirely identical with, those of Lepidosiren.
   The paddles are supported by a cartilaginous axial skeleton, that is, by
a longitudinal series of joints, with lateral divergent articulated branches,
each joint having two of these branches.             The relations of this singular
structure     to the corresponding       parts in Lepidosiren and Selachians are
explained   ;   and there is no doubt that the Ganoids of the Devonian epoch,
with acutely lobate      fins, had their paddles supported by a similar internal
skeleton.

   Heart. — The arrangements of the interior of the ventricle             and single
atrium, and the external appearance            of the bulbus arteriosus, are very
similar to the same parts in Lepidosiren ; but the valvular arrangement of
the bulbus is more " Ganoid," though considerably modified.               We find at
a short distance from the origin of the bulbus, first, a single, cartilaginous,
papillary valve worked by a special muscle, then a transverse series of four
small short valves (sometimes reduced to papillae), then a transverse
series of four oblong raised strips (rudimentary valves), finally a transverse
series of four well-developed
                                    " Ganoid " valves. Four arcus aortee enter
the four gills, without sending off branches, and four vents bronchioles
are collected into the aorta descendens.
   A description of    the principal portions of the circulatory system follows.
   The gills     are completely developed, four in number, lamellated.           The
pseudobranchia does not receive its blood from the heart           ; thus an  " oper
cular gill
           " is absent as well as
                                      spiracles.
   The lung is single, but its cavity divided into two symmetrical halves,
each with about      thirty cellular compartments ; pneumatic duct and glottis
as  in Lepidosiren ; its dorsal artery is a branch of the A. caliaca ; and its
vein enters the atrium separately from the sinus venosus.
   The most important points of the structure of the remaining soft organs
are the following : — the intestinal tract is perfectly straight and very
wide, with a complete spiral valve, along the axis of which large glands
are imbedded      ; the stomach is indicated only by a shallow double pyloric
fold  ; there are no pyloric appendages, but a glandular mass appears to
represent the spleen. Not only the liver, but also the paired, lobed
kidneys are provided with a portal system. The two ureters enter by a
single opening a small urinal cloaca situated at, and partly confluent with,
the back of the rectum.          Testicles without developed vas deferens, which
appears   to be represented by a blind duct, traversing the interior of the
testicle, and receiving the semen from the canaliculi seminiferi.            Ovaries
transversely laminate, the lamina? being the bearers of the stroma in which
very small ova are developed ; the ova fall into the abdominal cavity, and
are expelled by a pair      of wide peritoneal slits behind the vent.      But there

 are also a pair of narrow oviducts, with or without         a  narrow peritoneal
 opening, each confluent with the ureter of its side.
    In  the concluding chapters it is shown : —
    1. That Geratodus and Lepidosiren {Protopterus)         are more nearly allied
 to each other than to any third living fish, that they are well-marked
 modifications of the same (Dipnoous) type, the latter genus diverging
 more towards the Amphibians than the former.
    2. That the difference in the arrangement of the valves of the bulbus
 arteriosus    cannot longer be considered of sufficient importance to distin
 guish the Dipnoi as a subclass from the Ganoidei ; but that the Dipnoi
 may be retained as a suborder of Ganoidei.
    3. That the suborder Dipnoi may be characterized as Ganoids with the
 nostrils within the mouth, with paddles supported by an axial skeleton,
 with lungs and gills and notochordal skeleton, and without branchio-
 stegals.
    4. That   a comparison of Teleostei, Chondropterygii,     and Ganoidei shows
 that the two latter divisions, hitherto regarded as        subclasses, are much
 more nearly allied to each other than to the Teleostei, which were deve
 loped in much more recent epochs ; and therefore that they should be
 united into one subclass — Palatichthyes — characterized thus : heart with
 a contractile bulbus arteriosus ; intestine with a spiral valve ; optic nerves
 non-decussating.
    5. That there is very strong evidence that the suborder Dipnoi was re
presented in the Devonian and Carboniferous epochs by the genus Dipterus
(? — Ctenodus) ; but that, although Dipterus has internal nostrils and even
a pair of vomerine teeth (beside the molars) like the living Dipnoi, it must
be placed as the type of a separate family of this suborder, on account of
its heterocercy.
    6. That the     evidence with regard of Phaneropleuron        (Huxley) is less
conclusive   ;  and that  Tristichopterus (Egerton),  with the  complete segmen
tation of its vertebral column, must be excluded from this suborder.
    7. That the suborder Crossopterygii (Huxley) contains two distinct types
of " lobate fin," viz. the " obtusely lobate,"       with  a transverse series   of
carpal cartilages, and the " acutely lobate
                                              "  with an axial skeleton.     Only
the latter type agrees with the structure of the Dipnoous limb.               But
Polypterus, Ccelacanthus, &c, which are provided with fins of the former
type, are genera sufficiently distinguished     also  by other characters, to be
placed into a separate suborder.

       cated by    J. Paget, F.R.S.      Received February 17, 1871.
                                    (Abstract.)
   In the term subaxial arches is included all those which grow out in front
of the notochord.       The first forms the nasal    passages, the second forms
chiefly the superior maxilla, the third is the mandibular, the fourth the
lingual, the fifth the hyoid, the sixth the laryngeal, whilst the seventh,
which    is distinguished as the exoccipital arch, forms the shoulder-girdle
and the thoracic extremity of either side.
   The consideration of the connexion of the first four with the cranial
cartilages is for the present deferred ; and this communication relates to
those arches which grow into the cervical region, and to that period of
their growth which lies between the fifth and twelfth weeks of festal life.
   The fourth subaxial arch, the lingual, grows out below the mandibular,
and bears upon its anterior extremity the tissue which developes into the
tongue.      Its connexion with this anterior portion ceases to be recognized
at an early period, and about the eleventh week it consists of five portions,
 (1) cartilage from the base of the skull, (2) a short piece of membrane,
(3) a second very small rod of cartilage, these forming about one-half of
its length, (4) a long strip of membrane, and (5) a nodule of cartilage
within the lesser or anterior horn of the hyoid bone.
   The fifth subaxial arch, the byoid, grows in common with the sixth as a
layer of membrane from the basioccipital region.            The posterior portion
of it forms the middle constrictor muscle ; the remainder is cartilaginous,
and grows into the greater or posterior horn and the body of the hyoid
bone.
   The sixth subaxial arch,' the laryngeal, begins in membrane which forms
the inferior constrictor.      Rising up and thickening in the front of the
neck, it encloses the pharynx ; and its inner layer developes a septum, which
separates     this tube from the larynx.      In front, and between this inner
layer and that in which the constrictor is formed, a mass of thick granular
tissue becomes cartilage, and here the chief cartilages of the larynx are
formed.      The details of their formation are referred to.
   The thyroid body is developed in this arch, and it serves as a girdle to
surround and keep in place the continuation of the air-tube towards the
thorax.     Its relation to the branchial arches is also referred to.
   After mentioning the reason for Calling the seventh arch the exoccipital,
its growth from the basioccipital and exoccipital cartilage regions is de
scribed, with its ending in two processes which grow out as the clavicle
and the scapula.       The relations of the clavicle to the sternum and first rib
are related, as also its change in direction from a nearly vertical to a hori-

I.     "Experiments on the Successive Polarization of Light, with the
         description of a new Polarizing Apparatus."   By Sir Charles
         Wheatstone, F.R.S.     Received Feb. 2, 1871.
                                                I.
     The term              polarization was applied by Biot to denote the
                   successive
effects produced  when   a ray of polarized light is transmitted through a
plate of rock-crystal cut perpendicularly to the axis, or through limited
depths of certain liquids.    In these cases the plane of polarization is found
to be changed on emergence, and differently for each homogeneous ray ; so
that, when white light is employed, on turning the analyzer round con
tinuously in one direction different colours successively appear, rising or
falling in the     scale according to the nature           of the   substance.
       If, while the analyzer is turned from left to right, the tints                      ascend
 (».   e. follow the order B, O, Y, G, B,            P,

 hibit right-handed        successive      polarization,    but   if   the tints descend,      the
successive polarization         is   said to be left-handed.
  These phenomena were satisfactorily explained        Fresnel    bythe followingin
way.    The incident polarized ray, instead of resolving  itself into  two plane-
polarized rays at right angles to each other, as in the ordinary cases of di-
polarization, resolves itself in these instances into two circularly polarized
ravs, one right-handed the other left-handed, which are transmitted with
different velocities   each homogeneous ray, thus resolved into two opposite

382                           Sir C. Wheatstone on         the                [Mar. 23,
bifurcation    which    a ray   of polarized light suffers when it is transmitted
through a crystallized plate, is a very appropriate one; but as there are
different kinds of such separation, we may designate plane dipolarization
the resolution into two plane-polarized rays at right angles to each other,
and circular dipolarization the resolution into two circularly polarized
rays, one right-handed, the other left-handed.               In like manner the term
elliptic dipolarization may be employed to represent the phenomena
shown by transmitting a polarized ray through a plate of rock-crystal
obliquely to the axis.
    The object of the present communication is to make known another
means     of producing     successive     polarization, both right-handed and left-
handed, which, equally with the well-known modes, may be proved to
arise from the interference of two opposite systems of circularly polarized
rays.
                                              III.
    The polarizing-apparatus which            I have employed for the experiments
I  am about to detail is represented by          PI. IV.
    A   plate of black   glass,   G, is fixed at  an angle  of  3° to the horizon.   The
film to be examined is to be placed on a diaphragm, D, so that the light
reflected at the polarizing-angle from the glass plate shall pass through it
at right angles, and, after reflection at an angle of 18° from the surface of a
 polished silver plate S, shall proceed vertically upwards.              N is a Nicol'a
 prism, or any other analyzer, placed in the path of the second reflection.
 The diaphragm is furnished with a ring, moveable in its own plane, by
 which the crystallized plate to be examined may be placed in any azimuth.
 C is a small moveable stand, by means of which the film to be examined
 may be placed in any azimuth and at any inclination ; for the usual expe
 riments this is removed.
     If a lamina of quartz cut parallel to the axis, and sufficiently thin to
 show the colours of polarized light, be placed upon the diaphragm so that
 its principal section (i. e. the section containing the axis) shall be 45° to
 the left of the plane of reflection, on turning the analyzer from left to
 right, instead of the alternation of two complementary colours at each
 quadrant, which appear in the ordinary polarizing apparatus, the phe
  nomena     of successive polarization, exactly similar       to those exhibited  in the
  ordinary apparatus by         a  plate of quartz cut perpendicular to the axis,
  will he exhibited ; the colours follow in the order R, O, Y, G, B, P, V,
  or, in other words, ascend as in the case of a right-handed plate of
  quartz cut perpendicularly to the axis.            If the lamina be now either in
  verted, or turned in its own plane 90°, so that the principal section shall
  be 45° to the right of the plane of reflection, the succession of the colours
  will be reversed, while the analyzer moves in the same direction as before,
  presenting the same phenomena as a left-handed plate of quartz cut per
  pendicularly to the axis.         Quartz is a positive doubly refracting crystal ;
  and in it consequently the ordinary index of refraction is smaller than the

1871.J                  Successive Polarization   of Light.                  383
extraordinary index.       But if we take a lamina of a negative crystal, in
which the extraordinary index is the least, as a film of Iceland spar split
parallel to one of its natural cleavages, the phenomena are the reverse of
those exhibited by quartz : when the principal section is on the left of the
plane of reflection the colours descend, and when it is on the right of the
same    plane the colours ascend,     the analyzer being turned     from left to
right.
    It has been determined that the ordinary ray, both in positive and
negative crystals, is polarized in the principal section, while the extra
ordinary ray is polarized in the section perpendicular thereto.        It is also
established that the index of refraction is inversely as the velocity of
transmission.      It follows from the above experimental results, therefore,
that when the resolved ray whose plane of polarizatio n is to the left of the
plane of reflection is the quickest the successive polarization is right-
handed, and when it is the slowest the successive polarization is left-
handed — in the order R, O,       Y, G, B, P, V,  and in the second case in the
reversed order.
    The rule thus determined is equally applicable to         laminae  of biaxal
crystals.
    As  selenite (sulphate of lime) is an easily procurable crystal, and readily
cleavable into thin lamina; capable of showing the colours of polarized
light, it is most frequently employed in experiments on chromatic polar
ization.      The laminae into which this substance most readily splits,
contain in their planes the two optic axes ; polarized light transmitted
through such lamina: is resolved in two rectangular directions, which
respectively bisect the angles formed by the two optic axes : the line which
bisects the smallest angle is called the intermediate section ; and the line
perpendicular thereto which bisects the supplementary angle is called the
supplementary section. These definitions being premised, if a film of sele
nite is placed on the diaphragm with its intermediate section to the left of
the plane of reflection, the successive polarization is direct or right-handed ;
if, on the contrary, it is placed to the right of that plane, the successive
polarization is left-handed.     The ray polarized in the intermediate section
is therefore the most retarded     ; and as that section is considered to be
equivalent to a single optic axis, the crystal is positive.
    In one kind of mica the optic axes are in a plane perpendicular to the
laminae.      They are inclined 2'2\° on each side the perpendicular within
 the crystal, but, owing to the refraction, are seen respectively at an angle
 of  35°"3 therefrom.      The principal section is that which contains the two
 optic axes.     If the film is placed on the diaphragm with its principal
 section inclined 45° to the left of the plane of reflection, the successive
 polarization is right-handed.     The ray, therefore, polarized in the section
 which    contains the optic axes is the one transmitted with the greatest
 velocity.
    Films of uniaxal crystals, whether positive or negative, and of biaxal
                                                                  2g2

384                           Sir C. Wkeat3tone on   the             *  [Mar. 23;
crystals, all agree therefore in this respect :— that if the plane of polarization
of the quickest ray is to the left of the plane of reflection, the successive
polarization is right-handed when the analyzer moves from left to right ;
and if it is to the right of the plane of reflection, other circumstances
remaining the same, the successive polarization is left-handed.
    It must be taken into consideration that the principal section of the
film is inverted in the reflected image ; so that if the plane of polarization of
the quickest ray in the film is to the left of the plane of reflection, it is to
the right of that plane in the reflected image.
                                         IV.
    It   may not be uninteresting to state a few obvious consequences of this
successive      polarization in doubly refracting laminae, right-handed         and
left-handed according to the position of the plane of polarization of the
quickest ray.         They are very striking as experimental results, and will
serve to im press the facts more vividly on the memory.
     1 . A film of uniform thickness being placed on the diaphragm with its
principal      section    45° on either side the plane of reflection, when the
analyzer is at 0° or 90° the colour of the film remains unchanged, whether
the film be turned in its own plane 90°, or be turned over so that the back
 shall become the front surface ; but if the analyzer be fixed at 45°, 135°,
 225°,   or 3 1 5°, complementary colours will appear when the film is in
 verted from back to front, or rotated in its own plane either way 90°.
     2.  If a uniform film be cut across and the divided portions be again
 placed together, after inverting one of them, a compound film (fig. 4) is
 formed, which, when placed on the diaphragm, exhibits simultaneously both
 right-handed and left-handed successive polarization.        When the analyzer
 is at 0° or 90° the colour of the entire film is uniform       ; as  it is turned
 round the tints of one portion ascend, while those of the other descend ;
 and when the analyzer is at 45° orn90°+45°, they exhibit complementary
  colours.
     3.  A  film increasing in thickness from one edge to the other is well
 suited to exhibit at one glance the phenomena due to films of various
 thicknesses.        It is well known that such a film placed between a polarizer
  and an analyzer will show, when the two planes are parallel or perpen
  dicular to each other, and the principal section of the film is intermediate
 to these two planes, a series of parallel coloured bands, the order of the
  colours in each band from the thick towards the thin edge being that of
  their refrangibilities, or R, O, Y, G, B, P, V.       The bands seen when the
  planes are perpendicular are intermediate in position to those seen when
  the planes are parallel ; on turning round the analyzer these two systems
   of bands alternately appear at each quadrant, while in the intermediate
  positions they entirely disappear.
      Now let us attend to the appearances     of  these bauds when the wedge-
  form film is placed on the diaphragm of the instrument, fig.          1.  As   the

             *                                                                385
1871.]                  Successive Polarization    of Light.
analyzer is moved round, the bands advance toward or recede from the
thin edge of the wedge without any changes occurring in the colours or in
tensity of the light, the same tint occupying the same place at every half
revolution of the analyzer.       If the bands advance toward the thin edge of
the wedge,     the successive  polarization of each point is left-handed ; and if
they recede from it the succession of colours is right-handed ; every cir
cumstance, therefore, that with respect to a uniform film changes right-
handed into left-handed successive polarization, in a wedge of the same
substance transforms receding into advancing bands, and vice versd.
These phenomena are also beautifully shown by concave or convex films of
 selenite or rock-crystal, which exhibit concentric rings contracting or
 expanding in accordance with the conditions previously explained.
     4. Few experiments in physical optics are so beautiful and striking as
 the elegant pictures formed by cementing laminse of selenite of different
 thicknesses (varying from -jbV $ to Jg- of an inch) between two plates of
 glass.   Invisible under ordinary circumstances, they exhibit, when exa
 mined in the usual polarizing-apparatus, the most brilliant colours, which
 are complementary to each other in the two rectangular positions           of the
 analyzer.     Regarded in the instrument, fig. 1, the appearances are still
 more beautiful ; for, instead of a single transition, each colour in the
 picture is successively replaced by every other colour.         In preparing such
  pictures it is necessary to pay attention to the direction of the principal
  section of each lamina when different pieces of the same thickness are
  to be combined together to form a surface having the same uniform tint ;
  otherwise in the intermediate transitions       the colours will be irregularly
  disposed.
     5. A plate of rock-crystal cut perpendicular to the axis loses its suc
  cessive polarization, and behaves exactly as an ordinary crystallized film
  through which rectilinear polarized light is transmitted.
     6. A thick plate of unannealed glass undergoes a series of regular
  transformations, the principal phases of which are shown, fig. 5.
     The phenomena of        successive  or rotatory  polarization  I have  experi
  mentally demonstrated admit of a very simple explanation.
     The polarized light incident on the crystallized plate is resolved into two
  portions of equal intensity, polarized at right angles to each other, one in
  the principal section, the other perpendicular thereto.           These resolved
  portions, when they fall on the silver plate, have their planes of polariza
  tion each at an azimuth of 45°, one to the right, the other to the left of
  the plane of reflection.     These are again resolved in the plane of reflection
  and the plane perpendicular thereto, and are, in consequence of the unequal
  retardation, which in silver at an angle of 72° amounts to a quarter of an
  undulation,    converted into circularly polarized beams, one right-handed,
  the other left-handed.

 38G                         SirC. Whcatstone      on the              {Mar. 23,
    The various homogeneous rays being accelerated differently            in their
 transmission through the two sections of the crystallized plate,        this dif
 ference is preserved after reflection from the silver plate, and the oppositely
 circularly polarized beams are reflected with the same difference of phase
 as the two plane-polarized rays are when emerging from           the crystallized
 lamina.     The composition of two circular waves, one right-handed, the
 other left-handed, gives for resultant a plane wave the azimuth of which
 varies with the difference of phase of the two components.
    When the plane of polarization does not lie equally between the two
rectangular sections of the laminae, these still remaining 45° from the plane
 of reflection of the silver plate, the beam is resolved into two unequal
portions, the amplitudes of which are as sin a to cos a. Each therefore
gives rise to a circular undulation of different amplitude.      The resultant of
two opposite circular undulations       of different  amplitudes is an ellipse of
constant form, the axes of which vary in position according to the difference
of phase.       The same phenomena of successive polarization are therefore
exhibited, in whatever azimuth the lamina is turned in its own plane ; but
the tints become fainter and fainter until ultimately, when the principal or
perpendicular section is parallel to the plane of reflection of the polarizing
plate, all colour disappears.
                                         VI.
    By means of the phenomena of successive polarization it is easy to
determine which is the thicker of two films of the same crystalline substance.
Place one of the films on the diaphragm (a) of the instrument (fig. la) in
the position to show, say, right-handed polarization, then cross it with the
other film    ;  if the former be the thicker, the successive polarization will be
still right-handed     ; if both be equal there will be no polarization ; and if
 the crossed film be the thicker, the successive polarization will be left-
handed.      In this manner a series of films may be readily arranged in their
proper order in the scale of tints.
                                        VII.
    In the experiments I have previously described the planes of re
flection of the polarizing mirror and of the silver plate were coincident ;
some of the results obtained when the azimuth of the plane of-reflection of
the silver plate is changed are interesting.
    I will confine my attention here to what takes place when the plane of
reflection of the silver plate is 45° from that of the polarizing reflector.
    When the principal sections of the film are parallel and perpendicular
to the plane of reflection of the polarizing mirror, as the whole of the
polarized light passes through one of the sections, no interference can
take place, and no colour will be seen, whatever be the position of the
analyzer.
    When the principal sections of the film are parallel and perpendicular

1871.]
                 «            Successive Polarization   of Light.                  387
to the plane of reflection of the silver plate, they are 45° from the plane of
reflection of the polarizing mirror.
    The polarized ray is then resolved into two components polarized at right
angles to each other ; one component is polarized in the plane of reflec
tion of the silver plate, the other perpendicular thereto ; and one is re
tarded upon the other by a quarter of an undulation.
    When the analyzer is at 0° or 90° no colours are seen, because there is
no interference; but when it is placed at 45° or 135°, interference
takes place, and the same colour is seen as if light circularly polarized
had been passed through the film. The bisected and inverted film (fig. 4)
shows simultaneously the two complementary colours.
   But when the film is placed with one of its principal sections 22£° from
the        of reflection of the polarizing mirror, on turning round the ana
       plane
lyzer the appearances of successive polarization are reproduced exactly as
when the planes of reflection of the silver plate and of the polarizing mirror
coincide.   In this case the components of the light oppositely polarized in
the two sections are unequal, being as cos 22£° to sin 22|°; these com
 ponents respectively fall 22£° from the plane of reflection of the silver
 plate and from the perpendicular plane, and are each resolved in the same
 proportion in these two planes. The weak component of the first, and the
 strong component of the second, are resolved into the normal plane, while
 the strong component of the first and the weak component of the second
are resolved into the perpendicular plane.
                                             VIII.
   As bearing intimately on     subject of this paper, I will here quote
                                       the
a passage from a memoir presented by Fresnel to the French Academy of
Sciences in 1817, and published, in abstract, in the ' Annales de Chimie,'
t. xxviii. 1825       :   —
   "    Ifthin crystallized plate be placed between two parallelopipeds of
             a
glass crossed at right angles, in each of which the light previously po
larized undergoes two total reflections at the incidence of 54^°, first
before its entrance   into the plate (which we suppose perpendicular to the
rays),  and  subsequently after its emergence, and            if,
                                                          besides, the plate be
turned so that its axis makes an angle of 45° with the two planes of double
reflection, this system will present the optical properties of plates of rock-
crystal perpendicular to the axis, and of liquids which colour polarized
light.  When the principal section of the rhomboid with which the emer
gent light    analyzed
                 is        turned round, the two images will gradually
                                  is
change colour, instead of experiencing only simple variations in the vivid
ness of their tints, as occurs in the ordinary case of thin crystallized
plates besides, the nature of these colours depends only on the respective
         ;
 inclination of the primitive plane of polarization and the principal section
 of the rhomboid — that to say, of the two extreme planes of polarization
                                 is                                                  ;

 plate and the two parallelepipeds may be turned round the transmitted
pencil without changing the colour of the images.            It is this analogy be
tween the optical properties of this little apparatus and those of plates of
 rock-crystal perpendicular to the axis which enabled M. Fresnel to foresee
 the peculiar characters of double refraction        that rock-crystal exerts on
 rays parallel to the axis."
    It does not appear that Fresnel, in any of his published memoirs, has
 given any further modifications of this experiment, the importance of
 which has been almost entirely overlooked in elementary treatises on light.
 He   does not seem to have remarked that similar phenomena            of  successive
 polarization are exhibited when the light incident on the crystallized plate
is plane-polarized, nor that the order of the succession of the colours
 depends on the position of the principal section with respect to the plane
of polarization.       These circumstances are indeed necessarily included in
the beautiful theory established by this eminent philosopher ; but I am
not aware that they have hitherto          been specifically  deduced or experi
mentally shown.
                                          IX.
    The apparatus (fig.     1) affords also the means of obtaining large surfaces
of uncoloured or coloured light in every state of polarization — rectilinear,
elliptical, or circular.
    It is for this purpose much more convenient than a Fresnel's rhomb,
with which but a very small field .of view can be obtained.          It must, how
ever, be borne in mind that the circular and elliptical undulations are
inverted in the two methods : in the former case they undergo only a
single, in the latter case a double reflection.
    For the experiments which follow, the crystallized plate must be placed
on the diaphragm E between the silver plate and the analyzer, instead of,
as   in the preceding experiments,        between  the polarizer    and the silver
plate.
    By  means   of a  moving ring within the graduated circle D the silver plate
is caused to turn round the reflected ray, so that, while the plane of pola
rization of the ray remains always in the plane of reflection of the glass
plate, it may assume every azimuthal position with respect to the plane of
reflection of the silver plate.      The film to be examined and the analyzer
move consentaneously with the silver plate, while the polarizing mirror
remains fixed.
    In the normal position of the instrument the ray polarized by the
mirror is reflected unaltered by the silver plate ; but when the ring is
turned to 45°, 135°, 225°, or 315°, the plane of polarization of the ray
falls 45° on one side of the plane of reflection of the silver plate, and the
ray is resolved into two others, polarized respectively in the plane of reflec
tion and the perpendicular plane, one of which is retarded on the other by a
quarter of an undulation, and consequently gives rise to a circular ray,
which is right-handed or left-handed according to whether the ring is turned

45° and 225° or 135° and 315°. When the ring is turned so as to place
the plane of polarization in any intermediate position between those pro
ducing rectilinear and circular light, elliptical light is obtained, on account
of the unequal resolution of the ray into its two rectangular components.
   Turning the ring of the graduated diaphragm from left to right when
the crystallized film is between the silver plate and the analyzer, occasions
the same succession of colours for the same angular rotation as rotating
the analyzer from right to left when the instrument is in its normal posi
tion and the film is between the polarizer and the silver plate.
   To arrange the apparatus for the ordinary experiments of plane-polarized
light without the intervention of the silver plate, all that is necessary is to
remove the silver plate from the frame F, and to substitute for it a plate
of black glass, which must be fixed at the proper polarizing-angle.
   To convert it into a Norrenberg's polarizer, a silvered mirror must be laid
horizontal at H, and the instrument straightened, as shown at fig. 3, so>
that a line perpendicular to the mirror shall correspond with the line of
sight. The silver plate must be removed from the frame F, and a plate of
transparent glass substituted for     which must be so inclined that the
                                            it,
light falling upon   shall be reflected at the polarizing-angle perpendicu
                         it
larly toward the horizontal mirror. The eye will receive the polarized-
ray reflected from the mirror; and the polarized ray will have passed,'
before   it   reaches the eye, twice through
                                           crystallized plate placed between

  Dear Sir, —    enclose
                   I      curve of the variation of the annual mean tem
                               a

1870 inclusive.   have carefully examined the zero-points of all the ther;

390                      Mr. E. J. Stone     on a Decennial             [Mar. 23,
mometers which have been employed in this series of observations.                I
have then deduced the rate of change of these thermometers, from a com
parison of the index-errors thus found and those given originally or ob
tained in 1852 by Sir Thomas Maclear, when he compared the principal
thermometers at the Observatory with the readings of a standard " Reg-
nault" which had       been sent out to the Observatory       for that purpose by
you.    These indications of change have been        carefully checked by all the
comparisons made, at different times and for different purposes, of these
thermometers inter se and with others which still remain at the Observa
tory. From the agreement of the different results thus checked,             I have
no doubt upon my own mind of the systematic character and sensible
amount of the increase of readings of thermometers with age thus indi
cated.    In    some  cases  the change appears to amount to as much as
0o-05  F. per annum.       From    these results I have deduced the index-errors
of  the different thermometers for the different periods, and applied these
corrections throughout.       I  have also corrected the mean results of the five
observations made daily since 1847 in order to deduce the true daily mean.
   The results thus reduced on a general system, and extending over thirty
years, appeared likely to afford information respecting any connexion which
might exist between the mean temperature and the frequency of solar
spots.    I  have therefore constructed the curves of variation of mean annual
temperature, and the inverse curve of solar-spot frequency for comparison.
The latter curve has been founded upon Wolfs observations.
    The observations of temperature from        1841 to 1851 inclusive were made
in the original Meteorological Observatory, which was burnt down in
 1852, March 11.
    The observations from 1852, April 24, to 1858, August 31, were made in
a wooden shed erected for the purpose on the site of the old Observatory.
    The observations from 1858, August 3 1st, to the present time have
been made in the crib before the south-west window of the Transit-Circle
Room.
    These changes     are so far unfortunate    that there is clearly a change of
mean temperature arising        from  the  different  circumstances of exposure.
I  have therefore referred each set of observations to the mean temperature
deduced from all the observations made under the same circumstances of
exposure.       The deviations of the mean temperature for each year from the
mean of     the  whole period of similar exposure are then laid down as ordi-
nates on the scale of one division of the ruled paper to 0o-05 F.              To
smooth down the irregularities, I have joined the points thus laid down, and
bisected the lines thus joining these points whenever the corresponding
mean temperatures were deduced from a full year's observations. In other
cases the temperatures corresponding          to the deficient months have been
supplied from the adjoining years, and the resulting mean temperature
allowed less weight.       The inverse curve of the frequency of solar spots
has   been    formed  by simply subtracting 100 from Wolfs numbers, and

The   broken  curve    represents the variations in the mean annual temperature at the
         Cape  ; the  continuous line is the inverse curve of solar spots- frequency.
   The agreement between the curves appears to me so close that I cannot
but believe that the same cause which leads to an excess of mean annual
temperature leads equally to a dissipation of solar spots. There is on the
whole a curious appearance of lagging of the inverse curve of solar spots
over that of temperature.            At the maximum about 1856, however, this
does not appear to be the case ; but when the uncertainties of the data,

both   of the solar   spots near- the minimum, and     of the mean temperature
also, are taken into account, such discrepancies        might • perhaps fairly be
expected, even if there be a physical connexion between the two pheno
mena as results of some common cause.           If  there be a sensible inequality
in the mean temperature with a period of about ten years, then the mean
temperature resulting from the observations in the temporary Observatory,
which were made near a maximum, will be too high.               The corresponding
ordinates, therefore, will be depressed too much relatively to those corre
 sponding to observations made in the other two observatories.               In the
 curve 2, I have imperfectly corrected the mean of the results for the tem
 porary observatory on the supposition of such an inequality existing.          The
only result of such a correction is to modify the curve at the points of
junction of the observations made in different positions. The general form
is unaltered.      It should be mentioned that the point about which the
 curves appear to differ most is near or at the change       of exposure from the
 original observatory to the temporary shed, about 1852.
                            I
    I may mention that had not the slightest expectation, on first laying
 down the curves, of any sensible agreement resulting, but that         I  now con
sider the agreement too close to be a matter of chance.         I should, however,
rather lean to the opinion that the connexion between the variation of
 mean temperature and the appearance of solar spots is indirect rather than
direct, that each results from some general change of solar energy.
    I  have forwarded these curves to you, knowing the great interest you
have ever taken in such inquiries, and on account of your being the chief
promoter of the establishment of a Meteorological Observatory here. The
 problems of meteorology appear to be presented here in a simpler form
 than in England ; and probably systematic photographic self-registering
 observations extended over a few years might lead to important results.
                                    I have the honour to be, Sir,

 III.   Resume of two Papers on Sun-spots : — " On the Form of the
        Sun-spot Curve," by Prof. Wolf ; and
                                                           " On the Connexion
        of Sun-spots with Planetary Configuration," by M. Fritz. By
        B. Loewy.       Communicated by Warren De La Rue, F.R.S.,
        and B.   Stewart, F.R.S.
    Of these   two series of investigations, one is by Professor Wolf, the other
 by   M.  Fritz, communicated to Wolf.
    In the first, Prof. Wolf    has proposed to    himself  to find the mean cha
 racter of the curve of sun-spots, i. e. its real form from one minimum to
 another.     He investigates the form only for 2| years before, and 2| years1

1871.]           Mr. F.    G'altoh's Experiments in Pangenesis.                3S&
after   each  minimum,      and concludes by a simple proportion of the reJ
mainder.      He finds that the curve ascends more rapidly than it descends —
the ascent taking in the mean 3-7 years, the descent lasting 7'4 years.
We have established these data far more reliably in our last paper ; and
our curve gives 3-52 years for the ascent, 7*54 years for the descent (average
of the   three periods).    Professor Wolf also thinks that although a single
period may differ essentially in its character and form from the mean, still,
on the whole, if the descent is retarded, the ascent in the same period is
also retarded j    if the former is accelerated,   the latter is also accelerated".
This   is not quite    borne out by our ourve.         He also overlooks the se
condary    maximum,      which may lead to great conclusions if more investi
gated together with other matters.
    M. Fritz   comes to the following conclusions    : —
    1. The connexion      between  sun-spots and auroral and magnetic disturb
ances indicates an external cause, to be sought in planetary configurations.
    2. The relative influence of the planets must be exerted in the following
order : — Jupiter (greatest), Venus, Mercury, Earth, Saturn.
    3. This influence cannot entirely depend on the time of rotation ; but
changes in the magnetic axes of these planets may have the most deter
mining effect.                                                                      •
    4. Investigating the comparative influences of them singly and together
 (as far as possible), at the times of conjunction and quadrature, he finds
the greatest coincidence of maxima of sun-spots with the time wheu Jupiter
and Saturn are in quadrature ; and the greatest coincidence of minima
when these planets are in conjunction.
    5. There is also (a minor) coincidence of maxima when Jupiter and
 Venus are in quadrature.
    There is also an extension of the paper for finding the connexions with
 auroras, and   a statement that every 27' 7 days there seems to be a monthly
 maximum, which may probably be explained (according to Fritz) by the
 tendency of a particular solar meridian to spot-formations, depending upon
 the presence of an intra-Mercurial planet.

 I. "Experiments        in Pangenesis, by Breeding from Rabbits of a pure
       variety, into whose circulation blood taken from other varieties
       had previously been largely transfused."            By Francis Galton,
       F.R.S.      Received    March 23, 1871.
    Darwin's provisional theory of Pangenesis claims our belief on the ground
 that it is the only theory which explains, by a single law, the numerous

phenomena allied to simple reproduction, such as reversion, growth, and
repair of injuries.  On the other hand, its postulates are hypothetical and
large, so that few naturalists seem willing to grant them.     To myself, as
a student of Heredity, it seemed of pressing importance that these postu
lates should be tested.             If
                              their truth could be established, the influence
of Pangenesis on the study of heredity would be immense                 ;   if   otherwise
the negative conclusion would still be a positive gain.
     It   is necessary   that   I
                          should briefly recapitulate the cardinal points of
Mr. Darwin's theory. They are (1) that each of the myriad cells in every
                 is,
living body    to a great extent, an independent organism     (2) that before
                                                        throws " gemmules"
                                                                    ;
it   developed, and in all stages of its development,
     is                                                        it
into the circulation, which live there and breed, each truly to its kind,                   by
the process of self-division, and that, consequently, they swarm          the        in
blood, in large numbers of each variety, and circulate freely with it;
(3) that the sexual elements consist of organized groups of these gem-
mules  (4) that the development of certain of the gemmules in the offspring
          ;
depends on their consecutive union, through their natural affinities, each at
taching itself to its predecessor in regular order of growth
                                              a
                                                                (5) that gem
                                                                        ;
mules of innumerable varieties may be transmitted for an enormous number
of generations without being developed into cells, but always ready to be
come so, as shown by the almost insuperable tendency to                 feral    reversion,
in domesticated animals.
     It
      follows from this, and from the general tenor of Mr. Darwin's rea
soning and illustrations, that two animals, to outward appearance of the
same pure variety, one of which has mongrel ancestry and the other has not,
differ solely in the constitution of their blood, so far as concerns those points
on which outward appearance depends.          The one has none but gemmules
of the pure variety circulating in his veins, and will breed true to his kind;
the other, although only the pure variety of skin-gemmules happens to have
been developed in his own skin, has abundance of mongrel gemmules        his           in
blood, and will be apt to breed mongrels.     It also follows from this that
the main stream of heredity must flow in     far smaller volume from the
                                                       a
developed parental cells, of which there   only one of each variety, than
                                                     is
from the free gemmules circulating with the blood, of which there    large        is a
number of each variety.  If parental developed cell bred faster than free
                                         a                                             a
gemmule, an influx of new immigrants would gradually supplant the indi
genous gemmules under which supposition,
                         ;                   rabbit which, at the age
                                                           a                                 of
six months, produced young which reverted to ancestral peculiarities,
would, when five years old, breed truly to his individual peculiarities                ;   but
of this there no evidence whatever.
                    is
     Under Mr. Darwin's  theory, the gemmules in each individual must
therefore be looked upon as entozoa of his blood, and, so far as the pro
blems of heredity are concerned, the body need be looked upon as little
more than       a   case which encloses        them, built up through the development
of    some    of their number.           Its influence upon them can be only such as

1871.]               Mr. F. Galton'8 Experiments in Pangenesis.                                 395
would account for the very minute                    effects   of   use or disuse    of parts, and of
 acquired mental habits being transmitted hereditarily.
    It occurred to me, when considering these theories, that the truth of
 Pangenesis admitted of a direct and certain test.      knew that the opera  I
 tion of transfusion of blood had                been frequently practised with success on
 men     well as animals, and that it was not a cruel operation — that not only
         as
 had it been used in midwifery practice, but that large quantities of saline
 ¦water had been injected into the veins of patients suffering under cholera.
 I therefore determined to inject alien blood into the circulation of pure
 varieties of animals (of course, under the influence of anaesthetics), and to
 breed from them, and to note whether their offspring did or did not show
 signs    of mongrelism.              If   Pangenesis were true, according to the inter-
p pretation which         I   have put upon      it,
                                                   the results would be startling in their
 novelty, and of no small practical use     for     would become possible to
                                                         ;          it
 modify varieties of animals,    introducingby slight  dashes of new blood, in
 ways important to breeders.   Thus,   supposing      small infusion of bull-dog
                                                                     a
 blood was wanted in    breed of greyhounds, this, or any more complicated
                                a
 admixture, might be effected (possibly by operating through the umbilical
 cord of   newly born animal) in single generation.

     Ihave now made experiments of transfusion and cross circulation on
 a large scale in rabbits, and have arrived at definite results, negativing, in
 my opinion, beyond all doubt, the truth of the doctrine of Pangenesis.

  varieties of rabbits, took place after Dr. Murie had ceased to be Prosector.

     The  breed   of rabbits which  I endeavoured to mongrelize    was the
                                                                            " Silver-
 grey."     I  did so by infusing blood into their circulation, which I had pre
 viously drawn from other sorts of rabbits, such as          I could, from time to
 time, most readily procure.         I  need hardly describe Silver-grey rabbits
 with minuteness.        They are peculiar in appearance, owing to the intimate
 mixture of black and grey hairs with which they are covered.              They are
 never blotched, except in the one peculiar way I shall shortly describe ; and
 they have never lop enrs.        They are born quite black, and their hair begins
 to turn grey when a few weeks old.          The variations to which the breed is
 liable, and which might at first be thought due to mongrelism, are white
 tips to the nose and feet, and also a thin white streak down the forehead.
 But   these variations lead to no uncertainty,      especially as the white streak
lessens or disappears, and the white tips become less marked, as the animal
 grows up.      Another variation is much more peculiar : it is the tendency
of some breeds to throw " Himalayas," or white rabbits with black tips.
 From first to last I have not been troubled with white Himalayas ; but in
one of the two breeds which I have used, and which I keep carefully sepa
rated from each other, there is a tendency to throw " sandy" Himalayas.
 One of these was born a few days after I received the animals, before any
operation had been made upon them, and put me on my guard. A similar
one has been born since an operation.          Bearing these few well-marked ex
ceptions in mind, the Silver-grey rabbit is excellently adapted for breeding-
experiments.       If it is crossed with other rabbits, the offspring betray mon
grelism in the highest degree", because any blotch of white or of colour,
which is not " Himalayan," is almost certainly due to mongrelism ; and so
also is any decided change in the shape of the ears.
    I shall speak in this memoir of litters connected with twenty silver-
grey rabbits, of which twelve are does and eight are bucks ; and eighteen of
them have been submitted to one or two of three sorts of operations.
These consisted of: —
    (1) Moderate transfusion of partially defibrinized blood.           The silver-
grey was bled as much as he could easily bear ; that was to about an ounce,
a quantity which bears the same proportion to the weight of his body (say
76 oz.) that 2 lbs. bears to the weight of the body of a man (say 154 lbs.) ;
and the same amount of partially         defibrinized blood, taken from a killed
animal of another variety, was thrown in in its place. The blood was ob
tained from a yellow, common grey, or black and white rabbit, killed
by dividing the throat, and received in a warmed basin, where it was stirred
with    a split stick to remove part of the fibrine.          Then it was filtered
through linen into a measuring-glass, and thence drawn up with a syringe,
graduated into drachms ; and the quantity injected was noted.
•
    (2) The second set of operations consisted in a large transfusion of wholly

  1871.]          Mr. F. Galton's Experiments in Pangenesis.                 397
  defibrinized blood, which    I procured by whipping it up thoroughly with a
                                                                     I
  whisk of rice-straw ; and, in order to procure sufficient blood, had on one
  occasion to kill three rabbits.     I alternately bled the silver-grey and in
 jected, until in some cases a total of more than 3 ounces had been taken
  out and the same quantity, wholly defibrinized, had been thrown in. This
  proportion corresponds to more than 6 lbs. of blood in the case of a man.
     (3) The third operation consisted in establishing a system of cross-cir
 culation between the carotid artery of a silver-grey and that of a common
 rabbit.     It was effected on the same principle as that described by
  Addison and Morgan (Essay on Operation of Poisonous Agents upon the
 Living Body.        Longman & Co., 1829), but with more delicate apparatus
 and for a much longer period.        The rabbits were placed breast to breast,
 in each other's arms, so that their throats could be brought close together.
 A   carotid of each was then exposed ; the circulation in each vessel was
 temporarily stopped, above and below, by spring holders ; the vessels were
 divided, and short canulse, whose bores were larger than the bore of the
 artery in its normal state, were pressed into the mechanically distended
 mouths of the arteries ; the canulse were connected cross-wise ; the four
 spring holders were released, and the carotid of either animal poured its
 blood direct into the other.      The operation  was complicated, owing to the
 number of instruments employed ; but        I suspended them from strings run
 ning  over  notched   bars, with  buttons  as counterpoises, and so avoided en
 tanglement.       These operations were exceedingly successful ; the pulse
 bounded through the canulse with full force ; and though, in most cases,
 it began to fall off after ten minutes or so, and I was obliged to replace the
 holders, disconnect the canulse, extract the clot from inside them with a
 miniature corkscrew, reconnect the canulse, and reestablish the cross-flow
 two, three, or more times in the course of a single operation, yet on two
occasions the flow was uninterrupted from beginning to end.            The buck
rabbit, which    I  indicate by the letter O, was 37£ minutes in the most free
 cross-circulation   imaginable with his
                                           " blood-mate," a large yellow rabbit.
There is no mistaking the quality of the circulation in a bared artery ; for,
when the flow is perfectly free, the pulse throbs and bounds between the
finger and thumb with a rush, of which the pidse at the human wrist, felt
in the ordinary     way, gives an imperfect conception.
    These, then, are the three sorts of operations which I have performed on
the rabbits ; it is convenient that I should distinguish them by letters.
I   will therefore call the operation of simply bleeding once, and then
injecting, by the letter a ; that of repeated bleedings and repeated injec
tions by the letter w ; and that of cross-circulation by the letter x.
    In none of these operations did I use any chemical means to determine
the degree to which the blood was changed ; for       I did not venture to com
promise my chances of success by so severe a measure ; but I adopted the
following method of calculation instead :—
    vol. xix.                                                      2 u

398               Mr. F. Galton's Experiments in        Pangenesis.    [Mar.   30,
    I calculate the change of blood effected by transfusion, or by cross-cir
culation, upon moderate suppositions as to the three following matters:—
   C 1 ) The quantity of blood in a rabbit of known weight.
   (2) The time which elapses before each unit of incoming blood is well
mixed up with tbat already in the animal's body.
   (3) The time occupied by the flow, through either carotid, of a       volume of
blood equal to the whole contents of the circulation.
   As regards I, the quantity of blood in an animal's body           does   not ad
mit, by any known method, of being accurately determined.             I am content
to take the modern rough estimate, that it amounts to one-tenth of its total
weight.     If any should consider this too little, and prefer the largest
estimate, viz. that in Valentin's   'Repertorium,' vol.iii. (1838), p. 281, where
it is given for   a rabbit as one  part in every 6'2 of the entire weight, he will
find the part of my argument which is based on transfusion to be weakened,
but not overthrown, while that which relies on cross-circulation is not
sensibly affected.
   As regards     2, the actual conditions    are exceedingly complex ; bnt we
may evade their difficulty      by adopting a limiting value.     It is clear that
when only a brief interval elapses before each unit of newly infused blood
is mixed with that already in circulation, the quality of the blood which, at
the moment of infusion into one of the cut ends of the artery or vein, is
flowing out of the other, will be more alienized than if the interval were
longer.     It follows that the blood of the two animals will intermix          more
slowly when the interval is brief than when it is long.        Now I propose to
adopt an extreme supposition,       and  to consider them to mix instantaneously.
The results     I   shall thereby obtain will necessarily be less favourable to
change than the reality, and will protect me from the charge of exaggera
ting the completeness of intermixture.
    As regards 3,    I estimate  the flow of blood through either carotid to be
such that the volume which passes through it in ten minutes equals the
whole volume of blood in the body. This is a liberal estimate ; but I could
afford to make it twice or even thrice as liberal, without prejudice to           my
conclusions.
    Upon the foregoing data the following Table has been constructed. The
formulas are : — Let the blood in the Silver-grey be called a, and let its
volume be V, and let the quantity u of alien blood be thrown in at each
injection, then the quantity of blood a remaining in the Silver-grey's circu
lation, after n injections,
                                    =t(i-t):
    If  the successive injections be numerous and small, so as to be equivalent
 to a continuous flow, then, after w of alien blood has passed in, the for
                          te
 mula becomes     V.e     V  .

     A   comparison of the numerical results from these two formulae shows
 that no sensible difference is made if (within practicable limits) few and large,
 or many and small, injections are made, the total quantity injected being
 the   same.
     In cross-circulation          the general formula is this : —           If V   be the volume
 of blood in the other rabbit, after to of alien blood has passed through
 either canula, the quantity of blood a remaining in the Silver-grey exceeds *

 also, when       V   is infinite, it gives the formula already mentioned for injec
 tion by a continuous flow of purely alien blood.

    In another list (Table         III.) I    give particulars of all the litters      I have
obtained from these rabbits, classified according to the operations which
the parents had previously undergone.
    I will now     summarize the results.          In the first     instance  I obtained five
does    (A, B, C, D, and         E)  and three bucks      (K, L,     and  M) which had un
dergone the operation which I call w, and which had in consequence about
J  of their blood alienized. I bred from these +, partly to see if I had
produced any effect by the little I had done, and chiefly to obtain a stock
of young rabbits which would                  be  born with      ^
                                                                     of alien gemmulea in
their veins, and which, when operated upon themselves, would produce
descendants       having nearly ] alienized blood (the exact proportion is
1  —
      (1
         —
            §)2=^J).        I obtained thirty young ones in six litters ; and they
were all true silver-greys, except, possibly, in one instance (out of the doe
A («) by the buck M (w)), where one, of a litter of five, had a white fore leg,
the white extending to above the knee-joint. This white leg gave me great
hopes that Pangenesis would turn out to be true, though it might easily be
accounted for by other causes ; for my stock were sickly (both those on
which     I  had not operated and those on which I had suffering severely
from a skin disease), and it was natural under those circumstances of ill
health that more white than usual should appear in the young.
    Having, then, had experience in transfusion, and feeling myself capable
of managing        a  more complicated operation without confusion, I began the
series which      I  call w.     I left my old lot of does untouched, but obtained
one new doe       (G(w)), which had undergone the last -operation, and three
bucks (K (u, w), M (u, to), N (u, w)) which had undergone both operations,
u and to. On endeavouring to breed from them, the result was unexpected,
they appeared to have become sterile.                  The bucks were as eager as pos
sible for the does ; but the latter proving indifferent,              I  was unable to testify
to their union having taken place ; so               I  left them m pairs, in the same
hutch, for periods of three days at a time.                  Attempts were made in this

    t I always   allowed the bucks to run for awhile with waste does before commencing
 the brceding-exporimonts,      that all old reproductive material might be got rid of.

    way, to breed from them in seven instances ; and five of them were utter
    failures.    One case was quite successful ; and that, fortunately, was of the
    same pair (A (w) and M (a, w)) which, under the u operation, had bred
    the white-footed young one. This time, the offspring (six in number)
    were pure silver-greys.     The last case was unfortunate.      The doe (E    (a))
    had   been once sterile to its partner (N (a, tc)), and she had been put again
   in   the same hutch with him for a short period, but was thought not to
   have taken him.       She was shortly afterwards submitted to the operation x.
   From this she had nearly recovered when she brought forth an aborted
   litter and died.    I was absent from town at the time ; but Mr. Fraser, who
   examined them, wrote to say he fully believed that some were pied ; if so,
   it  must have been under the influence of the cross-circulation.       But  I have
  little faith in the appearance of the skin of naked, immature rabbits        ; for  I
   have noticed that difference of transparency, and the colour of underlying
   tissues, give fallacious indications.
       My results thus far came to this, viz. that by injecting defibrinized blood
  I    had produced no other effect than temporary sterility.        If  the sterility
  were due to this cause alone, my results admitted of being interpreted in a
  sense favourable to Pangenesis, because       I   had deprived the rabbits of a
  large part of that very component of the blood on which the restoration of
  tissues depends, and therefore of that part in which, according to Pan
  genesis,    the reproductive elements might be expected to reside.           I had
  injected alien corpuscles but not alien gemmules.        The possible success of
 the white foot, in my first litters, was not contradicted by the absence of
  any thing of the sort in my second set, because the additional blood         I  had
  thrown in was completely defibrinized.       It was essential to the solution of
  the problem, that blood in its natural state should be injected ;           and    I
  thought the most convenient way of doing so was by establishing              cross-
 circulation between the carotids.        If the results were affirmative     to the
 truth of Pangenesis, then my first experiments would not be thrown           away ;
 for (supposing them        to be confirmed by larger experience) they would
 prove that the reproductive elements lay in the fibrine.             But if cross-
 circulation gave a negative reply, it would be clear that the white foot was
 an accident of no importance to the theory of Pangenesis, and that the
 sterility   need  not be ascribed to the loss of hereditary gemmules, but to
 abnormal health, due to defibrinization and perhaps to other causes also.
      My operations of cross-circulation (which I call x) put me in possession
 of three excellent Bilver-grey bucks, four excellent silver-grey does, and
 one doe whose operation was not successful enough for me to care to count
it. One of my x does (B) had already undergone the operation a, and I
had another of my old lot (C (a)), which          I left untouched.     There were
also three common rabbits, bucks, which were blood-mates to silver-greys,
and four common rabbits, does, also blood-mates of silver-greys.              From
this large stock I have bred eighty-eight rabbits in thirteen litters, and
in no single     case has there been any evidence   of alteration of breed.  There

                                   of   a
assures me they are liable to throw them, and, as a matter of fact, as I
have already stated, one of the does he sent me, did litter and throw one
a few days after she reached me.     The conclusion from this large series
of experiments is not to be avoided, that the doctriue of Pangenesis, pure
and simple, as I have interpreted      incorrect.

that, ifthe reproductive elements do  not  depend  on  the body  and blood
together, they must reside either in the solid structure of the gland,
whence they are set free by an ordinary process of growth, the blood
merely affording nutriment to that growth, or else that they reside in the
blood itself.  My experiments show that they are not independent resi
dents in the blood, in the way that Pangenesis asserts    but they prove
                                                                     ;

so rudimentary that we could only ascertain their existence by inference.
In this latter case, the transfused gemmules would have perished, just like
the blood-corpuscles, long before the period had elapsed when the animals
had recovered from the operations.
 I  trust that those who may verify my results will turn their attention
to the latter possibility, and will try to get the male rabbits to couple im
mediately, and on successive days, after they have been operated on. This
might be accomplished   there were does at hand ready to take them
                                   if                                                          ;
because   often happens that when the rabbits are released from the
               it
operating-table, they are little,   at all, dashed in their spirits
                                            if                      they play, ;
sniff about, are ready to fight, and,   have no doubt, to couple.

                                      this experiment succeeded,     would         it
partly confirm the very doubtful case of the pied young of the doe which
died after an operation of cross-circulation (which, however, further im
plies that though the ovum was detached,         was still possible for the

gradually waning powers of producing mongrel offspring.

     Oct. 19, 1870. —Silver-grey buck, O, out of doe A (u) by M (u), and
therefore own brother to the white-footed young one, a small rabbit, just
six months old. His blood-mate was a

fifth heavier than the silver-grey. I avoided unnecessary weighing, because
it frightens the animals, and tends to interfere with the final success. At

occasions, not liking to interfere overmuch with my fingers.                        I, however,

 nected. This            I   repeated several times ; there was still much trouble in
 maintaining         a   proper flow from silver to common grey, but common to
 silver was always good. The operation continued till lh 40ra ; then I dis
 connected ; and as the silver-grey had received too much, I let her bleed
 to 4 drachms.

 heavier than the silver-grey.               There was some trouble with her, as the
 carotid was abnormal, and three offshoots from it had to be tied before the

  got three minutes more.                My estimate at the close of the operation was

    made his well-known               experiments about the production of Himalayas
    (Proc.      Zool.   Soc.   1861).      They are liable to throw "Sandy Himalayas,"
    as   I  found myself, as Mr. Bartlett also found, and as Mr. Yipan informs
   me is the case.           I  distinguish this breed by asterisks (*).

  the operation, and five drachms of blood were lost between the rabbits ; so
  I   did not care to let the silver-grey bleed more.

 but little further success.               Ten drachms of blood was lost between the

                Description     of the method of performing the operations.
     It is essential to a fair chance of success that the operator should hare

cured at will iu the market ; and young ones arc so timid and tender that

they       are not fit to be operated on.            The next
                                                        point is an operating-
                                                                    essential
table, with ample and proper apparatus for holding the rabbits easily but
rigidly.   It is most improper to subject a helpless animal to an operation
without taking every precaution for its success, so as to minimize the ne
cessity for operating.   The chief hindrances to success are, entanglement
of instruments, or the breaking loose of blood-vessels, both owing to an un
expected start ; also an animal will struggle violently, and become terrified
if he is loosely held, hoping to get away, whilst if he is firmly secured he
lies            magnetized, without signs of fear or discomfort, and with
          as though
his pulse and breathing perfectly normal. I regret extremely that, although
I took pains to inquire, I did not at first hear of Czermak's recently devised
apparatus for holding the head.  I began by the old plan of putting the
animals in a bag and holding them, which was very unsatisfactory.   Then
I  devised a plan of my own, which was good, but inferior to   Czermak's,
and I therefore abstain from describing it. The latter, with recent modi
fications,       can   now be obtained at             Mr. Hawkesley's,          4 Blenheim   Street,
Bond Street, London, to whom, I should say, I have been greatly indebted
for the care and thought he gave to successive and very numerous modi
fications of my instruments (far more numerous than I care to describe).
A drawing of Czermak's apparatus will be found in the ' Berichte der
K.       Sachs. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig,' 1867, p. 212.
     For injections,   I used a five-drachm ebonite syringe, whose stem was
boldly graduated to drachms. The canula (to be inserted into the vein) was
screwed into a light stopcock.      This was
filled with water, which, so long as the cock
was closed,         did not run         out for want of            a
vent-hole.  When it was thrust in the vein
and the vein was tied round       held the     it,
                                                I

stopcock, drove out all air      allowing by
                                           few              a
drops of blood to fall into its mouth, then
pushed its nozzle firmly in, opened the cock
and began to inject, steadily and slowly, at
the rate of about one drachm in twenty
 seconds.     When the syringe was emptied,
I    turned the stopcock, withdrew     rapidly       it,
 filled it, emptied   and again filled
                           it            with warm water, and returning to
                                                       it
 the canula with the same precautions as before,  threw in about  drachm,
                                                                       I                |
 to wash the blood out of the canula and adjacent vein.        do not think       I
I  lost more than three (or perhaps four) rabbits by injecting air, although
 the removals and replacements of the syringe were very numerous, often
    ten times insingle operation of the w kind.

it was whipped up by the whisk F ; then poured into C, which consists of a
short funnel with muslin below, resting in the top of a glass measure ;
when the blood had strained through, the funnel and muslin were set on
the top of D, to get them out of the way and, at the same time, to keep
them warm for future use ; B is the thermometer ; E is a spill-case full of
water to contain the syringe.   In addition to these,     I required     a large slop-
pail, a jug of hot, and another of cold water.
   The sketch shows my latest outfit of basins and warm water for              inject
ing.    It   was not perfected until   Ihad nearly finished the experiments.
Scrupulous   cleanliness is requisite, and great orderliness ; for the hazard
lies, not in the performance of one difficult operation, but in making a
mistake in some one of a great many easy operations.        The course of an
operation was ns follows: — (1) secure the animal, (2) remove fur from
neck, (3) anaesthetics, (4) expose jugular, (5) cut a slit in it and let
the animal   bleed as much as he can easily bear, about six drachms,
(6) stop  the   flow with gentle pressure by spring forceps ; the animal
was then left for a minute while (7) Dr. Murie and Mr. Fraser divided the
throat of the supply-rabbit,     I catching the blood in    a   warmed basin       and
whipping it up, to defibrinize   it,

    At the   end   of all, the vein   was tied.   It   was, no doubt, the surest plan
to avoid  future hemorrhage, especially as the blood was defibrinized ;
but the rabbits were apt to suffer from phlebitis, and I lost some thereby.
  Owing to the extreme rapidity mid stiffness of the coagulation of
rabbit's blood, it is quite easy to estimate the quantity that may have
been spilt on the operating- table.  It has simply to be sponged into a
measuring-glass.

is difficult with these, because the smallest canula which can be used with
propriety can only just be forced into the largest of them.        It is no use
operating with small canula: ; in every case, a layer of fibrine is sure to
line the tube ; if the bore is small this layer chokes      while   it,
                                                                     layer of   a

canula  was pressed in (the shape of its mouth was the result of many
trials and modifications), and ligature was put on. In the diagram,

blood, and two canulee.     Thus, when the throats were             brought close toge
ther, to connect the arteries cross-wise, there were                no less than eight

separate   pieces  at work in a deep hollow, close     together, and attached to
delicate arteries, none of which could be permitted to twist or interfere
 with each other.       I append a reduced sketch of
one    of the two frameworks over which, as pre
 viously described, I suspended these instruments,
 with attached counterpoises, and so avoided all con
 fusion.     Both pair of canulae and two pair of
forceps are here represented ; they might be so
arranged ; but it is better to divide the instruments,
equally, between the two frames.
    For removing clogs from the canulae, I tried a
great many plans, none with as much success as I
could wish.      I have, however, been able to extract
clots from the artery itself, a good quarter of an
inch beyond the canulro, with a wire whose end had
been cut with a file into a delicate solid corkscrew.
 I washed out the Canute, before reconnecting, with a thin stream of water
 sent through the quill of a small bird, which I had fastened, by help of a
short India-rubber tube, to my syringe.
    The wounds require careful dressing, just like those of a man. The
rabbits bear the operations wonderfully well, and appear to surfer little or
no pain when the influence of the anaesthetics happens to have left them
temporarily sensible. They are often quite frisky when released, and
sometimes     look as though nothing whatever unusual had happened to
them, all through the time of their recovery.

       LL.D., F.R.S., &c. Received March 1, 1871.
    The action of nitric acid upon orcin has been studied by several chemist?,
but with comparatively negative results.         Schunck   f  in this manner ob
tained a red resinous substance, which by further treatment with the acid
was oxidized to oxalic acid ; and in 1864 DeLuynes         J  found that orcin dis
solved in cooled fuming nitric acid without evolution of nitrous fumes,
and that the addition of water precipitated a red colouring-matter ; the
long- continued action of the vapour of fuming nitric acid on powdered
orcin likewise produced a red dye apparently identical with the above.
These, however, were resinous uncrystallizable substances.
    Although under ordinary circumstances only resinous products are ob
tained by treating orcin with nitric acid, yet, when colourless orcin in fine

powder is gradually added to strong nitric acid cooled by a freezing-mix
ture, it dissolves with a pale brown coloration, but without the slightest
evolution of nitrous fumes.       If this solution be now slowly dropped into
concentrated sulphuric acid cooled to — 10° C, the mixture becomes yellow
and pasty, from the formation of nitro-orcin, which is but slightly soluble
in sulphuric acid. When this is poured into a considerable quantity of
cold water, the nitro-body separates as a bright yellow crystalline powder,
quite free from any admixture of resin.
    After numerous experiments the following          was  found to be the most
advantageous process for the preparation of nitro-orcin.               6 grms. of
colourless orcin were dissolved in 6 cub. centims. of boiling water, and when
the solutiou had cooled to about 50° C, it was added in small portions at a
time, and with constant stirring, to 40 cub. centims. of nitric acid, sp. gr.
 1-45, which was maintained at a temperature of about — 10° C. by immer
sion in a good freezing-mixture.         The solution, which was of a very pale
brown colour, was now added, in a similar manner, to 120 cub. centims. of
concentrated sulphuric acid, also maintained at — 10° C. The pasty mass,
after being allowed to stand for fifteen or twenty minutes in the freezing-
mixture, was poured into a beaker containing 300 cub. centims. water and
400 grms. ice ; the crude nitro-compound was then precipitated as a yellow
or orange-coloured granular powder. The orcin employed in the prepara
tion of this nitro-compound was colourless, having been purified by dis
tillation in vacuo.     The yield of crude nitro-orcin amounted to 150 per
cent, of the weight of the orcin.
    The crude nitro-orcin was collected, washed with a little cold water,
 and purified by one or two crystallizations from boiling water (40 parts).
 It was thus obtained in large yellow needles, which are readily soluble in
 hot water and but slightly in the cold ; the addition of a strong acid preci
 pitates almost the whole of the nitro-orcin from its cold aqueous solution.
 It is soluble in alcohol, very soluble in hot benzol, and crystallizes out in
 great part on cooling ; it is less soluble in ether, and but moderately so in
 bisulphide   of carbon.     It  dyes  the skin yellow, like picric acid, but is
 tasteless.   It volatilizes slightly at 100° C, melts at 162° C, and decom
 poses with slight explosion immediately afterwards.           When heated with
 concentrated sulphuric acid it dissolves, forming a deep yellow solution,
 which   deposits  crystals on cooling, and is immediately precipitated by
 water.    It dissolves in hot strong nitric acid with evolution of nitrous
 fumes and formation of oxalic acid.         Like picric acid, when treated with
 calcium hypochlorite it yields chloropicrin at the ordinary temperature.
 Its aqueous solutions are coloured dark brown by ferric chloride, and com
 pletely precipitated by lead subacetate.

   Sodium trinitro-orcinate. — This was obtained by adding trinitro-orcinic
acid to a strong solution of sodium hydrate or carbonate until nearly
neutralized, and purifying by recrystallization. It forms orange-coloured
microscopic needles, strongly resembling the potassium salt.
   Ammonium trinitro-orcinate was prepared by adding trinitro-orcinic acid

slightly soluble in hot alcohol ; and the solution forms a gelatinous mass
on cooling.
    Magnesium trinitro-orcinate is very soluble in cold water, but less so in

    Lead trinitro-orcinate. — This salt was prepared by dissolving the pure
trinitro-orcinic acid in 1000 parts of water strongly acidulated with acetic
acid, and adding a solution of lead acetate likewise strongly acidulated,
when the lead trinitro-orcinate   came out as a bright yellow crystalline pre

and difficult to reduce to powder.         It is almost insoluble in cold water,
slightly soluble in hot. It is solubie in hot acetic acid, from which it
crystallizes unaltered. It is insoluble in alcohol.        If alcoholic solutions of
trinitro-orcinic acid and lead acetate be mixed, the lead-salt is obtained as a
yellow amorphous precipitate.

    Methyl trinitro-orcinate    was prepared in a manner precisely similar to
that above described, substituting methylic for ethylic iodide.           Like the
ethyl compound, it forms bright yellow crystals,          which, however,    have a

    As it  seemed important to ascertain     if the homologues of orcin yielded
compounds similar to trinitro-orcin,      I  submitted resorcin to the action of
nitric and sulphuric acids in a manner precisely similar to that above de
scribed for the preparation of trinitro-orcin.
    The resorcin employed     was prepared from      Galbanum    by the excellent
method      given by its discoverers, HIasiwitz and Barth *, substituting,
however, sodium hydrate for potassium hydrate.           After purification it was
treated with nitric and sulphuric acids, employing the proportions and
methods detailed in the preparation of trinitro-orcin.       As might have been
expected, the yield of crude substance was larger, being 180 per cent. of the
resorcin employed.       It was collected, washed with cold water, and puri
fied by one or two recrystallizations from boiling water (30 parts).           It is
of a paler colour than the corresponding orcin compound, and crystallizes
in leafy plates. It melts at a higher temperature, viz. 1 75°-5 C, and is more
soluble than trinitro-orcin; 156 parts of water dissolve one of trinitro-
resorcin at 1 4° C, but the presence of even a small proportion of one
of the stronger acids renders it almost insoluble.         Dried  at 100°   it gave
the following results   :—

rhomboidal plates of a pale yellow colour.            It is much more soluble than
the corresponding trinitro-orcin compound.                The crystals contain three
equivalents of water of crystallization, which they do not lose at 100° C. ;
but when gently heated on platinum foil they assume an orange-red colour
from the loss of water of crystallization, and at a higher temperature ex
plode with extreme violence, perforating the foil. Both trinitro-orcinic and
resorcinic acids and their salts explode with far greater violence than picric

 1871.]               Mr.    J.  R. Hind on Transits of Venus.                        423
                                     April 20, 1871.
       Dr.   WILLIAM HUGGINS,                    Vice-President, in the Chair.
    The following communications            were read : —
I. " Note      on the circumstances of the Transits of Venus over the
       Sun's Disk in the years 2004 and 2012." By J. R. Hind,
       F.R.S. Received March 1, 1871.
    While preparations are being made by astronomers of various nations for
the observation of the approaching transit of Venus over the sun's disk in
December 1874, it may be of interest to know under what conditions the
pair of transits in the twenty-first century will take place. This conside
ration has induced me to make a careful calculation of the circumstances
of the transits in 2004 and 2012, from M. Leverrier's Tables of the Sun
and Planet, which at present are extremely accurate, and which, there can
be little doubt, will closely represent the phenomena to be witnessed in
those years. The calculations have been made entirely by myself, but
with every precaution to avoid error, and I have confidence in the results.
    The following are the resulting elements of the transit in 2004 : —

II.       "On   the Existence and Formation                           of Salts of Nitrous Oxide."
          By Edward  Divkrs, M.D. Communicated by Professor W.
          Odung, M.B., F.R.S. Received March 2, 1871.
     1.    Metallic sodium thrown                  on a solution       of   an        alkali nitrate    was found
by Schonbein* to reduce it to nitrite.    He contented himself, however, with
merely detecting the nitrite by the iodide and starch test.       By using the
sodium in the form of amalgam the complete reduction of the nitrate to nitrite
can be readily effected, and silver nitrite freely precipitated from the solu
tion by first neutralizing it with an acid and then adding silver nitrate.
   2. But so soon as nitrite is thus formed by the sodium, it itself begins to
suffer reduction, as well as the remaining nitrate, by the action of more
sodium.    This reduction of the nitrite is rendered evident by the efferves
cence which attends      the gas given off consisting of pure nitrous oxide.
                                 it,
If  excess of sodium amalgam be gradually added to the nitrate solution,
and its action moderated by keeping the vessel containing the mixture in                                              a
stream of cold water, the effervescence only becomes very lively when the
sodium added has nearly reached the proportion of two atoms to one of
the nitrate used.   When four atoms of sodium have been oxidized by the
solution, the further addition of   without effect no more effervescence
                                                    it   is                          ;

  4. After neutralizing the alkaline liquid by acetic acid, it gives a yellow,
pulverulent precipitate with silver nitrate. This precipitate, when thoroughly
washed from its saline mother liquor, is almost as insoluble in water as silver
chloride        ;   for hydrochloric          acid gives no immediate opalescence                   with   water
filtered through it. It is quite stable below 100° C, or a little lower than
this, and it may be washed with hot water without change.       It is also un
affected by          light, or by exposure to
                                      pure atmosphere, even when in contact

may be added in excess to the original alkaline liquid without removing its
property of being precipitated by silver salts. It is soluble in ammonia
and ammonium carbonate, from solution in either of which it can be again
thrown down by acetic acid, or by cautious neutralization                                    of the ammonia
by dilute nitric or sulphuric acid, or by the volatilization                                 of the ammonia.
Itis soluble in either dilute nitric or sulphuric acid, and without immediate
decomposition ; and it can be reprecipitated from its solution in either of
these acids by the cautious addition                     of ammonia or ammonium                   carbonate, or
by the free addition of sodium carbonate or sodium hydrate, in either of
which it is insoluble.   It is immediately oxidized by concentrated nitric
acid, copious red fumes being produced.    Moderately diluted nitric, sul
phuric, or hydrochloric acid decomposes     with the evolution of nitrogen,
                                                                  it,

respect resembling silver nitrite.   My experiments on silver nitrite, about
being published, show that nitric oxide may serve as carrier of atmospheric          a

this body by other salts of ammonium.

  so that there can he no doubt as to the composition             of the salt, although
 the silver comes out about one per           cent,  too low.    But in several of the
 samples     traces of brownish   or black    matters  were  detected  on solution ; and
 in the last preparation analyzed, the presence of a little moisture was de
 tected, an attempt to expel which in some of the unused salt by a stronger
 heat caused partial decomposition.
     6.  If   the product of ,the ultimate action of sodium on the nitrate be
 treated with acetic acid, as directed, until it is neutral to test-paper, it gives
 no precipitate with any metallic solution except that of silver, so far at
least as trial has yet been made.            But the precipitation of the silver-salt
leaves the solution of an acid reaction to litmus ; and even if the solution
before precipitation        be rendered a little alkaline      to litmus,  it will, after
precipitation, generally react slightly acid. The reason of this is clearly
that the sodium salt has a markedly alkaline reaction ; and this is further
shown to be the case by adding some of the washed silver-salt to a solu
tion of potassium or sodium chloride, which it at once renders alkaline in
reaction to litmus.         To obtain     a  solution of the salt free from acid or
caustic alkali, the original alkaline liquid is to be treated with acetic acid
in   successive quantities until it just ceases to yield a brown precipitate with
silver nitrate.      Such a solution will yield the yellow silver-salt with silver
nitrate as before, and also precipitates with the salts of most of the com
mon metals. Instead of acetic acid dilute nitric acid may be used in this
method for thus neutralizing         the caustic soda, with the same result as to

the alkalinity of the solution to test-paper, and its capability of being pre
cipitated by many metallic salts.
   7. The following reactions having as yet been only observed with a
solution thus obtained, it is possible that some          of them may not      be due
simply to the new acid : —
   Barium chloride gives no precipitate.
   Lead acetate gives a cream-white flocculent precipitate, which generally,
on standing, changes to a very dense, full yellow precipitate.              This pre
cipitate is unchanged by boiling in water or in its mother liquor, is soluble
in acetic and other acids, slowly, if at all, affected by ammonia or sodium
carbonate, and instantly decomposed by caustic soda.
   Mercuric chloride gives a cream-white flocculent precipitate.
   Mercurous     nitrate  gives a blackish-grey     precipitate,   not improbably a
mixture   of mercury and the mercuric salt.
   Cupric   sulphate, a yellowish       olive-green flocculent precipitate, soluble
in acids and ammonia, insoluble in caustic soda, and unaffected by boiling
in water or its mother liquor.         The colour of this precipitate closely re
sembles the colour of a copper-salt mixed with a nitrite.
   Zinc chloride gives a white precipitate.
   Manganese chloride gives a whitish precipitate.
   Nickel chloride gives a greenish, almost white precipitate.
   Cobalt nitrate gives no precipitate (?).
   Alum gives a white precipitate.
   Ferric chloride gives a slight reddish-brown precipitate.
   Ferrous sulphate gives a whitish precipitate, instantly darkening to
dirty blackish green and eventually reddish brown. On addition of ferric
chloride   effervescence   slowly commences ; and with ferrous sulphate the
same thing happens, but        still more slowly.    It is very probable that the
iron and aluminium precipitates are simply hydrates ; and if so, the action
of this salt in these cases closely resembles that of a carbonate.
   Silver nitrate   behaves as already described.
   Sodium chloride gives an alkaline solution with the silver-salt, which is
changed to chloride.
   Ammonium chloride gives the same result as sodium chloride, but the
solution at once evolves ammonia.            The existence, therefore, of the am
monium salt of the new acid is problematical.
   Potassium     permanganate gives the beautiful changes of colour from its
own violet, through purple, blue, and chrome-green, to manganate green,
and then a brown precipitate.         The exhibition of this series of colours is
more certain in the presence of a little caustic alkali.         In this reaction the
new salt resembles     a nitrite, but it is much more sensitive than this.
   Potassium iodide gives no reaction ; it does with nitrite.
   Iodine solution is decolorized immediately ; so that if a nitrite, not in
excess, is added to a solution       of the new salt, the addition of starch and
potassium iodide produces no coloration.

 1871.]                   Dr. Divers on Salts of Nitrous Oxide.                      429
      The solution acidified with acetic or hydrochloric acid still gives no re
 action with potassium iodide, decolorizes iodine solutions, and prevents
 the action of a nitrite on an iodide.
      The acidified solution gives no coloration with ferrous sulphate. In con
 tact with strong sulphuric acid, the mixture gives the coloration like a
 nitrate. As is well known, a nitrite, even without addition of acid, gives
  an immediate colour with ferrous sulphate.
     The acidified solution immediately decolorizes potassium permanganate.
     The acidified solution does not reduce potassium dichromate.
     The solution which has been neutralized with nitric acid instead of acetic
 acid will not do for the iron and iodine tests, as this behaves, so far as it
 has been tried, as though it contained a nitrite.
     The acidified acetic-acid solution, when heated, evolves nitrous oxide.
  Here again, therefore, the new salt is analogous to a carbonate, —
                                    2NOH=NaO + OHa.
     8.  When silver nitrite is heated until a greenish-yellow, semifused mass
 remains, and this is washed out with water, the residue consists of metallic
 silver and a little bright yellow matter, unaffected by light, soluble in am
 monia, and decomposed by boiling in water, as will be found described in
 my paper on the action of heat on silver nitrite already referred to. From
 the properties of this yellow substance, and from the manner in which it
 is formed, it is probable that it is the silver-salt of the new acid ; but in
 consequence of the small quantity of it obtainable, and of the admixture of
 this with metallic silver, a fuller examination of it has not been attempted.
 If it be this salt, its formation is analogous to that of silver nitrite by
 heating silver nitrate.
     9. There is also reason         for believing that Hess * came across this salt
 by first treating a solution of barium nitrate which had been deoxidized by
 heat with a solution of silver sulphate and evaporating the mixture, and
 then decomposing the crystals thus obtained by the action of water.
     10. In his 'Researches on Nitrous Oxide 'f, Sir Humphry Davy de
 scribed some experiments by whifti he obtained what appeared to him to
 be a combination        of nitrous oxide with potash. He prepared it by ex
posing a mixture of solid potassium hydrate and potassium sulphite to the
prolonged action of nitric oxide, dissolving the resulting product in water,
crystallizing     out the potassium sulphate formed, and then evaporating to
dryness. The mass thus obtained evolved when heated pure nitrous oxide,
amounting to about a fourth of its weight.
    Since then, however, Pelouze         J  has obtained, by a modification of Davy's
method, the alkali nitrosulphates ; and it seems to be now universally

430                   Dr. Divers on Salts of Nitrous Oxide.                   [Apr. 20,
believed that Davy must have in reality obtained a nitrosulphate and not a
simple salt of nitrous oxide.         I  have not yet had time to repeat Davy's
experiments myself, but I wish to point out one well-marked and essential
difference between the body obtained by Davy and Pelouze's nitrosulphate,
which is that, whereas the former body evolved pure nitrous oxide when
heated, the latter gives off nitric oxide ; and also that, according to
Davy's experiments, Pelouze's modification of the former's process would
be fatal to its success     in forming the salts of nitrous oxide.
    1 1.  There is some difficulty in selecting an appropriate name for the
new acid.        That of hyponitrous acid naturally suggests itself, as being
framed according to the usual method of naming a rising series of oxygen
acids, and as associating the new acid with the similarly constituted acid
 of chlorine ; but      I  feel that in naming the nitrous-oxide acid regard
 ought to be had to the possible existence of salts of nitric oxide, in which
 several chemists have believed, indeed, and on better evidence,           I think,  after
 a perusal   of  some  of their papers, than is generally supposed.          Now,   if the
 nitric-oxide    acid should be discovered, and       if the  term   "hyponitric" is to
 be retained for the acid       intermediate to the nitrous and nitric acids, the
 term "hyponitrous" would            belong by analogy to the nitric-oxide            acid
 rather than to the new acid.
    This difficulty, however, will vanish if the term hyponitric be allowed
 to fall out of use and that of nitroso-nitric, already adopted by several
 chemists, be generally substituted for it as the name of the nitrogen-per
 oxide acid       for then, the term      *'                "
               ;                             hyponitrous      being given to the new
 acid, there remains the compound term " hyponitroso-nitrous " for the
 nitric-oxide    acid, should this acid ever be obtained.
    There will thus be the following series of names            : —
                    Hyponitrous acid                              HNO
                    Hyponitroso-nitrous      acid                 Ha N2 03
                    Nitrous acid                                  HNO,
                    Nitroso-nitric acid                           Ha Na 0,
                    Nitric acid                   „               HNOa
     If, however, the    terras  "hyponitrous"      and    "hyponitric"     are to be re
 tained for the second        and fourth members of the           above series, the term
  " hydro-nitrosylic "     may serve    for the new acid, according to its consti
  tution  : —

  and its salts, and hope, before very long, to have the honour to make
  known the obtained results to the Society.

      When the      above paper was presented to the           Royal Society    I was   not

aware that the action of sodium amalgam upon alkali nitrites had been
recently investigated by M. Fremy* and M. Maumene't, neither of whom,
however, have anticipated me in the discovery of the new class of salts here
described.   The latter chemist finds that in one set of circumstances this
action gives rise to a body allied in composition and properties to oxyam
monia, and in another only to ammonia.     M. Fremy finds that it produces
oxyammonia,        nitrogen which escapes, and nitrous oxide which remains in
solution.
  So far as I have since been able to experiment, I have found that, by pro
ceeding in different ways, a very small and variable amount of oxyammonia,
or a substance resembling            it,
                                    often obtained along with the sodium
                                           is
hyponitrite, which    always formed in material quantity
                        is                                 and, further, that,
                                                                      ;
under the circumstances which favour the formation of oxyammonia, there
are also obtained, together with nitrous oxide, the products of the decom
position of oxyammonia by alkalies — nitrogen and ammonia (Lossen). The
presence of oxyammonia in the product of the action of sodium on sodium
nitrate affords    amore satisfactory explanation than that                 have given        of the
darkening      of the silver-salt after precipitation which           I I       have    sometimes
observed to occur.
   M. Fremy        states    that alkali  nitrites do not decompose potassium per
manganate   and
              ;        I    now find that my assumption to the contrary   an error,     is
based on an observation of considerable interest, which                    is   that some good
commercial nitrite          in my
                           possession slowly reduces the permanganate.                              I
have since ascertained  that other samples of sodium nitrite have no action
on the permanganate, and that the one which does react with         behaves             it
also with copper- and lead-salts in such  way as to render very probable the
                                                  a
presence in    of it minute quantity of my new salt. This formation of
                        a
hyponitrite, by heating sodium nitrate,        does really take place,
                                                    if  it                in                      is
accordance with Hess's observations of the action of heat on barium nitrate,
and with mine on silver nitrite. — E. D.

    Introduction. — About ten years ago, when engaged in the examination
 of some of the constituents of the rectified wood-naphtha of commerce,                                I
 observed that moist and freshly precipitated mercuric oxide was dissolved by
 the naphtha in the presence of potassium hydrate, and that the resulting
 alkaline solution possessed highly characteristic properties.  It was ascer-

 482                  Dr.  J. E. Reynolds on a New Group of                   [Apr. 20,
tained that the solution of mercuric oxide under the conditions mentioned
depended wholly on the presence of acetone in the crude wood- spirit ;
since pure acetone, when treated in the same way with diluted alkali and
mercuric oxide, afforded the same result, while the remaining constituents
of wood-naphtha failed to produce the reaction.
    Though obliged       at the time to rest content with       recording * the obser
vations above referred to, I have since been able to resume the inquiry.
 As the result,     I now venture to lay before the Society the following account
of some members of a series of ketone compounds containing mercury, and
 presenting all the characters of strongly marked colloid bodies, though
chemically intermediate between the two groups of colloids previously
 made known by the researches of the late Professor Graham.
    Acetone, being the most important member of the fatty ketone group,
is the body whose compound with mercury I have studied with chief atten
tion, and I may therefore describe in detail .the results obtained with it.
    1 . Colloid body obtained by uniting         Acetone with Mercuric Oxide. —
When solution of mercuric chloride is slowly added to a mixture of acetone
with dilute aqueous solution of potassium hydrate, the mercuric oxide first
precipitated is dissolved, with the production of a clear colourless liquid.
The addition of the mercurial solution can be continued until a white pre
 cipitate makes its appearance, the alkali being still in excess t.               If the
solution     be filtered at this point, an apparently opalescent, yellowish-
coloured liquid is obtained J.          If one portion of this alkaline solution be
boiled for a few minutes, a thick gelatinous mass suddenly separates, and
 further ebullition is rendered difficult, if not impossible.          Another portion
 of the liquid, when treated with        an acid in slight excess, gelatinizes ; and if
 the original solution be moderately strong, the vessel in which the experi
 ment is made may be inverted without risk of spilling its contents.
 Finally, if some of the mercuric solution be exposed over sulphuric acid
in vacuo, it leaves on partial evaporation a gelatinous mass, on the surface
of which latter crystals of potassium chloride soon make their appearance.
 When the desiccation is complete, a yellowish resinoid body is obtained,
together with a large quantity of very beautiful acicular crystals of the
chloride and a certain amount of potassic carbonate.
    The solution of mercuric oxide in potassium hydrate in presence of
acetone takes place as easily in alcoholic as in aqueous liquids.
    Preliminary experiments similar to the foregoing were sufficient to in-
   * Journal of   tho Royal Dublin Society, vol. iv. p. 114.
   t  The same result can be obtained when mercuric oxide is precipitated from any of
ita Baits, rapidly washed, and then digested with excess of acetono and potassium
hydrate. The best mode of operating, however, is that stated in the text.
   \ The different solutions exhibit a slight opalescence, not completely removable by
ordinary filtration.   This opalescence appears to be due to the very gradual separation,
at ordinary temperatures, of traces of the same anhydrous substance which is very
rapidly thrown down at a boiling heat.      In composition the latter body is identical
with the anhydride obtained b\ other methods and described further on.

 dicate that the chief compound produced in the reaction above referred to
 might be regarded as a colloid body.           I therefore took advantage of the
late Professor Graham's beautiful dialytic method * for effecting its puri
 fication from crystalloids, and have met with complete success.
    a. Preparation of Colloid Liquid. — As the preparation of a strong
 solution of the pure acetone mercuric compound suitable for dialysis is
attended with some difficulty,       I may now describe in detail the mode of
operating proved by experience to afford the most satisfactory results.
     Forty grammes of pure mercuric chloride are to be dissolved in about
 500 cub. centims. of hot water and the solution then allowed to cool, even
though crystals of the salt separate.         Twenty-nine grammes of potassium
hydrate are next dissolved in about 300 cub. centims. of water : 15-20 cub.
 centims. of acetone should now be placed in a capacious glass balloon, and
diluted with 250 cub. centims. of water.               The reaction is then to be
managed as follows : — About 150 cub. centims. of the alkaline solution
should be added to the aqueous acetone, and then 250 cub. centims. of
the mercuric chloride gradually poured in. Re-solution of the mercuric
oxide first thrown down proceeds slowly at the outset, if the mixture be
 not warmed.       After a time the oxide quickly redissolves, if the contents
 of the balloon   are briskly agitated.      When the first half of the mercuric
 solution has been added, the remaining 150 cub. centims. of potassium
 hydrate are to be cautiously poured in and the residual mercuric chloride
 then mixed, with the precautions already stated.
     The solution prepared in the manner described is usually turbid, but
 can be easily filtered clear from the small' amount of mechanically sus
 pended matter.         The filtrate should next be placed on a large hoop
 dialyzer, covered" as usual with carefully prepared parchment-paper, and
 the vessel floated on a considerable volume of distilled water.            After two
 days' action the diffusate will be found to contain a large quantity of potas
 sium chloride, some potassium hydrate, and but a very small amount of
 mercury.      The process of diffusion is to be continued, the diffusate being
 replaced by pure water twice each day, until the liquid on which the
 dialyzer floats no longer affords a cloud when treated with a solution of
 silver nitrate.    The process may then be considered terminated, and the
pure colloidal liquid obtained.        The contents of the dialyzer can be now
removed, and should be free from all odour of acetone. A few drops, when
 evaporated to dryness on platinum-foil and the residue ignited, should
 volatilize completely.
    The mode of operating just described affords the strongest colloidal
liquid that can be conveniently prepared directly in a pure state ; but
 where degree of concentration is of no importance, I find that it is better
 to dilute the alkaline mercurial solution with its own volume of pure water
just before dialyzing.
    The properties of the colloidal liquid will      be described most conveniently

 after the results of the analyses of the anhydrous mercuric compound se
 parable from it in the pure condition shall have been stated.
                                                        I
     b. Analyses of the Anhydrous Compound. — took a considerable volume
 of the very carefully prepared colloid liquid and divided it in two parts.
 One portion was very cautiously evaporated to dryness, and the resinoid
 residue very finely powdered and carefully dried.           The second portion was
 precipitated by the    addition of  dilute   acetic  acid, and the gelatinous pre
 cipitate washed rapidly and completely with the aid of Bunsen's filter-
 pump, and the residue dried.        The desiccation in each case was effected at
 first in vacuo over sulphuric acid, and finally on the water-bath.               The
 compound easily bears a temperature of 100° C.
     On analyzing both products,      I  found that they were practically identical
 in composition.     The residue of the evaporation of the colloid liquid con
 tained, as might be anticipated, a slightly greater proportion of mercury
 than the precipitate by dilute acid.        The circumstances under which the
 precipitate was produced, however, were such as to give most confidence in
 the purity of the product ;        I   have therefore employed this latter or
 similar preparations in many of the determinations, the results of which
 will be presently stated.
    The compound      was found to contain carbon, hydrogen, mercury, and
 oxygen,   and  to be  free from chlorine.       As the presence of the volatile
 metal introduced some difficulty in the determinations, it is necessary to
 describe the plan of analysis adopted.
    The mercury was in some cases obtained in the metallic            state by dis
tillation with quicklime ; but I much prefer to digest a weighed quantity
of the compound in a sealed tube with dilute hydrochloric acid, and, after
complete solution has taken place, to break the tube, precipitate the metal
from the contents by sulphuretted hydrogen, and weigh the mercury in
the usual way as sulphide.       The results are very satisfactory.
    The presence of a large proportion of mercury in the compound
rendered the accurate determination of carbon and hydrogen somewhat
difficult.   At the outset of this investigation     I arranged a very troublesome
process of analysis, similar to that employed by Messrs. Frankland and
Duppa in their analysis of mercuric el hide and its analogues.           In all later
combustions      I have adopted the very simple and satisfactory plan of
placing in the anterior part of the combustion-tube a layer of fifteen cen
timetres of any metal capable of easily amalgamating with mercury.
Gold- and silver-foil answer the purpose well : no doubt tin-foil might be
used   in the same way. It is scarcely necessary to add that the tempera
ture of the anterior part of the combustion-tube containing the gold or
silver was in each instance very carefully regulated.
    The following results were obtained : —

formula

    c. Properties of the Colloid Body, Hydrated and Anhydrous. — Ana
logy would lead us to conclude that the colloidal liquid obtained by
dialysis is a hydrate of the body represented by the above formula ; but
since    evaporation in vacuo is sufficient to remove the water completely,
the hydrate can possess but little stability.                Properly speaking, this hydrate
is no doubt a true liquid, and         as   such    is  miscible     with other liquids.
    The reaction of this hydrate is neutral to test-papers.
    When the aceto-mercuric hydrate contains five per cent, of the anhy
drous compound, it will, if quite pure, remain liquid for twelve or fourteen
days, toward the end of this time becoming gradually less fluid, until the
whole " sets" to a firm jelly.               The same result may be brought about
in a    few   seconds  by    the  addition       to the perfectly neutral liquid of very
minute quantities of auy of the following substances : — Hydrochloric,
acetic, nitric,    sulphuric (incompletely), chromic, oxalic, tartaric, or citric
acids ; by potassium, sodium, ammonium, barium, and calcium hydrates ;
by calcium chloride, mercuric chloride, sodium acetate, and other neutral
salts.     Contact with certain insoluble powders, such as calcium carbo
nate, and even alumina, induces pectization*.
    Elevation of temperature quickly determines the gelatination of the
liquid.      If containing five per cent, of the ketone compound, a very firm
jelly is produced on heating to 50° C. In one experiment, a quantity of
the liquid was taken and some bright, carefully cleaned copper-gauze
introduced.       The liquid did not pectize, nor did any trace of mercury
deposit on the copper, after standing for a day.                       The temperature of the
whole was then raised to 50° C. ; a transparent jelly was at once
produced, of such strength that the vessel in which it was contained could
   * In accordance with the nomenclature of Prof. Graham, we must call the liquid
colloid hydrate the "hydrosol" of the new compound, the gelatinous hydrate the
                                                                      "

 be inverted without        any risk of loss. This jelly, inclosing the bright
 copper-gauze, has remained in my possession for eight months without
 giving the slightest indications of a disposition to change.
    Small zoological specimens, when inclosed in the same way in a jelly of
 the mercuric     ketone compound,           were   found to keep well when carefully
 cleansed  before they were sealed up in the gelatinous envelope.
    By evaporation,     a  liquid containing eight per cent, of the ketone             com
pound was      obtained, but it pectized in a few jhours.               A two per      cent,
 hydrate retained    its  liquidity for several months.           Once   a jelly formed in
any of these liquids,        I  have not succeeded completely in reconverting it
to the liquid state by very cautious treatment with potassium hydrate, even
when aided by diffusion.
    The alcosol of the mercuric ketone compound was obtained by the
method adopted by Prof. Graham in preparing the corresponding silicic
alcoholate, — that is to say, by adding to a one per cent, hydrate an equal
volume of alcohol, and exposing the mixture over quicklime until most
of the water      was removed       :  the alcosol remained.         This liquid could    be
boiled without pectizing ; but           if  the ebullition  continued for some time, a
jelly was suddenly obtained.              This insoluble jelly corresponded to that
produced on heating the hydrate, or adding to it any of the bodies capa
ble of pectizing it ; in the former case alcohol, and in the latter water,
being associated or united with the mercuric ketone compound.
    It has now been shown that the new body is capable of affording a
hydrosol and hydrogel, an alcosol and alcogel; it must therefore be
regarded as a very strongly marked member of Prof. Graham's group of
these   colloids,   though chemically           differing   widely from     previously   de
scribed compounds of this class.
    "When   the colloid      hydrate      was   treated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
mercuric sulphide       was produced.            The liquid filtered from the sulphide
yielded acetone on distillation.              Digestion with dilute hydrochloric acid
likewise effected    the decomposition of the colloid body, mercuric chloride
being produced and acetone liberated.                 Nitric and sulphuric acids, when
dilute, did not decompose the compound with the same facility as hydro
chloric acid.     Treatment of the hydrosol with copper, zinc, or iron at or
dinary temperatures, failed        to effect the substitution     of either metal for the
mercury in the compound.               Prolonged contact with each of the two last-
mentioned metals caused pectization, the metal subsequently becoming
encrusted with a white substance.                 Heat produced the same result more
rapidly.
    When the anhydrous compound                  was cautiously heated, a quantity of
acetone distilled     over,    and,   as   the  temperature rose, empyreumatic pro
ducts and mercury were evolved. When the heat was suddenly applied,
much metallic mercury distilled over, and a minute quantity of a liquid,
having the odour of mercuric methide, was produced, together with car
bonic anhydride and other gaseous               bodies not particularly     examined.     If

mercuric methide be formed during the rapid decomposition of the mer
curic compound, the first step in the reaction by which it is produced
may be explained by the following equation : —
          [2CO(CH,)a,
                        3HgO]=2(£|»        } Hg)+Hg+2C01+O.
The mercuric methide produced in the first instance, probably at another
stage surfers nearly complete decomposition in presence of the oxygen
liberated at the outset of the reaction.
    d. Chemical nature of the Diaceto-mereuric       Hydrate. — In the pre
ceding section the properties of the colloid liquid and other bodies ob
tained by dialysis from the potass solution have been described ; but the
potassium hydrate used in the first instance may be replaced by solution
of sodium, barium, or     even calcium    hydrate, and yet the same ultimate
result arrived at. When sodium hydrate is employed, no material dif
ference is observed at any stage of the operations, but when barium
hydrate is substituted, re-solution of mercuric oxide in presence of acetone
is quickly effected with the aid of heat ; but this alkaline solution slowly
decomposes, yielding a white precipitate of the mercuric ketone com
pound, mixed with a little barium carbonate. This decomposition takes
place in closed vessels, and most rapidly when the solution has been
boiled in course of preparation, and when no excess of barium hydrate
has been employed beyond the amount absolutely required to secure the
retention of the mercuric compound in solution.
    Keeping in view the peculiar mode of generation          of the mercuric
ketone compound, its solubility in alkaline liquids at the time of its forma
tion, and insolubility without decomposition in acid solutions, its power of
uniting with water to form both liquid and gelatinous hydrates, and the
extremely close analogy of these in properties and relations to the
                                                                          " co-
silicic acids" of Prof. Graham, we are compelled to attribute to the new
hydrates very feeble acid functions.
    The alkaline solutions  above  referred to may therefore be regarded as
containing metallic salts of a peculiar acid, derived from the compound
((CH3)aCO)2Hg;)03, already described.         That these salts are, however,
even more easily decomposed than alkaline silicates is shown      : —
    1st. By the easy decomposition of the potassium salt by the process
of liquid diffusion.   The osmotic force alone is sufficient for this purpose,
the high diffusive energy of potassium hydrate enabling it to rapidly pass
through the dialytic septum, leaving behind the colloid acid in the liquid
state.   The analogous decomposition occurs somewhat less readily in the
case of potassium silicate.
    2nd. By the facility with which the new acid may be displaced from
the aqueous solutions of its potassium, sodium, or barium salts by so
feeble an agent as carbonic acid.      Solutions of alkaline silicates are well
known to decompose in the same manner, but less rapidly.

        a
tical proportion of pure acetone added, and excess of potassium hydrate.
Complete re-solution of the mercuric oxide was obtained as usual.    To
the alkaline liquid dilute hydrochloric acid was added, until  moderate            a
quantity of the white mercuric-acetone compound had been precipitated.
The whole was then filtered as clear as possible. The filtrate now contained,
in addition to potassium chloride resulting from the reaction, a certain
amount of the mercuric-acetone compound, held in solution by   minimum              a
of alkali.  In order to determine the ratio between the anhydride or
acid and potassium present in combination, 100 cub. centims. of this
solution were now taken, treated with excess of hydrochloric acid, and
the mercury precipitated as sulphide by means of sulphuretted hydrogen.
The pure mercuric sulphide obtained in this manner weighed 1*056
gramme:    this amount represents 1*1591 gramme of the anhydrous
mercuric-acetone compound, as calculated from the formula already found
for that body.

     A  solution  of the barium salt    wa3 now prepared with great care, the
 presence of excess of barium hydrate being guarded against by very cau
 tious manipulation in the first instance, and subsequent treatment with
 acetone and mercuric chloride, until the liquid ceased to dissolve more
 mercuric oxide. The acid treatment resorted to in the case of the potassium
 salt was found to be unsuitable in the present instance : 100 cub. centims.
 of the clear filtered liquid were taken, immediately after preparation of the
 solution, and treated with excess of hydrochloric acid until complete de
composition was effected ; the mercury was then precipitated as sulphide :
•5062 gramme was obtained; this amount represents '5555 gramme of
the anhydrous mercuric-acetone compound.
     100 cub. centims. were treated with a standard      acid :  33 cub. centims.
were required before an acid reaction was developed            ; this corresponds
to -2244 gramme of barium.
    We therefore find in    100 cub. centims.   of the solution of
                                                                   erm.

    When    these numbers are treated as before, we find that the ratio         of
anhydrous ketone compound to barium is 1 : 1 -84. As in the case of the
potassium salt, the chances of error are altogether in the direction of
under-estimating the barium and over-estimating the remaining consti
tuent of the salt ; the ratio 1 : 2 may therefore fairly be takeu as the
practical result of these determinations.
    Potassium being monovalent and barium divalent, it would appear that
the solutions above mentioned contained respectively the normal potas
sium and barium salts of an extremely feeble but yet distinctly marked
tc-trabasic acid. When any one of these liquids was evaporated to dryness in
vacuo over sulphuric acid,       a  resinoid mass    was  in  each case obtained,
from which metallic chloride       was removable    by water ; but since partial
decomposition appeared to take place during the process of evaporation
in each case, the now insoluble resinoid body, containing potassium, so
dium,    or barium, could not be regarded as a pure salt ; nor have         I suc
ceeded    in obtaining any other solid compound of this acid in a condition
suitable for analysis.
    When to a liquid containing the potassium salt of the acid a solution
of potassium hydrate, saturated with zinc hydrate, was added, a semi-
transparent gelatinous precipitate was obtained.         On washing with water
this substance quickly became basic.         Other attempts with various metals
did not afford better     results,  precipitates of variable composition being
obtained in each case.     It would appear, then, that only the most powerful
soluble metallic hydrates are capable of forcing the new acid to remain
in combination, and that even these alkaline salts are so feebly held
together, that decomposition attends the attempt to obtain them in the
solid state.

Since acetone        is,
                 according to my experience, invariably present in the wood-
spirit of commerce, the reaction with mercuric oxide in presence of potas
sium hydrate, already described, becomes virtually     test for the presence

quantities of the liquids being resorted to in every instance.
   2. Bodies containing Mercury and higher members of the Fatty Ketone
series. — Experience has proved that several ketones of the fatty series are
capable of uniting with mercuric oxide in the presence of alkali to form
compounds analogous to that obtained with acetone.         The higher ketones
being insoluble in water though soluble in alcohol,        was found to be ex

tremely  difficult to prepare the colloidal hydrates or hydrosols of the mer

compound contained in each belongs to the group of colloid bodies and not
to that of crystalloids.

   (a) With Propione. — The rectified product of the careful destructive
distillation of barium propionate was dissolved in alcohol and mercuric
chloride added excess of strong aqueous solution of potassium hydrate
                     ;

                             ;
dissolved      in
              great part. The liquid, filtered as clear as possible, was found

 1871.]        Mercurial Colloids and certain Fatty Ketones.                   441
to  be rich in mercury, and when treated with       excess of dilute acetic   acid,
gave a white gelatinous precipitate precisely analogous to that obtained
under similar circumstances from the potassium di-aceto-mercurate.
   The precipitate was found on analysis to contain 72*26 per cent, of mer
cury ; the formula requires 73* 1 7 per cent. On treatment with hydro
chloric acid, the precipitate afforded mercuric chloride and an oily liquid,
insoluble in water, possessing the odour of and characters attributed to
propione.
   (b) With Butyrone. — The rectified product of the destructive distilla
tion of calcium butyrate, when dissolved in alcohol and treated with mer
curic chloride and potassium hydrate, gave, on warming, a liquid similar
to that obtained with propione.      Like the latter, it afforded a white pre
cipitate on treatment with excess of dilute acetic acid.        The precipitate,
when carefully washed and dried, contained 69*1 and 69"27 per cent, of
mercury, the formula ((C,H7)aCO)Hg303 requiring 68 -4 9 per cent.              The
freshly prepared precipitate, when digested with excess of hydrochloric acid,
afforded mercuric chloride and a small quantity of a liquid insoluble in
water and recognizable as butyrone.
   The alkaline alcoholic solution of the butyrone mercuric compound was
diluted with its own volume of water, then filtered and carefully warmed
in order to slowly evaporate the alcohol as much as possible. When a
considerable portion of the latter had been removed in this way, the clear
residual liquid was placed on a dialyzer, and the attempt made to diffuse
away the crystalloids from the liquid.      After treatment for five days, most
of the chloride had diffused away, and a liquid was obtained which pec-
tized on heating to near the boiling-point and on the addition of a small
quantity of a mineral acid. The precipitate first formed by hydrochloric
acid was easily redissolved on heating with excess of the reagent, and the
odour of the ketone developed. The attempt to convert the alcosol of the
mercuric compound into the hydrosol had therefore been attended with
success.
    (c) With Valerone, obtained by purifying the product of the distillation
of calcium valerate previously mixed with one-sixth of its weight of quick
lime.    When this   was dissolved in alcohol   and the solution was rendered
alkaline by potassium hydrate and mercuric chloride dropped in, the mer*
curie oxide first precipitated was speedily redissolved ; but from the solution
no precipitate, was thrown down on addition of an acid previously mixed
with alcohol.    I have not obtained any compound from this alkaline        liquid
possessing distinctive properties.    It is not improbable that the valerone
mercuric compound, if formed, is more easily decomposed by acids than
the corresponding bodies obtained with other ketones ; hence the difficulty
of isolating it.

the attempt to combine the latter bodies with mercuric oxide. Though the
experiments in this direction cannot properly be detailed in this communi
cation,   I may be permitted to state that when the aldehyde of the ethyl
series was warmed with freshly precipitated         mercuric oxide   in  presence of
potassium hydrate, solution of the oxide did not take place, but the latter
gradually united with the aldehyde to form a white non-crystalline com
pound.      I have not obtained any colloid liquid in the course of my experi
 ments with this body.
    Certain other aldehydes of the same series were found to unite with
 mercuric oxide, yielding      soluble  compounds     easily decomposed by      weak
 acids.
    The investigation of the bodies produced in these reactions has been
 attended with peculiar difficulty, owing, on the one hand, to the facility
 with which several aldehydes are converted into resinoid products of va
 riable composition by contact with caustic alkali ; and, on the other, to
 the circumstance that an aldehyde can react either as the oxide of a di
 valent group (C„H2B"0), or as the hydride of a monovalent acid radical
 (CnTl2„_iO, H, or, for terms of the series above methylic aldehyde, we
 may write the formula CO(CnH2„_i) H). It may be added, that the well-
 known tendency of the aldehyde to yield polymeric compounds has in no
 degree lessened the uncertainty      attending the examination of the products
 of the action of mercuric oxide and alkali upon the members of the group.
    Leaving the statements      contained in the last section out of consideration
 for obvious   reasons,  I may   now be allowed to summarize the results of       the
 investigation detailed in the foregoing pages.       It has been   shown : —
     1st. That certain fatty ketones can be made to unite directly with mer
 curic oxide.
 .  2nd. That the resulting       compounds afford    a new group of colloid hy
 drates, analogous in properties to the silicic, albuminic,     and other hydrates
 already made known by the researches         of Professor Graham.

The Bakekian           Lecture was delivered         by   Charles William
         Siemens, F.R.S., D.C.L., " On the         Increase   of Electrical Re-
        sistance in Conductors with rise of Temperature, and its appli
        cation to the Measure of Ordinary and Furnace Temperatures j
        also on a simple    Method of measuring        Electrical Resistances."
        The followingo is an Abstract.
    The first part of this Paper treats of the question of the ratio of increase
of resistance in metallic conductors with increase of temperature.
    The investigations of Arndtson, Dr. Werner Siemens, and Dr. Matthies-
sen are limited to the range of temperatures between the freezing- and
boiling-points of water, and do not comprise platinum, which is the most
valuable metal for constructing pyrometric instruments.
    Several series of observations are given on different metals, including
platinum, copper, and iron, ranging from the freezing-point to 350° Cent. ;
another set of experiments being also given, extending the observations to
1000° Cent.      These results are planned on a diagram, showing a ratio of
increase which does not agree either with the former assumption of a uni
form progression, or with Dr. Matthiessen's formula, except between the
narrow limits of his actual observations, but which conforms itself to a
parabolic ratio, modified by two other coefficients, representing linear ex
pansion and an ultimate minimum resistance.
     In  assuming a dynamicariaw7according to which the electrical resistance
 of a conductor increases according to the velocity with which the atoms are
 moved by heat, a parabolic ratio of increase of resistance with increase of
  temperature follows ; and in adding to this the coefficients just mentioned,
 the resistance r for any temperature is expressed by the general formula
                                r=a Tl + /3T + r,
which is found to agree very closely both with the experimental data at
low temperatures supplied by Dr. Matthiesscn, and with the author's ex
perimental results, ranging up to 1000° Cent.        He admits, however, that
 further researches will be necessary to prove the limits of the applicability
 of the law of    increase expressed by this formula to conductors generally,
 especially when nearing their fusing-point.
     In the second part of this Paper it is shown that, in taking advantage of
 the circumstance that the electrical resistance of a metallic conductor in
  creases with nn increase  of temperature,   an instrument may be devised for
 measuring with great accuracy the temperature at distant or inaccessible
 places, including the interior of furnaces, where metallurgical or other
  smelting-operations arc carried on.

    In measuring temperatures not exceeding          100° Cent., the instrument   is
go  arranged that two similar coils are connected by a light cable containing
three insulated wires.        One of these coils, " the thermometer-coil," being
carefully protected against moisture, may be lowered into the sea, or buried
in the ground, or fixed at any elevated or inaccessible place whose tempe
rature has to be recorded from time to time ; while the other, or
                                                                             " com
parison-coil," is plunged into a test-bath, whose temperature is raised or
lowered by the addition of hot or cold water, or of refrigerated solutions,
until an electrical balance is established between the resistances of the two
 coils, as indicated by a galvanoscope, or by a differential voltameter, de
scribed in the third part of the paper, which balance implies an identity of
temperature at the two coils.             The temperature of the test-solution is
thereupon      measured    by  means   of  a delicate mercury thermometer, which
 at the same time tells the temperature at the distant place.
    By another arrangement the comparison-coil is dispensed with, and the
resistance of the thermometer-coil, which is a known quantity at zero tem-
parature, is measured by a differential voltameter, which forms the subject
 of the third part of the paper      ;  and the temperature corresponding to the
 indications of the instrument is found in          a table, prepared for this pur
 pose, in order to save all calculation.
    In  measuring furnace temperatures the platinum-wire constituting the
 pyrometer is wound upon a small cylinder of porcelain contained in a
 closed tube of iron or platinum, which is exposed to the heat to be mea
sured.     If   the heat does not exceed a full red heat, or, say, 1000° Cent.,
 the protected wire may be left permanently in the stove or furnace whose
temperature has to be recorded from time to time ; but in measuring tem
peratures exceeding 1000° Cent., the tube is only exposed during a mea
sured interval of, say, three minutes, to the heat, which time suffices for the
thin protecting casing and the wire immediately exposed to its heated sides
to acquire within a determinable limit the temperature to be measured, but
is not sufficient to soften the porcelain cylinder upon which the wire is
wound.       In this way temperatures exceeding the welding-point of iron,
and approaching the melting-point of platinum, can be measured by the
same    instrument by which slight variations at ordinary temperatures are
told.    A thermometric scale is thus obtained embracing without a break
 the entire range.
    The leading wires between the thermometric coil and the measuring in
 strument (which may be, under certain circumstances, several miles in length)
would exercise a considerable disturbing influence if this were not elimi
 nated by means of the third leading wire before mentioned, which is
common to both branches of the measuring instrument.
    Another source of error in the electrical pyrometer would arise through
 the porcelain cylinder upon which the wire is wound becoming conductive
 at very elevated temperatures ; but it is shown that the error arising through
 this source is not of serious import.

    The third part of the paper is descriptive of an instrument for measuring
 electrical resistance without the aid of a magnetic needle or of resistance
 scales.   It consists of two voltameter tubes fixed upon graduated scales,
 which are so connected that the current of a battery is divided between
 them, with one branch including a known and permanent resistance, and the
 other the unknown resistance to be measured. The resistance and pola
 rization being equal, and the battery being common to both circuits, these
 unstable elements are eliminated by balancing them from the circulation ;
and an expression is found for the unknown resistance X in terms of the
 known resistances     C and y of the voltameter, including the connecting-
wires, and   of the volumes V and    V of gases evolved in an arbitrary space
 of time within the tubes, viz. : —
                                X=4,(C+y)-y                                  (1)
Changes of atmospheric pressure affect both sides equally, and do not
therefore influence the results ; but a reading at the atmospheric pressure
is obtained at both sides by lowering the little supply-reservoir with dilute
acid to the level indicated in the corresponding tube. The upper ends of
the voltameter tubes are closed by small weighted levers provided with
cushions of India-rubber ; but after each observation these levers are raised,
and the supply-reservoirs moved so as to cause the escape of the gases until
the liquid within the tubes is again brought up to the zero-line of the scale,
when the instrument is ready for another observation.          A series of mea
surements are given of resistances varying from 1 to 10,000 units, showing
that the results agree within one-half per cent, with the independent
measurements obtained of the same resistances       by the Wheatstone method.
    The advantages claimed for the proposed instrument are, that it is not
influenced by magnetic disturbances or the ship's motion if used at sea,
that it can be used by persons not familiar with electrical testing, and that
it is of very simple construction.

I. " On     the Change    of Pressure and Volume produced by Chemical
        Combination."      By M. Berthelot. Communicated by Dr.
        Williamson.       Received   April 25, 1871.
     1. A singular question has arisen in the study of the gaseous com
binations, viz. can the pressure be diminished in consequence of a reac
tion, at the moment it is accomplished, at constant volume, without loss
of heat,   so that the phenomenon     of explosion   comes  from the excess of
atmospheric pressure upon the inner pressure of the system, instead of
coming from the inverse excess of the inner pressure ? The discussion of
this question, however special it appears at first sight, leads to general
 notions concerning chemical combination.

   2.   The pressure depends upon the temperature evolved, aud upon the
state of condensation of the products.        Let us determine this quantity.
   Let t be the temperature produced by the real reaction, this being
effected at a constant volume, admitting that the whole of the disengaged
heat was employed in warming the products.
   Let V be the sum'of the volumes of the gaseous bodies in the initial
system     at 0° and 0m760.
   At    the temperature t, the final system contains in general certain gaseous
bodies.
   Let    V   be the volume of these bodies, supposed to be brought, without
changing their state, to 0° and 0m"7G0.
    The relation ^r=fT expresses the condensation produced by the reaction.
                    V    K.
    When certain bodies, contained in the initial system at 0°, or in the final
system at t°, are in the solid or the liquid state, you can generally neglect
their volume in comparison with that of the gas, when the pressures are not
too considerable.      Let us calculate the pressure during the reaction which
takes place at a constant volume and at the temperature /, the initial
temperature and pressure being 0° and H.
    In admitting Marriotte's and Gay-Lussac's             laws, the pressure     will
become
                                  Hxi(i+«0;
it will   be greater than the   initial pressure  if 1 + at >K,  less if 1 +xt < K,
or equal    if 1 + xt=K. Let    us observe that t = — ,   Q being the quantity of
heat produced in the reaction, and         c being the mean specific heat     of the
products between 0° aud t°.
    Let us develope this solution.
    3. The pressure augments when the condensation is null, for instance
chlorine     and hydrogen,    K=l    ;  and especially when     there is dilatation
(combustion of acetylene by oxygen), t being always positive in         a direct and
rapid reaction between gaseous bodies.
    4. On the contrary, the pressure diminishes if K is very great — that is,
in the case of a system containing gaseous bodies transformed entirely into
products which are in the solid or liquid state at the temperature deve
 loped by the reaction.       This case is more rare than one would think at
first sight, because very few compounds subsist wholly at the high tempe
rature that would be developed by the integral union of their gaseous com
ponents.       Generally a portion of these remain free at the moment of the
reaction ; but in the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to
 estimate the pressure corresponding to effects so complex.
     It is necessary to consider that the present case must not be confounded
with the case in which the products formed in the gaseous state and at the
temperature of the reaction are liquefied or solidified under the influence

of a subsequent cooling; for instance, the formation of water from its ele
ments, or of chlorhydrate of ammonia from hydrochloric acid and am
monia, produce equally a diminution in the final pressure.
    5. In theory the most interesting case is that in which the initial and
final systems are wholly constituted of gaseous bodies, whose volume (cal
culated at 0° and 0m-/60) is more condensed in the final than in the initial
system.      But this condensation is always comprised within very narrow
limits, such as K = 4 (formation of arsenious acid by the elements),
K=3,      2, 1|, &c.  ;  so the fundamental condition
                          1+<3<K, orQ<273(K-l)c,
                               e
that determines     a   diminution  of pressure, should         be realized only  in very
exceptional cases and when the heat evolved by an integral reaction is very
little.
    One can ascertain it in making the calculation by means of the specific
heats at constant volume (deduced with ordinary coefficient from the
specific heats at constant pressure which M. Regnault has determined for
many bodies).        One can also make the calculation in a more general
manner, in admitting with Clausius that the specific heats at constant
volume have an identical value for the atomic weights of elements, that
this value is equal to 2, 4, the number found for H= 1, and that it does
not change from the fact of combination.                 W being the quantity of heat
produced in a reaction between gaseous                   bodies calculated for atomic
weights, and n the number of atoms in the reaction, the pressure will
diminish only if
                                  W< 655n      (K-l).
    It is easy to see that this condition is not fulfilled in the combinations
best known.       Calculating, either by means of this formula or hy means of
the preceding, I have not succeeded in discovering any example of diminu
tion of pressure among the numerous reactions                 I  have examined in this
present research.
    Besides, it is sufficient to make the calculation for the reaction supposed
integral, the conclusion being generally the same for the reaction supposed
incomplete, that is to say in the case of dissociation, as it would be easy to
prove.
    6.  Without further extending          this discussion,      I  believe that   a  new
general proposition relative to chemical combination can be deduced from
it.    It is known that every direct reaction which can be accomplished in
a very short time between gaseous bodies with formation of gaseous com
pounds, produces a disengagement of heat : this is true for all reactions
evolved by chemical forces alone, acting without help of any work done
by exterior forces*.        The new proposition is the following : —
    The   heat  produced in    a reaction of this sort, supposing it to be applied
    • This proposition is contained in a more general         one, which   I have given in
 '
   Annales de Chimio et Fhysique,' 4°"' s^rie, t. xviii.

exclusively and without any loss to warm the products, is such that an
augmentation of pressure always takes place at a constant volume, or,
what is the same thing, an augmentation of volume at a constant pressure.
  This proposition results not from any a priori deduction, but is verified
by the whole of facts known to this day.
   7. One may ask   if the change of volume, in which the gases keep the
whole heat produced by their mutual actions, is regulated by a simple law,
¦analogous to those that have been observed when the gaseous combinations
are brought   to the same temperature      j   nevertheless      it   does not appear to
be so.
   Let us compare the formation of the different hydracids by means of
their gaseous elements, which gives no change of volume when the gas is
reduced at 0° and 0m-/G0.
   The formation of chlorhydric gas, H CI, produces 23,900 calories ; the
formation of bromhydric gas, H Br, produces 13,400 calories; the for
mation of iodhydric gas, HI, produces 800 calories.   The specific heat of
these gases being. nearly the same under the same volume, it is clear that
the quantities of heat aforesaid cannot produce an augmentation of volumes
identical or proportional with simple numbers.

  My dear Sir, — In the last published Number of Proceedings of the
Royal Society*, there     are remarks bySir William Thomson on the pro
posed method for determining the locus of a ship's place at sea, by making
one observation of the sun's (or other body's) altitude, and founding, on
this, computations of longitude with two assumptions of latitude ; and there
are suggestions, with a specimen of tables, for solving the spherical tri
angles which occur in all similar nautical observations, on the principle of
drawing a perpendicular arc of great circle from one angle of a spherical
triangle upon the opposite side.
   In regard to this principle and the tables which may be used with                      it,

         In
         regard to the problem of the
                                            " locus," allow me to point out the
     geometrical circumstances of the case.    If, upon a celestial globe, an arc of
     small circle be swept with the sun's (or other body's) place for centre, and
     the observed zenith-distance for radius, the ship's zenith will be somewhere
     in that curve ; and              if,
                              with the pole for centre, arcs of parallels be swept
     with the two assumed colatitudes for radii, the intersection of these two curves
     with the first drawn curve will give the ship's zenith on the two assumptions                               ;
     and           within the celestial globe there be placed
           if if

     and     these zenith-points be radially projected upon the terrestrial globe,
     the terrestrial places of the ship on the two assumptions will be marked.
     But the practical application of this requires that the position of the ter
     restrial globe, or of the earth, be known in respect of rotation, — that                              is,   it
     requires that the Greenwich sidereal time, or solar time, be known         in                        ;

     the cable every day, and he had therefore       perfect chronometer.   a  But
     other ships have no such perfect chronometer     and though the direction of

     a locus, as determined above, may be sufficiently certain, yet its place upon
     the earth         will   be uncertain,   by  quantity depending on the uncertainty of

have been exactly what the Astronomer Royal here describes, but partly the
saving of trouble in numerical calculation, partly the exhibition, for each
separate    observation of altitude at a noted chronometer time, of precisely
what that observation give*, neither more nor less, which introduces at the
same time certain facilities for the determination of a ship's place by a
combination of two observations.           Of course the place so determined is
liable  to  an  error east or  west  corresponding to the unknown error of the
chronometer ; and doubtless, under ordinary circumstances, this forms the
principal error to which the determination of a ship's place is liable. This
remains precisely as it did before ; and it is hard to suppose that the mere
substitution of a graphical for a purely numerical process could lead a
navigator to forget that he is dependent upon his chronometer, though
perhaps      the general tone of Sir W. Thomson's paper might render an
explicit warning desirable, such as that which Mr. Airy supplies. — G. G.

  Carpenter, F.R.S., and Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S., obtained, off the
  Adventure Bank in the Mediterranean, many specimens of a coral which
  has very remarkable structures and affinities.           The species is described
  under the name of Guynia annulata, Dune.             The necessity of including it
  amongst the Rugosa and in the same family, the Cyathoxonidce, as            llaplo-

     Having this proof of the persistence of the rugose type from the
  Palaeozoic seas to the present, the affinities of some so-called anomalous
  genera of Midtertiary and Secondary deposits are critically examined.
  The Australian     tertiary genus Oonosmilia, three of whose species have
 strong structural resemblance with the Rugosa, is determined to be allied
  to the Stauridce, and especially to the Permian genus Polyccelia.              The
  Secondary   and Tertiary   genera with  hexameral,   octomeral, or tetrameral and
 decameral   septal arrangements are noticed, and the rugose characteristics
 of many lower Liassic and Miotic species are examined.
     The impossibility of maintaining the distinctness of the        Palaeozoic  and
 Neozoic coral-faunas is asserted ; and it is attempted to          be proved that
 whilst some rugose types have persisted, hexameral types have originated
 from others, and have occasionally reverted to the original tetrameral
 or octomeral types, and that the species of corals with the confused
 and irregular septal members so characteristic       of the lowest Neozoic strata
 descended   from those Rugosa which have an indefinite arrangement of the
 septa.
    The relation  between the Australian    Tertiary and recent faunas, and those
 of the later Palaeozoic and early Neozoic in Europe, is noticed, and also the
long-continued biological alliances between the coral-faunas of the two
 sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

    In  1825*, Professor Wohler published the analysis of a rare variety of
pyromorphite from Leadhills, which he describes as an aggregation of very
diminutive, orange-red hexagonal crystals, fixed on cerussite.            The nor
mal constituents of pyromorphite are mixed in them with small quantities
of iron and arsenic.      Professor Wohler having ascertained the existence of
vanadate of lead only five years later (1830), and the presence of partly

 chromium, partly vanadium in Russian specimens of pyromorphite having
 been stated,    it may be supposed that the red pyromorphite from Leadhills
 owes its characteristic coloration to one        of the two elements named before.
    An examination of       a great number       of cabinet specimens from Leadhills
 gave no satisfactory result.         I could not find any red pyromorphite, as de
 scribed by    Professor   Wohler,     on the specimens at my disposal, and must
 consequently leave unproved the above-stated supposition concerning the
 colouring-substance of red pyromorphite.               A cabinet specimen, dating
 from the years 1820-1825, gave me, however, the proof that the specimens
 of cerussite found at Leadhills during this period were not completely
free from an admixture of molybdenum and vanadium.                      I succeeded in
 finding out a specimen of crystallized
                                                " vanadine-molybdate of lead " from
 Leadhills so strikingly different in crystallographical and chemical cha
 racters from its nearest allies, wulfenite and descloizite, that I am authorized
 to consider it as the type of a new species, for which I propose the name
 of " eosite," alluding to its saturated aurora-red colour.
                        § 1.   Paraffeneiic relation* of Eosite.
  •
    The cabinet     specimen    on which    I have found    the crystals of eosite has
 been in possession of the Imperial Museum since 1828 ; it must therefore,
as remarked above, date from the years between 1820 and 1825. Its matrix,
abundantly      beset with     crystals of cerussite, is cellular, ochreous galena.
The crystals     of cerussite,  about 3-8 millimetres in size, bear the aspect of
plates, and are greenish yellow ; some of them completely fill up a deep
cavity in the ochreous matrix, others are scattered on the surface of the
specimen. This cerussite, as also some parts of the matrix, is in several
points covered with small moss-like aggregations of delicate and minute
acicular yellow crystals.         If such a fascicular aggregation is detached, and
the concentrically grouped acicular crystals taken away, their nucleus is
found to be a very small red crystal fixed on cerussite. "When examined
with   a powerful magnifying-lens, the specimen shows about twenty such
minute red crystals more or less scattered over the surface of the cerussite,
wrapped up, some of them entirely, others only by half, in the above-
described fine yellow acicular crystals.             As was subsequently proved by
precise determination, the minute red octahedra are eosite, and the yellow
acicular crystals are pyromorphite.
    These last crystals, being only |-1 millimetre in length and about -fc
millimetre in thickness, could only be determined by the aid of the micro
scope.
    Thev   are yellow, pellucid or transparent, very       brilliant, with light-yellow
streaks.      The microscope         shows   prismatic   planes without any distin
guishable terminal planes. As previously for my investigations on labra-
dorite,  I  used for the measurement of the angles of the prismatic planes
a vertical circle adapted above the horizontal table of the microscope,
whose axis bears the object to be measured beneath the microscope's focus               ;

the crystal fixed to the axis being duly adjusted and centred, the pro
ceedings go on as usual.    Two acicular crystals, duly adjusted, gave as
results:

from which the planes, including them, must be admitted to be those of                 a
regular hexagonal prism.
   Their colour, and even their streak, being light yellow, they may be
either mimesite or pyromorphite on vanadate of lead.     A drop of hydro
chloric acid poured on such            a crystal       makes   its tint vanish gradually
¦without    bringing   to view a dark-brown            nucleus (as is the case with vana
date  of lead), and finally produces a pseudomorph of white chloride of
lead.   By heating on charcoal, a brown globule with facetted surfaces is
produced ; traces of lead are obtained ; the smell of arsenic is very insignifi
cant.   Fusing with bisulphate of potash in a platinum spoon gives merely
a portion of white saline substance.     All these tests were indicative of
pyromorphite without any admixture of vanadium j the quantities submitted
to operation being, however, very minute, a definitive judgment is not to be
pronounced.
                        §   2.   Chemical Characters        of Eoslte.
  The crystals of this mineral are all below £ millim. in size, and difficult
to be freed from the acicular pyromorphite covering them.          They are
easily detached from the cerussite, on whose surface they are fixed.   Their
hardness lies between 3 and 4 (Mohs's scale).       When compressed, they
are crushed into small, irregular granules, showing slight traces of cleavage.
   The colour of the eosite is a saturated aurora-red, even deeper than that
of chromate of lead, and approaching the tint of realgar ; the red tint of
the wulfenite from Ruskberg (Banat) is less intense, that of the Phenix-
ville specimens has more of yellow in it ; the tints of dechenite and des-
cloizite vary between brownish carnation and greenish brown.
   The powder resulting from the friction on a hard surface is brownish
orange in eosite, somewhat darker than that from red chromate of lead.
   Like     the powder from chromate        of   lead, or from red wulfenite, that from
eosite       its colour and becomes white by contact with hydrochloric
           loses
acid.  This solution, diluted and spread over a glass plate, shows under
the microscope the formation of chloride of lead in white acicular crystals.

 intense.      Wulfenite,   even when used      in fragments ten times larger, loses
 its colour and becomes white in far shorter time.
     If a splinter of eosite is dissolved in a drop of slightly heated hydrochloric
 acid, the solution spread on a glass plate, some alcohol added to it, and
 the whole again heated to dryness*, a bluish deposit, somewhat verging
 into greenish grey, is obtained.            With respect to the quantity of eosite
 experimented upon, and to the extent of the deposit, its tint may be consi
 dered asof medium intensity; it is bordered on its margin byadelicate green,
 somewhat acicular precipitate.           Fragments of yellow wulfenite, vanadinite,
 or red chromate of lead, of equal size and treated in the same way, give
 different deposits on the glass plate, — wulfenite a deep blue one (on ac
 count of the formation of molybdate of molybdenum), vanadinite a yellowish
 or bluish-green one, and crocoite a feeble yellowish-green onef.                        The
 crystals   of  eosite being   of  scarce  occurrence   and   of  diminutive     size,   only
 few experiments could be made concerning the action of the blowpipe on
them.
     Eosite, when heated in         a glass tube, assumes a darker tint without
 decrepitating,    and, when    cooled, takes again its original colour.        A splinter
 of this mineral, mixed with three times its volume of bisulphate of potash
and fused on platinum-foil, gives under a glowing heat a transparent,
nearly colourless saline mass with a very slight light-yellow tint. During
its cooling, this mass becomes for a moment reddish brown, and, after
complete cooling, assumes         a  light orange-brown tint.
     Comparative experiments made with chromate, vanadate, and molybdate
of   lead, as also with binary mixtures of the powders of these three sub
stances, proved the colour of the eosite salt to approach very nearly the
tint of the saline mass obtained by fusing a mixture of two to three
parts of molybdate of lead and one part of vanadate of lead with bisul-
phate of potash.
     The substance obtained          by fusing eosite with bisulphate of potash,
brought      into   contact  with   water   in a platinum spoon, gives a solution
which, some tin-foil being added to it and the whole being brought to
ebullition    J, assumes  a faint greenish-blue tint.      A  second experiment gave
the same result, and proved the solution to give, when further evapo
rated, a yellowish-brown residuum — possibly caused by the presence of
     * It must be remarked that all these experiments have been made under the micro-
seopo, or, at leasts under a powerful magnifying-lens, bo that it was impossible to sepa
rate the chloride of lead from the solution containing molybdenum.
    t As M. Czudnowicz has stated (Poggendorflfs Ann. vol. en. p. 17), the action of
alcohol on the hydrochloric solution of vanadium gives rise to precipitates tinted between
blue or brown, according to the degree of oxidation.    I also obtained at first, by mixing
with alcohol a solution of vanadate of lead, precipitates changing from yellowish green
into brown, according to the degree of heat Tho exact and constant temperature for
the evaporation of alcohol was, however, soon ascertained by a series of experiments.
    X The splinters of eosite submitted to chemical action being scarcely      J  inillim. in
size, tho chloride of lead could not be isolated.

vanadinite a light yellowish-green, and chromate of lead a light yellowish
grey of the saline solution heated in contact with tin-foil.
    It would be desirable to ascertain experimentally the presence of other
metals besides lead, were not the scarcity of the material an obstacle to
any further experiments besides those of absolute necessity.
    Considering the whole of the experiments above described, the way
in which eosite is acted upon by heating in a glass tube, by hydrochloric
acid, alcohol, and bisulphate of potash, proves this mineral to be essen
tially a vanado-molybdate of lead ; possibly with an excess of molybdenum,
as it may be supposed from the colorations caused by chemical action, the
presence of an undoubtedly minute quantity of chromium being concealed
by the chemical action of the prevalent constituents*.
    The investigations here detailed having ascertained the presence of lead,
molybdenum, and vanadic acid in eosite, it is still to be proved that the
chemical actions of vanadate and molybdate of lead are essentially different
from those manifested by eosite, and that consequently this mineral is to
be identified neither with the red varieties of wulfenite actually known, nor
with the crystals of dechenite, vanadinite, or descloizite.
             §  3.  Chemical Properties     of the Chromo-Wulfenites.
    The late Professor H. Rose (Poggendorff's Ann. vol. xlvi. p. 639) is
known to have investigated the red varieties of wulfenite from Re'zb&nya
(Banat) and Siberia, and to have ascertained the presence of chromium in
them.     I  have before me cabinet specimens from Rgzbanya, Ruskberg
(Banat), and Phenixville, which I shall comprehend here under the general
denomination of " chromo-wulfenites."             The specimens from Rezbanya
being rather yellowish than pure red, I must confine my investigations to
those from Ruskberg and Phenixville.
   The matrix of the Ruskberg pyromorphite is cellular quartzf and
galena.     A good number of rather bright, deep-red octahedral crystals of
wulfenite, 1-2 millims. in size, are fixed at the surface of the pyromorphite.
    The crystals of Phenixville are notably larger (2-4 millims.), and con
creted into a crust on the surface      of the matrix (quartz and pyromorphite).
Although apparently of       even surface, these crystals show merely a peculiar
wax-like brightness.
    The red of eosite is deeper than that of croco'ite ; it is somewhat more
intense than that of the Ruskberg chromo-wulfenite, and less mixed with
yellow than in the Phenixville specimens.               The streak is browner in
    * The existence of vanadium, as accidentally entering into the composition of the
genuine  wulfenites, was ascertained by Prof. Wohler on the occasion of his experiments
concerning  the  production of molybdic acid by the treatment of wulfenites (see Liebig
and Kopp, Ann. d. Chem. und Pharm. voL cii. p. 383).

of   those from Berezowsk are quite identical       ; the powder of the Phenixville
crystals is light orange, verging into sulphur-yellow.
   The Ruskberg and Phenixville chromo-wulfenites, treated with hydro
chloric acid in the way above described, both leave a deep-blue precipitate
with a yellowish-green margin.       Fused with bisulphate of potash in a
platinum spoon, they both give a saline compound, becoming very faintly
yellowish green after cooling.     In the beginning of fusion a brownish-
purple tint appeared, especially on the Phenixville crystals.   This circum
stance, not remarked  in eosite or  vanadate of lead, confirms the fact ascer
tained by Prof. Rose, of chromium being a prevailing component of the red
wulfenites of the Banat, with which, according to my observations,   rank            I
also the yellowesh-red wulfenites from Phenixville.    According to Mr.
Smith, these last contain vanadium ; however, the specimen before me,
when fused with bisulphate of potash, would certainly have manifested the
presence of this metal had it been a prevailing constituent, as chromium
really is.      At all   events, the red wulfenites       may possibly contain a certain
proportion of vanadium, as may be expected with regard to nearly all wulfe
nites in consequenoe of Prof. Wohler's statements.

   could not detach any particle of the small group of crystals at my disposal
   for the purpose of chemical investigation, being thus obliged to confine
   it to two varieties of vanadinite from Kappel, and to a specimen of de-
   chenite.     On two specimens of vanadinite from Kappel, vanadinite appears
   in the form of crystals intimately connected into a crust, the single crystals
   not exceeding the size of
                                 \-\  millim. On one specimen (variety A), the
   greater number of the larger crystals is of a dark greenish-brown colour
   (fluorescence-colour?), and without translucidity ; the smaller ones are
  reddish brown and translucid ; the streak is brownish orange.                     This
   variety agrees, in all its external characters, with the specimen of Peruvian
  descloizite now before me ; the crystals of it are reddish to greenish brown,
  translucid, and their streak is brownish orange*.
       The crystals of the second specimen (variety B) form a thin crust over
  limestone ; they arc £-1 millim. in size, rather translucid, of lighter
  carnation tint, and less bright than those of variety A.              The crystals of
  variety   A show    a vivid metallic brightness, while       the light carnation ones
  of variety B scarcely offer a faint vitreous brightness, very easily altered
  by contact with moist air ; even the moisture contained in the breath
  is sufficient to produce a superficial decomposition of the crystals of
  variety B.       Their brightness is immediately tarnished, and in a few
  minutes very diminutive greyish-white globules cover, like Mucedinese,
  the surface of the crystal.         Some time after, these globules assume a
  slight yellowish colour, but spread no further over the specimen if it is
  kept in dry air.         The supposition of this alteration being caused by
  the presence of arsenic is contradicted by the results of subsequent
  investigation ; proving arsenic, if it exists at all, to exist in such dimi
  nutive proportion that visible marks of its presence could not be obtained
  by heating the mineral on charcoal or in a glass tubef.                Notwithstand
 ing" the differences detailed above the actions of hydrochloric                acid, of
  alcohol, and of bisulphatc of potash give evidence of the notable difference
  between eosite, descloizite, and vanadinite, and of the nearly absolute identity
  of the two varieties of vanadinite from Kappel.
       Small splinters of both these varieties, moistened with hydrochloric acid
  on a glass     plate, become   yellowish grey on their margins, the internal
  portion assuming a dark reddish-brown tint.                   Under the protracted
  action of the acid this nucleus becomes darker and lessens in size, till at
 last it disappears, leaving a portion of uniformly greyish-white substance.
The nucleus of the carnation variety B shows a                  somewhat lighter tint
 at first; this difference, however, vanishes more               and more under the
 lengthened action of acid ; alcohol added to the               cold solution  of both
varieties causes the separation of a yellowish-green             gelatinous substance,

  These alterations are common to both varieties, as also those produced
by fusion with bisulphate of potash. The saline substance thus obtained
is yellow during fusion     ;becomes reddish during cooling, and deep

reddish orange after complete refrigeration. This last coloration may ex
ceed two or three times in intensity the coloration obtained by treating
eosite with bisulphate    of potash.
   These experiments, merely tried with some few minute fragments,
although any thing but decisive, are sufficient for ascertaining the difference
between eosite and the vanadates of lead.
     As the dark variety (A)        Peruvian eosite, the light variety (B)
                                resembles

                   is
surface than on the recent fracture.     The cabinet specimen before me
shows isolated crusts, transversely concreted, with globular external sur
face, offering blackberry-like aspect.
               a                            fracture shows these crusts to

be concentric agglomerations         of minute crystals   (1   millim. in size), exter
nally exhibiting only one or two of their planes.  Isolated margins may
be found by careful inquiry, but    could not succeed in obtaining any
                                        I
measurable angle. The crystalline crust includes   number of spheroidal

cavities (similar to those of pisolite), around which the aggregations of
crystallized dechenite are concentrically disposed. Greenish pyromorphite
appears on the inferior surface of the specimen in question.

     The action of hydrochloric acid and bisulphate of potash                 is   nearly the
same with that exercised on vanadinite, as already detailed.
     Asplinter moistened with hydrochloric acid shows    yellow  a             margin and
a  darker nucleus, in which the vanadium         concentrated.

of this nucleus, instead of being very intensely brownish red,            is       of   a   rather
darker brown than the unaltered mineral.      The action of the acid, mani
fested  by the progressive darkening and lessening of the nucleus,     how              is,
ever, less prompt and less evident than when vanadinite    acted upon, and
                                                                     is
resembles rather the alterations undergone by eosite.   The difference lies,
however, in the yellowish coloration of the solution around the crystal
lying on the glass plate. Alcohol gives rise to the secretion of gelatinous   a
yellowish -green liquid, which, evaporated          by
                                               heat, assumes    fine green or

 greyish-green solution.
    The analogy between the vanadate of lead from Schlettenbach (deche-
 nite) and the vanadate from 'Windisch-Kappel (vanadinite) goes still beyond
 their chemical characters.       I submitted both these minerals to the action
 of the blowpipe, in order to find out, independently of my comparative
 studies concerning eosite, the cause of the prompt decomposition of the
 cabinet specimens from both these localities.
    A   splinter  of dechenite from Schlettenbach,       heated in a glass tube,
 emits, previously to its melting, a greenish-white vapour, not condensing
into water drops nor into any other deposit upon the cooler portions of.
the tube.      The presence of arsenic is manifested neither by its charac
teristic smell nor by any specular sublimate.         The mineral takes a darker
tint when heated, and assumes again its original tint by cooling. It melts
in the glass tube, without previous decrepitation, into a brownish-yellow
substance.       Heated on charcoal, dechenite melts easily, and with ebullition,
into a hollow dark steel-brown globule, giving at the same time a slight
orange aureola and a whitish slag, including metallic granules.              Fusing
with soda gives rise to a yellowish slag, including granules of metallic lead,
and to graphitic vanadium imbedded in the charcoal.              The slag imbibed
with cobalt-solution     and heated to redness, assumes a dirty greenish tint
 and is surrounded by a greenish-yellow aureola, thus betraying the presence
 of a rather notable quantity of zinc, not mentioned in M. Bergemarin's
account of his analysis of dechenite.
    Among the vanadinites from Kappel, only the carnation variety B seems
 to contain a notable proportion of zinc. Its tint darkens transitorily during
 heating, it emits a faint vapour (of water) when heated in a glass tube,
 without manifesting the presence of arsenic, and melts on charcoal into a
 dark greyish-brown, steel-bright globule, proving hollow when the flame
 of the blowpipe touches it. A notable aureola of oxidated lead appears,
 together with a small quantity of a dark slag, including globules of lead
 and graphitic vanadium, and assuming a green tint in contact with nitrate
of cobalt.
•
    The darker variety    A   exhibits the same phenomena when heated in the
glass tube or by the blowpipe-flame, only the remaining slag is dark
 coloured, and only in one case among repeated experiments could I perceive
 on it some faint traces of green coloration.          Possibly this variety may
 contain  but  a  small proportion    of zinc, as  M. Damour    has found only 2\
per cent, of this metal in the Peruvian descloizite.
    The results of the before-detailed investigations, leaving out of account
at present the subsequent crystallographical facts, may be resumed as
follows : — Of both' the varieties of vanadinite from Kappel, the darker one
(A) contains but a small proportion of zinc, and may be assimilated' to
the Peruvian descloizite    ;  the lighter   one  (B) is far richer in this   metalt

Notwithstanding    the prisms with an angle of 90° 10' being proper to
several prismatic minerals, the slight difference obtained in the present
case may be ascribed to an error of observation, owing to the exiguity and
the curved surface of the planes, and eosite may be safely ranked among
the pyramidal system, with the axial proportion

    The pyramid of eosite could therefore be considered as representative of a
 the pyramid 778 of wulfenite, and the crystals of eosite to be merely   new             a
 form of the crystallographical form of the last-named mineral.      Setting
 aside the chemical differences,    number of crystallographical characters
                                           a
 may be alleged against the identity of these two minerals.  All the crystals
 of eosite carefully examined by me show only one dominant pyramid,
 without  any secondary pyramidal plane.        The difference between the
angles of the pyramids of eosite and wulfenite amounts to only 3°. It would
have been too slight for admitting, with any degree of probability, that the
secondary pyramid (778), having grown out into principal plaue, has com
                                                                  a
pletely superseded the original principal pyramid, had not an alteration in
the chemical constitution of the substance been attended by an altered
arrangement of the atoms entering into the composition of the crystalline
molecule.
          §   6.   Crystallographical forms of Descloizite and Vanadinite.
   The similarity of the pyramidal angles of eosite and Peruvian descloizite
(the second one, as stated      M. Des Cloizeaux) led me at first to suppose
                                      by
the existence of similar forms among the crystals of the carnation variety
B  of vanadite or of dechenite.
   The crystalline agglomerations of dechenite are so confused that      was            it
    *
    I      alluded, number of years ago, to the necessity of beginning any crystallogenetic
                     a
theory with distributing the molecules of the elements constituting a combination ac
cording to the three directions of space, which thus          differentiated in the required
                                                             is
way.      In the case here in question the subsequently acceding substance (vanadium)
seems to hnve assumed its direction according to the principal axis, the molecules of
wulfenite having kept meanwhile their original direction along the secondary axis; and
this supposition could, indeed, account for the successive transition of form from wulf
enite into descloizite.     However, such investigations could lead to any real, not merely
apparent,     success  only under condition of not being confined to the parameter of the
crystals,   but  also founded  on the molecular values of the constituting elements.
   These ideas of mine, and the calculations of crystalline forms from the molecular
values of the elements founded on them, have been thoroughly discussed in several
of my publications.

isolated lateral angles, some of them offering an angle of about 90°, are

      As to the form of crystals, the variety B of vanadinite from Kappel bears
  some resemblance with these aggregations of dechenite.                       Some few solid

      All these numbers are in perfect concordance with those ascertained                   by
  M. Des Cloizeaux        on the Peruvian descloizite;          these are:   —

      These results prove thus the absolute identity of the forms of Peruvian
   descloizite with those of both varieties of vanadinite from Kappel, probably
   also with those of dechenite, all of them discrepant from the characteristic
   forms of eosite.      These investigations throw likewise some light on the
  indices of the planes observed on descloizite.
     M. Des Cloizeaux has observed the three planes m b\ and ef , whose indices
   arc, (1 1 0), (I 1 1), and (2 0 3).        M. Des Cloizeaux expressly states that
   he could not find out from these data any isomorphism between this form
  and that of any other lead salt.         I can, however, in no way explain how so
  eminent a mineralogist came to omit comparing the parameter of anglesite
  with that of descloizite, as be did with the parameter of cerussite.

  Such     a comparison proves immediately the isomorphism of both these

   These notations and symbols            I   intend to adopt in future.   This disposi
tion equalizes the terminal angles            of eosite with those of descloizite, — [c y]
of descloizite being nearly equivalent to [cp\ of eosite.
   This isomorphism of anglesite (PbOS03) with descloizite (2PbO,V03
according to M. Damour) is only to be accounted for by granting to M.
Damour's analysis less importance than its author's name allows to claim,
and by admitting descloizite, vanadinite, and dechenite to be merely mono-
vanadates.  Thus another argument for separating these three minerals be
comes untenable         ;   the only distinctive character still remaining is the greater
or lesser proportion of zinc contained in them.
          §7- Crystallographicalform of Ike Chromo-Wulfenites.
   Prof. H. Rose, in his above-quoted investigation of the chromo-wulfenites,
 has given the measures  of angles of the variety from Beresowsk, differing
 but slightly from the pyramidal angles generally admitted.      I intend in
 the present paper to ascertain the angles of the chromo-wulfenites from
 Ruskberg and Phenixville, in order to state the changes arising from the ac
 cession of chromium to the constituting elements.   The nature of the planes
 is,   however, such that the measurements               offer differences   of nearly   ^°,   the
 averages from even          a   greater number of observations becoming thus rather
objectionable.

 des Mineralreiches,' under the article " Anglesite."     The isomorphism of descloizite
and anglesite appears in the similarity of forms, as well as in the equality of angles,
the vanadinite from Eappel resembling the anglesite from Siegen, as the Peruvian
descloizite   similar to the anglesite from Wolfach.

      The crystals of chromo-wulfenite from Ruskberg are 1-2 millimetres in
  size.  Most of them are quadrilateral pyramids, formed by the planes e( I 0 1);
  in some of them the pyramid is truncated by the terminal plane c(0 0 1).
  The planes are convex. My measurements gave : —

     I  did not succeed     in finding in the crystals from Phenixville the form
  alleged by    Prof.   Dana    (Mineralogy,       1868).    Those before me exhibit
  the pyramid n, common to all wulfenites, assuming a tabular shape by the
  development of the truncating terminal plane c (0 0 1).                  Their surface is
  opaque, rough, and curved, thus manifesting, as it were, the resistance op
 posed to regular development of the fundamental form, by the accession
 of heterogeneous substances.            One of these crystals offered, besides the
 planes (0 1)

     As the results of measurements show, this crystallographical revision of
 chromo-wulfenites afforded no data for ascertaining the action of chromium
 on the molybdate of lead ; they, however, confirmed the fact that the cha
 racteristic forms of eosite are wanting in the red varieties of wulfenitc.

     Asa perusal of the last paragraph, treating of           the morphological proper
 ties, will prove, these properties        run  parallel  to the  chemical characters of
 the minerals here in question.              The results obtained may be concisely
enounced thus     :—
    The crystalline form of         eosite    differs from     those of descloizite and
wulfenite, having the terminal lateral angles             of descloizite united with the
crystallographical system of wulfenite.
    Eosite is a  vanado-molybdate of lead.
    The red  varieties  of wulfenite hare an admixture of chromium, but are not
crystallographically different from the other varieties.
    Descloizite is isomorphous with anglesite ; thus the results of the analysis
of descloizite seem to be questionable.
    The dark variety of vanadinite (A) from Kappel is identical with Peruvian
descloizite ; the light variety (B) from the same locality is nearly identical
in chemical characters with the dechenite of Schlettenbach and, as to the
form of its crystals, with descloizite.

       April   1,  1871.
                                          (Abstract.)
    The results obtained from the inquiry which forms the subject of the
 paper are as follows : —
    First. That blood is strictly a colloid fluid.
    Second. That although blood be strictly a colloid, it contains invariably
a  small proportion of diffusible constituents amounting to nearly 7'3 grins.
in 1000 of blood, and 9-25 grms. in an equal volume of serum, these
proportions diffusing out of blood in twenty-four hours.
    Third. That the proportion of chlorine contained in blood has a remark
able degree     of fixity, a fact which had been foreseen by Liebig, and may be
considered as amounting to 3 parts (the correct mean being 3-0(i) in 1000,
the proportion of chlorine in a bulk of serum equal to that occupied by
 1000 grms. of blood being 3*45, and therefore higher than in blood,
and moreover that one of the objects of the chlorides, and other diffusible
constituents of blood, appears to be to preserve the fluid state of the blood.
The substances which yield an alkaline reaction to blood are mostly crys
talloid ; their being retained in the blood while circulating through the
body must be of the highest importance in connexion with the phenomena
 of oxidation constantly in progress during life.

  466                 Dr. Marcet on the Constitution of Blood            [May    1 1,
     Fourth. That blood contains phosphoric anhydride andiron in a perfect
 colloid state, or quite undiffusible when submitted to dialysis, the relative
 proportions appearing to vary from 78*61 per cent, of peroxide of iron
  and 21*39 of phosphoric anhydride, to 76-2 and 23-8 respectively, the
 proportion of phosphoric anhydride having a tendency to be rather higher.
     Fifth. That blood contains more phosphoric anhydride and potash,
 bulk for bulk, than serum. This fact has long been known ; but I hare
 shown that the excess of phosphoric anhydride and potash in the blood-
 corpuscles is greater than can be accounted for by the estimation of the
 proportions of colloid phosphoric anhydride and potash in blood and
 serum ; consequently there exists in blood-corpuscles a power checking the
 diffusion of the diffusible substances they contain, and apparently con
 nected with a force peculiar to the corpuscles, as this force ceases to act as
 soon as the corpuscular form disappears from admixture       with water.      This
 property     inherent   to blood-corpuscles may cause an accumulation            of
 potash in blood equal to no less than rather more than four times the
 amount of this substance present in an equal bulk of the serum       of the  same
 blood.
    Sixth. That     a  mixture of colloid  phosphoric anhydride and potash can
 be prepared artificially by the dialysis of a solution of chloride of potassium
 and phosphate of sodium, and that the colloid mass thus obtained appears
 to retain the characters of the neutral tribasic phosphate from which it ori
 ginates ; it exhibits an alkaline reaction, yields a yellow precipitate 'with
 nitrate of silver, and after complete precipitation the reaction is acid.
    Seventh. That by dialyzing certain proportions of phosphate of sodium
 and chloride of potassium during a certain time, proportions of phosphoric
 anhydride, potash, chlorine, and soda are obtained in the colloid fluid very
 similar to the proportions these same substances bear to each other in
 serum after twenty-four hours dialysis.
    Eighth. That muscular tissue is formed of three different classes of
 substances,    — the first including   those substances  which    constitute   the
 tissue   proper, or the portion of flesh insoluble in the preparation of the
 aqueous extract, and consisting of an albuminous principle and phosphoric
 anhydride with varying proportions of potash and magnesia; the second
 class   including the same substances as are found in the tissue proper, and
 in the same proportions relatively to the albumen present in that class, but
 existing in solution and in the colloid state ; the third class including the
 same substances as are found in the two others, and moreover a small
 quantity of chlorine and soda, which, although relatively minute, is never
absent.      The constituents of this class are crystalloid, and consequently
diffusible, the phosphoric anhydride and potash being present precisely in
the proportion required to form a neutral tribasic phosphate, or a pyro
phosphate, as the formula 2KO P05 can equally be 2KO HO P03. The
formation of this substance (2 KO POs) is extremely interesting, and shows
beyond a doubt that, in addition to the material blood yields to muscu-

1871.]                  and Hie Nutrition    of Muscular Tissue.                  467
lar   tissue for the formation    of its insoluble portion, or framework, it supplies
flesh with a large proportion of potash, the only object of which is the
ultimate removal of the phosphoric anhydride it contains.
     Class No. I. of the constituents of muscular tissue is to be considered as
the tissue in the complete stage of assimilation.
     Class No. II. constitutes the material from the blood on its way to form
the Class No. I.
     Class No. III. constitutes the material from Class No. I. in the effete
state, and on its way out of flesh.
     Ninth. That flesh contains in store a supply of nourishment equal to
 about one-third       more than its requirement for immediate use, this being
 apparently      a provision of nature to allow of muscular exercise during pro
 longed fasting.
     Tenth. That the numbers representing the              excess of phosphoric an
 hydride     and   potash  in blood  over  the  proportion of these substances in an
 equal volume of serum in the regular normal nutrition of herbivorous
 animals appear to bear to each other nearly the same relation as that which
 exists between       the phosphoric anhydride and potash on their way out of
 muscular tissue,       from which result     I  conclude that the blood-corpuscles
 have apparently the power of taking up and preparing the material which
 they themselves supply to muscular tissue for its nutrition.
     Eleventh.     That   vegetables   used as food for man and animals, such as
 flour, potato, and rice, contain respectively about the same proportions of
 colloid phosphoric anhydride and colloid potash compared to the total
 quantities of these substances present ; this fact is very remarkable, con
 sidering that the proportions of phosphoric anhydride and potash vary to a
 great extent in these different articles of vegetable food.          I also found in
 some of my analyses of blood that the proportions of colloid phosphoric
 anhydride and colloid potash to the total quantity of these substances
  was the same as the corresponding proportion existing between these sub
  stances in flour, potato, and rice ; and        I conclude that vegetable food has
  the power of transforming phosphoric anhydride and potash from the
  crystalloid or diffusible into the colloid or undiffusible state, and in certain
  tolerably definite proportions ; and it is only after having been thus pre
  pared that these substances appear to be fit to become normal constituents
  of blood, and contribute to the nutrition of flesh.
     A    final remark, and one which is worth consideration, is the fact esta
  blished by the whole of the present investigation, that there is a constant
  change, as rotation in nature, from crystalloids to colloids and from colloids
  to crystalloids.       The substances destined to nourish plants being inanimate
  must be      diffusible,  otherwise they could not be distributed throughout
  the mineral kingdom and brought within the reach of plants.               Vegetables
  transform into colloids the mineral substances destined for the food of
  animals, and it might be said that the locomotion of animals in some re
  spects acts the same part as the diffusion of mineral substances ; for animals

  468               Mr. F. Cracc-Calvert on Protoplasmic Life.                  [May 11,
  more nbout in search of their colloid food, and crystalloid minerals are
   displaced by physical diffusion in search of the plants they are to nourish.
      The excretory products of animals          are crystalloid and diffusible,    as far
  as these soluble constituents are concerned, the solid portions rapidly de
  composing in contact with air and moisture into crystalloid compounds.
  Dead vegetable and animal tissue all return into crystalloids by decomposi
  tion, to be distributed afresh, either by gaseous or liquid diffusion, through
  out the whole     of the mineral world.
      Hence     Graham's     great discovery of the laws of liquid and gaseous
  diffusion lifts up the curtain which veils the mysteries of animal life, and
 throws a flood of light on very many physiological phenomena which had
 until now remained in darkness*.
       II. " On    Protoplasmic      Life."     By F. Crace-Calvert, F.R.S.
                                 Received May 8, 1871.
      A  year since, the publication of Dr. Tyndall's interesting paper on the
 abundance of germ-life in the atmosphere, and the difficulty of destroying
 tliis life, as well as other papers published by eminent men of science,
 suggested      the inquiry if the germs existing or produced in a liquid in a
 state of fermentation or of putrefaction could be conveyed to a liquid suscep
 tible of entering into these states ; and although at the present time the
 results of this inquiry are not sufficiently complete for publication, still I
 have observed       some facts arising out of the subject of protoplasmic life
 which I wish now to lay before the Royal Society.
      Although prepared, by the perusal of the papers of many workers in
 this field, to experience difficulties in prosecuting the stud)-, I must confess
 I did not calculate on encountering so many as I met, and especially those
 arising from the rapid development of germ-life, and of which 1 ha*e
 hitherto seen no notice in any papers which have come under my observa
  tion.     Thus, if the white of a new-laid egg be mixed with water (free from
 life), and exposed to the atmosphere for only fifteen minutes, in the
 months of August or September, it will show life in abundance.                     From
 this cause I was misled in many of my earlier experiments, not having beeu
 sufficiently    careful to avoid even momentary exposure of the fluids to the
 atmosphere.        To the want of the knowledge of this fact may be traced the
 erroneous conclusions arrived at by several gentlemen who had devoted
their attention to the subject of spontaneous generation.
     I  believe that  I  have overcome the difficulty of the fluids under exami
nation becoming polluted by impregnation by the protoplasmic life existing
in the atmosphere, by adopting the following simple method of working.
    As a pure fluid free from life, and having no chemical reaction, was
essential to carrying out the investigation, I directed my attention to the
    *  I have had the valuable assistance  of Messrs. M. T. Salter, P. A. Manning, and H.
Bassett   in the analytical part of my inquiry.

preparation of pure distilled water.           Having always found life in distilled
water prepared by the ordinary methods, by keeping it a few days, after
many trials    I employed the following apparatus, which gave very satisfac
tory results, as it enabled me to obtain water which remained free from life
for  several months.
    It consists of two flasks,     A and B (A rather larger than B), fitted with
perforated    caoutchouc     stoppers*.    These flasks are connected by the tube
D.     Into the stopper of A is fitted a tube C, to which is joined a piece of
 caoutchouc      tubing, which may be closed by the clip E. Through the
 stopper of B is a siphon, F, the long limb of which is cut and joined with
 caoutchouc tubing, which can be closed by the clip G. Through this
 stopper is a third tube, II, connected by caoutchouc with the tube I ; this
 can be closed by the clip K.          The tube     I  is about 3 feet long, and goes
  into the vessel   L, which is partly filled with water.
     The water to be distilled is mixed with solution of potash and perman
 ganate of potash, and placed in the flask At.              Before distillation is com
 menced, a rapid current of pure hydrogen, or some other gas, must be
 passed through the apparatus by the tube C to displace the air and carry
 off all the germs the air may have contained. The clip G is first left open,
 then this closed and the clip          K  opened,    which    allows the gas to pass
 through the water in the vessel        L.
    * The stoppers and     caoutchouc tubing used for the various joints must be new, and
 must be well boiled in water before use.
    + The. reasons why   I  employed permanganate of potash (in large excess) were that,
 under the influence of heat, its oxidizing powers were much increased, and that it gave
 off no gas that could interfere with the purity of the Water, this salt in solution not even
 yielding oxygen under any circumstances.

470              Mr.    F.<  Cracc-Calvert on Protoplasmic Life;             [May 11,
    The' gas should    be passed through      for about fifteen minutes.      The clip
 E  is then closed, and the distillation carried on. When the operation is
complete, the gas must be again passed through the apparatus, and the
connexion with the tube          I broken by closing the clip K.          The water is
drawn off through the siphon F. The long tube acts as a safety-tube, and
is made so long that the absorption is noticed in ample time to close the
clip before any air can enter through that tube.
    The water   has   to be redistilled three or    four times before it is obtained
free from germs, and must be kept          in the apparatus in which it is distilled
until wanted, to prevent any contact with air.
    Some water which had been distilled on the 20th of November, 1870,
being still free from life on the 7th of December, was introduced by the
siphon H into twelve small tubes, and left exposed to the atmosphere for
fifteen hours, when the tubes were closed. Every eight days some of the
tubes were opened, and their contents examined.               On the fifteenth, there
fore, the first examination was made, when no life was observed; on the
twenty-third two or three other tubes were examined, and again no life was
detected ; whilst in the series opened on the 2nd of January, 1 87 1 (that
is to say, twenty-four days from the time the tubes were closed), two or
three black vibrios were found in each field .
    Being impressed with the idea that this slow and limited development
of protoplasmic life might be attributed to the small amount of life existing
in the atmosphere at this period of the year*, a second series of experiments
was commenced on the 4th of January.               The distilled water in the flask
being still free from life, a certain quantity of it was put into twelve small
tubes, which were placed near putrid meat at a temperature of 2 1° to 26° C.
for two hours, and then sealed.          On the 10th of the same month the con
tents of some of the tubes were examined, when two or three small black
vibrios were observed under each field.           This result shows that the fluid
having been placed near a source of protoplasmic life, germs had introduced
themselves in two hours in sufficient quantity for life to become visible in
six days instead of twenty-four.         Other tubes of this series were opened on
the 1 7th of January, when a slight increase of life was noticed ; but no
further development appeared to take place after this date, as some exa
mined on the 10th of March did not contain more life than those of the
 1 7th of January.
    This very limited amount of life suggested the idea that it might be due
to the employment of perfectly pure water, and that the vibrios did not
increase from want of the elements necessary for sustaining their life.               I
therefore commenced         a third series of experiments. Before proceeding to
describe this series,    I  would call attention to the fact that the water in the
                                                             I

to the atmosphere of two days at a temperature of 12° C. before life appeared in solu

time required became less.

flask had remained perfectly free from life up to this time,            a   period of close
on sixteen weeks.
    On the 9th of February     100 fluid grainsof albumen from a new-laid egg
were   introduced,   as quickly   as possible and  with the greatest care, into
10 ounces of pure distilled water contained in the flask in 'which it had
been condensed, and an atmosphere of hydrogen kept over it.              On the
16th some of the fluid was taken out by means of the siphon H, and
examined, and no life being present, twelve tubes were filled with the fluid,
exposed to the air for eight hours, and closed.      On the 21st the contents of
some of the tubes were examined, when a few vibrios and microzyma were
distinctly seen in each field.   On the 27th other tubes were examined, and
showed a marked increase in the amount of life.          In this series life ap
peared   in five days, and an increase in ten, instead of requiring twenty-four
days, as was the case when pure water only was employed.
  Albumen therefore facilitated the development of life.   Of course the
contents of the flask were examined at the same time, but in no instance
was life detected.    I
                      believe that these three series of experiments tend to
prove the fallacy of the theory of spontaneous generation ; for if it were
possible, why should not life have appeared in the pure distilled water, or in
the albuminous solution, which were kept successively in the flask B, as well
as in the fluids which were contained     in    and had been exposed to
                                               the tubes,
the atmosphere or near animal matter in a state of decay, and had thus
become impregnated with the germs of protoplasmic life ?    What gives
still further interest to these experiments         is,
                                            that, having operated during
the severe weather of last winter, when little or no life existed in the
atmosphere, I   was able to impregnate the fluids  with germs without intro
ducing developed  life.
  The quantity of life produced in the above-recited experiments being com
paratively small, was led to infer that this might be due to the influence of
                I
the atmosphere of hydrogen employed to displace the air in the apparatus
used for obtaining the water.     therefore, on the 2nd of March, prepared
                                  I
a solution of albumen similar to that before employed, but expelled the air
out of the apparatus      by
                        pure oxygen   and as the contents of the flask

matter, and then sealed. Several of these tubes were opened on the 11th,
and    immediately examined, when only      few cells were observed in each
                                               a
field.  A   second lot was opened on the 14th, and they showed con
siderable increase of life, there being two or three vibrios under each field.
A   third quantity was opened on the 25th, when no increase had taken
place.  This latter Tesult tends to show that although oxygen appears to
favour the development of germs, still    does not appear to favour their
                                           it

of life is not   due to reproduction  merely, but to the introduction of fresh
germs ; for, excepting this fresh supply, there appears to be no reason why
life should increase more rapidly in the open than in the closed tubes.
    In concluding this paper     I have great pleasure in recognizing the able
and persevering     attention with which my assistant, Mr. William Thompson,

       III. " Action    of Heat on Protoplasmic Life." By F. Crace-
                  Calvert, F.R.S. Received May 9, 1871.
    Those investigators of germ-life who favour the theory of spontaneous
 generation have assumed that a temperature of 212° Fahr., or the boiling-
 point of the fluid which they experimented upon, was sufficient to destroy
 all protoplasmic life, and that the life they subsequently observed in these
 fluids was developed from non-living matter.
     I  therefore made several series of experiments, in the hope that they
 might throw some light on the subject.
    The first series was made with a sugar solution, the second with an in
 fusion of hay, the third with solution of gelatine, and the fourth with
 water that had been in contact with putrid meat. The hay and putrid-
 meat solutions were taken because they had often been used by other in
 vestigators ; sugar was employed, being a well-defined organic compound
 free from nitrogen, which can easily be obtained in a state of purity ; and
 gelatine was used as a nitrogenized     body which can be obtained pure and
 is not coagulated by heat.
     To carry out the experiments I prepared a series of small tubes made of
 very thick and well-annealed glass, each tube about four centimetres in
  length, and having a bore of five millimetres.     The fluid to be operated
 upon was introduced into them, and left exposed to the atmosphere for
  sufficient length of time for germ-life to be largely developed. Each tube
  was then hermetically sealed and wrapped in wire gauze, to prevent any
  accident to the operator in case of the bursting of any of the tubes. They
  were then placed in an oil-bath, and gradually heated to the required tem
  perature, at which they were maintained for half an hour.
     Sugar Solution. — A solution of sugar was prepared by dissolving 1 part
  of sugar in 10 parts of water. This solution was made with common
  water, and exposed all night to the atmosphere, so that life might impreg
  nate it.    The fluid was prepared on the 1 st of November, 1870, introduced
  into tubes on the 2nd, and allowed to remain five days. On the 7th of
  November twelve tubes were kept without being heated, twelve were
  heated to 200° Fahr., twelve to 300°, and twelve to 400° Fahr.

 the other varieties of vibrios, and are the most important of all, as  have             I

  of meat suspended in it until it became putrid and contaminated with
  myriads of animalcules.            This fluid was placed in the usual tubes, which
  were sealed on the 7th of November, and heated on the same day.
      The contents of the        tubes were       subjected to examination on the 1st of

      The results recorded in the           above Tables show that protoplasmic life is
  hut slightly    affected    by a temperature         of 212° F., and that,      even at a tem
  perature of 300° F., it is not entirely destroyed, excepting in the case of
  gelatine.     In all the other fluids a temperature of 400° F. is necessary to
  completely destroy the life.              These experiments, therefore, clearly show
  that the life found by previous experimenters in fluids which have been
  submitted to heat was not due to heterogenesis, but to life which had re
   mained in the fluids, as          I  have seen no experiment reported where the
  temperature to which the fluids were exposed exceeded 300° F.*
      I am the more justified in making this statement, as I have repeatedly ex
  amined the contents of tubes which had been submitted to a temperature
  of 400° F., both immediately after cooling and at all periods up to thirty
  days, and was unable in any instance to detect the slightest trace of life.
      This important result corroborates those recorded in my previous paper,
  and proves that the spontaneous-generation theory is not yet by any means
  established.

     * It is with pleasure that find these experiments to confirm the suggestion of Dr.
  Beale, in his work entitled " Disease-Germs, their supposed Origin," page 50 (which            I
  read a few weeks ago), that " living forms might live though exposed, under certain
  conditions, to a temperature of 350° F."

 476                      Action  of Heat    on Protoplasmic    Life.           [May 11,
      It  occurred to me that it might he interesting to examine the influence
  on pure albumen of the putrid-meat fluids that had been heated, and note
  whether they still possessed the property of propagating life.               A solution
  wns prepared by mixing the albumen of a new-laid egg with pure distilled
  water free from life (prepared as described in my previous paper).                  Equal
  volumes of this solution were placed in six small test-tubes, which              had  been
  cleansed with hot vitriol and well washed with pure water.                  To one tube
  two drops were added of the putrid-meat solution that had been heated to
  100° F., to a second two drops of that heated to 212° F., to a third two
  drops of that heated to 300° F., to a fourth an equal bulk of fluid heated to
  400° F., and to a fifth the same quantity heated to 500° F.             In the sixth the
  albuminous solution, without any thing added, was kept for comparison.
      The tubes were sealed, and kept from the 1st of February to the 9 th.

       These results clearly show that, at the temperatures of 100°, 212°, and
   300° F., life and its germs had not been destroyed, whilst at 400° F. they
  had ; for the results of the examination were in this case exactly identical
  with those of the albumen solution itself; and the life found was doubtless
  introduced in the preparation of the solution, and was not due to any life
  having remained in the fluids that had been heated.
       Although perfectly aware of the interesting researches of Professor Mel-
   sens, proving that the most intense cold does not destroy the active power
   of vaccine lymph, still I thought it desirable to ascertain the effect of a
   temperature of 15° F. on well-developed germ-life, similar to that which
   had been subjected to the action of heat.
       Some putrid-meat liquor, therefore, containing a large quantity of micro-
   zyma and vibrios, was subjected for twenty hours to the influence of a tem
   perature ranging between the freezing-point of water and 1 7° below that
   point, when the ice was melted and the liquor examined.                The animalcules
  retained their vitality, but appeared very languid, and their power of loco
  motion was greatly decreased.
       Two hours after melting the ice the liquor was again examined, when
   the animalcules appeared to be as energetic as before.
         The Society adjourned over Ascension Day, to Thursday,               May 25th.

       For. Sec. G.S. Received April 6, 1871.
   It  had been arranged from the commencement of the Alpine tunnel
(often, though incorrectly, called the Mont-Cenis tunnel) that observations
should be taken at intervals of about one kilometre (3281 feet) from both
the French and Italian ends, with a view to determine as nearly as possible
the law of increment ; and before the completion of the work it had become
evident that the ordinary estimate of increased temperature due to the depth
below the surface of the earth would by no means apply to this particular
case.   The actual length of the tunnel being 40,140 feet, and the culmi
nating point of -the mountain being 5280 feet vertically above a point
2 1,156 feet from the Italian end, there was evidently scope for a number of
valuable observations. The result also might be expected to show the influ
ence of marked irregularities in the contour of the mountains, and also of
changes in the nature of the rock.          The experiments and observations
were entrusted to the resident engineers at each end of the tunnel, Signor
Borelli undertaking them from the Italian side. It does not appear that
any special construction of thermometer was supplied, or that the subject
greatly interested the resident engineers. Carefid observations were made
and duly recorded by Signor Borelli,. but the attempt failed in the hands of
his colleague at the other end. Thus one great source of value was lost,
and the observations at equal distances from both ends cannot be compared.
   The rocks through which the tunnel has been driven consist to a very
large extent of a peculiar calcareous schist, partly talcose, and containing
many bands and strings of quartz.       The whole of the Italian end is through
rock of this kind, and it was reached at about 1 1,000 feet from the entrance
from the French side. The rocks on the French side were at first very
different, including nearly 7000 feet of a peculiar sandstone with indica
tions of anthracite, about 1000 feet of very hard quartzite, and 3000 feet of
gypsum, limestone, and calcareous schist, a large proportion being gypsum.
It would have been in the highest degree desirable to have been able to
compare observations of temperature made at similar depths in different
   tol. xix.                                                      2 a

kinds of rock.    All the rocks may be regarded as mctamorphic ; they are,
however, stratitied, dipping at an angle of 50°, or thereabouts, to the north
west, and corresponding in age to the secondary rocks of England, from the
Oxford clay to the Ehsetic inclusive. There was very little water met with
in tunnelling.
    The observations made by Signor Borelli have been recently made public
in a memoir by Signor F. Giordano, that appeared in the Bulletin of the
'
  R. Comitato Geologico d'ltalia' (No. 1, 2, Jan. and Feb. 1871) ; and in
this communication the general subject is discussed.           The following ac
count, though not a translation of M. Giordano's memoir, derives most of
its facts from the statements there made.        The geological notes and some
of the conclusions, however, result from the author's personal observations,
assisted by the account published      last year by Professor Sismonda, and a
memoir that appeared also last year in the * Comptes Rendus,' written by
M. Elie de Beaumont.
    The temperature observations include the temperature of the air, of the
 water issuing in springs (always small) met with in the progress of the
works, and of the rock.     To obtain the latter, borings were made either in
 the walls of the tunnel or in the headings in advance of the tunnel, and
 generally to a distance of 7 to 10 feet.      The excavation of the complete
tunnel from the Italian end was suspended when 6 kilometres had been
 completed (about 20,000 feet, or less than halfway) ; but as the excava
tion from this end had been much more rapid than from the other, the work
 was continued by a small heading to a      further distance of about 3000 feet,
 when the opening was made to the work on the French side. Thus several
 of the observations were made by borings into the wall of the heading, and
 at a long distance from the completed tunnel and from good         ventilation.
    No observations whatever     are  recorded from      the French   side  of the
 tunnel, either during the work or at the time of meeting.            We are in
 formed, however, that a rush of air took place at the moment of the last
 blast, driving the smoke rapidly towards the Italian end. It should be
 mentioned that the northern,      or French    end,  is only 1160m    (3806 feet)
 above the sea, whereas  the Italian end is 1292m-50       (4241 feet), showing a
 difference of level of 435 feet.    Thus the tunnel would seem to act as a
 chimney, and it is not unlikely that a natural ventilating-current        may   be
 established.
    On the morning of the 26th of December, 1870, the day when the com
 munication was made, the external temperature in the Bardonneche valley
 was considerably below the freezing-point, but within the mouth of the
 tunnel several degrees above.     On this day, besides the temperature of the
 rock, that of the small springs near the end and that of the air were re
 corded ; but the number of men employed, the frequent blasts, and the
 active works going on must have had a marked influence on the latter,
 especially as for 3300 feet the excavation of the tunnel had been stopped
 and only a heading pushed on in advance.         During the continuance of the

 1871.]            as indicated by the      Alpine-Tunnel        Observations.               483
work, the smoke and foul air           were drawn out        of the tunnel by    a ventilator
near the roof.
    The following tabular statement, adapted from that published by Signor
Giordano, will show the nature of the observations for temperature made
in the     course   of the works from the Italian         side : —

   It  thus appears that the observed difference of temperature of the rock
between the distance of 1640 feet from the entrance and the distance of
21,156 feet is 2/°"5 F. The difference of depth beneath the surface in
that distance is about 4600 feet.                It is thought possible that the real
difference may       be  somewhat    less,  as  the increased temperature of the air in
the heading, owing to the number of men employed and the frequent
blasting, may have influenced the result in some measure ; and it is perhaps
safer to estimate       the total increment at something less than 264° F.
   In    the   absence of observations that can be absolutely depended on, we
may perhaps assume the true maximum temperature of the rock to be 84°.
The part of the tunnel having this permanent temperature is 1295m or
4250 feet above the sea, and the corresponding point of the surface i3
9530 feet above the sea, showing a difference of 5280 feet.                 A careful esti

484     Mr. D. T. Anstcd         on tlie     Earth's interior Temperature,                       [May       25,
mate    of   the distribution   of the mountain                mass seems to show               that this u
somewhat in excess of the true difference, and that if the slope were per
fectly even the difference would be reduced to about 5080 feet.
   It   is necessary     now to estimate              as nearly as possible the mean                     annual
temperature of the air at the surface, and the depth and temperature of the
stratum of invariable temperature within the earth. None of these has as yet
been determined by experiment ; but it is found generally that the stratum
of invariable temperature is nearly   2° F. warmer than the mean temperature
of the air at the surface, and that the  mean temperature of the air decreases
in ascending to the higher parts of the atmosphere at the rate of 1° F. in
317 feet.   As, however, the mean temperature of the air at the mouth of
the tunnel is not known by observation, we must take Turin as the nearest
point of departure, this city being 820 feet above the sea, and its mean
annual temperature 54°'5 F.  The difference of level between Turin and
the mountain-summit being 8710 feet, this, divided by 317, gives 27c"5 as
the amount to be deducted from 54°-5.   Thus the calculated mean annual
temperature would be 27°-5 F. ; adding to this 2°, we have the calculated
temperature of the stratum of invariable temperature 290-5 F.
  As some check on this estimate, it may be worth while to refer to a some
what analogous case ^determined by observation by Dolfuss-Ausset, in
1S65-66, on the mountain of St. Theodule and in the valleys of Aosta and
the Vallais. In this case the mean temperature of the air was found to be
-5°-10 C. (22°-8 F.) at the height of 3333m (10,936 feet). The excess
of elevation of this summit above the crest of the Alps over the tunnel
being 1406 feet, the latter should be (at the rate of 1° F. per 31/ feet)
4C'5 F. warmer, or have a temperature of 27°'3 F., a result nearly in accord
ance with the other calculation.
   Estimated in this way, the difference of temperature between the mean
temperature of the air on the assumed surface above the central point of the
tunnel would be (84°— 2/°-5=) 56°-5 F., and the rate of increment (the
difference of level being 5080 feet)                   1°   in I   ,„.,   =   1   90 feet   nearly   ;    or if
we assume the stratum           of invariable temperature                 to be 80 feet          below the
surface,     the rate will be                         =j           feet, showing, no doubt, a very
                                1°

considerable difference when compared with most other observations made
in Europe and elsewhere at vnrious levels, but not altogether unparalleled in
special cases. It        is,
                     of course, possible that the difference may be due to
the topographical conditions and geological structure of the earth's crust
under the crest of  great mountain-chain of comparatively recent elevation.
                        a
   But there     is          fact to be observed not alluded to by Signor
                      an important
Giordano, but bearing very strongly on the general question of the rate of
increment.   The slope of the Alps in this part of the range above the
tunnel     nearly regular on the French side, but very sudden at first
           is
towards Italy, after which there             is   a   wide step or terrace, for             a   distance of

   1871].       as indicated by the        Ai^pine-Tunnel Observations.                485
  about two miles. It results that the depth from the summit of the ridge to
  the tunnel being 5280 feet, the depth from the surface to the tunnel at the
  Torrent of Merdovine, where the step or terrace commences, and which is
  8240 feet in horizontal distance from the summit, is only 1 700 feet, show
 ing   a diminution     of 3580     feet  of elevation in 8240 feet of distance, or,
 allowing for a    sudden rise near the summit, a slope of 1 in 2|, or an angle
 of 21°.    On the other hand, the depth from the surface to the tunnel be
 tween the Torrent of Merdovine and a point about 3000 feet from the
 entrance (a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet) shows hardly any appre
 ciable difference, varying only a few hundred feet from one point in the
 profile to another. Beyond this point there is another rapid descent to the
 valley of Bardonneche, where the mouth of the tunnel is situated.
    Temperature observations were taken (1) at a point under the summit
 of the crest, (2) at a point under the Torrent of Merdovine, and (3) under
 the last point mentioned, 3000 feet from the entrance.                  These show re
spectively 85°-l F., 74°"5 F., and 62°-6 F. In each case the observations
were made from borings, and they may all be regarded as good and fairly
to be compared with each other.                  Making the corrections already ex
plained, the result would be, first, that borings of 1 700 feet made in dif
ferent parts of the terrace below the steep mountain face for a breadth of
about two miles might show a rate varying from 1° of increase of tempera
ture in 43 feet of depth to 1° in G3 feet ; whilst on the steep slope the rate
at the lowest part of the slope being 1° in 03 feet, the rate at the summit is
1° in 91 feet, the horizontal distance between the two places of observation
being 8240 feet, or about a mile and a half.              In all these cases there is no
differeuce in the nature of the rock.
    There are two intermediate observations, numbered (10) and (11) in the
Table, which correspond to depths below the surface of 3000 and 4500
feet   respectively.     Estimated as before, the rate of increment is in the
former case 1° in 65 feet, in the latter 1° in 84 feet.
    One observation (No. 14) was made 1800 feet beyond the centre of the
tunnel towards the north, at a depth which may be fairly estimated at
4750 feet.     The temperature observed was 80°-(J F., which, reduced as
before, shows    a  rate equivalent to 1° in 93'4 feet.

486     Mr. Legros Clark     on the Mechanism       of Respiration.    [May 25,
   The  absence  of observations from the French side appears more and more
unfortunate as we advance in the investigation, and renders the general
result by no means so satisfactory as it would otherwise be. It would appear,
indeed, that distance from the surface alone is not by any means the only
cause of increased temperature in the case of a lofty mountain mass ; but
how far this is due to imperfect observation, the want of properly sheltered
instruments, and local causes connected with the progress of the works, it
is not easy to say.    There may also, no doubt, be some difference arising
from the imperfect modes of estimating the mean annual temperature and
the temperature and depth of the stratum of permanent temperature. Bat
although all these are subject to a certain amount of correction, there is
enough general accordance of the observations to show that the conclusions
indicated must be accepted.      Considering that we are in the heart of the
great mountain axis of Europe, the conditions are simple and favourable.
There is little or no permanent snow or ice on either side, and no glaciers :
one slope   (that  to the south)    is at first rapid, and then in steps ; the
other slope is very regular.      The tunnel is of great length, and most
parts of it of enormous depths below the surface, compared with any other
depths that have been reached ; and it has been mentioned already that the
geological conditions are unusually simple, especially in the southern end
of the tunnel, to which all the observations are confined. No case has ever
before occurred in which there was so much opportunity of making syste
 matic and trustworthy observations on the subject of the internal tempera
ture of the earth ; but as it is not unlikely that the successful comple
tion of the tunnel under the Mont Frejus may be followed by other similar
undertakings in other parts of the Alps, the experience here gained may at
any rate be turned to account to secure better aud more systematic work
elsewhere.
   Note. — Since the    above  memoir was written, the author       has been in
correspondence with Prof. Sismonda of Turin,       and has obtained permission
to repeat the observations recorded, to make corresponding observations in
the bore-holes at the French end of the tunnel, and to obtain observations
of the temperature at the surface. These observations will be made with
instruments provided by the British Association Committee for investigating
the rate of increase of underground temperature, and will be conducted by
the author, who hopes to visit the tunnel during the present summer.

   The author commences his paper by narrating some experiments on
recently slaughtered animals, in the course of which the remarkable tension

1871.]       Researches on the Hydrocarbons         of  the Series Cnlhn+2-              487
of the diaphragm was noticed ; and the varying condition of that muscle,
aud of the lungs and pleura, with their mutual relations, are com
mented on.
    The importance of this      passive     tension of the diaphragm is indicated,
and exemplified both physiologically and pathologically.                  It is essential
in retaining    the supplemental    air  within   the  luugs,  in  restoring the equili
brium of repose, in economizing active muscular power, and in maintaining
the pericardial space, &c.
    The action of the diaphragm in relation to the walls of the chest and to
other muscles is next discussed ; and the influence of the diaphragm in
drawing in the chest-walls, under certain circumstances, is pointed out, and
illustrated by cases of injury to the spinal cord.
    The action of the intercostal muscles, as necessary adjuncts to the dia
phragm and as muscles of inspiration, is insisted on and illustrated by
diagrams ; and a summary of their action is given.
    The agency of the serratus magnus is then discussed ; and reasons are
advanced, supported by observation and experiment, to show that it is only
under special conditions and to a limited extent that it can be regarded as
 taking any part in the act of inspiration.
    The mobility of the different costal regions and of the sternum is
exemplified by observation and experiment.
    Lastly, the question of abdominal and thoracic              breathing, severally in
the male and female, is considered        ;  and reasons are adduced for concluding
that the received opinions on this subject are erroneous.

obtained from the normal propyl iodide, and dibutyl from normal butyl
iodide. The constitution of the others was determined by converting them
into alcohols and studying the oxidation products of the latter ; thus the
hexyl hydride from petroleum, as well as that obtained from mannite, was
transformed into secondary hexyl alcohol, which on oxidation yielded acetic
acid and normal butyric acid.

                                                  placed the hydrocarbon

found now that this body is identical with dibutyl and also with the hydro
carbon which   Zinke obtained from primary octyl alcohol.    This chemist
prepared also dioctyl, C10H31, which consequently is a normal paraffin;
and it appears probable that dihexyl, which Brazier and Gossleth obtained
by the electrolysis of ccnanthylic ncid, belongs to this group too.

 1871.]                    of Uranus and Comet I., 1871.                               489
     By means of the equatorial refractor of 1 5 inches aperture, by Messrs.
 Grubb and Son, recently placed in my hands by the Royal Society, 1 have
 succeeded in making the observations described in this paper of the re
markable spectrum which is afforded by the light of the planet Uranus.
     It should be stated that the spectrum of Uranus was observed by Father
 Secchi in 1869*.         He says: " le jaune y fait completement defaut. Dans
le vert et dans le bleu il y a deux raies trcs-Iarges et tres-noircs."             He re
presents the band in the blue as more refrangible than F, and the one in the
 green    as near  E.
      The spectrum of Uranus,      as   it appears in my instrument, is represented
 in the accompanying diagram. The narrow spectrum placed above that of
  Uranus gives the relative positions of the principal solar lines and of the
  two strongest absorption-bands produced by our atmosphere, namely, the
  group of lines a little more refrangible than D, and the group which occurs
  about midway from C to D.           The scale placed above gives wave-lengths
  iu millionths of a millimetre.
      The spectrum of Uranus is continuous, without any part being wanting,
  as far as the feebleness of its light permits it to be traced, which is from
  about C to about G.
       On account of the small amount of light received from this planet, I
  was not able to use a slit sufficiently narrow to bring out the Fraunhofcr
   lines.     The positions of the bands produced by planetary absorption,
   which are broad and strong in comparison with the solar lines, were deter
   mined by the micrometer and by direct comparison with the spectra of
   terrestrial substances.
       The   spectroscope   was  furnished    with one prism of dense flint-glass,
   having a refracting- angle   of CO0,   an observing telescope magnifying 5% dia
   meters,   and  a  collimator of 5  inches focal length.        A cylindrical lens was
   used to increase     the breadth of the spectrum.
       The remarkable absorption taking place at Uranus shows itself in six
    strong lines, which are drawn iu the diagram.               The least refrangible of
    these lines occurs in a faint part of the spectrum, and could not be mea-

sured.     Its position was estimated only, and on this account it is repre
sented   in the diagram by a dotted line. The positions of the other lines
were obtained by micrometrical measures on different nights.           The strongest
of the lines is that which has a wave-length of about 544 millionth^ of a
millimetre.     The band at 5/2 of the scale is nearly as broad but not so
dark  ;   the one   a  little  less  refrangible  than  D is narrower       than  the
others.
   The measures taken of the most refrangible band showed that it was
at or very near the position of F in the solar spectrum.             The light from
a tube containing rarefied hydrogen, rendered luminous by the induction-
spark, was then compared directly with that of Uranus.              The band in the
planet's    spectrum appeared       to be coincident with       the  bright   hue of
hydrogen.
   Three of the bands were shown by the micrometer not to differ greatly
in position from some of the bright lines of the spectrum of air. A direct
comparison was made, when the principal bright lines were found to have
the positions, relatively to the lines of planetary absorption, which are
shown in the diagram.         The band which has a wave-length of about 5/2
millionths of a millimetre is less refrangible than the double line of nitrogen
which occurs near it. The two planetary bands at 595 and 618 of the
scale appeared very nearly coincident with bright lines of air.          The faint -
ness of the planet's spectrum did not admit of certainty on this point ;            I
suspected that the planetary lines are in a small degree less refrangible.
There is no strong line in the spectrum of Uranus in the position of the
strongest of the lines of air, namely, the double line of nitrogen.
   As carbonic-acid gas might be considered, without much improbability,
to be a constituent of the atmosphere of Uranus, I took measures with the
same spectroscope of the principal groups of bright lines which present
themselves when the induction-spark is passed through this gas.              The re
sult was to show that the bands of Uranus cannot be ascribed to the ab
sorption of this gas.
   There is no absorption-band at the position of the line of sodium.              It
will be seen by a reference to the diagram that there are no lines in the
spectrum of Uranus at the positions of the principal groups produced by
the absorption of the earth's atmosphere.

   On   April  7 a faint comet was discovered by Dr. Winnecke.           I  observed
the comet on April      13  and  May   2.   On   both days  the  comet  was  exceed
ingly faint, and on May 2 it was rendered more difficult to observe by the
light of the moon and a faint haze in the atmosphere. It presented the
appearance of a small faint coma, with an extension in the direction from
the sun.
                                             I
   When observed in the spectroscope, could detect the light of the coma
to consist almost entirely of three bright bands.

     A
     fair measure was obtained of the centre of the middle band, which was
the brightest ; it gives for this band a wave-length of about 510 millionths
of a millimetre.             I
                      was not able to do more than estimate roughly the
position of the less refrangible band. The result gives 545 millionths.
The third band was situated at about the same distance from the middle
band on the more refrangible side.
     It
     would appear that this comet is similar in constitution to the comets
which I examined in 18G8*.

     It   was   seen that,         even   if    such were the case, it would be difficult                     to
obtain proof of           it,

to design and construct an instrument with this object    and after many         ;
trials with varied apparatus,   was decided to adopt the hydraulic prin

actuate the instrument, and of measuring the force itself    the alteration          by
produced in the height of the column of water.
   The use of an air-chamber was suggested by the sympiesometer      has,                       ;   it
however, been enlarged to meet the altered conditions of this instrument,
and   is   buried underground               to secure freedom from all diurnal changes of
temperature.
  The action of the instrument     essentially depends upon the flow and
reflow of water between two hydraulic chambers (connected by       tube or                  a
siphon), one  of which     open and  is
                                    exposed   to atmospheric pressure, the
other closed at top, and removed from such pressure, being in pneumatic
connexion with the buried air-chamber.
  Any difference in the levels of the water in these two chambers                                        is   a

                  an inch
 sufficient force to reduce to insignificance the inevitable friction of the pen
 and working parts.
   The chief difficulties met were               :   —
    1st. To retain perfect sensibility to minute variations of pressure with
 out being constantly thrown out of range by the greater changes.
   2nd. To record on a very open scale, and yet not to exceed the usual con
 venient limits of paper and space.
    It     was found         necessary     to abandon         the idea     of recording         absolute
 barometric measurements on such a scale, aud to deal                         with minute differ
ences only (hence the name "Differential microbarograph"), making the
instrument self-adjusting, so as to act differentially only, allowing brief
wave-like motions or pulsations of pressure to record themselves as such,
while a steady rise or fall of pressure should record itself by a line or trace,
whose mean distance above or below the base-line will indicate pretty
accurately the rate per hour of such rise or fall.
   This power of self-adjustment has been obtained by use of a capillarv
tube communicating with the air-chamber and with the atmosphere,

stantly restored, and the pen brought back to the zero.
   It is as if the ordinary barographic curve of pressure were made to serve
as the base-line, and these minute variations were made to record them
selves above or below             it,
                             as though they were ripples or waves upon its

change of pressure, the          one rising while the other descends, and so com
bining      to produce the desired movement.
     A   light but rigid V-shaped bar is laid inverted on the sharp edge of a
disk    placed on the axis of the pulleys supporting the cylinders, the other end
of   the bar running upon a light disk as a friction-roller.
     This bar carries    a glass   capillary siphon pen of very simple form lightly
poised, and having        a  reservoir of fluid ink sufficient for a month's use ; this
traverses the paper        on the drum     in the usual manner.
     The relative areas of the cylinders and the hydraulic chambers respec
tively determine the scale upon which the curves shall be projected ; the
ratio of 10 to 1 which has been adopted giving half an inch rise or fall for
one-tenth of       an inch difference    in the water-level in the two chambers.
     The     instrument     therefore multiplies by 5, and the difference in the
specific gravity of mercury and water again multiplies by 13'59, say
 1 3*6 X 5 = 68 ; this is the scale upon which the curves would be projected
were it not for the power of self-adjustment given to the instrument, in order
 to keep it within range.
     By use of an instrument such as described, the writer has at intervals
 during the last four years accumulated barograms for subsequent examina
 tion and discussion, amounting to over 450 days.
     The autographs of different days are as diverse as possible, and sometimes
 most characteristic      ; tracings of a few types are appended.
     It is only within the last few weeks that the writer has been able to com
 mence the comparison of his barograms with independent data gathered
 from a wide       area of official observations.
     By the courtesy of the Meteorological Committee of the Royal Society,
  and the kindness of Mr. Scott, the Director of the Meteorological Office,
  he has been furnished with all the reports and data at their disposal, which
  he trusts will enable him thoroughly to discuss the matter.
     Meantime the interesting nature of some of the results, the coinci
  dence in point of date between some of the most striking of the micro-
  barograms, and the existence of storm and gale within a certain radius are
  not a little remarkable, and are indeed sufficient to induce the writer to lay
  the matter before the Royal Society in its early stage, rather than await a
  fuller development under his own hands, in order to insure for it a wider
  basis than his own individual observations alone could command.
      Personally the writer entertains little doubt that these barograms show
   the existence,    under some circumstances, of the atmospheric storm-waves
   of which he has been in search, the most marked feature in such case being
   the rhythmical character and strikingly wave-like form which the minute
   movements assume.
      It is believed that much information may result from such additional
   means    of research, and the writer offers the instrument in aid of meteoro
   logical science.

   The curves and surfaces considered in this paper are, I believe, some of
the most fertile in properties in the whole range of geometry.  For the pur
pose of giving a full and comprehensive discussion, I have divided the paper
into several chapters.   The following is an outline of the method of inves
tigation pursued, together with a statement of some of the results arrived
at.
      If we
        take the most general equation of the second degree in (a,                                    ft,   y,   S),
where these variables denote spheres instead of planes,
                                    (abcdlmnpq                   rjfca,   ft,   y,    l,)-=(),
we get the most general form                       in which the equation of   quartic cyclide  a
can be written.                       Setting out  with this equation,   have proved that
                                                                                     I                           a
quartic cyclide                is   the envelope of variable sphere, whose centre moves on
                                                          a                                                      a
given quadric, and which cuts orthogonally the Jacobian of the spheres of
reference (a,    y,           ft,        I).
   The Jacobian of (a,   y,    can be written in
                                               ft,form identical with that

                     of the Jacobian can be expressed

second degree in a.,   y, c. This equation assumes

where        a.,   ft,   y,   I,    e   are five spheres mutually orthogonal.               These are spheres
of inversion of the cyclide, and by incorporating                                    constants their equations

49G           Dr.    J.      Casey on Cyclides and Sphero-Quartics.                            [June   15,
    From    these
                equations           I
                             hare shown that in general a quartic can be
generated in five different ways as the envelope of a variable sphere which
cuts a given sphere orthogonally, and whose centre moves on a given
quadric, which, on account of one of its most important properties,     have                       I
named the focal quadric of the cyclide.   Every cyclide has, in general, five
focal quadrics ; these focal quadrics are confocal ; their focal conies are
double, or "nodo-foci" of the cyclide.
    Ihave shown that the locus of the single or ordinary foci of cyclides
are sphero-quartics (curves of intersection of a sphere and a quadric).  In
general a cyclide has five focal sphero-quartics.     we  call confocal If
                                                                        two
cyclides having in common one focal sphero-quartic, through any point can
be described three cyclides confocal with a given cyclide. These confocals
are mutually orthogonal.    Other methods of generating cyclides are also
given   ;thus three circles in space being given, whose planes are diametral
planes of a given sphere, and which are orthogonal to the sphere, a cyclide
will be generated by a variable circle in space which rests on these three
circles. This method is analogous to that for describing ruled quadrics by
the motion of a line.             The equation of           a cyclide may be              interpreted in
three different ways : — 1,         so as to denote         a cyclide ; 2, a             sphero-quartic ;
3, a tangent cone                      Hence it follows that sphero-quartics,
                             to the cyclide.
both in their modes of generation and in many of their properties, bear a
striking analogy to cyclides. Thus the canonical form of the equation of
a sphero-quartic is ax2 + b(i2 + cy2 + dd2 =0, where a,    y,  are circles on      (i,   &
a   given sphere    U the poles of the planes of a,

of this relation, which holds also for bicircular quartics,        have got the          I
equations  of  the  four  focal sphero-conics   of the   sphero-quartic.   These
sphero-conics are constructed geometrically as the intersections with U of
perpendiculars from its centre on the tangent-planes to the four cones
which can be drawn through the sphero-quartic.          The focal sphero-conics
are confocal, their foci being the double or nodo-foci of the sphero-quartic.
   Sphero-quartics may be inverted into bicirculars    they may also be pro
                                                                         ;

circular section of the quadric, whose intersection with the sphere          the                  is
sphero-quartic by  lines parallel to the greatest or least axis of the quadric                         ;
second, by elliptic projection — that           is,

quadrics passing through each point of the sphero-quartic.        The de
velopable formed by tangent planes to the sphere U, at every point of the
sphero-quartic, possesses many geometrical properties.     Thus the cone
whose vertex    at the centre of U, and which stands on its cuspidal edge,
                    is
may be generated by the focal lines            of

                                           contact with another.   The
cuspidal edge and the nodal lines of the developable may be projected

into the      evolute and the focal conies of              a   bicircular     quartic.    The     deve
lopable possesses numerous anharmonic properties ; thus all its gene
rators are divided homographically by the nodal lines and the sphere U.
   In the chapters on the inversion and classification of cyclides,    have                   I
proved  that the presence or absence of nodes depends on the relative posi
tions of the focal quadric and sphere of inversion ; thus if they touch
there will be a conic node, the cyclide being in this case the inverse of a
quadric, which is           an hyperboloid      or ellipsoid according as the node has a
real or imaginary          cone   of contact.     If they osculate, the cyclide will be the
inverse of     a paraboloid        ; the node will be biplanar if the paraboloid be an
elliptic or hyperbolic            one, and it will be uniplanar if the paraboloid be
cylindrical.   If the focal quadric and sphere of inversion have double con
tact, the cyclide will be the inverse of a cone of the second degree, and will
have two nodes, which must be conic nodes. When a cyclide has nodes,
the number of focal quadrics suffers diminution. I have given in the same
chapters the equations and the singularities of the tangent cones, and
shown that in general every cyclide has as many double tangent cones as
 it has focal quadrics ; in fact the double tangent cones are the reciprocals
 of the asymptotic cones of the focal quadrics. It is also proved that the
 lines of intersection of   cyclide, with its spheres of inversion, are lines of
                                   a
 curvature on the cyclide, and that the imaginary circle at infinity is a
 fiecnodal curve on its surface of centres.
    In the chapter on the classification of sphero-quartics         have given       I
 Chasles's characteristics for the osculating circles of a sphero-quartic.  By
 inversion we get the characteristics for the osculating circles of bicircular
 quartics.     Thus V=24 for           these                   In

   It  is well known that one metal has the power of decomposing the stki
of certain other          metals, and that the chemical change will proceed until
the more powerful metal has entirely taken the place of the other.                            The
authors have investigated what takes place during the process.
   The experiments were generally performed as follows : — 72 cubic centi
metres     of  an aqueous solution         of the salt of known strength, and at 12s
Centigrade, were placed in a tall glass ; a perfectly clean plate of metal of
3230 square millimetres was weighed and placed vertically in this solution
without reaching either to the top or bottom ; the action was allowed to
proceed quietly for ten minutes, when the plate was removed, and the de
posited metal was washed off.                The loss of weight gave the amount of
metal dissolved, and represented the chemical action.
    The most complete series of results was with copper and nitrate of
silver.

is shown in the 5th and 6th columns.             The law then breaks down, and
after about 7 per    cent, the increased action is almost in direct ratio with the
increased strength.
     The position of the plate in the solution was found to make no difference
to this 2-3 law.
     Similar series of experiments were made with zinc and chloride of copper,
zinc and sulphate of copper, zinc and nitrate of lead, iron and sulphate of
copper, and other combinations ; and in every instance where the solution

for twice the strength was found to hold good.

     The manner in which the silver is deposited on       a copper plate was exa
 mined, and the currents produced were studied.          At first a light blue cur
 rent is perceived flowing upwards from the surface of the plate, presently a
 deep blue current pours downwards, and these two currents in opposite di
 rections continue to form simultaneously.           A similar phenomenon was
  observed in every case where a metallic salt attacked a plate of anotner
  metal. The downward current was found to be a solution of almost pure
 nitrate of copper, containing about three times as much N03 as the original
  silver solution, while the upward current was a diluted solution of the
  mixed nitrates.      Moreover the heavy current took its rise in the entangled
  mass of crystals right against the plate, while the light current flowed from
 the tops of the crystalline branches.       It was evident that when the fresh
 silver was deposited on these branches, and the fresh copper taken up from
 the plate, there was not merely a transference of the nitric element from
 one     combination to another, but an actual molecular           movement of it
 towards the copper plate, producing an accumulation of           nitrate of copper
 there, and a corresponding loss of salt in the liquid that is    drawn within the
 influence of the branching crystals.      Hence the opposite     currents.

    The amount of action in a circuit of two metals and a saline solution
 must have as one of its regulating conditions the conducting-power of that
 solution.     It appeared by experiment that a strong solution of nitrate of
 silver offers less resistance than a weak one ; and it was also found, on
 adding nitrate of potassium to the nitrate of silver, that its power of
 attacking the copper plate was increased, that the augmentation of the
 foreign salt increased the action still further, and that the 2—3 law holds
 good between two solutions in which both the silver and potassium salt are
 doubled, though it does not hold good if the quantity of foreign salt be kept
constant.       Similar results were obtained with mixed nitrates of silver and
 copper.
    While    these  later experiments offer an explanation of the fact that s
 solution of double the strength produces more than double the chemical
 action, they do not explain why it should produce exactly three times           the
 effect, or why the ratio should be the same in all substitutions of            this
nature hitherto tried.       The simplicity and wide range of the 2—3 law      seem
to indicate that it is   a very primary one in chemical dynamics.

        F.R.S., Professor of Natural History in Owens College, Man
        chester.    Received June 13, 1871.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The Lepidodendron selaginoides described by Mr. Binney, and still more
recently by Mr. Carruthers, is taken as the standard of comparison for
numerous other forms.          It consists of a central medullary axis composed
of a combination of transversely barred vessels with similarly barred cells ,-
the vessels are arranged without any special linear order.          This tissue is
closely surrounded by a second and narrower ring, also of barred vessels, but
of smaller size, and arranged in vertical lamina: which radiate from within
outwards.       These laminae are separated by short vertical piles of cells,
believed to be medullary rays. In the transverse section the intersected
mouths of the vessels form radiating lines, and the whole structure is re
garded as an early type of an exogenous cylinder ; it is from this cylinder
alone that the vascular bundles going to the leaves are given off.            This
woody zone is surrounded by a very thick cortical layer, which is parenchy
matous at its inner part, the cells being without definite order ; but exter
nally they become prosenchymatous, and are arranged in radiating lines,
which latter tendency is observed to manifest itself whenever the bark-cells
assume the prosenchymatous type.           Outside the bark is an epidermal layer,
separated from the rest of the bark by a thin bast-layer of prosenchyma,
the cells of which are developed into a tubular and almost vascular form ;
but the vessels are never barred, being essentially of the fibrous
                                                                             type.

Externally    to this bast-layer  is a more   superficial epiderm of parenchyma,
supporting the bases of leaves, which consist of similar parenchymatous
tissue. Tangential sections of these outer cortical tissues show that the
so-called   " decorticated " specimens of Lepidodendra and of other allied
plants are merely examples that have lost their epidermal layer or had it
converted into coal, this layer, strengthened by the bast-tissue of its inner
surface, having remained as a hollow cylinder when all the more internal
structures had been destroyed or removed.
    From this type the author proceeds upwards through a series of examples
in which the vessels of the medulla become separated from its central cel
lular portions and retreat towards its periphery, forming an outer cylinder
of medullary    vessels, which are arranged without order and enclose a defined
cellular axis ; at the same time the encircling ligneous zone of radiating
vessels becomes yet more developed, both in the number of its vessels and
in the diameter of the cylinder relatively to that of the entire stem. As
these changes are produced, the medullary rays separating the laminoc of
the woody     wedges become more definite, some of them assuming a more
composite structure, and the entire organization gradually assuming a more
exogenous type ; at the same time the cortical portions retain all the
essential features of the Lepidodendroid plants.           Commencing with the
Lepidodendron selaginoides just described, we pass on to L. Harcourtii, in
which there is    a distinct cellular axis to the medulla, surrounded by a    ring
of medullary vessels, externally to which is the second or radiating cylinder
of vessels, from which alone, as M. Brongniart has very correctly shown,
the bundles of vessels supplying the leaves are derived. Then we reach
the more highly organized of the forms which Mr. Binney has described
under the common name of Sigillaria vascularis, in which the woodv
cylinder is more extensively developed.           This conducts us to a series of
varieties from which the cells of the medulla have disappeared, but in
which there is a very distinct inner cylinder of large barred vessels not
 arranged in radiating order, and an outer and much more ample cylinder
of smaller   ones arranged on the exogenous type.          In these examples the
line of demarcation between the vessels of the medulla and those of the
 ligneous zone is sometimes straight and at others boldly crenulated.           In
 the latter examples the outside of the vascular medullary cylinder, detached
 from its surroundings, exhibits the fluted appearance of a Calamitc, for
 which it might    be mistaken, but    it lacks the transverse nodal constrictions
 of that genus.     It is to some of these more highly organized Lepidodendra
just referred to that Corda has applied the name of Biploxylon, and "Witham
 that of Anabathra, both of which correspond in the closest manner
 with the Sigillaria elegans of M. Brongniart.           We are thus brought, by
 the evidence of internal organization, to the conclusion that the plants
 which Brongniart has divided into two distinct groups, the one of which
 he has placed amongst the vascular Cryptogams, and the other amongst
 the Gymnospermous Exogens, constitute one great natural family.

the ring of medullary vessels, and, besides, exhibit the enclosing ligueoa!
zone at its minimum stage of development.    The remarkable scars       Vk-      of
dendron and the tubercles of Halonia appear to have had their most pro
minent surfaces composed of the true bark-layer deprived of its epidermal
bast and parenchymatous layers, which surround these structures but                    do
not wholly enclose them.  These characteristic structures are believed                 to
have supported special organs, into which the epidermal layer of the stem
has been prolonged, and which the author believes to have been reproduc
tive cones.  Favularia corresponds very closely, so far as its cortical layer
is concerned, with those already described   and as Brongniart's Sigillmt
                                                 ;
elegant   anisunquestionable Favularia,  the entire series of this subgenus
is brought into the closest relationship with the plants described. But
the author has further met with some important examples, showing that
the stem supported verticils of organs that were neither leaves nor branches,
but which are believed to have been cones, thus bringing to light an addi
tional indication of affinity between Favularia, Halonia, and Ulodendm.
  Well-marked examples have also been obtained from the Lancashire
Lower Coal-measures, the source whence all the specimens described haw

                                   is                           thick and well-

developed        ligneous cylinder, which contains two distinct sets of primarj
and secondary medullary      rays.  The primary ones are of large size, m
are arranged   in  regular quincunctial order    they are composed of thick
                                                     ;
masses of mural cellular tissue.    A tangential section of each ray exhibits
a  lenticular outline, the long axis of which corresponds with that        the    of
stem.   These rays pass directly outwards from pith to bark, and separate
the larger woody wedges which constitute so distinct   feature in all trans

smaller rays consist of vertical piles of cells, arranged in single rows, and
often consisting of but one, two, or three cells in each vertical series                ;

these latter are very numerous and intervene between all the numerous
radiating laminee of vessels that constitute the larger wedges of woody
tissue. The vessels going to the rootlets are not given off from the pith,
as Goeppert supposed, but from the sides of the woody wedges bounding
the upper part of the several large lenticular medullary rays, those of
the lower portion of the ray taking no part in the constitution of the
vascular bundles. The vessels of the region in question descend vertically
and parallel to each other until they come in contact with the medullary
ray, when they are suddenly deflected, in large numbers, in an outward
 direction,    and nearly at right angles to their previous course, to reach the
 rootlets.      But only a small number reach their destination, the great
 majority of the deflected vessels terminating in the woody zone.         A very
 thick bark surrounds the woody zone. Immediately in contact with the
 latter it consists of a thin layer of delicate vertically elongated cellular
 tissue, in which the mural tissues of the outer extremities of the medullary
 rays become merged. Externally to this structure is a thick parenchyma,
 which quickly assumes a more or less prosenchymatous form and becomes
 arranged in thin radiating lamina; as it extends outwards.        The epidermal
 layer consists of cellular parenchyma with vertically elongated cells at its
 inner surface, which feebly represents the bast-layer of the other forms
 of Lepidodeudroid plants. The rootlets consist of an outer layer of
  parenchyma, derived from the epidermal parenchyma.            Within this is a
  cylindrical space, the tissue of which has always disappeared.          In the
  centre is a bundle of vessels surrounded by a cylinder of very delicate
  cellular tissue, prolonged either from one of the medullary rays or from the
  delicate innermost layer of the. bark, because it always accompanies the
  vessels in their progress outwards through the middle and outer barks.
     The facts of which the preceding is a summary lead to the conclusion
  that all the forms of plants described are but modifications of the Lepidodeu
  droid type.      The leaf-scars of the specimens so common in the coal-shales
  represent tangential sections of the petioles of leaves when such sections are
  made close to the epidermal layer.       The thin film of coal of which these
  leaf-scars consist, in specimens found both in sandstone and in shale, does
  not represent the entire bark as generally thought, and as is implied in the
  term "decorticated" usually applied to them, but is derived from the
  epidermal layer.      In such specimens all the more central axial structures
  (viz. the medulla, the wood, and the thick layer of true bark) have disap
  peared through decay, having been either destroyed or in some instances
  detached and floated out ; the bast-laver of the epiderm has arrested the
  destruction     of the entire cylinder,   and formed the mould into which
  inorganic materials have been introduced.        On the other hand, the woody
  cylinder   is  the part most frequently preserved in Stigmaria ; doubtless
  because, being subterranean, it was protected against the atmospheric
   action which destroyed so much      of the  stem.
      It is evident that all  these Lepidodendroid   and Sigillarian plants must

be included     in one common family, and that the separation            of the latter
from the former as a group of Gymnosperms, as suggested by M. Brong-
niart, must be abandoned.          The remarkable development of exogenous
woody structures in most members of the entire family indicates the
necessity of ceasing to apply either to them or to their living representa
tives the term Acrogenous.           Hence the author proposes a division of
the vascular Cryptogams         into  an exogenous group, containing Lycopo-
diacece, Equisetacece, and the fossil Oalamitacete,               and an endogenous
group, containing the ferns ; the former uniting the Cryptogams with the
Exogens through the Cycadece and other Gymnosperms, and the latter
linking them with the Endogens through the Palmacece.
V. "Contributions to the History of the Opium Alkaloids. — Part
       II. On the Action of Hydrobromic Acid on Codeia and its de
       rivatives."     By C. R. A. Weight, D.Sc, Lecturer on Chemistry
       in St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.               Communicated by Dr.
       H. E. Roscoe.        Received June 7, 1871.
    It has been    shown in Part   I. of this research * that the action        of hy
drobromic acid on codeia gives rise, without evolution of methyl bromide,
firstly to bromocodide, and secondly to two other new bases termed re
spectively deoxycodeia and bromotetracodeia, the latter of which, under
the influence of hydrochloric acid, exchanges bromine for chlorine, yielding
a corresponding chlorinated base, chlorotetracodeia ; when, however, the
action of hydrobromic       acid is prolonged,     methyl bromide is evolved in
some    little quantity.   By digesting codeia with three or four times its
weight of 48 per     cent, acid for five or six hours on the water-bath, vapours
were evolved which condensed by the application of a freezing-mixture to a
colourless mobile liquid, the boiling-point of which was found to be 10o-5
to ll0-5, and the vapour of which burnt with a yellow-edged flame, and
exploded violently with oxygen, forming carbonic and hydrobromic acids.
It becomes, therefore, of interest to examine in detail the action of hydro
bromic acid on each of the three bodies produced from codeia under its
influence.
              § 1. Action  of Hydrobromic Acid       on Bromotetracodeia.
   When bromotetracodeia hydrobromate is heated in a sealed tube to 100°
with four or five times its weight of 48 per cent, hydrobromic acid for from
six to ten hours, methyl bromide is found as a thin layer on the top of the
tarry contents of the tube after cooling ; by dissolving this tarry substance
in water and fractionally precipitating the liquid by strong hydrobromic acid
several times successively, nearly white amorphous              flakes are ultimately
obtained, resembling in all their physical and chemical properties the bro
motetracodeia hydrobromate originally employed.                After desiccation, first

   Out of  these ten bases four have been        prepared, and a substance corre
sponding in composition with a fifth (chloro-dicodeia-dimorphia) has also
been obtained ; but, from the great similarity in properties between all the
five substances and their high formulae, it is clear that no certainty as to
the purity of the missing intermediate bodies could exist, and therefore it
was not thought advisable to attempt their formation.

product, dissolved in warm water and precipitated by sodium carbonate,
is for the most part insoluble in ether, the insoluble portion having all the
properties of bromotetramorphia ; the etherial extract shaken with H CI
or  H Br  yields a viscid liquid, which, on standing, becomes filled with
crystals   consisting apparently of a mixture of the hydrochlorates or hy-
drobromates of deoxycodeia and a lower homologue, the latter predomi
nating when the digestion is performed in an open flask.                  Attempts to
prevent the formation of the lower homologue by continuing the digestion
with   H Br  for only two or three hours did not succeed, as the large quan
tity of unaltered bromocodide in the ether extract obtained prevents the
separation of the crystalline hydrochlorate or hydrobromate of deoxycodeia,
and hitherto no method of separating the deoxycodeia salt from its lower
homologue has been arrived at.

    From the above numbers, and more especially from the percentages of
  H, CI, and Br found, it appears that while specimen A may have con
 tained some little quantity of deoxycodeia, specimen 13 must have consisted
 almost wholly of the lower homologue ; to this body the name deoxymor-
 phia may appropriately be given (provisionally), to indicate that its com
 position bears the same relation to that of morphia as deoxycodeia to
 codeia.
    The numbers required for apomorphia salts        are very close to those actually
 obtained above,    viz. for hydrochlorate     C=67'22,      H=5'93, C1=1170;
 and for hydrobromate C=5862, H=5"17, Br=2299; but the entire
 absence   of emetic properties in all     these   specimens, as observed by Dr.
 Michael Foster, conclusively proves        that this base could not have beeH
 present.
    Further research is required before it can be decided with certainty
 which of the three oxygen atoms in codeia is removed in the formation
 of deoxycodeia ; the production of deoxymorphia with simultaneous evo
 lution of methyl bromide, however, indicates that the oxygen that links
 the methyl group to the rest of the codeia residue is still present in deoxy
 codeia and deoxymorphia, while the production of both from bromocodide
renders the following formulae probable       : —
          Codeia.                   Bromocodide.                    Deoxycodeia.

    Experiments are in progress to gain further insight into the structure of
the group C17 H17 NO.        By the action of hydriodic acid on codeia methyl
is eliminated as iodide, and the elements of free hydrogen and those of          HI
are added    on to this group ; from which, as well as from the easy poly
merization to form tetracodeia bases, it appears probable that some at least
 of the 17 carbon atoms are connected together somewhat after the
 fnshion of ethylene or acrylic acid, which unite readily with H I, H Br,
Ha, &c.     Again, the oxidizing action of Ag N03         on chlorotetramorphia is
accompanied by the production of COa, which renders it not improbable
that the third oxygen atom exists either as the group
                                                                     [CH(OH)]"     or

hydrochlorate B and those of a specimen of pure deoxycodeia-salt from
codeia (without evolution of methyl bromide), not the slightest difference
was discernible between the two ; in their physiological actions, too, as ob
served by Dr. Michael Foster, the two bodies seem perfectly alike, both
being utterly dissimilar from apomorphia, from which in all other respects
(qualitative reactions, percentage composition, &c.) they differ either not
at all or extremely little.
    The portion insoluble in ether of        the batch from which hydrochlorate
B   was    obtained was treated with        HC1 and fractionally precipitated by
strong acid several times successively ; this mode of treatment was adopted
rather than that with HBr, as a much larger yield is obtained thus, the
hydrochlorates of chlorotetracodeia and chlorotetramorphia being much
less soluble in dilute HC1 than the corresponding brominated bodies are in
dilute HBr.         Finally, nearly white flakes were obtained presenting all the
characters of chlorotetramorphia hydrochlorate,            and yielding the following
numbers after drying at 100°: —

    Hence the portion insoluble in ether must have been bromotetramorphia.
    The simultaneous formation of bromotetramorphia and deoxymorphia
from bromocodide is explainable in two ways : either

    Of   these two views, the first involves only known         substances     and reac
 tions similar to those already known in the           codeia series    of derivatives,

and is, moreover, probable from the circumstance that the numbers ob
tained in some instances indicate the presence of deoxycodeia as well u
deoxymorphia ; whilst the second view involves the not improbable exist
ence   of bromomorphide, C,T H,g Br N03 ; on the other hand, it will be
shown in the next section that equation (III.) represents a reaction which
does not readily take place with deoxycodeia, when not in the nascent con
dition at any rate.
   Whichever view be adopted, the ultimate formation of bromotetramorphia
requires the action of water on a brominated body, substituting hydroiyl
for bromine by a reaction perfectly parallel to that whereby                    codeia is
regenerated from chlorocodide by the action of water *, viz.
                  C1S H20 CI N0S+H30=HC1 + C1S HaiNOs.
             § 3. Action of Hydrobromic Acid on Deoxycodeia.
    In the hope that this action would give rise to methyl bromide and
deoxymorphia, deoxycodeia hydrobromate was heated to 100° for two
hours with about five parts of 48 per cent. HBr ; no change whatever
took place, no methyl bromide being found on opening the tube in which
the digestion was carried on after complete cooling.                  After an hour's
additional exposure to a temperature of 120°-130°, the contents of the tube
were found to have become black and tarry, while a small quantity of
methyl bromide floated on the top.         Precipitated by sodium carbonate, a
very dirty substance was obtained, which was almost insoluble in ether ;
the etherial extract, shaken with HBr, gave a small quantity of a tarry
hydrobromate, of which 01 330 grm. gave 0-0"90 AgBr or Br= 25*20 per
cent, deoxymorphia hydrobromate requiring only 22' 86 per cent.
    Nothing fit for analysis could be obtained from the portion insoluble in
ether, and the minute yield of pure deoxycodeia from codeia precluded                   a
 repetition of the experiment.
     § 4. On the  Physiological Action of the foregoing Codeia derivative*.
                       By Michael Foster, M.A., M.D.
    The hydrochlorate of chlorotetracodeia and the hydrobromate of bromo
 tetramorphia, in doses of a decigramme by subcutaneous injection or by the
 mouth,    produced in adult cats in a very few minutes a condition of great
 excitement, almost amounting to delirium, accompanied by a copious flow
 of saliva and great dilatation of the pupils.        Micturation and defalcation
 occurred in some instances, and vomiting was observed on two occasions
 with   the morphia-salt,    but was very slight.       The excitement was very
 peculiar,  being  apparently   due partly  to increased    sensitiveness to noises,
 and partly to an impulse to rush about.
    The   same doses  of the morphia-salt given to a young kitten produced the
 same  flow of saliva, dilatation of pupils, and excitement (without vomiting);

but the    stage  of excitement, which in adult    cats  passed  gradually off in a
few hours,     was followed by a condition marked by a       want of coordination
of    muscular movements, and presenting the most grotesque resemblance
to certain stages of alcoholic intoxication.      This stage was followed in turn
by sleepiness     and  stupor,  in which  the  kitten   was left at night ; in the
morning it was found dead.
     Two observations have shown that these salts paralyze (in dogs and cats)
the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric ; they also seem to lower the
internal tension, but want of material has prevented me from ascertaining
how this is brought about.
     On rabbits neither salt, even in doses of a decigramme, seems to have
any effect, except perhaps a slight excitement. There is no dilatation of
the pupils, no flow of saliva, and, if one observation can be trusted, no
paralysis of the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric.
     No marked difference      was  observable between      the two salts,  except
 that the morphia-salts      seemed rather more potent than the correspond
 ing codeia bodies.
     The   salts  of deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia given by mouth or by
 subcutaneous injection in doses of a decigramme, produced in adult cats,
 almost immediately after exhibition, a series of convulsions much more
 epileptic in character than tetanic.        In one case there was a distinct
 rotatory movement.
     In  a few   minutes these convulsions passed away, leaving the animal
  exhausted     and frightened.     Then followed a stage of excitement with
  dilated pupils and flow of saliva, very similar to the effects of the tetra-
  codeia and tetramorphia salts, but less marked.
      Doses of half a decigramme given to adult cats produced the stage of
  excitement only, without the convulsions.
      In no case, with any specimen of product, has vomiting been witnessed ;
  like the tetracodeia and tetramorphia products, the deoxycodeia and de
  oxymorphia salts appear to paralyze the inhibitory fibres of the pneumo
  gastric.    Trials with rabbits gave only negative results.
      No marked differences could be observed between the hydrochlorates
  and hydrobromates of deoxycodeia or deoxymorphia.
   VI. "   On the Measurement of the Chemical Intensity of Total Day
         light made at Catania during the Total Eclipse of Dec. 22, 1870."
         By Henky E. Roscoe, F.R.S., and T. E. Thorpe, F.R.S.E.
         Received    June 15, 1871.
                                     (Abstract.)
      The following communication contains the results of a series of measure
   ments of photochemical action made at Catania in Sicily, on Dec. 22nd,
    1870, during the total solar eclipse of that date, with the primary object
   of determining experimentally the relation existing between this action

 and the changes of area in the exposed portion of the sun's disk. The
  attempt to establish this relation has already been made by one of us from
 the results of observations carried out by Captain John Herschel, RE,,
  F.R.S., at Jamkandi, in India, during the total eclipse of Aug. 18,            18&>.
  Unfortunately the   state   of the weather at Jamkandi at the time of tbt
 eclipse was very unfavourable, and the results were therefore not of so
 definite a character as could be desired, and it appeared important to
 verify them by further observation. The method of measurement adopted
 is that described by one of us in the Bakerian Lecture for 1865 ; the ob
 servations were made in the Garden of the Benedictine Monastery of San
 Nicola, at Catania, the position of which, according to the determination
 of Mr. Schott of the United States' Coast Survey, is lat. 37° 30' 12"N,
 long. lh 0' 18" £. In order to obtain data for determining the variation
 in chemical intensity caused by the alteration in the sun's altitude during
 the eclipse, observations were made on the three previous            days, during
 which the sky was perfectly cloudless.
     In the following Table the observations taken at about the same hours
 are grouped together    : —

    The  above numbers confirm the conclusion formerly arrived at,          viz. that
the relation between total chemical intensity and sun's altitude          is repre
sented by a straight line, or by the equation
                               CI, =CI„+ const, xa,
where CI„ signifies the chemical intensity at any altitude a in circular mea
sure, CI„ the chemical intensity at 0°, and const, a a number derived from
the observations.
    The observations on the day of the eclipse (the 22nd) were commenced
about nine o'clock a.m., and up to the time of first contact were made re
gularly at intervals of about an hour.          The sky up to this point was
cloudless, and the measurements almost absolutely coincided with the
mean numbers of the preceding day's observations.            As the eclipse pro
gressed, and the temperature of the air fell, clouds were rapidly formed,

 1871.]           Intensity of Daylight in Eclipse of 1870.                513
and from lh 40' up to the time of totality it was impossible to make any
observations, as the sun was never unclouded for more than a few seconds
at  a time.   As the illuminated portion of the solar disk gradually increased
after totality, the clouds rapidly disappeared, the amount falling from
9 (overcast =10) to 3 in about fifteen minutes. The observations were
then regularly continued to within a few minutes of last contact.
    Although the disk and by far the largest portion of the heavens were
completely obscured by clouds during totality, rendering any determina
tion of the photochemical action perfectly valueless for our special object,
it was yet thought worth while to attempt to estimate the chemical inten
sity of the feebly diffused light  at this time, which certainly is capable  of
producing photographic action.
    Immediately after the supposed commencement of totality the slit was
opened, and the sensitive paper exposed for ninety-five seconds.       Not the
slightest action, however, could be detected on the paper, and we therefore
believe that we are correct in estimating the intensity of the chemically
active light present at certainly not more than 0-003 of the unit which we
adopt, and probably much less.
    The Table containing the experimental numbers and the graphic repre
sentation of them are given in the memoir.         By a graphical method the
relative  areas of the sun uneclipsed at the times of observation were
obtained   ; and these are seen in column 3 of Table II., the area of the
unobscured sun being taken as unity.
    Column 2 gives the results of the photochemical observations made
during the eclipse obtained from the graphical mean, and corrected for
variation in the sun's altitude, the total chemical action immediately before
first contact being taken    as  unity.    Column  1 gives  the apparent solar
times of observation.

    From these observations we conclude that      the diminution   in the total
 chemical intensity of the sun's light during an eclipse is directly propor
 tional to the magnitude of the obscuration.

  The question of the variation of (1) the direct and (2) the diffused
radiation is next discussed.     On comparing the curve representing the
chemical intensity of diffused light with the curve of solar obscuration, it
is found that the rate of diminution   in chemical action exerted by the dif
fused light is up to a certain point greater than corresponds to the portion
of eclipsed sun, whilst from this point up to totality the rate of diminutioa
becomes less than corresponds to the progress of the eclipse.        The same
rapid  diminution  in the chemical  action of the diffused daylight during the
early periods of the eclipse was also observed at Jamkandi ; it is doubtless
clue to the dark body of the moon cutting off the light from the brightly
illuminated portion of sky lying round the solar disk.
    The results of the observations at Catania are then compared with those
made at Moita, near Lisbon, and communicated to the Society in 1870.
This comparison shows          a   striking coincidence between the two sets of ob
servations.    In each     case    it is seen that the relation between solar altitude
and total chemical intensity is represented by a straight line, although the
Catania observations slightly exceed, by a constant difference, those made
at Moita in conformity with the slight difference in latitude, and with the
fact that the former determinations were made at a greater elevation above
the sea-level.
   The Catania observations further confirm the fact which we formerly
announced, that for altitudes below 50° the amount of chemical action
effected in the plane of the horizon by diffused daylight is greater than that
exerted by direct radiation, and also that at altitudes below 1 0° direct sun
light is almost completely robbed of its chemically active rays.

   The main object of the present communication is to correct some inac
curacies both of reasoning and calculation contained in two papers by Mr.
Shanks, viz. " On the Extension of the Value of the Base of Napier's
Logarithms ; of the Napierian Logarithms of 2, 3, 5, and JO ; and of the

    Mr. Shanks obtains the value of y from this formula by making          #==10,
20,   50, 100, 200, 500, and     1000, and remarks, as a curious coincidence,
that the number of decimal        places obtained from x being made equal to
10, 20, 50, and 100 is nearly proportional to ^/lO, »/20, »/50, and
                                                                           */ 100.
On p. 432 he gives       a Table of the number of decimal places obtainable
from the formula when x has the values 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500,
and 1000, and from it draws the inference that "we may fairly infer that
when n is increased in a geometrical ratio, the corresponding number of
decimals obtained in the value of E increases only in something like an
arithmetical one, and that probably from 50,000 to 100,000 terms in the
Harmonic Progression would require to be summed in order to obtain 100
places of decimals in the value of E, Euler's constant."
    Algebraically, of course, y is independent of x in the formula (i), but
arithmetically, since the series ultimately becomes divergent, the value of y
is so far dependent on x that for a given value of x the series will only
afford a certain number of decimal places.        The number of decimal places
 directly obtainable is equal to the number of ciphers which precede the first
 significant figure in the value of the numerically least term of the series.

     The number of decimal places practically obtainable is limited by the
 difficulty of calculating the Bernoulli's numbers, of which only thirty-one
have been hitherto obtained.        By means of these, however, 156 decimals
could be obtained of y when      .%•¦=100 ; and by deducing a few of the subse
quent terms, each from its predecessor (knowing                 their ratio),   20 places
more could be obtained without difficulty.
    It is clear therefore that Mr. Shanks's      values    of y obtained from .r=500
and .r=1000 ought to agree beyond the 59th decimal, if correctly calcu
lated.     The author at first supposed that the want of agreement was due
to an insufficient number of the terms involving the Bernoulli's numbers
having been included, and he therefore undertook the calculation of this
portion of the expression for .r=500 and x= 1000 to 100 decimal places ;
the results, however, still showed     a  difference in the 59th place.
    In order to determine where the error existed, the same portion of the
 constant was calculated also to 100 places, both from .r=100 and a'=200 ;
 all the calculations were performed wholly in duplicate, and so much care
was taken that the author felt a strong conviction of their accuracy.                  It
should be noticed that the agreement of all the four results would not
 necessarily prove the accuracy of that value of y ; for any error made in

    It was therefore evident that the only means                 of ensuring freedom        from
error in the harmonic series was to recalculate it. The lowest value of x
which would suffice for a verification was 100 ; the author therefore calcu

    Mr.    Shanks computed log 2 and log 5 from formulae of the form
                             Log   2 =  2  (7  P+5Q + 3R),
                             Log   5  = 2
                                           (16  P+   12 Q+ 7 R),
P, Q, and R being infinite       series  (Proc. Roy. Soc. toI. vi. p. 397;
                                                                             '

tion    of the  Circle,' p. 88).
    If,  therefore, any error was made in the calculation of           P say, it would
produce errors in log 2 and log 5 proportional to 7 and 16. On trial it
was found that sixteen times (E) was equal to seven times (F), the difference
being only such as an error of a unit in the 100th decimal of (E) or(F) would
produce.       This afforded a moral proof that Mr. Shanks had made an
error equal to one-fourteenth of (E) in the calculation of P, or
                                31+3.31 I+5.313 +
which has rendered his values of log 2 and log 5 incorrect, and that (with
the exception of the error previously noticed) the harmonic series was
summed correctly.
    Since log 3 was calculated from the formula
                             Log  3  = 2 (11    P + 8Q + 5 R),
 its value is also incorrect, as also is that of log      10 (log 2-f log 5) and the
  modulus (the reciprocal of log 10).
     The values of all these quantities are given to 205 decimal places in
 vol. vi. Proceedings of the Royal Society, p. 397 ; but all the figures after
 the 5 9 th decimal place are incorrect in each case.

  After the completion of the above paper, the author found that Mr.
Shanks had, in second, third, and fourth supplementary papers on the
Constant*,        extended his calculations          so as to determine        y     from x=20flfl,
5000, and 10,000.
   The values so obtained all differ in the sixtieth decimal                             ;   in   fact the
higher x   tnken, the further from the truth are the results,

in the logarithms are multiplied by larger factors.
   The calculation for x=2000 affords     verificationa                of the        error of

out of   aproposed Tnble, and then Sumner's line (the line on which the
observation shows the ship to be) was to be interpolated, dividing the

nation from two of the tabular numbers.                  I find a better plan in practice
to be as follows : —
       (1) Take      two solutions out  of  the Table as directed in my previous paper.
       (2) Taking       the two hour-angles         and the two altitudes      from    these
two solutions, interpolate to the              nearest  minute the hour-angle      and the
altitude corresponding to the correct declination, according to the simple
proportion of its differences from the declinations of the two solutions ;
and estimate, by inspection, the proper azimuth to the nearest half degree,
from the azimuths shown in the two solutions.
       (3) Using the interpolated hour-angle, azimuth, and altitude found by
 clause (2), find on the chart, in the assumed parallel of latitude, the point
 whose longitude is the difference between the interpolated hour-angle and
 the Greenwich hour-angle at the time of the observation ; through this
 point draw, by aid of a protractor, a line inclined to the north and south at
 an angle equal to the azimuth, and on the proper side according to whether
 the observation was made before or after noon; on this azimuthal line*
 measure off towards the sun              a  length (miles for minutes) equal to the
 correct altitude of observation above the interpolated altitude of clause (2) ;
 and through the point thus reached draw a perpendicular to the azimu
 thal line.         This perpendicular is Sumner's line.
       The Table (of which        a specimen page was shown in my former commu
 nication)       has now been completed by Mr. Koberts, and has been in my
  hands long enough to allow me to test its use in actual practice.                   I  find
  the assistance of compasses for measuring off the assumed colatitude
  preferable to the slip of card with numbers which I first suggested ; and I
  find the process to be altogether very easy and unfatiguing (in respect to
  fatigue a great contrast to the ordinary method).               I find that all the cases
  (as azimuth and hour-angle both acute, azimuth acute and hour-angle
  obtuse, or azimuth and hour-angle both obtuse, or, again, declination greater
  than latitude, but of same name, and declination of opposite name to lati
  tude) work out without ambiguity or perplexity.                  Still the mere fact of
  there being different cases may possibly deter practical navigators from leav
   ing the ordinary method, which, though considerably longer and much more
   laborious, has the excellent quality of presenting no variety of cases.                  I
  intend, however, to push forward the preparation of a short paper of prac
   tical directions, illustrated by examples of all ordinary and critical cases,
   and to publish it with the Table ; so that practical men may have an
   opportunity of judging from actual experience whether the plan of working
   Sumner's method which           I have proposed will be useful to them or not.
         I thought it unnecessary in my former communication to remark that
    every determination       of longitude    at sea (except from soundings       or sights
        * It is unnecessary to mark this azimuthal on the chart.    By holding one side of a
    "             "
       set square
                    (or other proper drawing instrument for making right angles) along the
    azimuthal line, the Sumner lino perpendiculartoitis readily drawn, and this "Sumner
    line," or Hue of equal altitude, is the only mark which need be actually made on the
    paper.

Shipping Gazette') are of opinion that an explicit warning of the kind
might be desirable in connexion with any publication tending to bring
Sumner's method into more general use than it has been hitherto.

         Received       June 15, 1871.
   The universal undercurrent theory so fascinatingly advocated by Maurr
and others, and more recently by the late Dr. Forchhammer, has now been
so remarkably supported and maintained in the enlarged views pronounced
by Dr. Carpenter in his recent papers and lectures before the Royal and
other societies, and is of so interesting and important a nature in connexion
with the study of the laws regulating the natural history and geological
results of the past, as well as of the phenomena in progress in the ocean
and seas in communication with                   it,            and data upon
                                                       that the assumed     facts
which     they are based deserve, and indeed require, in the interest of sound
science    and philosophy, to be carefully considered and analyzed before they
can be     accepted as  grand law such as

     Dr.Carpenter then refers to the observations and opinions* of the late
Dr. Forchhammer of Copenhagen, for the conditions and facts that are
said or assumed to exist between the Baltic and German Ocean in regard to
the interchange of a surface and undercurrent between them so as to
restore the lost density of the former caused by a supposed continued
outward surface-current, and thus maintain the equilibrium or normal
conditions between them.
     As    I shall
              be obliged to refer to these opinions as assumed facts here
after,     I
         must here dwell more particularly upon what has been assumed in
regard to the Black Sea and jEgean, regarding which Dr. Carpenter states
              "
as follows : — The condition of the Euxine is precisely parallel to that of
the   Baltic      ;   and   a   surface-current is well known to be constantly flowing
outwards through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, carrying with it (as in
the case of the Baltic) a large quantity of salt.   Now, as the enormous
volume of fresh water discharged into the Euxine by the Danube, the
Dneiper, and the Don would in time wash the whole of the salt out of its
basin, it is obvious that its density can only be maintained at its constant
amount (about two-fifths that of ordinary sea-water) by a continual
inflow of denser water from the iEgean, the existence of which inflow,
therefore, may be predicted on the double ground of a priori and a posteriori
                 '
necessity.'
   The first consideration then                is,
                                   whether these predictions, as necessary
premises  to his  enlarged theory, are true both for the Baltic and Black
seas, since upon them the soundness of the theory mainly depends.
 I      am therefore        induced, as   frequently requested to do, to
                                            I   have    been
give my experience and knowledge of the conditions of the surface and
deeps of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, and next analyze the observa
tions of Dr. Forchhammer to see whether his opinions and conclusions are
true in regard to the Baltic, viz. that the density of the Baltic main                is
tained by an undercurrent from the denser waters of the Kattegat and
German Ocean.     For       through my knowledge and experience of the
                                  it   is
conditions existing at the Black Sea Straits and ^gean Sea, from repeated
experiments in them on temperature and densities, &c, that, with all due
deference to the judgment of Dr. Carpenter,      am obliged to regard those
                                                               I
advanced      him as fallacious, and to maintain that, in adopting them, he
                 by
is  advocating    theory upon erroneous premises. It

 for me to briefly show here the nature and extent of these investigations,
 either published or unpublished, in support of my reasons for so differing
 from     Dr. Carpenter.

Atlantic, or of the Black       Sea, do not intermingle, and exert their individual
temperature in the depths of the central basins. The temperature of the
deeper waters of the Mediterranean, Archipelago, Sea of Marmora, and
Black        Sea are consequently each dependent on local influences, namely
from the solar or atmospheric temperature above them. Therefore the
minimum temperature of their deeper parts corresponds nearly with the
mean annual temperature over them.
      *'  In the Grecian Archipelago I long since showed it to be constant at
about 55° in depths from 100 fathoms downwards.                   In that sea the
temperature of the intermediate depths between 100 fathoms and the
 surface in the summer season ranges from 55° to 76°, and, indeed, even up
to 80° and 86° sometimes, in the littoral waters of enclosed gulfs and
 shallow bays.
       " In the eastern and western basins of the Mediterranean it will have
 consequently a higher minimum temperature than that ; and I find that it
 is about 59° in all depths from 300 down to 2000 fathoms.             But between
 the depths of 30 and of 300 fathoms there is an increasing variation from
 that temperature to 73° and to 75° in the summer months, but confined
  more particularly to the depths between 100 fathoms and the surface.
       "But in the winter months of December, January, February, and March,
  the upper depth is nearly at the minimum temperature of the deepest part
  below, namely from 59° to 62°, varying with the locality and depths of
  water there.
       " Thus it   is that in these months the surface and deep waters of the
  Mediterranean are at a constant temperature of about 10° or 15° above
  that of the atmosphere.
       " After the month of March, however, the solar influence begins sensibly
   to raise both sea and atmospheric temperatures, so that in July, in the
   southern part of the Mediterranean, it is at its maximum of about 75°
   from the surface down to the depth of about 30 fathoms."
        Having been thus brief in stating the facts obtained in regard to the
   distribution    of the temperatures of the deeps, I shall also be as brief as will
   be consistent    with the due illustration of the more important facts and results
    in describing the observations for ascertaining these surface- and under
    currents in one or two of the localities in question, viz. the Dardanelles
    and Bosphorus, where Dr. Carpenter has assumed and predicted conditions
    as an absolute necessity, and upon which predictions he has mainly founded
    his enlarged views and theories.
         Now it will easily be realized on consideration,      that  the testing of
     surface-currents for their various rates in different depths, or of under
     currents of small amount where they exist, in proof of this theory, as a
     general fact, is an experiment that requires much delicacy and nicety in
     the mode of operation and the means by which it is attempted or effected.
     I   therefore never attempted such experiments by the use of any bulky
     object, such as a boat, that offered both great resistance to the surface
                                                                     2t2

density as that of the Sea of Marmora, viz. 20°, the Bosphorus being
about 14°, and Black Sea surface 13£°, and about 15° below 100 fathoms.
Therefore in this part of the Dardanelles, between the surface and the

result of the intermixture in the deeps of the narrows and from the en
circling eddy or return-current by the south shore in that part, as in

   The plan       I
                adopted for ascertaining whether any such undercurrents
existed, as well as of the rate of the surface-current in descending depths,
was as follows        :   —
   A  suspended sinker, or current-anchor, was made in several forms to
test the most simple and effective form.   Sometimes a vertical cross was
used, which was formed of boards, so as to offer a resisting surface every
way when hanging vertically with the weight or lead attached to its base.
More generally a large weighted disk or enlarged log-ship was used, and
when weighted with a weight consistent with size of the disk, and also of
the line a%id float, was slung like a kite, the weight being in the place of the
tail.   "When thus slung it would of course hang nearly vertical in all
depths, and offer a sufficient resistance to prevent its being moved by the
friction of the surface-current upon the float used to suspend it. It will
be thus seen that the operation   of testing slow currents in the deeps is one
of great delicacy, and therefore requires great nicety and care in the mode
and apparatus for doing              it,
                             for scientific dependence and aims.
   The float that, after many experiments,         found to answer best was
                                                           I
one made of thin copper or block-tin, in the form of an elongated air
tight cylinder,   or  4feet in length, and pointed at one end to offer least
                               5
resistance to the surface-current passing it.  The other end was truncated
or flat, where two loops were fixed in which    small rod or staff with
                                                            a

could be placed, to render its position conspicuous, without adding to its
resistance    or weight.   The suspended kite, or current-anchor, was then
 weighted    to about one-third of what the float would bear in perfectly still
 water, without being wholly immersed.

slung by its corners like a kite, so as to act as a suspended anchor or sinker,

passing the float when the sinker    was at this depth, it follows that both
float   and sinker were in the same amount of current, or in the upper stratum
of   the current ; that      is,

servable passing the buoy or float, which measured about 0'3 of knot per           a
hour, or just one-third of the rate of current running past the float attached
to the shot at the bottom in 350 fathoms therefore the rate of current at

     The suspended sinker was then lowered to 20 fathoms, when there ap
peared    much greater amount of current passing the float, and the rate was
           a
found by the log-line to be about 0*5 of mile per hour, thus showing that

the float of the suspended sinker was held in check by the sinker being in
a current about half that of the surface-current, or running at only about
0*4 of    mile per hour at 20 fathoms' depth.
           a
   Again, on lowering the sinker to 30 fathoms there was immediately
observed an increase of the superficial current passing its float, showing,
therefore, still diminishing current as the suspended sinker descended,
                 a
since     it   was thus kept more stationary.
     Then      at 40, 50, 100, 200, and 300 fathoms the rate           of the current passing
 the float of the suspended sinker was about 0-8 of mile, — that   a  nearly            is,
 that of the surface-current when in all depths below 40 fathoms, so that an
 outward current of 0"1 of knot per hour would appear to exist there but
                                   a                                                          ;
 in reality this was the result of using in this instance too bulky float, by

 which the suspended sinker was dragged along at that rate still water,        ;
 therefore, undoubtedly existed below 40 fathoms, as confirmed by the density
 experiments and others in those depths.
   This result was given to show the confusion and error almost sure to arise
 from using bulky apparatus as  float, that offered too much resistance to

 being an opposite current to the current observed running  past the fixed
 float, the current then observed running    past the float attached to the sus
 pended sinker or current-anchor     would have measured       greater rate than
                                                                           a

 have been dragged along by the undercurrent in an opposite direction to
 the surface-current, its float would have presented the singular phenomenon
 of going to windward of the fixed one     or, in other words, would have run
                                                 ;
 up against    the stream instead of down with the surface-stream.  This, on
 a   slight consideration of the phenomena, will be evident, and the delicacy

of the operation too, especially when testing any very slow ocean-current,
of only O'l of a mile per hour or less, which is quite practicable, as I bare
frequently done. And it is rendered sure and easy by always having a fiied
float with sinker at the bottom as a point of reference, even where objeeU
arc near and charts are correct, and also by using very fine twine as a log-
line to each float, and allowing it to run out from five to ten times the
usual interval in measuring a ship's rate. The diagram on p. 537 wil
illustrate the matter*.
    The diagram referred to will illustrate the plan, and the result will
be more comprehensible and satisfactory, because    sooner completed, if we
suppose the trials to have been made from two or three boats (instead of fan
only one boat), each being provided with one or two buoys and suspended
sinkers to suit, and with lines to each arranged for different depths ; and if also
a fine log-line is attached to each float for measuring the distance it drifts
in a given time, and from it the rate of each float, the boats being always
kept abreast of each other.    For although each float, from the different
times each suspended sinker will take to reach its intended depth, will bare
drifted away to some small varying distance from the boats and stationary
float, these varying intervals will correspond to the stray line paid out in
measuring a ship's rate through the water ; and being noted in the usual way
(as the rate-lines will be duly marked at intervals of 10 feet), or by a piece
of cork or rag attached to each, when at the given signal the interval,
by watch or glass, is simultaneously commenced to be noted, the deduc
tion of this stray portion from the whole length run out in the arranged
interval of five or ten minutes or more, according to the speed of the cur
rent, will give the surface-rate of each, and the consequent rates of the
 currents in which the suspended sinkers are lowered are easily deduced
 from them.

 around and across the Sea of Marmora and through the Dardanelles, and
 at no greater depth than from 20 to 40 fathoms, viz. that of the btniet
 ridges between the Black Sea and jEgean, there occurs for several davs                                           in
 the year   strong reverse current into the Black Sea from the J2gean. Un
               a
 reverse current    frequent during the autumn and winter months, when
                           is
 the Black Sea rivers are at their lowest, so that the Black Sea level thai                              is
 frequently overbalanced                by
                              the pressure of westerly gales in the llediter-
 ranean or JEgewa.
    Therefore     this recurring return current into the Black Sea tkt
                      it   is
 maintains, as found to be the curious or interesting fact, the JUgean a
                     I
 Mediterranean density in the deeps of the Sea of Marmora in all depths
 below about 40 fathoms, and therefore that restores also the lost                                       salinitr
 of the Black Sea through                  the flow of diluted water so prevalent                       as   a   sur
 face-current from it.
  This return-current occurs sometimes for two or three days at       time,                              a
and occasionally at  rate even greater than the general outflowing current
                                a
of and
    2      knots.
               3    The same occurs at the Kcrtch Straits.
  Therefore, instead of the Black Sea being washed fresh, unless there
was     an undercurrent             to restore     as Dr. Carpenter argues, its noma!
                                                   it,
density       is   restored     by the  surface return-current, as also that of the Sea                            of
Azof.
  But   I      am induced to believe, as          I      have elsewhere            stated*, that       theBlacl
Sea has not become              a   diluted or brackish sea from               a   previously salt      sea, but,
on the contrary, from a freshwater lake has become                                 a   brackish   one.
    This Iinfer to be the fact from the latest deposits existing around the
shores of the Black Sea, Sea of Marmora, and Dardanelles being of fresh
water origin,   large Dreissena and
                       a              freshwater Cockle in them being

error.
   Having thus shown these physical conditions as facts in connexion
with    the    Black    Sea, and that the undercurrent                       theory    isa   fallacy   where      it
was expected and insisted upon as being       predicted necessity, as con

the densities between the Black Sea and^Egean, viz. 13° and 29°, as shown

conclusions to be drawn from the facts he gives regarding the densities and
currents, and thus led Dr. Carpenter to adopt them as follows : —
      " Now if it can be shown that a similar vertical circulation is maintained
in the opposite direction, when the conditions of the case are altogether
reversed, the explanation above given may, it is submitted, be regarded as
having a valid title to acceptance.          Such a converse case is presented by
 the Baltic, an inland basin which communicates with the German Ocean by
 three channels — the Sound, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt, of which
 the Sound is the principal. The amount of fresh water discharged into the
 Baltic is largely in excess of the quantity lost from its surface by evapora
 tion ; and thus its level would be continually raised if it were not kept down
  by a constant surface-current, which passes outwards through the channels
 just mentioned. But the influx of fresh water reduces the density of the
  Baltic water ; and as the water which the outward current is continually
  carrying off contains a large quantity of salt, there would be a progressive
  reduction of that density, so that the basin would at last come to be filled
  -with fresh water if it were not for a deeper inflow.        Such an inflow of denser
  water might      be  predicted  on  Principle  VI.  as  a physical necessity, arising
  from the constant want of equilibrium between the lighter column at the
  Baltic end of the Sound and the heavier column at its outlet in the German
   Ocean ; and that such an undercurrent into the Baltic has an actual existence,
   was proved two hundred years ago by an experiment of the same kind as that
   hy which we have recently proved the existence of an undercurrent out of the
   Mediterranean.        This experiment is cited by Dr. Smith (loc. cit) in his dis
   cussion of the Gibraltar current, as supplying an analogical argument for his
   hypothesis of the existence of an undercurrent in the Strait of Gibraltar ;
   but he does not make any attempt to assign a physical cause for the move
   ment in either case "*. — Proceedings of Royal Society, vol. xix. p. 213.
       I need only add, as a remark to this latter part, that a greater density
   below was no proof of an undercurrent, as shown by the contrary fact in the
   Dardanelles and Sea of Marmora.
       In his paper in the Philosophical Transactions for        1865,  "On the Com
   position of Sea-water in the different parts of the Ocean," in page 230
   Dr. Forchhammer says, " In the Baltic likewise the water from the deeps
   contains more salt than that from the surface. The upper-current goes
   generally (not always) out of the Baltic, the reverse of the Mediterranean.
   The    cause is evident, the excess    of atmospheric water in the Baltic from
   the rivers surrounding      it       With the    assistance of Captain Prosilius, in
    1846, who commanded the vessel stationed at Elsinore, the surface-current
   was observed on 134 days, from 27th April to 11th September; of which
   on 24 days it ran from the north, on 86 from the south, and on 24 days
    there was no surface-current at all."
       * " Prof. Forchhammer fully confirms Dr. Smith's statement, and further shows that
    the water which thus returns to tho Baltic has the density of the Sound water, the
    ¦urface-current being formed of the much lighter Baltic water."

  Dr. Forchhammer's observations    are all upon the densities at different
depths in the Sound, and  some few temperatures at the surface and bottom.
There were, unfortunately, none upon the rate of the surface-current                                 in
descending depths, as carried out by me in the Mediterranean and Blsc*

is, by the fact recorded       by
                            him of the density being greater at the bottom
of the Sound than at the surface, he would have ascertained a correspond
ing diminution in the outward rate of current in descent from the surface.
But he has inferred, from the fact of there being      slight increase
                                                                  a        den            of
sity at the bottom  of Copenhagen    harbour,  viz. of 17*546   at the  bottom
and of only 15*845 at the surface, that there was necessarily an undercurrent
there from the denser water of the Kattegat and German Ocean for                             ;
he says that at Copenhagen the density was

that the undercurrent   at that season reached Copenhagen."     Thus qmte
overlooking  the remarks  he has made  upon fluctuations in the saline den

                           was running
into the Baltic from the Kattegat and German Ocean, and of course then
              I
doing what have shown to occur in the Sea of Marmora and Black Sea,
¦with   every recurring and return-current    into them, viz. restoring the lost
saline density of the surface and   deeps   of those seas.  Now the proportion
of    the inward return surface-current from the denser seas is very much
greater in the Baltic Straits than in the Black Sea Straits, and, moreover,
the depth on the dividing ridges of the Sound and Great Belt leading into
the Baltic does not exceed 9 fathoms, or about 50 feet only ; and thus,
even here (notwithstanding the great supply of fresh water from the Baltic
rivers into the Baltic between April and September, when the observations
¦were made, and, therefore, the time of greatest supply in the whole year),
the outside influences of wind &c. so outbalanced the surface-level be
tween the Baltic and German Ocean, as to produce twenty-four days inward
 current in that period, and twenty-four days without any current, then
 stopping the Baltic outflow in fact. So that Dr. Forchhammer himself
 shows that the phenomena of the currents to and from the Baltic are,
 at one time, a mass of diluted water outwards over the very shallow
 barrier forming the straits, and then a run of the Kattegat denser water
 inwards for the restoration of the normal saltness. What need, then,
 was there for looking to an undercurrent as the great source of such
 a resupply, when it was evidently produced by a greater agency during
 the twenty-four days return surface-current inwards, when the German
  Ocean must have stood at a higher level than the Baltic? One more remark
 is necessary to show another fallacious conclusion of Dr. Forchhammer in
  favour of the undercurrent theory.       In p. 233 he says, " I observed on
  the 2nd of March, 1850, the temperature of the undercurrent at a depth
  of 108 feet to be 360-8 Fahr., while the temperature of the surface was
  340,9 Fahr.," — thus intimating that because he found a higher tempera
  ture and density in 108 feet at Elsinore it positively indicated an under
  current from the German Ocean or Kattegat, the conditions of density and
  temperature being those of the outside sea and not of the Baltic. But these
  were the natural conditions of things there, because in the depth of 108 feet
  at Elsinore he was in a depth more than twice that of the submarine shallow
   barrier that separates the Baltic from the Kattegat, and on the Kattegat
   side of the ridge.  The barrier or ridge is at the southern end of both the
   Great Belt and   Sound,  and is thirty miles to the south of Elsinore, which
   is therefore on the German Ocean side of the ridge ; and, moreover, the
   depth of 108 feet at Elsinore was in the greatest depth of the Kattegat any
   where within fifty or sixty miles northward, and the barrier ridge is only
   30 feet deep here.    The undercurrent view, then, has no ground of sup
   port from this fact ; but the contrary, for the increase of temperature and
   density was found exactly where it was natural to expect
                                                               it,that is, in the
   region of depths below the comparatively shallow barrier of about 50 feet
   in depth which separates the Baltic from the Kattegat  ;  and especially so as

                                                                                           I

it     in the depth of 108 feet, so considerably below the skimming snrfece-
     was
current of lighter water flowing from the Baltic. The denser and warmer
water thus found in 108 feet was therefore a continuity of the wanna
and denser waters of the deeps of the Kattegat          and German Ocean.
But the Kattegat being shallow, with a wide entrance between it and the
German Ocean, it has no deep trough so much below the separating barrier
for retaining still water as in the Sea of Marmora ; its waters would, there
fore, fluctuate in density throughout,      between the densities   of   the Bsltk
and German Ocean.
   As Dr. Carpenter has made the fallacy regarding the Baltic conditions «
the authority of Prof. Forchhammer's statements and opinions the strongest
reason and basis of his enlarged theory of universal undercurrents, I mas
refer to another circumstance, another error of the late Professor in as
suming the existence of an undercurrent at the Sound flowing into the Baltic
when the surface-current was running out, viz. the fact often observed in the
Sound, that ships of deep draught are frequently carried past the lighter
draught ship when sailing together into the Baltic through the Sound*.
   There      however, another and more probable explanation of the phe
            is,
nomenon, namely, that the deep-draught ships are, by the lowness                   of
their keels in comparison with that of the light-draught craft, under                  a
lesser influence of the outward surface-current, through the whole strength
of the current not descending to the depth of their greater draught, as
surface-currents always diminish in descent.        The mean strength of           a
current felt by    vessel drawing twenty feet of water would consequently
                    a
be less than the mean strength felt by one drawing only eight or ten feet          ;
this will be evident, especially as the surface-current from the Baltic can
not descend much below the depth of sixty feet, viz. that of the Barrier
ridge across the Sound and Great and Little Belts, moreover there            is
                                                                             no
tidal influence there to force or confuse the outflowing surface- current from
the Baltic.
    Judging from these explanations and facts there appears to be really
no evidence, from the observations of Prof. Forchhammer, that an under
 current   is  real necessity for the restoration of the lost salinity of the
                a
 Baltic any more than in the Black Sea but, on the contrary, that the
                                                  ;
evidences  and facts are confirmatory of there being no such undercurrent,
and no such necessity for one in either case.
   Therefore, finding the undercurrent theory fallacious in both instances,
I have no faith in its application to the Ocean as     grand law of inter

Mediterranean as compared with the deeps of the Atlantic Ocean on the
west side of the 150- or 160-fathom barrier that separates the one from the
other at the western embouchure of the Straits of Gibraltar.
    The very high temperature of the depths of the Mediterranean below
about 200 fathoms, in all seasons, as compared with that of the Atlantic
and Pacific (where, according to Ross, Belcher, Denham, Pullen, and
others, it seems to remain at about 39£° Fahr. * in all latitudes between
the Arctic and Antarctic zones) results apparently from its insulation
 from the Atlantic deeps by the 150-fathom bank or submarine ridge across
 the entrance of the Gibraltar Straits, and thus appears to have settled
into a mean resulting from a small terrestrial influence from below and
the large solar influence above, since the normal temperature is constantly
 at 59° t at all depths below 100 to 200 fathoms.
    The fluctuations of temperature in the Mediterranean Sea are conse
 quently confined to this upper zone of about 100 fathoms, in which the
 temperature varies with the seasons, being in the summer and autumn
 from 10° to 20° higher than the normal temperature, whilst in winter it
 rises up at the surface to the normal temperature of 59° — 4°, viz. 55° ;
 and is then even sometimes 10° lower at the surface and a few fathoms
 below      viz. in January and February, the coldest months.

  Had the normal temperature of the Mediterranean been as low as that of
  the Atlantic, the superficial influence would no doubt have extended down
  wards to the same depths as in the Atlantic. Upon the first consideration of
  these facts, however, the inference seems to be, that the Atlantic deeps are
  under the influence of cooling-down undercurrents from the poles. But
  appreciable undercurrent movements as      universal movement (such as the
                                                     a
  theory advocates)    have no belief in, except, probably, where two great
                           I
  streams meet, such as the Arctic current and the Gulf-stream.
       It   has    well shown, too, in support of this opinion, during the
                    been
  soundings   taken across the Atlantic, that perfectly still water reigns in              a
  large area of its deeps, by the fact of the sounding-line, on several occa
  sions, having coiled itself upon the sinker when some 200 or 300 fathoms
  more than the actual depth had been accidentally or intentionally     paid out
  from the ship, and thus the coils came up in       bunch together round the

the lead at the bottom, as well as before it reached the bottom, so that no
incline of the line from a perfectly vertical course of descent could have
occurred for several hundred fathoms above the bottom ; all must have
been  perfectly still water there, for the deviation of the line for a few
inches only out of the perpendicular in the lower depths would have
prevented the line from coiling itself around the upright lead, and jo
from  this perfect stillness the lead returned to the surface with the
excess of 200 fathoms coiled round it*.      Now it is perfectly impos
sible that the ship could have been kept stationary over the same spat
in the Atlantic, under the most favourable circumstances,   even for a
few minutes, much less so during the time a sounding-line                  takes to          de
scend in about 2000 fathoms ; for the combined influence                   of   swell    and
of the smallest superficial current during this time would drift her
from it considerably, as must be evident to every one.         Hence it will
be perceived that, unless perfectly still water existed iu the lower depths,
no coiling together of the excess of line paid out around the lead could
occur; and as it occurred on several occasions,            I
                                                       have been led to in
terpret the fact, as did Capt. Dayman, as being a most interesting and
satisfactory test, where it occurred, of the perfect stillness of the ocean
deeps there.
     It
     is shown by the few soundings that have been taken in the Atlantic,
that probably a continuous depth of at least 2000 fathoms extends along
it   between   the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
   The consideration of the above points, then, opens up the question of how
this low normal temperature of the Atlantic and Pacific deeps is retained
in continuity, with a higher terrestrial temperature below, as generally
supposed, and a higher atmospheric temperature above — whether it is
chiefly, if not entirely, due to the horizontal conduction of this low tempera
ture from the Arctic and Antarctic zones and seas during the long ages
the present poles have been the sources of cold, combined also with the
great density resulting from this low normal state, and consequent ten
dency of such cold and dense water to remain in the deeps (a view I
am more inclined to accept), or whether entirely due to a continuing
undercurrent movement between the poles and the equator, as others
suppose.
     Ionly touch upon the question here, and thus merely state, in re
ference to the undercurrent    theory, that there seems to be an opposing
difficulty in the first thought upon     — first, because
                                          it,             conceive that the

 sure in that direction, from the greater density     of the substratum at the
 source of its origin ; but the temperature of the greater depths that arc in
 continuity seems to be of the same low normal condition below about 1000
 or 1200 fathoms, so that there is no such difference to set up an appre
 ciable horizontal movement in those deeps.
    Although undercurrents undoubtedly exist in the atmosphere, and thus
 may lead to the possibility or belief in such general movements as a law
 of the deeps of the sea also, yet the modes in which the solar influence
operates    upon   the two media     are diametrically    opposite.   In the sea
the rarefying influence of the sun        commences    from, and therefore re
mains at or near the surface,     whilst in the atmosphere it commences from
below, and therefore disturbs and causes the lower Btrata to ascend.
    The sea is also a comparatively non-elastic fluid, whilst the air is the
most elastic, and thus yields to every local influence, whether of heat or cold.
    The isothermal temperature of the ocean deeps (viz. about 39s0 Fahr.)
has been supposed to be that at which the water attains its greatest den
sity, probably because it is found at the lowest tried depths of the At
lantic and Antarctic seas, and because of its being the temperature of
greatest density of fresh water ; and therefore it has been said that a lower
temperature made sea-water lighter, causing it to float upon that at the
above-mentioned temperature.
    But this is contradicted by the temperatures found by Sir E. Parry,
and by the recent experiments of M. Edland, M. Despretz, and others,
which seem to show that the greatest density of sea- water is attained between
22° and    25° Fahr.
    It seems to me therefore (and    I was impressed with the opinion before
knowing of this fact and      the  statements   that confirm it) that this iso
thermal temperature of 39£°— 4°, found throughout the Antarctic deeps,
is the settled mean temperature produced by the atmospheric influence
upon these areas, as about 59° Fahr. is of the eastern basin of the Mediter
ranean, and about 55£° Fahr. is of the deeps of the Greek Archipelago, and
54" for the Sea of Marmora* — this difference in similar depths occurring in
consequence of the separation of the deeps of the two basins by a submerged
but comparatively shallow ridge between them, as the Mediterranean deeps
are separated from the Atlantic by the shallowest part of the Straits of
Gibraltar, and with an isothermal temperature of 59° for the deeps on one
side, and of 39£° on the other, subject to the deduction of 4° or 5° from
each.
    These facts suggest the view that there really may not be an exact
correspondence between the lowest temperatures of the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian oceans, although, when a temperature in excess of or under
                                                                 since Sir James
39^° has been found, there has generally been supposed,
Ross's establishment of this as the normal temperature of the ocean deeps
to be an error of observation, or a defect in the instrument used.

546                 Captain Spratt on     the Undercurrent           [June  15,
    The foregoing quotations, and recapitulations of arguments and reasons
from ' Researches in Crete,' which, in my hnmhle judgment and experi
ence, seemed to be sound, in opposition to the undercurrent theory is a
grand circulation, and general and appreciable as a fact,      I  again offer in
concluding these remarks, but with all due deference and diffidence, al
though I am strongly of opinion still, from my practical experience and
investigations regarding surface- and deep-water currents, that differences
of density and of level are more generally rectified by superficial and
littoral movements, than by undercurrents running up hill or burrowing
in mid-deeps. But if recognizable or measurable as a physical fact any
where, it is only local and not universal, and is merely an atomic inter
change of insensible amount in general, in the greater depths of the oceaa
or of inland seas.
                       On the Gibraltar Undercurrent.
    There are also strong reasons for inducing me to dissent from Dr. Car
penter's conclusions as proofs of the undercurrent he asserts to having
found indisputable proofs of in the Gibraltar Straits ; for to my mind, on
carefully considering the observations, as well as the means employed, and
circumstances at the one trial (Station 64) which was accepted as an
undoubted evidence of such an undercurrent, against the four others that
showed no such result, there does not appear to be just grounds for assert
ing that it really exists, as a positive result of the trials ; for in such a
question of science the fact should be free of any ground of doubt.
    In such a Strait as that of Gibraltar, however, where there are tidal in
fluences combined with the general inset from the Atlantic, an under
current at certain times is a possibility ; but, with all due deference to Dr.
Carpenter,  I  cannot agree with him in inferring from the single and, to
my experience, unsatisfactory result obtained at Station 64,
                                                               " that a strong
presumption may be fairly raised for the constant existence of such a
return-current, though its force and amount are liable to variation," when
the results of his four other trials, viz. two at and near Station 39, and
one at 65 & 66, showed no undercurrent, the' former being in the nar
rowest part of the Strait, and the latter over the shallow ridge that unites
Europe with Africa, the average depth of which does not exceed appa
rently more than about 130 or 140 fathoms, although there are depths of
 1G0 near to the  African side.  It  extends across, between Cape Trafalgar
and Cape Spartel, the two western capes of the Strait.
    The width of the Strait between these two capes is 22| miles, and the
width in its narrowest part near Tarifa is only 7| miles.
    There is therefore a great convergence of the confining coasts and de
scending slopes to this part, and a necessarily convergence of the Atlantic
tidal wave, as well as general inset of the Atlantic current.
    In this constricted part of the strait also the greater portion of the
depth (fully 5 miles of the 7k
                                  across) is more than twice as great as on

                                  Theory of     the Ocean.                                    54,7

the barrier-ridge to the westward that separates the deeps of the Atlantic
from the proper Mediterranean deeps.
   Therefore, as there is here a great convergence or concentration of
the Atlantic inset, here there would naturally be a deeper tendency of the
inflowing current, as well as of an uprising of the lower part of   where               it,
this concentration produced      more rapid commingling of converging
                                    a
waters, and    sort of boiling-up of parts of the deeper waters would be the
                 a
natural result of this convergence and constriction.     Colder waters would
therefore come towards the surface, and vice vend.
     Now Dr. Carpenter shows this to  be the result here, although he does
not recognize what appears  to me to be the natural and simple explanation
of the phenomenon as above given. He says in regard to this — " It was        :
not little perplexing to find, when we had fairly entered the Strait and
     a
were proceeding along the mid-channel towards Gibraltar, that the surface-
temperature of the sea fell still further to 660,4, whilst the temperature of
the air rose to 76°-6, thus showing the then unprecedented difference of
10°- between the two
      2                      ;"
                           and on his return to the same part about two
months afterwards, viz. at Station 64, he found the surface-temperature
there 66°.
   Now, if this be the true and simple explanation of the low surface-tem
perature  over the position of greatest intermixture or boiling-up of the
currents there, as  suggest and believe, we should expect the same thing
                     I
to occur in some parts over the ridge which extends across the western
entrance    to the Straits, where the Atlantic current or inflow              is   nlso some
what concentrated, or     first   meets   it   as an obstruction,   and thus causes an
                                                                                                     '
uprise    of the cold water from below         to the surface.    And, curious enough,
the two surface-temperatures          taken      by   Dr. Carpenter at this part, viz. at
Stations   65 and 66, show in proof        much lower temperature, only 63° at
                                           a
the first  of these, and 69° at the other. The temperature of 66° at Station 64
is   therefore clearly   a commingling of the uprisen cold waters over the
barrier-ridge    ; for the mean surface-temperature at 50 miles' distance, on the
west side   of   the ridge, was 72| degrees, and from about 50 miles' distance
from Gibraltar on the east of the Strait         it   was 73% degrees, that       is,   the mean
of seven observations taken about      the former distance by Mr. Gwyn
Jeffreys, and   of seven about  the  latter by Dr. Carpenter. Deductions
from temperature and density in such positions as the narrows and over
the barrier-ridges are therefore, to my mind, not reliable    experienced
                                                                        I

the same at the narrows           of the Dardanelles, near the two Castles, and
so carried out my observations in more normal conditions or tranquil
areas, and in parts free of local disturbing influences that might tend also
to divert the direction of the lower currents, as well as of those near the
surface, and lead to erroneous conclusions favouring       bias for any theory
                                                                    a

a satisfactory or sufficient proof of such an undercurrent outflow as Dr.

presumed undercurrent direction, the result certainly cannot be accepted as
a " conclusive proof

wind, and therefore following swell, was drifting faster than the inflowing

                            Postscript, June 23rd, 18/1.
      As the undercurrent theory, in its larger view, as first put forth hy Capt.
 Maury, will remain a source of error still for the misguidance of the phy
 sical geographer and philosopher, whilst the fallacy or mistaken facts
 also remain uncontradicted, upon which it was mainly and originally founded
                                      *
 by the eminent author of the           Physical Geography of the Sea,' it is
 therefore     now necessary for me to show, after what 1 have previously
 written on the question, that the assertion of an undercurrent of from 1 to
  1$ knot per hour in the Atlantic as counter to a surface-current of much
 smaller amount on the outside of the Gulf-stream,        is based upon a mis
 taken estimate of the results of the experiments that were supposed to
 indicate such an undercurrent.
     Capt. Maury says, in p. 141, 'Physical Geography of the Sea,' when
 discussing his undercurrent      views in the chapter headed        " Undercur
 rents :"—
      " Lieut. J. C. Walsh, of the United States schooner ' Taney,' and Lieut.
 S. P. Lee, in the United States brig ' Dolphin,' both, while they were car
 rying on a system of observations in connexion with the wind and
 current charts, had their attention directed to the subject of submarine
 currents.     They made some interesting experiments on the subject. A
block of wood was loaded to sinking, and by means of a fishing-line or a
bit of twine let down to the depth of 100 or 500 fathoms ; a small float,
just sufficient to keep the block from sinking further,     was then tied to the
line, and the whole let go from the boat.
     " To use their own expression, it was wonderful, indeed, to     see this har-
rega move off against wind and sea and surface-current at the rate of over
one knot an hour as was generally the case, and on one occasion as much as
 1 f  knot.   The men  in the boat could not repress exclamations of surprise ;
for it really appeared as if some monster of the deep had hold of the weight
below, and was walking off with the line.         Both officers and men were
amazed at the sight."
     In paragraph 273 he says, " It may, therefore, without doing violence to
the rules of philosophical investigation, be conjectured that the equilibrium
of all the seas is preserved, to a greater or less extent, by this system of
currents and counter currents at and below the surface.         If we except the
tides and the partial currents of the sea, such as those that may be created
by the wind, we may lay it down as a rule that all the currents of the ocean
owe their origin to difference   of specific gravity between   sea-water at one
place and sea-water at another ; for whenever there is such a difference,
whether it be owing to difference of temperature alone or difference of
saltness, &c, it is a difference that disturbs equilibrium, and currents are
the consequence.      The heavier water gives towards the lighter, and the
lighter whence the heavier comes ; for two fluids differing in specific gravity,
 and standing at the same level, cannot balance each other."

552                   Captain Spratt on the Undercurrent                     [June  15,
    From the    above reasonings,    it is clear that the eminent author, from the
supposition that a great undercurrent movement in the Atlantic had been
discovered as the result of the observations and experiments of Lieutenants
Walsh and Lee, was induced to propound his fascinating but fallacious
theory regarding the origin of "all the currents of the ocean" being more
due to temperature and density than to tides and winds.
    Now it is true in regard to tides, that is, the currents resulting from tide-
waves are mainly littoral and local.         It is not so, however, as the result of
winds, which from       my experience are the main sources of ocean-currents,
without ignoring that from the rotation of the earth, which are therefore
chiefly superficial, but capable of reaching a considerable depth where the
water is deep enough, even to 50 and more fathoms, with no greater sur
face-movement than from three-tenths to five-tenths,               or half a knot per
hour, as I have on several occasions experienced from a perfect stillness
 of the sea from the surface down to the greatest depths in perfect calm
 weather, but which was set in motion iu the same direction as the wind to
 that depth a few hours only after a 4- or 5-knot breeze had set in.
     To show that Capt. Maury had mainly founded his theory upon the ob
 servations of Lieutenants Walsh and Lee, I must quote from the Report
 of the former as being the one most important and complete, as was sup
 posed, in proof of the rapid undercurrent believed in by Capt. Maury,
  and supposed to have been confirmed by other phenomena connected witli
 the fallacious idea of the ploughing of icebergs through fields of ice in
 Baffin's Bay, by the force of a mighty undercurrent*, instead of the fact of
 the field of ice flowing past them, by reason of the greater strength of the
  surface-current over the current in the depths to which the base of the
  bergs reached, as no doubt must be the fact iu that bay or strait from the
  southerly drift of both into the Atlantic.
      " Report  of Lieut. Walsh, U.S.N., to Lieut. M. F. Maury, of the Ob
  servatory at Washington.
      " The  next subject to which      I  would refer is our investigation of the
  undercurrents of the ocean.        I  regret we had so few opportunities for the
  interesting experiments, but enough has been done to seem to warrant
  the conclusion that these undercurrents are generally stronger setting in
   various different directions than those of the surface.            I   am well aware
  there is no mode      of   testing their exact velocity, but that practised by
   myself,  which   I  will  describe, was certainly all-sufficient to show their
   real velocity.   There may be none so rapid as that mighty ocean-river
   the Gulf-stream.         Unfortunately     the weather prevented our making
   these investigations in that interesting region ; but in the various parts
   of the Atlantic in which we succeeded in these experiments, on only
   two occasions did we find the undercurrent of less velocity than that run
   ning in a different direction above it.

   " The      following      is the mode    practised       :   the    surface-current   was first
tried by the usual mode (a heavy iron kettle being lowered from a boat to
the depth of 80 fathoms), then for the trial of the undercurrent a large
chip-log, of the usual quadrantal form, the arc of it measuring full 4 feet,
and heavily loaded with lead to make it sink and keep upright, was lowered
by a light but strong cod-line to the depth of 126 fathoms (the length of
the       ; a barrega was attached as a float, a log-line fastened to this
      line)
bnrrega, and  the rate of motion to this float, as measured by this log-line
and the glass, and the direction as shown by a compass, were assumed as
the velocity and set of the undercurrent.  No allowance was made for the
drag of the barrega, which was always in a different direction from the
surface-current. It was wonderful, indeed, to see this barrega move off
against wind and sea and surface- current at the rate of over one knot an
hour, as was generally the case, and on one occasion as much as    knot.                 If
The men in the boat could not repress exclamations of surprise, for it
really appeared as if some monster of the deep had hold of the weight
below, and was walking off with it."
   It is therefore quite evident that Capt. Maury adopted Lieut. Walsh's
identical words and views as the sound solution of the experiments, viz.
that a great oceanic undercurrent circulation existed as a counterpoise to
the disturbed densities arising from temperature and salinity.
   Lieut. Walsh next cites from the log several instances of the experi
ments, viz. at six positions in the Atlantic, between 24° 43' North and
 C5° 2' West, and 33° 58' North and 72° West, in which the weighted chip-
 log was lowered to 126 fathoms in each position, to test the undercurrent
 at that depth, as erroneously supposed.     But in fact it was merely giving
 a more correct indication of the surface-current than that resulting from the
 iron kettle in 80 fathoms, with a large boat as its float, under the erroneous
 impression that the iron kettle would be in still water at that depth, and
 that it would retain the boat stationary as if anchored to the bottom ;
 this, too, against wind and sea.   It however, evident that the kettle-and-
                                                 is,
 boat experiment could only show      vitiated result,

 current to that actually existing.
    The kettle-and-boat experiment were only used once, however, at the
 last position, in connexion with the large chip-log lowered down to 126
 fathoms, which Lieut. Walsh regrets,       saying,
                                                    " which
                                                       by     would have         it
 been better to have always done."
      Now   must be quite evident from what
            it                                  have before shown, from my

 fact, although          Lieut. Walsh did not then know " of any                means    of doing

by    N.W. and westerly gales.
     In concluding these remarks    upon the errors regarding the under
current theory, I feel that it is due to our distinguished transatlantic
bydrographers and geographers, that as theirs were the pioneer efforts in
such investigations on a large scale, it was natural that they should have
been defective, from the little attention given to such researches previously.
But it is     necessary      that these errors should now be well understood, and
shown to have arisen from a fallacious estimate of the experiments, that
the philosophical naturalist and physicist be no longer misguided by them,
and thus attribute so grand and large an influence to undercurrent, as
erroneously shown by the experiments of Lieut. Walsh and Lee, and as
the assumed necessary result of the small difference of density between one
part of the ocean and another ; for surface-current circulation and return
can and, indeed, must tend largely to restore    aided    it,            by
                                                          the rain and river
supply of fresh water met with in its circulation and return. This     even           is
 shown to be so under the equator, from the large African rivers and also
 from the Amazon and others joining the equatorial current, from the
 elaborate investigations (the twenty years' researches) of the late Dr.
 Forchhammer,                     in his most interesting and valuable dis
                          as summarized
 cussion    of   these
                     analyses in  his  paper in the Philosophical Transac
 tions for 1865, wherein the analyses        and temperatures of the sea-
 water are given from all parts of the globe, and      most remarkable and
                                                                     a
 able deduction of the surface-currents from them. But the learned Doctor,
 misguided, no doubt, by the supposed existence of the great undercurrent
 movement      the Atlantic as propounded by Capt. Maury, and also by the
                 in
 misunderstanding of the facts and the incompleteness of the observations
 for correctly ascertaining the conditions existing between the Baltic and
  German Ocean, and so, as     philosophical physicist, thus misled, was in
                                     a
 duced to ascribe        greater influence to undercurrent circulation than to
                           a
 superficial, as      a    of restoring the equilibrium from reduced or increased
                          means
 densities.   I   have before admitted that where two currents meet, such as the
 Polar and Gulf-stream, both strong in force and of great difference in density
 or temperature, and in directions nearly at right angles such as these two,
 an undercurrent or intermediate current of appreciable amount may exist.
    That denser water will intermix with lighter water in its deeper portion,
 when they meet and when depths are equal and difference of the densities
  great, as between pure fresh and sea-water,             I     am   aware    from my experi
  ence at the mouths of large rivers.
     This   is
            a fact experienced every year at the Damietta and Rosetta mouths

within    their embouchures, as I first ascertained when carrying out        my
current tests in that river ; brackish water was consequently found in       the
lower depths, percolation of sea-water through the sandy substrata do
doubt then partly accounting for its brackish condition.              Bnt eddy
surface-currents along the sides of the river, under the influence of the
prevailing N.W. winds blowing directly into the mouths, no doubt also
assist the intermixture as far as it goes — just as the return-current down
the European coast is diluted and intermixed in its general and superficial
density from the rains and rivers of the north, and thus tends to restore
the lost freshness of the equatorial or trade-wind and Gulf-stream car-
rents, as the tropical rivers and rains tend to restore the loss in the low
latitudes : thus condensation from evaporation and redilution by surface-
currents are throughout mainly maintaining the equilibrium.          Dr. Forch-
hammer shows that this lighter density or dilution of the encircling super
ficial waters from the equator commences from the American rivers from
the parallel a little north of the Bermudas, and that it exists all along the
European coast and again on the African coast from the African riven ;
and he has shown that the effect of the La Plata is found 900 miles from
its mouth.      The fact I have given of the condition at the Nile's mouths
at certain seasons is an extreme case, quite in accordance with the great
undercurrent theorists' views, and I mention it as a fact of interest to then.
But nevertheless    I believe,  from my own experience, and from the facts to
be gathered from Dr. Forchhammer's elaborate researches into the tempe
ratures and saline densities, that as it is not an appreciable and measurable
movement as an undercurrent at the Nile or Dardanelles, and only chemi
 cally testable by the tongue or hydrometer, so are there no great mechanical
 and appreciable movements as undercurrents in the ocean as a necessary
result of the very slight difference in the densities of one part of the ocean
 and another.      Nevertheless a complete investigation into the phenomena
 of ocean-currents is a most desirable operation, and can be so easily accom
plished on the plan    I  have found so practicable and easy, and recommended
 several years   ago for adoption by all scientific captains when crossing the
 great  oceans,  especially when calms detain them and favour the experiment,
 without fear of the results being confused or mistaken ; for then only should
 it be carried out where there are great depths and where strong surface-
 currents exist.
XII. " On the Physical         Principles concerned in the passage of Blood-
       corpuscles through the Walls of the Vessels."             By Richard
       Nokris, M.D., Professor of Physiology, Queen's College, Bir
        mingham.       Communicated by Dr. Sharpky, Sec. R.S.               Re
       ceived   June 12, 1871.
    In the year    1846    my much-lamented     teacher, Dr. Augustus Waller,
published     in the Philosophical    Magazine two able papers relating to the

1871.]        Blood-corpuscles       through the Walls      of the   Vessels.            557
perforation of the capillaries by the morphological elements of the blood,
viz. the red and white corpuscles.
   These observations attracted little attention till the year 1867, when the
facts made known by Dr. Waller were rediscovered by Professor Cohnheim,
of Berlin.
   Since the publication of Cohnheim's researches very considerable interest
has been taken in the subject, and the experiments have been repeated and
the facts corroborated by eminent physiologists and pathologists in all
parts of the world.
    On a careful consideration of the hypotheses which have been propounded
by Waller, Cohnheim, Strieker, Bastian, and Caton, to account for the
 curious phenomena in question, it will be found that all these hypotheses fall
 short in one important particular, inasmuch as they afford no explanation
 whatever of by far the most singular part of the process, viz. the fact that
 the apertures through which the corpuscles pass again close up and
 become invisible.    The question, indeed, is not so much how the cor
puscles get out, as how they get out without leaving any permanent trace
of the apertures through which they have so recently passed, and which
were so palpable during the period of transit.
   Before proceeding to elaborate my own views, it may be well to restate
succinctly the various points upon which observers are agreed.
   1st. Both white and red corpuscles pass out of the vessels through
apertures which can neither be seen before their ingress into or egress
from the vessel wall, but only during the period of transit.
   2nd. An essential and primary step in the process                 is,
                                                           that the corpus
cles shall adhere or, more properly, cohere to the wall of the vessel.
   3rd. These cohering corpuscles shall subsequently be subjected to pres
sure from within.
   With these conditions fully before our minds, we will proceed to inquire
if in
    physics we can find the analogue of these seemingly mysterious phe
nomena.
   Iu the first place, this phenomenon of the              passage    of
                                                                   through bodies
 films or membranes      is    by   no means    to the capillary walls, the
                                                confined
 same thing has been observed in nucleated blood-corpuscles, such, for ex
 ample, as those of the frog. In these cases no rupture or aperture of exit
 has been discovered.
   It   obvious that the escape of the nucleus from its capsule without
        is
rupture, and the passage of the entire blood-corpuscle through the capil
lary wall without rupture, are phenomena of the same class and the ex       ;
 planation which will suffice to clear up the one, will also apply with equal
 force to the other.
   As   a    matter of fact,   it   will   be admitted that we can form no          h   priori
 conception of one form-retaining   body passing through another without
 either rupturing   itor distending certain holes or pores which   may          it         al
 ready possess.   This, however,    just one of those cases in which con
                                           is

558                       Dr. It. Norris on the passage of                    [Jnne \b,
ceivability is no test whatever of possibility. To comprehend these phe
nomena it is necessary to bear in mind the ultimate constitution of the
animal membranes, which form alike the capsules of the corpuscles and the
parietes of the capillaries*.   All the membranes which enter into the
animal body may, from a physical point of view, be divided into two orders,
— the very fine structureless homogeneous films which must be regarded
as simple cohesion-membranes,      in contradistinction to the second order of
coarser membranes, to which certain mechanical arrangements are super
added, which have the effect of increasing the strength, such, for example,
as structure, the result of interlacing fibres j in films of collodion, gelatine,
albumen, india-rubber, and soap we have examples of the first class of mem
brane.    It is with this class that we are now concerned, and these are sus
ceptible  of two states, the fixed or rigid condition, and the contractile or
elastic state, dependent upon the presence of the principle of "flow,"
which principle may be operative in every shade and degree, from perfect
liquidity to absolute rigidity.
   It will be sufficient to state here that the more colloid and plastic those
membranes are, or, in other words, the more they approximate in their con
stitution to liquids, so do they proportionately cease to obey exclusively the
laws of rigid bodies, and begin to exhibit intermediate properties or quali
ties, some of which belong to solids' and others to liquids.
   We may take the soap-film as the best illustration we can find on a
large scale of the class of homogeneous cohesion-films, possessing in the
greatest perfection this principle of
                                      " flow," and as
                                                      exhibiting to the fullest
extent phenomena which         I
                               have generalized under the term •progressive
cohesive    attraction   f.
      By the study of the soap-film       we   may acquire a knowledge         of many
  * The    parietes of the capillaries aro held by modern liistologists to consist of pro
toplasm, a substance which is universally considered to be of a viscid semiliquid nature,
and in which it is easy to demonstrate the presence of the property of flowing within
certain limits.
  t  The term progressive cohesion is hero used in contrast with that operation of cohe
sion which simply maintains contact between the particles of two like or unlike sub
stances or bodies, and which, when it occurs between the particles of unlike bodies, is
called adhesion.   The attraction of cohesion evidently operates for some distance beyond
the atom or particle, so that actual contact is not essential to its display.   When two
small globes of mercury, or of any other liquid, are made to touch at one point, they
merge, as is well known, with great rapidity into each other, and the materials which
compose them become arranged around a common centre, that is to say, one larger
sphero results.  The mode of union of these two spheres is clearly a progressive one, the
particles nearest to those in actual contact being the next to come into contact, and so
on, until the globes become intimately united.     In the presence of gravitation there
can be no moss-attraction between the two globules.
   Again, when a solid is partially immersed in a liquid having a cohesive affinity for
it,e.g. a sheet of glass, the liquid, as
                                     is  well known, rises considerably above the water-
level.  This shows that with unlike bodies the action extends beyond contact, and      is
progressive in its oporation from one line or row of particles to the next above.    This
term therefore includes all effects of cohesion which
                                                        arise from and display its opera

1871.]            Blood-corpuscles     through the Walls      of   the Vessels.      559
of the laws which          are operative       in connexion with delicate colloidal films
in general.
   The steps, for example, in the production of an ordinary soap-sphere
are very remarkable, as exemplifying the power which these films possess,
under the influence of progressive cohesion, to perfect any absence of con
tinuity which may exist in their structure.
   The first essential in the process of forming   soap-sphere is the pro
                                                               a
duction upon the mouth of the pipe-bowl of a film stretching evenly across
from every point of the circumference.
   The production of this film is a far more complex operation than is
generally supposed.
  If    for the pipe-bowl we substitute a ring having a diameter of from 12
to 1 8 inches, we are enabled to watch, as the process proceeds, the manner
in which the film is formed.
     Having submerged the ring in a solution of soap, we observe, as we
gradually raise it out, that its circumference brings up from the liquid a
band-like film of a cylindrical or tubular form which is attached to the
ring above and the liquid below ; raising up the ring still higher, we find
that this annular film contracts in diameter at every part except at its at
tachment to the circumference of the ring, which is of course fixed. This
 quality of the film to contract between opposing points of extension
 causes it to take on the shape of an inverted cone with curved sides, the
 convexities of which are directed inwards.       The tendency to assume the
 inverted-cone shape is further assisted by    the   fact that the film, in con
 tracting, travels inwards upon the surface of the solution towards a central
 point, so that from the ring downwards to the surface of the solution the
  diameter of the tubular film is continually decreasing. The shortest
  diameter is not, however, immediately upon the surface of the liquid, but
  at a little distance from it ; and consequently, as the contraction proceeds,
  it will be at this spot that the union of the sides of the film and the separa
  tion will take place. This arises from the fact that .this is the weakest
  point of tension between the ring and the liquid, and therefore the one in
   which circumferential contraction can take place with the greatest ease and
   effect.   Thus we see that the tubular film which we have raised really be
 comes constricted into two portions,            — an upper portion, which immediately
 contracts into a plane surface upon the ring, and a smaller and lower
 portion, which, in consequence of including air, becomes a hemisphere and
 remains attached to the surface of the solution.   If, having formed such a
 film upon        a   ring or pipe-bowl, we proceed to blow down upon        we    it,
  distend   it   into a  sphere; but  it obvious
                                           is    that until the sphere detached
                                                                              is
  tion beyond the line    or boundary of actual contact,  All capillary phenomena may
  bo regarded                              action of cohesion operating at one and the
                  as due to this progressive

                                                                                              I
suddenly sealed up by cohesion of the sides of the film at the                      moment
preceding detachment ; and this detachment is seen to be a repetition                        of
what takes place in the formation of the primary film.
     The next point to which       I would
                                     draw attention is the power possessed
by these films to repair breaches of continuity that may be made in them
subsequently to their formation.             If
                                       any rigid body be wetted, it is quite
possible to thrust it through one of these films, move it about, and again
withdraw it without interfering with the integrity of the structure, as may
be proved by passing a smooth bulbous rod of glass through the film.      It
is not, however, essential that the body should be either smooth or regular,
for the same thing may be done with the naked fist and arm.
     Ihave demonstrated elsewhere that the blood-corpuscles undergo a
mode of aggregation in obedience to progressive mutual attraction in pre
cisely the same fashion as soap-spheres, — that is to say, if they touch at                  any
one point they gradually, by the operation of double cohesion (capillary                     at
traction), convert each other into polyhedral-shaped bodies*.    we wet            If
any smooth rigid surface and allow one point in the circumference of i

the soap-sphere takes on the form of two watch-glasses in apposition                          at
their edges, one of the curves being present on each side of the film. The
soap-sphere has, in fact, penetrated the film, and arranged itself so that

laws as the soap-spheres, and we have only to infer that they hear the
same relation to the capillary walls as these spheres and films bear to each
other.           The margin of speculation is therefore small.
      In the case of the corpuscles this relation is of course only seen under
abnormal conditions, simply because it is a physical law which in the
 normal working of the animal economy required to be antagonized.
       It must also be observed that it is only under certain conditions that the
 soap-spheres attract           each other, or are attracted by rigid surfaces or plastic
 films.          This   occurs only when free liquid is cohering to their surfaces.
 If before         bringing them into contact we allow the soap-film and sphere to
 become moderately dry, they will not attract each other, but the former
 will support the latter as a perfect sphere instead of drawing it down by
 progressive cohesion and arranging it halfway through itself.
       Just so with the corpuscles ; they do not unite either with each other or
  with the capillary wall, unless their normal osmotic relations are disturbed,
  the cxosmotic current setting in excessively when their external surfaces
  become          coated with content-matter,       and they become instantly attractive
  of each other, of the capillary wall or            glass slide, as the case may be.
                                                 "
        In the paper before referred to, On the Laws concerned in the Aggre
   gation of the Blood-corpuscles,"            I  have given numerous examples of the
   operation of progressive cohesive attraction ; but in this place wish to call I
   attention to the demonstration             there given of its relation       to plane sur
   faces.
        Taking this experiment as a starting-point,             we   will extend the consi
    deration to surfaces of a different character.              In   the first place, we find
   that this law continues to operate with great facility in connexion with
    surfaces curved in one direction only, whether the surface used be convex
    or concave       ; in both cases the film of paper or collodion applies itself evenly
    to the surface in the gradual progressive manner before explained.
         If, however, for surfaces curved in one direction only, we substitute such
    as are curved in all directions (for example, the outer or convex, or the inner
     or concave surfaces of        a hollow sphere), we find ourselves confronted with
     a  new set of difficulties, out of which we may evolve the statement that,
     for any film to apply itself evenly and regularly to either the convex or
     concave       surface of a  sphere under the influence of progressive attraction,
     it is   necessary that the film should be, in several particulars of its consti
     tution, very different from the class of films by means of which we have
     been able to illustrate      the three preceding experiments.
          If, by way of illustration,      we apply a film of wetted collodion         or fine
      cambric paper to the sphere, so that one point of the convexity of the
      latter may come in contact with the centre of the film, the attraction will
      only succeed in pulling it down to the surface of the sphere at certain
      points ; the intermediate puckered parts are not in contact, and can by no
      possibility become applied.         From this we see that for the film to be laid
       down evenly, it would be necessary that it should contract in certain parts,
           "VOL.  xix.                                                         2   x

562                              Dr. R. Norris          on the passage   of                      [Jane   15,    I
that, in fact, the puckered or surplus material should be taken up. Ve
may say, then, that any film which can adapt itself to the surface of &                                         )
spherical body must possess the twofold quality of facile contraction and
expansion, these qualities being controlled in their operation by progres
sive cohesive attraction.  Such a film must be a simple colloidal cohesion-
                                              "
membrane in possession of the property of flow."
   Further, if we apply to a sphere a film known to possess facile proper
ties of expansion and contraction under the influence of slight forces, snch
as progressive cohesive attraction, the first thing seen to occur is cohesion
of the film to the sphere at the point of contact ; and from this point is i
centre of operation the film proceeds to apply itself gradually in all direc
tions, so that the sphere becomes coated or covered evenly by it : this
process goes on till such time as the attraction becomes balanced or fully
antagonized by the elasticity of the film, that is to say, the attraction is onk
powerful enough to stretch the film to a certain extent ; so that    the rigid                   if
object be fixed, as is the case with the glass  bulb when  held   immovably,
we get a flattened form of the film.   A sufficient degree of attachment of
the film to the bulb has taken place to stretch the former backwards out
of its normal plane. If, now, we push the bulb further forwards, the fibs
Btill continues to apply itself to its surface, and having reached the equato
rial line of the sphere, descends on the opposite hemisphere till the bulb
is completely coated. But it will be said the bulb does not then reallT
produce an infraction of the film, but merely attracts it down to its surface,
and in so doing stretches     so that   it,  in reality  new conformation

passage   of the cohering body than to suifer distension by it, and this be
cause   it   has under these conditions as great an      attraction for the particles
of the body        as for its own particles.   When the cohering body has become
perfectly applied to the film, the latter, by the cohesiveness of its own
particles, contracts to the greatest degree possible consistent with still main
taining its attachment to the cohering body            and this in spherical-shaped
                                                                   ;

   * An excellent illustration of this principle afforded when light india-rubber ball

               suspended          from a fixed point, its surface having previously been wetted
with a solution of soap.          When    a soap-film formed upon the ring, as in the previous

accomplished by pressure from within. It is easy to see that the manner
or degree to which the corpuscle or body coheres to the film will deter
mine very materially the method of its transmission.
      All,   then, that is essential for      a rigid or plastic body to pass through a
colloid film is : — 1st, an intimate power of cohesion, either mediately or im
mediately, between the film and the body ; 2nd, a certain amount of pres
sure from within j 3rd, power in the substance of the film to cohere to
the surface of the body (or to some intermediate matter which already
coheres to the surface) during its passage; 4th, cohesive plasticity of the
particles of the material of which the film itself is composed, so that the
breach in it may again become reunited as it descends upon the opposite
surface       of the body which is being extruded.
      It  is quite remarkable to how great an extent these conditions appear to
be complied with in the passage of the white corpuscle through the capil
lary wall, as affirmed by independent observers.
      In   the factitious examples by which             I have sought to illustrate these
 effects,    the film moves over the body, or the body through the film, by
 virtue of the intermediate agency of the solution which has cohesive at
 traction      for both ; and the film does not rupture, because, while the
 body is travelling through, it can continue to cohere till such time as it
 is brought again into contact with its own particles at the opposite pole of
 the extruded body.
      Theoretically, as it leaves the sphere or protruding body, the aperture
 should gradually narrow to absolute union at a focal point, or, according to
 the laying-down          view, having resealed itself from the bulb ; practically,
 however,       I  find that the film rarely leaves the bulb or sphere without form
  ing on it    a   small hemispherical bubble, which is large in the ratio of the
  rapidity with which the detachment is effected.
       If detached with very great care, the bubble is exceedingly small ; but
  I could uot succeed with a spherical bulb in getting rid of it altogether ;
  with a more conical bulb, however, this was readily effected.                         In the
   case    of the sphere, the film is in reality drawn out into a little neck,
  as    in the other examples in which continuity is effected ; and this neck
   is  pulled into two, and both parts cohering at the point of severance, we
   get on the one side the perfected film, and on the other a small enclosure
   of air which        takes  on the hemispherical form.             This is owing to the
   annular contraction of the tubular part.                  If  the body were small or
   less spherical, or the film a trifle more rigid, this would not occur.                I  find,
   in fact, by experiment that smaller bodies, more conical in their termina
   tion, do not       do this,   but draw out      a  kind of streak of solution        as they
   leave the    film — a   fact I have often observed      with the white corpuscles.          In
    experiments, is brought into contact with one point of its convexity, the ball is at once
    drawn into the film as far as its equator, and is compelled to retain this position in
    opposition to the force of gravity.    This is the exact converse of the case of the fixod
    bulb, in which the attraction is satisfied at the expense of the expansibility of the film,
                                                                            2x2

this case the film is brought to a focus upon the body, and not at a slight
distance from it ; so that either or both these modes might obtain with the
corpuscle.       In  some cases the streak     of solution is absent. The method
of   sealing, which leaves behind      a portion of the film, is probably a necessity
of   every case of repair of continuity, with the exception of that of trans
 mission of a foreign body through a film.
     In the case of the blood-corpuscle it would not appear that the capillary
 wall became applied over the surface of the corpuscle to any great extent,
 but that, having effected cohesion, it becomes easier for the capillary wall
 to give way and glide over the corpuscle than to be distended by it ; and
 this is effected much slower than in the case of the factitious example:
 which I have placed before you.             For capillarity to come into play, the
 presence on the exterior of the corpuscle of another and cohesively dissi
 milar liquid to the liquor sanguinis is required ; and this we obtain by the
 outward passage, under the influence of osmosis, of the content-matter
 (haemoglobin) of the corpuscle ; a magnified view of the relations present
 may be thus represented         : —

      We may conclude in the appropriate words of Herbert Spencer: —
  " We    have in these colloids, of which organisms are mainly composed, just
  the required compromise between fluidity and solidity ; they cannot be re
  duced to the unduly mobile conditions of liquid and gas, and yet they da
  not assume      the unduly fixed condition usually characterizing solids ; the
  absence of power to unite together in polar arrangement leaves their atoms
  with a certain freedom of relative movement, which makes them sensitive to
  small forces, and produces plasticity in the aggregates composed              of them."—

             OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED*.
       James David FoRBEsf              was the youngest son    of Sir William Forbes of
Pitsligo, who was descended from the ancient family of the Forbes of
Mony music, on the banks of the Don, and was head of the well-known bank-
i rig-house long established in the Parliament Square of Edinburgh. The
mother of James Forbes was the only child and heiress of John Belches,
afterwards Sir John Stewart, a cadet of the old house of Invermay. The
early death of Lady Forbes, while her youngest son was a child scarce two
years         old, cast   a sobering shade over his early years, and indeed coloured
his      whole      life and character.     His father idolized the child, as the last
legacy         of her whom he had lost. He retired from Edinburgh, and lived a
secluded          life, surrounded    by  his young family, in his country place of
Colinton. There were spent James Forbes's childhood and boyhood. The
 teaching he got was of the most private, even desultory kind. Fear for the
 boy's health made his father nervously anxious lest he should overwork
 himself.          So his education was left entirely to his sisters' governess, and to
  occasional lessons from the neighbouring village schoolmaster, a worthy
  man, to whom his distinguished pupil remained ever afterwards sincerely
  attached. But though lessons were easy, his mind was active, and by his
  twelfth year the natural bias towards physical knowledge was manifesting
  itself.       Already his head was busy with mechanical contrivances, — a new
  velocipedometer, an anemometer, a metal quadrant made by his own
  hands for astronomical purposes.               At the same time he was devouring
   every scientific book he could lay hands on, from the 'Nautical Almanac' to
   Woodhouse's          '                 But all this devotion to science was kept
                          Astronomy.'
   strictly secret ; he laboured at it in private, and said nothing, for his father
   would not have smiled on such pursuits.            He would have objected to them
   both as too serious a tax on the young brain, and also as likely to turn him
   from     the dry studies     of the bar, for which he was destined.       His own wish
   was to take orders in the English Church, to which he was strongly
   attached ; but from this aim he was, not without reluctance, withdrawn by
   his father's expressed wish that he should study for the Scottish bar. This
   accordingly, from his fifteenth to his twenty-first year, was his ostensible
   purpose, but his heart was all the while turning secretly aside to the for-
       *  Note   to a passage in the Biography of M. Foucault, Proceedings of the Royal
    Society, vol. xvii.
       It appears from a notice in the Report of the British Association for the Promotion
   of Science for 1843, that Dr. Joule had made an experiment demonstrating the conver
    sion of work into heat, very similar to the experiment by M. Foucault described at tlto
    end of page lxxxiii.
       t This notice of Professor Forbes, except what more especially refers to his scientific
    work, has been taken, with abridgement, but without other alteration in matter or lan
    guage, from an inaugural address delivered by his distinguished successor, Principal
    Shairp, at the opening of the Academical Session of the United College, St. Andrew's,
    in 1869.
        VOL.   XIX.                                                            a

                                                11
bidden paths of science.   When he was only sixteen he began to keep i
record, entitled " Ideas of Inventions ;" because, as he expressed     so    it,
many more ideas, chiefly mechanical,  occurred to  him than he conld pos
sibly execute  and, in order to remember these, he " resolved
                    ;                                                   to   write
t'hem down, taking most special care to distinguish between what       were ori
ginal and the parts which were borrowed." About the same time he began
a journal of personal observations in astronomy, which he continued, with
scarce    an interruption,for seven years. He then also began to         keep      a
meteorological journal, in which he recorded all his observations          on the
temperature and state of the atmosphere, with speculations as           to    their
causes.   The two last, especially, were continued for years.        These were
his real and earliest educators in -science. By these he trained himself           to
be the patient and accurate observer which he ultimately became.
   Thus entirely home-trained, and, indeed, self-edueated, young Forbei
entered Edinburgh University in Session 1825-26, and joined the Classes              of
Latin and Chemistry. About the close of his first year at College he entered
on another phase of his self-education, which was destined to have important
results. He commenced an anonymous correspondence on scientific matters
with the late Sir David Brewster.      The lad of seventeen wrote to the then
renowned man of science, offering him for insertion in his well-known Phi
                                                                             '
losophical Journal      paper containing an attempt to account for the appa
                         '
                          a
rently infinite number of the stars.    The paper was not only inserted, but
the following words were annexed to         "We should be glad to hear again
                                                it   :

part  of this  request was readily complied with.      For several years hardTr
a  Number of the journal appeared without some paper either of original
observation, experiment, or cautious speculation from the young votary               of
science.   The latter part of the request he was more slow to meet all the
                                                                       ;
communications still bore the original signature, or "A" — disguise which
                                                               a
the author's modesty induced him to assume, and which Sir David tried                to
pierce for some years in vain.    Those who are best versed in these subject!
will, believe, most appreciate the natural insight, careful toil, and patient
    I
observation embodied in those papers, written at seventeen, with none              to
help or consult with, indeed, in the utmost secrecy.       Towards the end           of
1826 the young student's College     course was interrupted (but his philoso
phical correspondence was not) by a year spent in Italy with his father and
family.    With his passion for science in no degree abated, he entered into
all that Italy contains to feed the imaginative and historic mind, almost as
fully    as   if   he had been           scholar or man of letters — so earl/
                                  exclusively   a
appeared that fine blending of literary taste with scientific exactness which
in after years lent to his lectures and his writings so great charm. The
                                                                a
  Philosophical Journal contained some fruits of his Italian experiences,
'                             '                                                    in
what Sir David styles " A's very excellent set of observations," made              at
Rome, on the climate of Naples, and on the
                                               phenomena of Mount Vesu
vius.   These three papers appearing in successive Numbers of the Journali

                                              Ill
sailed forth much attention from scientific men. On his return home to
2o\irjton, in the autumn of 1827, his diary records that he is pleased " to see
Brewster's journal, and read the articles of mine he inserted in October last
ax\    the     apparent number of the stars, the heats and colds of last year, and
elements of the lunar eclipse, together with all the other papers which
I    have sent, inserted, or favourably noticed."             In the correspondence
with Brewster, the disguise of A was preserved to the close of 1828.
Many          and curious were the attempts Sir David made to pierce behind the
mask and see the real face of his unknown contributor. In one of his
letters he says : — " We who have begun our downward course look anxiously
 for some rising stars ; but, excepting yourself and Mr. F., I know of no
 young men who are likely to extend the boundaries of science." "Who
 was       Mr. F. ? Was he the same as the unknown A ? When at length
 the mask was withdrawn, the welcome which the elder philosopher gives                 ¦
  to his younger fellow-labourer is highly characteristic.          He expresses his
 joy " that        Scotland possesses one young man capable of pursuing        science
  with the ardour and talent of A, and that he belonged to a family for
  which he had so much esteem and affection." He then goes on to advise him
   to allow no professional duties to turn him from science ; he would find in
  it a solace and delight amid the bustle and vexations of life.
        Though thus early launched into original inquiries, James Forbes           was
   still only a Student of Arts in Edinburgh University.           The excitement of
    young and successful authorship seems never for a moment to have turned
    his head, or to have made him bate one jot the patient industry by which
    only college classes can be turned to account.          In the Moral Philosophy
    Class, which he attended after returning from the Continent, we find him
    preparing with great labour an essay of sixty large quarto pages for Pro
    fessor Wilson.       The essay was on the influence and advantages of the
    study of astronomy on the mind, and it was accompanied by scientific
    illustrations and notes.      This and other essays of the young physicist so
     far commended themselves to the Professor of Ethics, that at the close of
     the Session he made        him Medalist    in the Class, and  ever afterwards re
     ceived   him to intimate friendship.
         The month before James Forbes entered the Class of Natural Philosophy
      an event happened which deeply impressed him.           His father was removed
      by death, and this was soon to be followed by the breaking of the old home
      at Colinton House.       This bereavement formed a turning-point in his life,
      and deepened his already religious character.       Solemnized, yet braced, he
      entered on the Natural Philosophy Class, then taught by the celebrated Sir
      John Leslie, in his later years.     In the subjects of that Class lay his own
      specialty, but he had never received one word      of mathematical instruction
      from    any one, all  his mathematics were entirely self-acquired.     Yet, not
      withstanding this disadvantage, in the competitions with students who had
       passed through a regular Mathematical Course he held the first place, and
       closed  the Session by easily bearing off the highest honours.    While  he was
                                                                         «2

                                           IV
a Student in the Natural Philosophy Class he had the honour ofbeingprc-
posed by Sir David Brewster as a Member of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh before he had reached his twentieth birthday.
   Though his College course may be said to have been now completed, he
took yet another Session, attending Sir John Leslie's Class, and the Che
mistry Class of Dr. Hope each for the second time, and combining with
these two the study of the Law.     At the close of his College life, in April
 1830, he looks back on    in his diary, " with peculiar satisfaction, as com
                           it,
prising the happiest period of his life."    That summer (1830) he passed
his Law trials, and put on his advocate's gown, but never wore it. To his
great joy, having obtained the full concurrence of his family and friends,
he cast law for ever behind him, and, content with a small competence,
gave himself unreservedly     to science.   This resolution was not taken
hurriedly.   But his mind once made up never faltered.        At the beginning
of next winter he says — " now enter on the delightful and engrossing
                          :      I
studies, which have now, blessed be God, become my principal and legiti
mate object, untrammelled by jarring occupations aud conscientious scrapie!.
He then gave himself to closer study of the higher mathematics, and at the
same   time began those experiments on heat which were afterwards             to
result in one of his best scientific achievements. A hint of his future
destiny was at this time given him.     He had ^happened to go to heir
Sir John Leslie's opening lecture in that Professor's last Session but one,
1830-31.   At the close of the lecture Sir John, who had never before
admitted his promising Student to any special intimacy, sent for him, and,
after asking him about his own studies, told him that when he (Sir John)
proposed going to the East last summer, he had thought of getting him
(James Forbes) to officiate for him, but was afraid the public might think
him too young.      He then broke off abruptly.   In exactly two years from
this time young Mr. Forbes, who had gone to the Continent on long scien
                                                                   a
tific tour, was recalled by the news of Sir John Leslie's death, and that his
friends in Scotland had given         in
                                  his name as   Candidate for the vacant
                                                  a
Chair. Then ensued      contest, not the least memorable of those man/
                         a
contests of the same kind by which Edinburgh has made itself conspi
cuous.     Two things   made this one especially warm, and even painful.      By
one   ofthose strange turns in men's destiny, Mr. Forbes's chief opponent
was  his friend and patron, Sir David Brewster, now almost        veteran
                                                                  a           in
the army of science.    Political feeling, too, was added. It was the era     of
the Reform Bill, and party spirit, then running high in Scotland, as else
where, entered as an element of the contest even more than       usually it
does.  Mr. Forbes, though only twenty-three, was elected        by
                                                              very deci
                                                                     a
sive majority ; and, however   may have appeared at the time, the result,
                                 it
we know, justified the wisdom of the choice. It pleasing to be assured
                                                      is
 that, whatever passing feeling the contest may have awakened, the old
intimacy was soon renewed, and the friendship so honourable to both
these distinguished men continued unimpaired till the close of their lives.

He thus        entered on a Professorate of seven-and-twenty years, carried on
¦with     an energy and success rarely equalled, never surpassed.           He began
to teach the Natural Philosophy Class in Session 1833-34, when he was
only four-aiid-twenty, yet from the very first he rivetted the attention of
one of the largest and most distinguished classes of students that Edinburgh
University ever contained. One great feature of his teaching, as I have
always understood, was that while it stimulated the powers and won the
admiration of his most scientific listeners, he yet made himself attractive
to all students who were intelligent, though less highly gifted.
      In these lectures the whole range of Natural Philosophy was gone
through, and the laborious and well-sustained study required for the due
 performance of his professorial work had doubtless prepared him for the
 task, which he successfully accomplished, of writing the well-known " Dis
sertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science, principally
from 1775 to 1850," which was published in the last edition of the 'Ency
clopaedia Britannica.'         Meanwhile, however, Professor Forbes was indefa
 tigable in original investigation, for which he had so early shown an apti
 tude ; and the separate titles of his contributions to Transactions of
 Societies and Scientific Journals, as given in the Royal Society's ' Catalogue
 of Scientific Papers,' amounted in 1863 to one hundred and eighteen.
 These embrace various subjects belonging to Physics, Meteorology, Geo
 logy, and Physical Geography.            The most important of his earlier experi
 mental investigations was that in which he succeeded in demonstrating the
 polarization of heat. Melloni had been pursuing an inquiry in the same
 direction, but had failed to obtain the result he was in quest of. Professor
 Forbes was more fortunate. The steps of his investigation are thus stated
 hy himself in the dissertation above referred to.
      He says : — "  I have   just referred to my own early experiments on the
  subject (which    were  likewise    inconclusive), in order to explain that it was
  natural, on hearing of the application of the thermo-multiplier to measure
  Tadiant heat, that I should wish to repeat them with the new instrument.
  This   I did in  1834.    I  first succeeded   in proving the polarization of heat
  by tourmaline (which Melloni          had announced did not take place), next by
  transmission through a bundle of very thin mica plates, inclined to the
  transmitted ray, and afterwards by reflexion from the multiplied surfaces of
  a pile of thin mica plates placed at the polarizing angle.       I next succeeded
  in showing that polarized heat is subject to the same modifications which
  doubly-refracting crystallized bodies impress upon light, by suffering a beam
  of heat (even when quite obscure), after being polarized by trausmission,
  to pass through a depolarizing plate of mica, the heat traversing a second
  mica bundle before it was received on the pile.         As the plate of mica used
   for depolarization was made to rotate (in its own plane), the amount of heat
   shown by the galvanometer was found to fluctuate just as the amount of
   light received by the eye under similar circumstauces would have doue.
   This experiment, which, with the others just mentioned, was soon re
    peated and confirmed by other observers, still remains the only one proving

                                         vi
the double refraction of heat unaccompanied by light ; and, though some
what indirect, it will hardly be regarded by competent judges as otherwise
than conclusive.        Iceland spar and other doubly-refracting       substances
absorb invisible heat too rapidly to be used for affecting directly the sepa-
ration   of the rays, which requires      a very considerable thickness of the
crystal.     I also succeeded  in repeating Fresnel's experiment of producing
circular polarization by two internal reflections.      The substance used wis,
of  course,   rock-salt."
    For these researches the Royal Society awarded to their author the
Rumford Medal, in 1838. Taken in conjunction with the experiments of
Melloni on the absorption, &c. of radiant heat, they afforded the conclusive
proof of the identity of thermal and luminous radiations, — a fact of the verj
greatest consequence to the further progress of one of the most fascinating
branches of physical science.
    In  1842    Professor Forbes communicated      to the  Royal Society    a paper
 " On   the Transparency of the Atmosphere, and the Law of Extinction of
 the Solar Rays in passing through it," which was adopted as the Bakerian
Lecture for that year, and for which in 1843 he received a Royal Medal.
    Another prominent work of Forbes is that long series of observations oa
 the Nature and Motion of Glaciers, which he pursued with intense applica
tion, and, as there is too good reason to believe, to the serious injury of his
health.     lie had spent several vacations on the Continent, and had wan
dered over the mountains of Switzerland and Savoy, studying the Geology
and Physical Geography of those regions ; but he specially devoted the
summers of 1842—44 and 1846 to the exploration of the glaciers of the
Alps. Into this pursuit he threw an enthusiasm and concentration of
energy which few men are capable of. In 1843 appeared his well-known
work, ' Travels in the Alps,' in which he blends interesting descriptions of
scenery with scientific observations and reasonings ; and the fruits of his
earlier labours on the glaciers are there given.          Shortly before this he
commenced the interesting series of sixteen " Letters on Glaciers
                                                                     "
                                                                        published
in the 'Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal ' from 1842 to 1851, which
contain the results of his continued        study ; and he also set forth and
discussed his views on the constitution and motion of glaciers, in au elabo
rate Memoir published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1846, en
titled " Illustrations of the Viscous Theory of Glacier Motion."
    Not contented to limit his observations to Switzerland and Savoy, he in
 1 85 1 made    an excursion to Norway to study the glacier phenomena of
that country, and gave an account of his work in * The Glaciers of Norway
visited in 1851,' which was published in 1853.
    Professor Forbes looked on the progressive motion of a glacier as com
parable to that of a plastic mass, moulding and adapting itself to the varia
tions in the width and depth of its channel and the inclination of its bed, and
moving faster in the middle than at the sides, as would happen with such a
yielding substance.       A view substantially similar had been previously pro
mulgated by Bordier in 1773, the contemporary of De Saussure, and more

                                            vu
recently by M. Rendu, then Canon, afterwards Bishop of Annecy ; but to
Forbes belongs certainly the merit of proving its general truth by careful
and prolonged experimental measurements of the rate of progression of
glaciers at different parts. But whilst it is plain that the ice of a moving
glacier behaves in the gross like a plastic substance, there has been a ques
tion by what intestine changes or motions of its particles its change of figure
is brought about or accompanied ; and later inquirers maintain that the ice
yields by breaking up into minute fragments, which speedily reunite by
partial melting and regelation, thus permitting of change of form in the
mass.      The ribboned or veined structure of glacier ice, which had been but
little attended to by previous writers, was carefully studied by Forbes.
 Having seen that the velocity of movement increases from the sides to the
middle of the glacier, he ascribed the production of the ribboned structure
 to " differential motion
                          " between adjacent laminar sections of its substance,
 a process which has since been termed " shearing."          Others have com
 pared   the phenomenon   to the lamination of slaty rocks  now  very generally
 regarded as caused by pressure in a direction perpendicular to the planes
 of lamination.
     But while there may be difference of opinion as to the physical explana
 tion of the observed phenomena, there can be no question of Forbes's
  signal merit in connexion with the scientific history of glaciers ; and it is
 pleasing to know that it was generously acknowledged in his lifetime by a
  distinguished rival in the same field, who thus speaks of him*: — "The
  more his labours are compared with those of other observers, the more
prominently does his comparative intellectual magnitude come forward.
The speaker would not content himself with saying that the book of Prof.
Forbes was the best book which had been written       on the subject.   The
qualities of mind, and the physical culture invested in that excellent work,
were such as to make          it,
                           in the estimation of the physical investigator at
least, outweigh all other books upon the subject taken together."
   While Switrerland                         of Forbes's explorations, he did
                             was the main region
not neglect his own land. In the summer of 1845 he traversed the rugged
hills of Skye, and proved that the bare scarps of the Cuchullius had been
ground down by the same kind of glaciers as those which are now wearing
down the gorges of the Alps.
   The last important scientific labour he was permitted to undertake was
on the subject of thermal conductivity.     He was the first to point out —
and this at   very early period of his career — the fact that the conducting-
               a
powers of the metals for electricity are approximately proportional to their
conducting-powers for heat. Now, heat diminishes materially the electric
 conducting-power — does      also affect the thermal conductivity
                                it                                     Forbes?
 showed that (at least in the case of iron, the only metal his failing health
 left him strength to examine) the conductivity for heat diminishes as the
 temperature     increases.     Another result of the    same investigation, and one
   * Report of     a   Lecture delivered by Professor Tyndall   at the Royal Institution,
 June 4,1858.

                                          via
  of great interest and importance in modern science, is his detenninatioi
  (the earliest of any real value) of the absolute conductivity of a substance,
  i. e. how much heat passes per second per unit of surface through u
  iron plate of given thickness, whose faces are maintained at constant girea
  temperatures.     As a proof of the value attached by scientific men to
  these ingenious experiments, it is only necessary to mention that the
  British Association has given a grant for their repetition with the best
 attainable instrumental    means,    and for their extension to other   substance!
 than that to which Forbes was obliged to confine himself.
     But on his more active work an arrest was soon to be laid.               In  De
 cember 1 85 1 he was prostrated by a severe hemorrhage in the lungs,
 occasioned, it was thought, in part by exposure on the Alps, in part bj
 too close   application while prosecuting further experiments on heat. For
 two Sessions and a half he was entirely laid aside from work. In the
 winter of 1854 he resumed his duties, but daily lecturing was a heart
 burden on his now enfeebled strength.           As for exploration or   continuous
 experimenting, all that was ended.
     " Though he could not      leave   Edinburgh without some natural pangs,
                                         " it was no doubt a relief to him when
 yet," continues Principal Shairp,
 he was called to assume the Principalship of this College [St. Salvador
 and St. Leonard's United College, St. Andrew's] iu the beginning of Session
  1859-tiO.    The office fitted in better to liis state of health, because it
 relieved him from the necessity of giving daily lectures, and set him more
 free to do his work at the hours and in the way that suited him.           He was,
 however, far from regarding it as a sinecure, as some speak. Our late
 Principal was not the man to regard any post of trust as a sinecure.
 He came among us, no doubt, with diminished strength.                  But illness
 had not abated his mental energy.          Few men felt more the appeal whicb
 the past history and present aspect of this city makes to the imagination.
 But though much captivated with this, he found on his arrival enough of
 hard matter-of-fact work ready to his hand, and into it he threw himstlf
 vigorously."
     "Those who were comparatively strangers to our late Principal ob
 served in him a certain antique formality and reserve which they sometimes
 mistook    for coldness.   They little knew how gentle and         affectionate    a
 heart lay under that exterior — what longing for sympathy, what apprecia
 tion of confidence and frankness in others.       His thoroughness in all work,
 his painstaking in the most ordinary college business, his patience in
 getting to the bottom of every minutest detail — as great, indeed, as if i'
 had been a link in some grave discovery — these are things which only bis
colleagues can know."
     " His last public act,   I   believe, was to preside at the laying of the
foundation-stone of the new College Hall Building in 186/. A few dart
after, he left St. Andrew's not to return.         The sequel in its outward de
tails (that winter abroad, the return to Clifton, and the
                                                             close) would be
                                                                                 too
pniuful to dwell on.     But while his body was reduced to the last stage of

                                           IX
weakness, his mind remained self-controlled, unclouded, and peaceful to
the end.      He departed on the last day of the departing year (1868), up
held by humble faith in Him to whom long since he had committed him
self."
    Professor Forbes     was a Vice-President      of  the    Royal Society of Edin
burgh, and a Corresponding Member of the French Institute.                     His elec
tion into the Royal Society      is dated  June   7,  1832.
    Johann Evangelista Purkinje              was born    in  the town  of Libochowitz,
near Leitmeritz, in Bohemia, on the 1 7th of December, 1 787. He obtained
the first rudiments of education in the school of Libochowitz. He then went
to Nicholsburg in Moravia, where he passed through the normal school and
Gymnasium with credit, and entered the Order of the Piarists with the in
tention of becoming a teacher.         After a noviciate of one year at Kaltwasser
in Moravia, he was sent to Straznic in Hungary as teacher in the Gymna
sium of that place.        In 1805 he began to study French and Italian, and
 also the language and literature of Bohemia.           In the following year, while
 officiating  as teacher  in the normal   school  at  Leutomischlin     in Bohemia, he
 turned his attention to the writings of the German philosophers, and espe
 cially to those of Fichte.     These pursuits opened out to him the prospect of
 a higher intellectual culture, which he felt to be within his reach.                He
 accordingly quitted     the  school  and  became    a student    in the  University of
 Prague, and supported himself by taking pupils.                After some hesitation,
 he adopted the career of medicine.          For two years he pursued his studies
 in the Anatomical Institute under Dr. Ilg, and for two more in the surgical
 division of the hospital under Dr. Fritz, by whom he was greatly esteemed.
 During this time he derived the means of living from the family of Baron
 Hildeprandt, to whose son he had been tutor.                In 1818 he graduated as
 M.D., the title of his inaugural dissertation being, " Contributions to our
  Knowledge of Subjective Vision."          In this dissertation he explained how
  some properties, and even some structural        relations of the eye, can be in
 vestigated by means partly psychological, partly physiological, which
  otherwise require for their discovery the most minute microscopical exami
  nation.    This essay decided his line of research ; it opened a new world to
  his fellow-labourers, and won for himself the approbation of Gothe, who
  was engaged in similar pursuits.        Shortly afterwards he became assistant
  to the Professors   of Anatomy and Physiology, Ilg and Rottenberger.                In
                                       '
  1820   Purkinje published in the Medicinische Jahrbiicher des osterreich-
  ischen Staates,' a paper on Vertigo,     from observations made upon himself.
  In 1822 he was appointed to the Professorship of Physiology in the Univer
  sity of Breslaw, on the recommendation of Dr. Rust, of Berlin.              At Easter
  in 1823 he entered upon his duties at Breslaw.            In consequence of preju
  dice against Austrians on the part of the Medical Faculty, and a desire for
  the appointment of another person, he was not well received at first, but in
  the course   of two years he overcame all dislike by the extent        of his acquire
  ments, and his urbane and unassuming demeanour.               The inaugural disser

tation required of the newly-appointed Professor had for its title, "De
examine physiologico organi visus et systematis cntanei."            In thk dis
sertation he described the now well-known method of investigating the
structure of the retina by the appearance seen after waving a flame bead*

the eye.      He followed out this subject in a work entitled        Observation!
and Experiments on the Physiology of the Senses, or new Contributions to
the Knowledge of Subjeetive Vision," published in 1825.          In the eoorse of
the same year the Faculty of Medicine of Breslaw resolved to send their
 congratulations to Blumenbach on the fifteenth anniversary of his
                                                                        doctorate,
accompanied by an original memoir on a suitable suhject. Purkinje's
                                                                               offer
 to write the memoir was gladly accepted.         He   took  for  his  subject the
 elementary origin of the bird's egg within the ovary, and its subsequent
 progress up to the time of its deposition. This investigation, which occupied
 him for three months, resulted in one of the most important physiological
 discoveries of his time, that of the germinal vesicle, now generally known
                                                                                   u
 the *' vesicle of Purkinje." The congratulatory memoir in which it was firrt
 described and figured was afterwards published independently under the
 title of " Symbolse ad ovi avium historiam ante incubationem," 1830. la
  1828-30 he entered upon a microscopical examination of the organisation
 of plants. The elastic fibres of various vessels of plants, and the receptaclei
  of pollen and seed capsules, which scatter the pollen and the seed, especially
 attracted his attention.     The account of these researches was published ie
  1830: "De cellulis antherum fibrosis ncc non de granorum poUinsrinm
  formis, commentatio phytotomica."
     On the recommendation of Mirbel, the Montbyon Prize was awarded to
  him by the French Institute for this essay.     In the spring of 1833 he un
  dertook the observation of the developement of the tadpole through in
  various stages.     He carefully examined the cilia which at first cover the
  whole body, then the head, and lastly only the branches of the gills. Ia
  the course of the same year Professor Valentin began his researches on the
  organization of the ovum of mammals, and while examining the funnel
                                                                                   of
  the oviduct of a rabbit, observed a movement of a granule on the mucoM
  membrane of the oviduct while floating in water, and attributed it to
   spermatozoa.     But Purkinje traced the motion to cilia on the edge of the
   membrane.      This discovery of ciliary motion in a warm-blooded animal
                                                                        *
   led to a   joint research, and to the publication of the work De phe-
   nomeno generali et fundamentali motus vibratorii continui in membraaH
   cum externis turn internis animalium plurimorum et superiorum et in-
   feriorum ordinum obvii, commentatio physiologica,' 1835.
      Ou entering upon his duties at Breslaw he established a physiological
   institute in his own house, where students were furnished with the means
   of examining microscopically the elementary parts of human bodies end
   those  of animals, and of drawing and accurately describing      them.     These
   researches   supplied the materials of a series of academical dissertation!,
  many of which disclosed new methods of microscopical investigation, •
  field of research then beginning to be generally cultivated after having be»

comparatively neglected since the days of Malpighi, Swammerdam, and
Leeuwenhoek.         Others again treated of various physiological or anato
mical subjects.       In the first of these essays, by Krauss, in 1824, "De
cerebri lsesi ad motum voluntarium relatione, certaque vertiginis directione
ex certis cerebri regionibus laesis pendente," by the introduction of his
theory of vertigo, he confirmed and extended the discoveries of Flourens and
Magendie respecting the activity of the cerebrum and cerebellum.                   In
another, by Wendt, in 1833, he announced the important discovery               of the
sudorific glands and their excretory ducts in the human skin.              In another

 (1839), Purkinje, in oppsition to the views of Remak and others, main
 tained that the "formatio granulosa" or elongated corpuscles resembling
 cell-nuclei, which are found attached to the sympathetic nerves, are not
 peculiar to this system, and that they consist of a newer material resembling
 protoplasm, out of which the more matured portions derive their growth.
 In the essay * De velamentis medullse spinalis,' he made known the dis
 covery   of a peculiar nervous plexus distributed on the pia mater of the spinal
 cord,   which can be easily exhibited by maceration in acetic acid. An ac
 count of these observations and of the existence of nerves in other mem
 branous parts was given in a memoir (in Polish) published in the Year-book
  of the Medical Faculty of Cracow,and reproduced in German, with additions,
 in Midler's ' Archiv ' for 1845. Two other dissertations appeared, the titles
  of which were, 'De structura uteri non gravidi' (1840), and 'De numero
  atque mensura microscopica       fibrarum-elementarium      systematis cerebrospi-

      Purkinje having at length succeeded in convincing the Government of
  the necessity of establishing an independent institution for teaching physio
  logy, a house was built in 1842 for the purpose of carrying on physio
  logical researches, and a suitable grant made for defraying the stipends of
  assistants and other expenses.       This example has since been followed in all
  the German and      Austrian universities.
      Purkinje was    the  author of a paper " On the World of Dreams," in
  'Hesperus' (1821), "On the Physiological Import of Vertigo" in Rust's
  Magazin (182/), "On Tartini's Tones," in the Bulletin of the Natural
  History Section of the ' Schlesisch-patriotischen       Gesellschaft' for 1825, and

a compressorium        for microscopic observation invented by himself, which
Boon came into general use, and soon afterwards published, conjointly
with Valentin, an account of researches on ciliary movements observed in
the cavities of the brain.       In 1 838 followed his interesting experiments, in
conjunction with Pappenheim, on artificial digestion.            In 1845, as already

 He translated Tasso's * Gerusalemme Liberata,' many of Schiller's poems,
 and all his Lyrics into Bohemian.
     At the Naturforscherversammlung, held at Prague in 1837, he antici
 pated Schwann in the announcement of the doctrine of the identity
                                                                                          of
 fundamental structure of plants and animals, but with this distinction
 between    the two cases, that he calls the elements       of plants       and those     of
 animals, cells and granules respectively.
     In 1 848 he attended the Meeting of the Sclavonic races in Prague, and
 was present at the celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the
 foundation of the University, when the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy
 was conferred on him.         A long-cherished wish to be enabled to pass the
 remainder of his days in his native country was gratified by his nomination
 to the Professorship of Physiology in the University of Prague in the
 summer of 1850.            His first care was the due equipment of the Physio
 logical Institute, at that time recently established.       This he effected in i
 satisfactory manner in the course of a year.          His next endeavour was to
 promote the cultivation of the Natural Sciences among the Bohemian-
 speaking population, and with this view he became one of the editors of the
  Natural-History Journal 'Ziva' from 1853 to 1864, and also contributed
  many articles to the Journal of the Bohemian Museum.
      One of the most important of his later researches was a careful            invesuga-
  tion of the sound perceived in the interior of the skull. On examining the
  inmates of a deaf and dumb asylum, he found, as some previous observers
  had discovered, that almost all possess the power of hearing through the
  Skull.
      His election  as a Foreign Member     of the Royal Society took place in 1850.
  He was corresponding Member of the French Institute, Member of the
 Academies of Vienna, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, and of many other learasf
 Societies.     He retained his vigour of body and mind up to the last days of
 his life.    His death, after an illness of no long duration, on the 28th               of
 July,   1869, was mourned by every class of
                                                    Society in Bohemia.

    Sir James Clark was born at Cullen in Banffshire in December 1788,
and was educated at the parish school of Fordyce, and subsequently at the
University of Aberdeen.        In 1806 he entered a writer*s (solicitor's) office
at Banff ; but, not liking the law, he was given the choice of the Church,
with the promise of a ministry, or the profession of medicine. He chose
the latter calling, and proceeded to Edinburgh. In 1809 he passed at the
College of Surgeons, and then entered the medical service of the navy.
He served at Haslar Hospital till July 1810, when he was sent to sea as
Assistant-Surgeon      in the schooner ' Thistle,' which was going with des
patches to New York. The 'Thistle' was wrecked, with the loss of
several of her crew, on the coast of New Jersey, and the survivors lost
everything they possessed, and suffered great privations.                On returning
to England he was promoted             to  the  rank  of  surgeon,     and   joined the
'  Collobree.'   It  is remarkable that this vessel was also wrecked on the
American coast.       He was then appointed to the ' Chesapeake,' which had
been recently taken by Sir Philip Broke, in his famous action, and served
                                                             '                   In this

ship   he met with     and  formed    a strong friendship     for Lieutenant (after
wards Sir Edward) Parry,          the  celebrated  Arctic  navigator, and made, in
 conjunction with him, a series of experiments on the temperature of
                                                                                     the
 Gulf-stream.     During his service in the navy his attention appears to
 have been strongly directed to the question of climate, and the few notes
he has left of this period of his life chiefly refer to observations he made
 on this subject, and to the hygienic conditions influencing the health of the
 men under his charge.

    In 1815 the 'Maidstone returned to England to be paid off, and Sir

1826, being partly urged to the step by his friends, and partly influenced
by consideration for his wife's health, he left Rome ; and after a few mantis
spent in visiting the chief medical institutions of France and Germany, and
the Pyrenean and German baths, then very little known in England, ht
settled in London.    In the autumn of 1827 he was attacked with typhoid
fever, and was ill for several months. He never recovered perfectly fron
this attack ; it left            a   delicacy of digestion   behind    it,   and    permanently
enfeebled him.

Climate.'   This work, which was long considered the standard book                                  oa

  From this time the life of Sir James Clark (he was made baronet                   a                in
1838) was spent in the discharge of his responsible duties as media!

But indirectly,         in   this latter period of his life, he lent   a     most   powerful
 to science.
     He    was always ready to help,  and to use his influence, which yearly
 became   greater, both with the Court and with the leaders of parties,                              fa
 the furtherance of scientific objects, and for the advance Of education.                            It
is difficult to give complete account of what he did in this direction,
                             a                                                                       i-'

his share in     should be known.

been      directed to the improvement               of medical and of       general      education.

to fostering special scientific instruction, to the promotion of sanitary mea
sures, to the improvement of the Lunacy Laws, and of the public medical
services.
     He appears to have always taken a deep interest in medical education.
Early in life he had published in Italian a work addressed to Professor
Tommasini on English medical literature, and some time afterwards he
published some ' Observations on the System of Teaching Clinical Medi
cine in the University of Edinburgh, with suggestions for its improvement.'
He had also corresponded with both French and Italian physicians on this
point ; and in the summer of 1825 he had spent several months in Paris for
the purpose of observing the method of clinical teaching followed by
Laennec.
     When, therefore, in       1838 the University of London was founded, and
he was asked to serve on the Senate, he was fully prepared to deal with this
subject of medical education ; and it is to a considerable extent to his
labours at that time, and subsequently, when further changes were made in
 the curriculum, that the present examining system of the Medical Section
 of the University owes its shape. The leading features of the scheme
 which, in consultation with experienced medical teachers, he adopted, and
 which he advocated in the Senate, were to require evidence of a certain
 time having been spent in the study of medicine, but not to demand or to
 rely on many certificates of attendance, but to trust to a searching examina
 tion ; to split up the examination into two (and subsequently into three)
 parts, to be undergone at different stages of education, and to make the
  examination as practical and as thorough as possible. Clinical examina
  tions were not, however, at first employed, but he subsequently obtained
  the introduction of this important part of medical examination.
      He continued to serve on the Senate until 1865, when he resigned, to
  the great regret of his colleagues.
      In 1854, when the Government determined to open the Indian medical
   service to unrestricted competition, he was requested to organize the method
   of medical examination.        He did so, and gave this examination the form
   which, with a slight alteration, it has since retained.     In this examination
   he recommended the introduction of practical surgical and medical tests ;
   and to this may be traced much of the improvement which has taken
   place  of late years in all parts of the kingdom in practical medical teaching.
       In 1858 he was appointed by the Crown a Member of the General
   Council of Medical Education which was constituted under the Medical
   Act of that year. He served on this body till December 1860.
      In  connexion with medical education, he interested himself on the subject
    of Medical   Reform, and in 1842 and 1843 he wrote two letters to Sir
   James Graham on that subject. The second letter, which gives a risumi
   of the first, urges the need " for a good and uniform system of medical
   education," which he says should be the same throughout the empire for
   every medical practitioner.      He then sketches the constitution of  a  body

                                              XVI
to whom ought to be delegated the power of carrying out the prindpk
of education to be laid down by the Government.      He had evidently
                                                                                          day
formed an idea of a General Medical Council, which may yet some                           fe
turned to account.
   He did not, however, restrict his labours                   to medical   education.         He
took   a             in the improvement of the Universities generally, and
           deep interest
assisted Prince Albert in the projects which eventually ended   the altera      in
tions in the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford.       At later date      a                    as
was very active in aiding the reconstruction of the University  Aberdeen.       of
     His       attempt to improve purely scientific education was nude
           greatest
in connexion with the College of Chemistry.   He was deeply imprest
with the defective opportunities of studying practical chemistry  this                    in
country as compared with Germany, and with the unfavourable inflnens
that deficiency would have, not only on our scientific standing, but on our
powers as     manufacturing nation.
               a                      The influence of Liebig's doctrines
on  agricultural chemistry and on the improvement of the productrrc

James Clark's opinion appears to have been that the Continental sTstfin
of State aid had the effect of overweighting England in the race, and that
if   we wished to maintain our equality        in   science,    we had no option          but     to
imitate to  certain extent the Continental plan. The College of Chemistry,
             a
however, in the first instance, was intended to be self-supporting.     *¦                It
commenced in 1845 by Dr. Gardner         and Sir James Clark soon became
                                               ;
one of its most active supporters, and through his influence Prince Albert
interested himself greatly in it.
     In the summer of that year, when           the Queen          and Prince   were      in   Ger
many, Professor von Liebig was requested by Sir James to name some
chemist who could carry on in England the same kind of practical instruc
tion which had made Giessen so famous.    Liebig mentioned three name!.
and fortunately circumstances led to the selection             of Dr.Hofmann.         Through
the influence of Prince Albert, Dr. Hofmann obtained leave from the Uni
versity of Bonn for two years, and soon afterwards the College of Chemistry
was opened.
     How    successful    it   was   in
                                     scientific point of view, even from the first,

length the College of Chemistry eventually became incorporated with
Itoyal School of Mines. Since that time the College (which   partly w'/-        is
supporting) has done much to diffuse among our manufacturing and                                agri

cultural population a knowledge of Chemistry, and to advance the science
by original research.      It is to be regretted, however, that the College of
Chemistry, originally established as an independent institution, self-sup
porting, or aided, if necessary, by private means, could not maintain itself
on that footing.
    As far as possible also Sir James Clark gave a warm support to all plans
for promoting the study of Natural History, and was ready to urge on the
Government at any time any reasonable mode of doing this, or of furthering
independent inquiries.
    Passing from pure science, he had         a great share in the sanitary move
ment which has been so marked a feature of our days, although his name
was not brought before the public so prominently as that of others who
had really less influence.       From a very early period he had been a very
strong advocate of measures calculated to prevent disease and to improve
the public health.     He therefore used "his influence with the Government to
institute the Health of Towns' Commission, and those other early inquiries
which were the foundation         of the present movement.        He was at this
time    intimately acquainted both      with   Andrew   and George Combe, and
estimated very highly the philosophical characters of the two brothers.
 Some years afterwards he edited and partly rewrote one of Andrew
 Combe's Hygienic works on the Management of Infancy.
    At a very early date also, long before the Crimean war, he did what he
 could to get the sanitary state of the army and navy inquired into and
remedied.
    There can be no doubt that his service in the Navy had impressed him
 with the urgent importance of this subject, and had also given him a
 strong conviction of the waste of life in warlike operations.
    Owing probably to their knowledge of his exertions in this direction, the
 Government during the Crimean war requested his cooperation in the
 organization of Supplementary Civil Hospitals, in support of the Military
 Hospitals, which were overflowing and had proved unequal to the work
 entailed   by a severe campaign.       He assisted in the deliberations which
 resulted in the establishment of the Smyrna Hospital ; and subsequently,
 when a second hospital was required, the Government requested him to
 undertake the entire organization.         He did so, and the result was the
 great Hospital   of Renkioi on    the Dardanelles, which was intended for 3000
 sick.    This hospital, the design of which was made by Mr. Brunei, has
 proved the model    of the American Wooden Hospitals established during the
 late civil war, and indirectly has given rise to many of the arrangements
 in field hospitals in war which were carried out in Italy and Germany in
 the campaigns of 1859 and 1866, and are now being repeated on a still
 larger scale.
    It  was therefore not surprising that after the Crimean war he was asked
 to serve on the   Royal Commission, presided over by Mr. Sidney Herbert,
 for inquiring into the health of the army ; and he had no small share in

                                         XVlll
shaping the conclusions        arrived  at in that      well-known    and   important
inquiry.     He subsequently took an equal interest           in the Indian   Sanitary
Commission ; and it is really chiefly to his exertions and his influence with
the Government (in support of the persistent action of Miss Nightingale,
Sir Ranald Martin, Dr. Sutherland, and others) that we must attribute the
advance    which has been made in carrying out that most important reform,
a reform which will influence not only the European soldiers in India, but
the many million inhabitants of that empire.
    It is not wished to claim for Sir James Clark more honour than is due.
There were many other labourers in the field, and no one man unassisted
could have done such great works.           All that is urged for him is that be
was one   of the earliest of those who    saw the   importance of sanitary science,
and that he was ever ready with time and thought and influence to aid ia
the progress of inquiry and reform.          In connexion with military medical
arrangements, he served on the Committee which organized the Army
Medical School now stationed at Netley ; and he continued to the last
moment to take the warmest interest in everything connected with that
institution.
    In addition to the work of inquiry on sanitary legislation              among the
civil population and in the public services, he was very much interested in
the legislation for the insane.      In 1855 an American lady, Miss Dis, who
was visiting the lunatic asylums of England and Scotland, was refused ad
mission into some of the private asylums in the latter country-               In order
to compass her wishes, she obtained introductions            to some influential     per
sons, among others to     Sir James Clark, and the inquiries          then set on foot
led to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the Scotch
 Lunacy Laws. In this inquiry, and in the appointment of the Lunacy
 Commissioners which       followed   the Report of the Royal Commission, Sir
 James Clark      took an active share ; and in after years, when various
 attempts were made to revert to the old state of things, he spared neither
time nor trouble to stem the retrograde current by correspondence and
verbal remonstrance with Members of Parliament and Members of the
 Cabinet ; indeed, after his death, the Lord- Advocate quoted in Parliament
a letter from him as a justification     of the foundation of the      Scotch Lunacy
Board.
    Only two years before his death he wrote a life of Dr. Conolly, the object
 of which was not only to perpetuate the memory of his friend, but also to
place before the public the true treatment of the insane, and to rebut the
attempts, certainly feeble enough, which have been made to impair the wis
and benevolent mode of treatment which Conolly did so much to populariie-
    When it is considered that all these labours (and in the true sense of the
word his exertions were labours) were carried on in addition to the work
 entailed by his Court duties and a large private practice,         the great activity
of Sir James Clark will be appreciated.
    In this  sketch only some    of the public   services  rendered by him      can be

                                             XIX
referred to ; for his mode of using his influence was so unostentatious, and
his desire for a recognition of his services so small, that much of what he
did is scarcely known ; and the want of specific details in showing how his
influence was brought to bear in so many ways is owing to the modesty of
his nature. Justice, too, has hardly been done in the foregoing lines to his
scientific knowledge and sympathies.      In this respect, as in his constant
endeavour to promote the wellbeing of his fellowmen, he was so little self-
ubtrusive that few men knew the extent of his acquirements. He paid,
even to within a week of his death, constant attention to scientific progress,
and especially to its practical application.   Among his notes written but a
few weeks before his last illness are details of the composition and mode of
action of chloral. It was this union of a scientific spirit with great bene
volence of character which, aided by a large experience abroad and at
home, made him so excellent          a   physician.
   His position at the Court necessarily occupied much of his time and
thoughts ; he was unceasing in his attention to the health of the Queen and
of her children, and the Royal family owe to him much of that blessing of
health which has happily been their lot. He was on most confidential terms
with the Prince Consort ; and the Prince found in him a congenial adviser
on all points connected with education and science.   The Queen's trust in
him was early and firmly implanted, and was never impaired, and her
sympathy and, we can truly say, affection for him were manifested to the
last.
   Sir James Clark retired from private practiee in I860, and removed to
Bagshot Park, which Her Majesty had lent him for his life.         He died
there on the 29th of June, 18/0, in the eighty-second year of his age, re
taining almost to the last hour of his life a warm interest in all scientific
progress, and a heart-felt sympathy with every step which would promote
the improvement and happiness of his fellowmen.
   William Allen Miller,                 Vice-President    and Treasurer of the Royal
Society, was born at Ipswich, in Suffolk,             on the 1 7th of December, 1817.
He was indebted for his early education to his mother, whose memory he
cherished with the greatest love and respect, and whose quiet, sagacious
nature was reflected in him.   Mrs. Miller had a favourite maxim, "Take
 everything by the smooth handle ; and if a thing has not got a smooth
                     " Dr. Miller was actuated
 handle, make one !                             through life by the spirit
 of this axiom ; and we have known him, when giving advice to a friend who
 sought   it,   introduce the remark,     " Take
                                          by the smooth handle."

   Miller passed one year in Merchant Taylors' School, and two years at
 Ackworth, in Yorkshire, in  school belonging to the Society of Friends —

at Ackworth that he first distinctly remembered having acquired a Uste ft*
science, and a desire to devote his life to its cultivation ; and this was not
so much from the chemical lectures, or rather the chemical experiments,
which were shown to some of the boys, as from the fact that Miller wa
occasionally invited to look at the stars through a telescope belonging
                                                                                to
one of the masters.      These early impressions bore fruit in the chemistry
of the stars, with which his name is now associated.           At the age of 15 he
was apprenticed to his uncle, Mr. Bowyer Vaux, one of the honorary
surgeons in the General Hospital at Birmingham, of which, daring nearly
twenty years, his father, Mr. William Miller, was secretary.             After five
years he entered the medical department of King's College,
                                                                          London,
 where his superior knowledge of chemistry over that of the other students
 attracted the attention of Professor Daniell, who more than once expressed
 his surprise in the inquiry,
                                " Where did you get your knowledge from .
 One of those opportunities that occur in the lives of most people, but «re
 taken advantage of only by superior men, occurred in connexion with the
 chemistry lectures. Miller had no taste for surgical practice, and preferred,
 if possible, to get some employment in the laboratory of a manufacturing
 chemist, rather than become a medical practitioner.          Indeed he did per
 form some analyses for the Messrs. Chance, while in treaty with them for
 more permanent       employment.      But the laboratory assistant at Kings
 College having     been disabled   by illness, Daniell engaged the services ot
 Miller ; and when the office    of Demonstrator in the laboratory became va
 cant in 1840, he was appointed to the post.        It should be mentioned thai
 in 1839 Miller obtained the Warneford Prize for the encouragement of
 theological studies among medical students, and in 1840 he passed a fe»
 months in Liebig's laboratory at Giessen.        In 1841 he became Assistant
  Lecturer for Professor Daniell, and also took his degree of M.B. in the
  University of London, proceeding to M.D. the following year.             He also
  assisted Professor  Daniell in various scientific inquiries, and conducted the
  experiments on the electrolysis of saline compounds, his name being as
  sociated with that of Daniell in the paper that appeared in the Philoso
  phical Transactions for 1844.       In the following year he was elected »
  Fellow of the Royal Society, and on the death of Professor Daniell suc
  ceeded to the vacant chair of Chemistry in King's College.            The wnto
  of this notice was engaged in assisting Professor Daniell to bring out the
  third edition of his well-known work entitled " Meteorological Essays," and
  on the suddeu death of the author he requested Dr. Miller to cooperaK
  with him in completing the work, to which he readily assented. Df'
a
  Miller was engaged about this time in some experiments on Spectrum
 Analysis. They were conducted in a sort of lumber-room below the seats
 of the Chemical Theatre, and formed the subject of a paper which *«

                                          XXI
read before      the British Association and published in 1845 in the Philo
sophical Magazine (Series 3, vol. xxvii. p. 81). He thus became inter
ested at an early period in the subject of spectrum investigation.
    Miller continued during      some   years  to use as his text-book Professor
Daniell's    ' Introduction to the study of Chemical
                                                              Philosophy,' supple
mented at a later period by Fownes's 'Manual of Chemistry.'                       The
writer of this notice repeatedly urged Dr. Miller to bring out a work of
his own, which should be better suited to the wants of his pupils ; but he
hesitated in doing so lest he should at all interfere with his predecessor's
work.        I
          " must prepare the book," he said, "from my lecture-notes, and
you are not aware how much of Daniell I have in them."                 For some time
his idea was to accede to a proposal of the publisher of Daniell's work to
bring out a third edition, making such additions thereto as the progress of
science required, and to maintain it in its old position as the text-book.
But on looking over Daniell with this view, he found that so many addi
tions and alterations would be required as greatly to supersede the author's
peculiar touches ; so that he finally decided to produce a uew work, and
the first volume accordingly appeared in 1855.             In the preface to this
volume, which was devoted to " Chemical Physics," the author stated that
" he had decided to leave untouched the work of his late master, as the true
exponent of his views, upon some of those branches of science which his
researches had contributed to advance and adorn."               The two subsequent
 volumes on     " Inorganic"   and  "Organic Chemistry," which appeared, the
 one in 1856 and the other in 1857, were written from Miller's lecture-
 notes, as was also the case with the " Chemical Physics," the notes being
 so amplified as to form continuous reading, a process which led to so many
 insertions    and alterations as to make the manuscript difficult to read.
 But the effect of this mode of treatment was so far advantageous that
 when the books were introduced to the students, they, so far from having
 to conform to any new method, seemed to recognize in the new text-books
 the very lectures they had heard.
                                                                    '
     The three volumes of Miller's     *
                                         Elements of Chemistry         passed through
 several  editions, and  were  reprinted  in the United  States  of   America.  While
 not professing to set forth any marked original views, the work affords a clear
 and comprehensive exposition of the science, and soon became deservedly
 popular.     In the later editions Miller adopted the new method of notation
 in chemistry.      His conservative principles led him to resist this change as
 long as it was possible to do so.       Moreover, having been, during so many
 years, accustomed     to  the old  notation,  he never took kindly to the new.
  Indeed it was part of Miller's character to grasp a new idea with a certain
  amount of mental slowness     ;  but when once fairly appreciated, it was held
 tenaciously and not given up without a severe struggle.                But he was so
 conscientious that    he  would   sacrifice  every thing  to  what    he  held to be
  the truth.     The writer has known him to refuse to hold any further
 intercourse with a foreign man of science whom he had received iuto hi3
                                                                         c2

house and assisted in various ways, on hearing the expression of a doubt
as to the benevolence of the Almighty for permitting him to undergo so
much trouble.    Soon after he became Professor, he was on one occasion
giving evidence in a court of law on some scientific point connected with a
patent, when, during the cross examination, the Judge made a remark
which had the effect of questioning the veracity of the witness. Miller
felt this so keenly that he fainted, and had to be carried out of coin.
After a short interval the Judge sent to inquire how he was. Miller said,
*'
     I   shall   be better when   his Lordship    does   me   justice."    On his   return,
the counsel for the cross examination was proceeding to put questions
in the spirit of the objection, when the Judge stopped him, stating that
he had misunderstood           the witness, and explained how.
     As    a lecturer   Miller was more successful in style and        expression than     as
a writer, for his written composition had some tendency to                    become in
volved.   One of the best' specimens of his lectures is that on Speetrnm
Analysis, given before the British Association at Manchester in 1861,
at the time when Kirchhoff s researches had made the subject more than
usually popular.   One part of this lecture was devoted to an historical re
view of that remarkable branch of chemico-physical research ; and so little
attention had been paid to this part of the subject that when a large
audience were collected to hear, as they supposed, an account of Kirchhoff s
discoveries, they were not a little surprised to find KirchhofF occupying the
end of a long series of illustrious names, from Newton in 1701 to Wollas-
ton in 1802 and Fraunhofer in 1815 ; while the various other names were
arranged after the fashion of a genealogical tree, under the four heads o!
(1) Cosmical lines, (2) Absorption-bands,    (3) Bright lines produced by
the electric spark, and (4) by coloured flames, the four branches uniting
in the names of Kirchhoff and Bunsen, 1860. On the morning of the day
appointed        for that lecture, successful and brilliant as it was, Dr. Miller
was       seized with one of those bilious attacks to which he was subject, and
was so prostrated that he had to keep his bed nearly       up to the time of the
lecture, and return to it immediately after its close.     This gave occasion to
a little incident which deserves to be noted as illustrative of the cautious habit
of forethought of the man. In moving to the front of the crowded platform
with a bottle containing red nitrous fumes in his hand, in his weak state                     lie
stumbled and fell, breaking the bottle in pieces.  Immediately he sprang
to his feet, exclaiming "  have another
                                          " on which round of
                                                                  applause

caused him to remark, as   to himself, "  am too old lecturer to rely upon

friend and neighbour Mr. (now Dr.) Huggins, that Miller assented to a pro
posal made by Mr. Huggins that they should unite in carrying on a series of
experiments on the spectra of the heavenly bodies. Miller was at this
                                                                       time
engaged in an elaborate series of experiments which formed  the subject of
a paper read before the Royal Society, 19th June, 18G2, "On the Photo
graphic Transparency of various bodies, and on the Photographic effects of
metallic and other Spectra obtained by means of the Electric Spark."
This paper is inserted in the Philosophical Transactions for 1862.
  The joint labours of Miller and Huggins were continued during about

Miller in brain-work at College and elsewhere during the day.                                 The first
results of       their observations are given              in    a note on the lines in the spectra
of   some    of the fixed           stars,   1803*, from which it appears
                                              dated February
that a considerable time was devoted to the construction of apparatus
suited to this delicate branch of inquiry; but they had at length
" succeeded in contriving an arrangement which has enabled them to view
the lines in the stellar spectra in much greater detail than has been figured

instrument attached to the telescope it was possible not only readily to
 divide the sodium line D into its two compartments, but to exhibit also
the nickel line which Kirchhoffhad observed between them.             Tbespeetra
of the   stars were now, in the first instance, compared approximately with
the superposed atmospheric spectrum already alluded to, for the purpose
of suggesting what metallic lines probably existed in the star under obser
vation, and then were compared directly, by actual juxtaposition, with the
actual spectra of those metallic vapours which had been already suggested.
It seems impossible to conceive any process more rigidly or conscientiously
exact than that which Messrs. Huggins and Miller thus skilfully adopted ;
and here I may be excused for repeating that the attainment of the ulti
mate object    of the research depended, not on any approximation, however
close,  of the stellar with the metallic spectra, but on the certainty of their
absolute coincidence.     In this way, during the space of two years and a quar
ter, many of the midnight hours of these gentlemen were passed in the
 scrupulous examination and measurement of the spectra of upwards of fifty
stars ; but in several instances the number of the fine dark lines, the in
evitable indices (be it remembered) of the material constitution of these
distant worlds, were so numerous, that to measure and map them all the
labour of months would barely suffice.        The physical result of all this
scrupulous    and  conscientious  care was to discover the fact, or it may be to
confirm the suspicion, that those mysterious lights with which the firma
ment is spangled are in strict reality worlds fashioned, in their material con
stitution at least, not altogether differently from the fashion of the little
orb on which we live    ; beyond the question of a doubt they are proved, by
the investigations of our medallists, to contain at least the hydrogen, the
sodium, the magnesium, the iron with which all terrestrial creatures are
so  familiar."
    On Tuesday, May 14th, 1867, Miller commenced at the Royal Insti
tution a course of four lectures on " Spectrum Analysis, with its applica
tions to Astronomy." These lectures were reported in the ' Chemical
News,' under the revision of the author.        Again, at the Meeting of the
British Association at Exeter in 18(39, he gave a lecture on Spectrum Ana
                                                                           '
lysis to working men. This lecture was afterwards published in the Po
pular Science Review' for October 1869.
    Miller was interested in the subject of water analysis, and, in conjunction
with Professors Graham and Hofmann, prepared a Report for the Govern
ment " On the Chemical quality of the Supply of "Water to the Metro
polis." This was printed in 1851. At a later period he undertook an
investigation
                " On the combined Action of Air and Water on Lead," and
in 1 865 gave a lecture before the Chemical Society " On some points in
the Analysis of Potable Waters."
    Quitting the subject of Miller's original work, we pass on to a brief
notice of the various services rendered by him to Science.           He was ou
the Council of the Royal Society during the years 1848-50 and 1855-57,

                                         XXV
and being elected Treasurer on the 30th of November, 18G1, he served on
the Council in an official capacity till the time of his death. His metho
dical and punctual habits, his knowledge of affairs, and his excellent
judgment, with the earnest and lively interest he took in the welfare of the
 Society, rendered his special services as Treasurer of the utmost value ;
 whilst the same high qualities, combined with his accomplishment in
 science, singularly well fitted him for the various duties he had to perform
 as Member of the Council and a chief Officer of the Society.            The date of
 his election to the Fellowship    is 1845.
    Mr. Gassiot, who knew Miller intimately, referring to his merits as
 Treasurer,  writes, "a  more straightforward officer, or one more devoted to
 upholding the dignity and promoting the usefulness of the Royal Society,
 I  do not know ; and there is probably no one with whom Dr. Miller com
 municated on the subject so freely as myself."         Mr. White, the Assistant-
 Secretary, who habitually had to transact business with him, adds, "My own
 experience of Dr. Miller was, that on walking down to King's College I could
 tell beforehand the mood in which      I should find him — always uniform and
 considerate.    His decision on questions brought before him was generally
 quick and sound, and he was ready in detecting the weak points of an
 argument.                                                        I
               In the whole period that he was Treasurer never had a single
 disagreeable word with him."
    In 1866 Dr. Miller was nominated        a  Member of the Committee         then
 appointed for the purpose of superintending the Meteorological Observations
 made by direction of the Board of Trade, and served on it till the time of
 his death ; he was also an active Member of the Committee of the British
 Association for superintending the Kew Observatory, and devoted much time
 to that work.    The definition of the arrears to be executed under the
 superintendence of Mr. Balfour Stewart, as entered on the Minutes of the
 Committee, 9th March, 1870, was written by and inserted at Dr. Miller's
 particular request, in order specially to define the important work that has
 yet to be completed by the time when the connexion of the Observatory
 -with the British Association shall cease.
     It may here be mentioned that whilst a Member of the Committee ap
 pointed to advise on the scientific arrangements for the marine researches
  carried on during the voyage of the Porcupine' in 1869, Dr. Miller was
                                          *
 happy enough to contrive a thermometer adapted for taking deep-sea tem
 peratures, which has been found admirably to fulfil its purpose*.
    Miller was one of the original founders of the Chemical Society, and
 frequently presided over its meetings, as well as occupied a place at its
 Council Board. Along with his other various occupations, Dr. Miller was
 a Member of the Senate of the University of London, to which he was
 appointed, on the recommendation of Convocation, early in 1 865 ; and his
 sound judgment and knowledge generally, as well as his accomplishment
 in chemical and physical science and his experience as a teacher, gave
                 * Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xviii. p. 408.

great weight to his opinion in the deliberations of that body,        and causd
his loss to be severely felt.
    In addition to the various honours which rewarded Miller's         position as
a  scientific man, it should be mentioned that he received the degree of
 LL.D. at the University of Edinburgh, on the occasion of the installation
of Lord Brougham as the first Chancellor, that of D.C.L. at the Univer
sity of Oxford in June 1868, and that of LL.D. at the University of
Cambridge in May 1869, after giving the Reade Lecture, which on this
occasion was on the Coal-tar Colours.
    Perhaps the most marked feature in Miller's character was sagacity
combined with a deep sense of religion.             His religious views maybe
gathered,    although   imperfectly,  from  an  address  entitled " The Bible and
 Science," delivered at the Church Congress in Wolverhampton, October
3rd, 1867 ; also from his " Introductory Lecture," on the opening of the
Medical Session at King's College, October 1st, 1859, published under
 the title, " Hints to the Student on commencing his Medical Studies."
    In conclusion, the writer may      be allowed to repeat what     he said in    I
short notice at the period of Miller's death, drawn up at the reqeest of
the editor of the ' Chemical News' : — " During a quarter of a century Miller
continued to lecture with unceasing activity, and to take part in the manage
ment of King's College, every one, from the Principal and Professors to
the youngest student, being anxious to obtain his advice and assistance.
It  was impossible to come in contact with him        without feeling one's self in
the presence of a man of pure nature, of spotless integrity, of sound and
sagacious judgment, and of true gentlemanly feeling.             His loss will be
deeply felt, especially in King's College, in the Royal Society, in the Mint,
and the Bank of England, where he was one of the Assayers.             He will be
missed in the Courts of Law, where his clear perception of patented pro
cesses, and his strong sense of justice, made him respected alike by judge
and counsel.      He will be missed by the manufacturers who sought his
advice ; but, above all, he will be missed by his owu family, and by the
few friends who had his confidence."
    There had been symptoms of an overwrought brain for some months
previous to his last illness, which took place on the journey to Liverpool,
13th September, 18/0, at the time of the British Association gathering,
which, however, he was unable to attend, his illness culminating in apo
plexy on the 30th of the same month.           His remains were brought from
Liverpool     and  interred in the   cemetery  at Norwood, by the side of those
of his wife, whom he survived one year. He died on the anniversary o!
her burial, and at the comparatively early age of 53.       He married, in 184:',
Eliza, eldest daughter of the late Mr. Edward Forrest, of Birmingham, by
whom he leaves issue, two daughters and one son.        — C. T.

 John T. Graves, M.A., F.R.S.,          was son   of John C. Graves, of Dublin,
 Barrister-nt-La\v.    He was born in Dublin on the 4th of December, 1800,
 and passed some years in the school of the Rev. Samuel Field, Westbury-
 on-Trym, Somersetshire.         He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1823,
 and was a class-fellow of Sir William Rowan Hamilton, with whom, though
 living at a distance, he kept up a life-long friendship.          In his under
graduate career he was distinguished in both Science and Classics, and at
his Degree Examination in 1827 was awarded the Classical Gold Medal.
 He soon after took an ad eundem degree at Oxford, and was incorporated
in Oriel College, where he resided some time, and proceeded          to the degree
of M.A.       He  was also M.A. of Dublin University.       On the 10th of June,
 1831, he was called to the    Bar  as a  Member of the Inner Temple, and for
a   short time went the Western circuit.       In the year 1839 he was appointed
Professor of Jurisprudence in University College, London, in succession to
Mr. Austin, and not long after was elected to be Examiner in Laws
in the University of London.           The records of his work as a lawyer

are Twelve Lectures on the Law of Nations, published in the Law Times,'
commencing       April 25, 1845, and two elaborate articles contributed          to
      '
the Encyclopedia Metropolitann,' on Roman Law and Canon Law. About
this time he was a contributor to Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Biography     and  Mythology.     Among other articles from his     pen   are those
on Cato, Crassus, Drusus,      Gaius, and the Legislation of Justinian.
    As a scientific author Mr. Graves commenced his labours in his twentieth
year.    It was in October 182G that he was engaged in researches on
profound and subtle questions in analysis ; the results he obtained were
communicated to the Royal Society of London in the year 1828, and pub
lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829, under the title "An
attempt    to rectify the Inaccuracy   of  some  Logarithmic Formula;."        This
paper gave rise to interesting     and important     discussions, with which the
names    of M.Vincent, Peacock, Ohm, De Morgan, Warren, Rowan Hamilton,
and others are connected.       It was by meditating upon the results of this
memoir that Sir W. Rowan Hamilton was led to his ingenious theory of
Conjugate Functions or Algebraic Couples, as may be learned from Sir
W. R. Hamilton's abstract of a paper " On Conjugate Functions, or
Algebraic Couples, as tending to illustrate generally the Doctrines of
Imaginary Quantities, and as confirming the Results of Mr. Graves respect
ing the existence of two Independent Integers in the complete expression
of an Imaginary Logarithm," as well as from an abstract of a " Memoir on
the Theory of Exponential Functions," both published in the Beport of the
British Association for 1834. In continuation of the same and allied re
searches,    Mr. Graves contributed a paper to the Philosophical Magazine
for April 1830, "On the lately Proposed Logarithms of Unity, in reply to
Prof. De Morgan ;" and in November and December of the same year
another, entitled " Explanation of a remarkable Paradox in the Calculus of
Functions, noticed by      Mr. Babbage."      To the  same  journal   were  contii

hibited in the Notation of certain Geometrical Porisms when they are
stated    merely     with   reference   to   the arrangement of points;       and   in
April    18-15 a   paper  on  a Connexion    between the General Theory      of Nor

Meeting     of the   British  Association   contains abstracts of papers communi
cated by him on the Polyhedron of Forces, and on the Congruence w=

    The   above   list of papers, itself incomplete, is far from    representing   ade
quately Mr.     J.   T. Graves's contributions to mathematical         science.    The
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy contain many traces                 of his   in
tellectual activity ; and by his long correspondence with Sir William           Rowan
Hamilton, commenced at an early period and maintained until death in
terposed, Mr. Graves may be said to have taken no small part in bring
ing to maturity the splendid conception of Quaternions, by which alone
the name of Hamilton would have been rendered immortal. In his pre
face to the ' Lectures on Quaternions,'         Sir William makes frequent allusion
to the suggestive character of his correspondence with his early friend,
and warmly expresses his indebtedness thereto.
    Mr. Graves was oue of the Committee of the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge.           In the year 1839 he was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society, and he subsequently served upon its Council. He was also
a Member        of the     Philological    Society and     of the Royal    Society     of
Literature.
    For many     years past he had taken interest         in forming  a collection     of
mathematical works of all ages and countries, a collection which, though
only to be appreciated by the few, is by those qualified, who are acquainted
with it, considered to be almost unique for historical curiousness and com
pleteness    ; and nearly every book composing it was bound under his direc
tion with costly care and elegance.             This portion of his library he be
queathed to University College, London, in remembrance of his former
connexion as Professor with that Institution.
    In the year 1846, soon after his marriage with the daughter of the late
William Tooke, Esq., F.R.S., he was appointed Assistant Poor-Law Com
missioner,     and    on the constitution      of the present Board in 184/ was
made Poor-Law Inspector.              He served efficiently in that department
till the past month, when he sent in his resignation, an act which he did
not long survive.         He died on the 29th of March, at his residence in
Cheltenham, at the age of G3.
