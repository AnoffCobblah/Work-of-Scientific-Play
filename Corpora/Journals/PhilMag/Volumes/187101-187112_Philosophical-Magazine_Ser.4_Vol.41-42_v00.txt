I.   On the Examination of the Bessemer Flame with Coloured
     Glasses and with the Spectroscope, By J. M. SILLIMAN, M.E.,
     Adj. Prof, of Metallurgy, Lafayette College, Easton, Pa.*
                I. Examination with    Coloured Glasses.
       the Bessemer process the progress of the decarbonization is
IN determined      chiefly by the appearance of the smoke, flame,
and sparks which are emitted from the apparatus.         Owing to
the rapidity with which the reactions take place, it is highly
important to catch the exact moment when the blast should be
turned off. This is indicated by the colour and brightness of
the stream of gas issuing from the converter; and by this the
moment of total decarbonization can generally be accurately de
termined by the naked eye.      When, however, pig iron of certain
qualities is used (manganiferous iron, For example)this determina
tion is very difficult ; even those who have had much experience
make frequent mistakes, and find it impossible to produce the
same quality of steel at every blow.
   In order to intensify these flame-indications, use has been
made of the spectroscope, and also of various combinations of
coloured glasses.    The former was first attempted by Dr. Roscoe,
and the latter by Mr. Rowan at the Atlas Works.
   Mr. Rowan experimented with a great variety of coloured
glasses, and obtained the best results by using three glasses —
two of ultramarine-blue and one of dark yellow.      This little in
strument (or chromopyrometer, as he terms             now in daily
                                                     it)   is
use at the Atlas Works, its indications being so marked and un-

2    Prof. Silliman  on t/te  Examination oftfie   Bessemei- Flame
mistakable   as to render    its use  safe in the most inexperienced
hands.
   The following experiments were made at the Bessemer Steel
Works of John A. Griswold and Co., in Troy, while pursuing
the chemical course in the Winslow Laboratory of the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute. In my observations on the flame, made    I
use of the spectroscope and also of a combination of coloured
glasses.   This combination consisted of two light-yellow glasses
and a blue one, through which the sunlight appeared of a deep
purplish-blue tint ; and as it differed slightly from Rowan's, it
gave somewhat different results.
   In order to reproduce the appearance of the flame at the dif
ferent stages of the process,       I  prepared a plate consisting of
about a hundred varieties of colours and tints, all of which were
numbered, and thus referred to a Table which indicated their
composition.     They were also arranged to be seen with either a
light or dark background. The use of this plate was of neces
sity limited to daylight ; but the illustration and description are
given as occurring at night in order to show its illuminating-
power.
   At the beginning of the process that which issues from the
converter does not appear to be a true flame, but only an illu
mined stream of gas carrying with it innumerable red-hot pellets
of iron. This gas has scarcely any illuminating-power, extends
but a short distance from the mouth of the converter, and is
sometimes sheathed with a whitish smoke.             Seen through the
glasses, the flame and sparks have a deep         crimson  colour, the
converter is invisible, and at the base of the flame is a crimson
band which continues throughout the process.
   As the reaction continues, this stream of gas grows brighter
and more elongated, and after a few minutes a small pointed
whitish flame appears which suddenly increases in size.             At
this instant the blast-pressure falls from twenty to eighteen
pounds.
    When viewed through the glasses, the upper part of the con
 verter comes dimly into view, and the flame and pellets of iron
 appear of a lighter colour, while the fragments of slag which
 begin to be thrown out are of a deep red. This difference in
 shade between the iron and slag thrown out is probably entirely
 owing to the lower temperature of the latter —for the reason that,
 while the iron is discharged from the metallic bath, the slag is
 washed up on the sides of the converter, and can be seen cling
ing around its mouth in a spongy mass until detached and
thrown out by the blast.        The greater porosity of the slag and
its consequent more rapid cooling would also cause a difference
of temperature.

          with Coloured Glasses and with the Spectroscope.        3
    In   the second period the discharge of slag increases, and the
flame is very bright and illuminating with occasional dark
streaks.      Through the glasses at the beginning of this period
the flame is of an ashy-blue colour with streaks and flashes of
crimson, the edges being sometimes of a purplish hue.            At
this point surrounding objects are illuminated, and the converter
becomes distinctly visible.     A wreath of crimson is seen sur
rounding the flame where it strikes the chimney. By the middle
of this period the crimson almost entirely disappears from the
body of the flame, leaving only a slight cone at its base, and a
border of greenish hue makes its appearance and gradually
grows more decided.        Streaks of a dark blue colour are also
 seen   in the body of the flame.
     The beginning of the third period is scarcely indicated to the
naked eye, though the flame becomes somewhat weakened, and
after a few minutes shows dark streaks running through it.
 Through the glasses, at the commencement of this period the rose-
coloured cone begins to expand and deepen, the greenish sheath
is more decided, while streaks of dark and green are visible.
After a few minutes the change becomes very rapid, a few
 seconds only being required to reduce the flame from rose-
 colour to the deep crimson non-illuminating gas as at first, and
 again the converter is lost to view, by which time the blast
 should have been turned off.
     The gradual fading of the crimson from the beginning of
 the blow and its deepening at the termination of the process, as
 well as the crimson band at the base of the flame and the
 wreath of crimson surrounding the flame at the chimney, tend
to confirm Mr. Rowan's views, which are that the different
 shades of crimson are due to changes of temperature.           The
 stream of gas which comes from the mouth of the converter
 at the beginning of the process being illumined from within,
 derives its colour from the metallic bath, the temperature of
 which, owing to the combustion of silicon, increases more ra
 pidly during this period than at any other.
     The crimson band at the base of the flame and the wreath of
 crimson at the chimney might also be accounted for by this
 theory.      The flame rushing from the mouth of the converter
 has a tendency to create a vacuum at its base around the con
 verter's edge, and thus to cause a wreath of flame to pass over
 this surface, and by consequent cooling produce the crimson
 band.      The wreath of crimson at the chimney may be also due
 to the cooling of the flame consequent upon deflection.
      It is true we have a seeming contradiction to this theory in
  the rose-coloured    cone extending from the base at the centre,
  which we should naturally consider the hottest part of the flame ;

4    Prof. Silliman     on the Examination of     the Bessemer Flame
but, as in the flame of the Bunsen burner, the hottest part is in
its outer sheath ; the conditions of combustion in both being
similar, it is probable that that part of the flame occupied by the
cone is at a lower temperature than that surrounding it.
    The green streaks in the flame are most intense when the
manganese spectrum is brightest ; and as the colour of the flame
when the Spiegeleisen is added is also green, we are led to sup
pose them due to the presence of manganese.
    On two occasions simultaneous observations were made with
the spectroscope and the coloured glasses ; but, with the excep
tion of that just mentioned, and the changes at the commence
ment and termination of the blow, no striking coincidence was
noticed.
                II.  Examination with    the Spectroscope.
    The science of spectrum-analysis        is yet in its infancy ; and
there has been no scientific investigation, perhaps, which has
 been more contradictory in its results than that of the Bessemer
 flame.    The first application of the spectroscope to the analysis
 of the  Bessemer     flame was made in ] 862, by Dr. Roscoe, at the
 works of Messrs. John Brown and Co., in Sheffield.            Soon after
 this it was in constant use in Brown's works for controlling the
 process.    It was next introduced at Crewe, and from there is
 said to  have   been taken to Seraing, in Belgium, in 1865.
    Roscoe's account of the general appearance of the spectrum
 has not altogether been verified by subsequent observers.           His
 not having seen any line beyond 80° indicates an imperfection
 in his instrument.        He also is the only one who claims to have
 seen the sodium-line as an absorption-band, or who professes to
 have detected the lines of nitrogen and hydrogen in the Bes
 semer spectrum.         His spectroscope was so arranged that the
 spectrum    of  the Bessemer    flame was seen in the upper half of
 the field of view, while the spectrum with which it was to be
 compared was seen immediately below.               The spectrum of the
 flame was thus compared with the following spectra : —
 1. Spectrum of electric discharge in carbonic-oxide vacuum.
 2.         „         strong spark between silver poles in air.
3.          „             „            „      iron       „
4.          „             „            „        „             hydrogen.
5. Solar spectrum.
6. Carbon spectrum — oxyhydrogen blowpipe supplied with de
        fiant gas and oxygen.
    The coincidences observed were very few, and totally failed
to explain the value of the Bessemer spectrum.              The lines of
the well-known carbon spectrum did not occur at all, either as

          with Coloured Glasses and with      the Spectroscope.         5
  bright lines or absorption-bands, nor was any coincidence ob
  served between the lines of the Bessemer spectrum and those
  of the carbonic-oxide      vacuum-tube.       The lines of lithium,
  sodium,    and potassium    were    strongly marked, and identified
 with certainty.    He found that three fine bright lines between
  E  and b, shown on the plate at 66£°, 67°, and 67i°, coincided
  with those of iron ; and in place of the red hydrogen-line C he
  discovered a black band which he considered an absorption-
  band, and states that it is better defined in wet than in dry
 weather.
     In Austria Professor Lielegg followed up this subject with
 great perseverance, and gave more extended accounts of the
 varying character of the Bessemer spectrum during the different
 stages of the process.       His experiments were made at Gratz,
 where the spectroscope was afterwards used with great success
 in controlling the Bessemer process; but at Konigshiitte,
 where dark grey manganiferous iron was used, it was found that
 the indications which in other works so plainly determined the
 moment of decarbonization were unreliable.              In this case the
 lines, whose disappearance is to indicate the exact point of time
 for ending the process, disappear too soon. During the period
 in which the spectrum is brightest, among the glowing vapours
 and gases that stream from the converter, carbonic oxide, next
 to nitrogen, is most abundant ; and it is for this reason that
 the first investigator (Roscoe) expressed himself as confident
 that the numerous lines of the spectrum were caused by this
 gas, although he could obtain no coincidence.
     Brunner* states that " no part of the Bessemer spectrum is
 ever visible in the flame when the converter is heated for the
 first time after being relined, but, that when the lining is not
new, Lielegg's group of green lines (CCty) appears in the spec
 trum, which then contains also the lines of potassium, sodium,
 and lithium," — from which he concludes that this spectrum is
not to be identified with carbonic oxide, but must be produced
by other constituents of pig iron. Others state that the Bes
semer spectrum is sometimes visible while the converter is being
heated after a blow.      I  made an observation of the flame from
the converter while    it was  being heated the first time after being

    Lichtenfels, by a series of simultaneous comparisons of the
manganese with the Bessemer spectrum, found the lines in the
blue and green fields to completely harmonize in the two spectra.

6     Prof. Silliman    on the   Examination of the Bessemer Flame
could not detect in either of the spectra.            I have never observed
it ; but Dr. Wedding, who has summed up the observations of
others, states that he has repeatedly seen it.               Its position is
at
     135^°.
     The instrument used in my investigations was constructed by
 A-lvan Clark of Cambridge, and consists of an equiangular flint-
glass prism, in a metallic box, into the sides of which at the
requisite angles are screwed an inverting-telescope              with a mag-
nif'ying-power of six, and a tube containing the adjustable slit
 and lens for rendering the rays parallel — also a tube with a scale,
which is placed at such an angle that it is reflected from the
 surface of the prism through the telescope to the eye ; it can be
 so adjusted as to appear along the upper edge of the spectrum.
 I   was provided with Bunsen's plates of spectra on a large scale ;
 and in order to adapt them to the scale in my instrument,                   I
 took the spectrum of the sun and obtained Fraunhofer's lines
 with great distinctness.          Two characteristic lines in the solar
 spectrum    were    then  noted,  one of which appeared at 37° and the
 other at 117°, and a space        measured     equal to their distance apart
 as given on Bunsen's scale.           This was divided into eighty equal
 parts, and the division extended in both directions.              By the ap
 plication   of  this  scale to   Bunsen's,    I found  that   the  remainder
 of Fraunhofer's lines in my           instrument    exactly coincided with
 their position on his plates.          The correctness of the new scale
 was also proved by other coincidences.              By moving the prism,
 Fraunhofer's lines will vary slightly in their relative distances
 apart ; but in no possible position in which              I could place the
 prism could       I obtain the sun-spectrum as given by Wedding in
 connexion with the Bessemer spectrum ; if the spectrum given
 by him was obtained by the use of bisulphide of carbon in his
 prism, that substance causes a greater variation than                 I  had
 supposed.
      I have recorded the results of twenty-five observations on the
 Bessemer flame, most of which were taken at a distance of about
 thirty feet from the flame, though          I  have stationed myself at in
 termediate points between that and the flame, at one time sitting
 so close as to be almost scorched.             Nearly all my observations
 were made at night, and the lines obtained much better denned
 than when seen in diffused sunlight.
      The record of my observations was kept as follows : — Five
 columns were ruled, headed —
   |  Degree.     |
                     Colour.   |   Brightness.     | Time.    |
                                                                 Remarks.    |
 Note was made of the dark bauds as well as the bright ones, both
 of which were classed according to their distinctness, as very
 bright, bright, faint, and very faint. In the time-column was

           with Coloured Glasses and with   the Spectroscope,        7
 noted the number of minutes after the commencement of the
 blow at which the lines appear.
     At the first two or three observations   I attempted to make a
 thorough note of the changes as they occurred throughout the
 whole spectrum, but afterward abandoned it as utterly impos
 sible, as at the beginning of the second period the lines come in
 so fast and the changes are so rapid that they cannot be accu
 rately noted at the exact moment of their occurrence.        I there
 fore confined myself to a few degrees at each observation, and by
 this method was enabled to note accurately, and at the exact
 moment of their occurrence, slight changes which otherwise
 might have escaped notice.      Note was also taken of the changes
 in the general appearance of the whole spectrum during the
 successive stages of the process.       After having made half a
 dozen observations, while viewing the spectrum of the flame
 from the converter while it was being heated for another charge,
 it was discovered that a movement of the eye before the eye-glass
 occasioned a similar movement of the lines of the spectrum along
 the scale, on which their position could thus be made to differ
 more than half a degree.     I  have seen no notice of this in the
 statements of others ; and it may account for some of the appa
rent discrepancies.     Thereafter, when taking the readings of any
 of the lines, the position of the eye was so adjusted as to bring
 the sodium-line exactly at 50°. Owing to the extreme brilliancy
of the flame, the aperture maybe made exceedingly narrow, and
 thus the many lines of the spectrum, which with a duller light
 and broader gauge would be blended together, may be separated.
    At the beginning of the blow the spectrum is continuous and
very faint, and generally extends from 35° to 120°, covering
about three-fourths of the length attained in the second period.
This increases slightly in extent and brightness until the ap
pearance of the sodium-line.       This line appears at the end of
the first period, at the beginning of a more decided flame.         It
comes flashing through from one extremity to the other for an
instant, and then disappears, only to return the next instant in
brighter flashes, which are continued for about a minute, by
which time the line becomes permanently established.          On one
occasion the sodium-line, instead of flashing and disappearing as
usual, continued visible after a few seconds, and expanded and
contracted in width almost isochronously until it became perma
nently established.     The appearance of this line indicates the
termination of the first period.    This period  I have found to vary
in extent from three to seventeen minutes in blows lasting from
thirteen to twenty-seven minutes.       None of the other lines make
 their appearance in vivid flashes as does the sodium.            The
 lithium-line becomes visible three or four minutes after the first

8      Prof. Silliman     on the  Examination of   the Bessemer  Flame
"flash  of the sodium.        It is very faint at first, but soon becomes
quite   distinct,   and  lasts  through the blow.      The vivid flashing of
the sodium-line may be accounted for by the exceedingly small
 amount of sodium required to produce its spectrum, an amount
 not exceeding TSTTtritioTro" °^ a Sram<         The slightest momentary
 combustion taking place in the stream of gas from the converter
 would at that instant render glowing a sufficient amount of the
 vaporized sodium to produce its spectrum, and thus occasion the
 flashes so characteristic in the first appearance of that line.
 Lithium exists in a much smaller quantity, and requires ^^JfrnjiJ
 of a grain, or thirty times that given for sodium.             By the time
 the lithium -line is established the red potassium-line at 23^°
 and, occasionally, the violet line at 135° appear, and the blue and
 green fields become divided into bands which are so rapidly re
 solved into bright and dark lines that it is difficult to note the
 exact time of the appearance of each.            The spectrum increases
 to a dazzling brightness, and extends itself in both directions
 until it reaches from 23£° to 140°.
     During the third period the spectrum becomes more brilliant
 and the lines more distinct.           Several new lines make their ap
 pearance in different parts of the spectrum, of which the ones at
 51£°, 57°, and 67° are well defined, while others are faint and
 not always visible, some of them appearing only toward the
 close of the last period.          In viewing the lines in the most re
 fracted part of the spectrum, it has been repeatedly observed,
 both by myself and others, that these lines were more strongly
 marked when entering the eye at an angle than when viewed
 directly.    That this was not imagination is proved by repeated
 identification of lines at the same point on the scale.
     At the termination of the blow the lines are rapidly swept
  away, sometimes in the inverse order of their appearance, but
  more generally they disappear within the space of two or three
  seconds, leaving a continuous spectrum as at first, though some
  what brighter.        Sometimes the sodium- and lithium-lines are
  swept away with the others, and at other times they remain
  visible.   In either case the change is very decided, and does not
  generally occupy more than three seconds.             In the course of my
  observations thirty-three lines have been detected, as given in
  the Table below.
     Some of the lines given by Lielegg          I  have failed to find, but
  have detected others not given by him.

   Among the dark bands detected, the most intense occurred at
44-46, 51-55, 56-58, 62-641; others were found at 33-34£,
361, 371, 38i; 40, 68-72.
   Many of the dark bands were crossed by bright lines.
   I have repeatedly observed the dark band considered by Roscoe
to be a hydrogen absorption-line, but have not noticed that its in
tensity varied with the dampness of the weather.        Whether it
is an absorption-band or not can be determined by a series of
observations continued through wet and dry weather.          If this
proves to be a hydrogen-line, the Bessemer spectrum will be
found more complicated than is generally supposed.           It has
been thought by some that the dark bands in the spectrum are
absorption-lines due to the cooling of the outer sheath of flame ;
but it is more probable that although the pellets of iron and
slag tend to produce a faint continuous spectrum, yet in con
trast with the very brilliant lines it appears discontinuous, the
dark bands being merely intervals between the bright ones.
The iron spectrum has not been satisfactorily identified.      It has
been suggested that the brightness and size of the lines of the
Bessemer spectrum do not allow the iron-lines to appear.           In
comparing the Bessemer spectrum with Bunsen's spectra of
nickel, cobalt, and calcium, no coincidences were observed, except
two or three in the latter spectrum.    The brightest calcium-line,
however, was not visible in the Bessemer spectrum.         The Bes
semer spectrum contains yet many mysteries to be solved, among
which is the cause of the non-appearance of the lines of the
spectrum at the beginning and termination of the blow.
   This was readily solved when the numerous lines of the spec
trum were attributed to carbon ; but in proving them to be
caused principally by manganese, their disappearance is not so
readily accounted for.
   One theory to account for it is that the luminous power of
the flame is too small at the beginning and end of the process
to produce a spectrum.       In regard to this, it may readily be
shown that the brilliancy of the spectra of incandescent metallic
vapours does not depend upon the illuminating-power of a flame,
but upon the heat of the flame into which they are introduced.
 For instance, the spectra are more distinct in the non-luminous
flame of a Bunsen lamp than in the ordinary luminous gas-flame.
If we take the theory as referring to the feebleness of light given
off by those substances in the flame which produce the spectrum,
it will resolve itself into the one of change of temperature, not

    10   Prof. Silliman on        the  Examination of     the Bessemer   Flame
    withstanding the fact that the illuminating-power of flames of
    the same temperature varies with the composition of the gas,
   because there is evidently enough sodium in the flame to give its
    characteristic line ; hence, whatever might be the illuminating-
   power of the flame, if the heat is sufficiently intense, the sodium-
   line will show itself.
       Dr. Wedding adopts the theory that the absence of the spec
   trum at the beginning and termination of the blow is because
   the absolute quantity of the bodies volatilized producing the
   spectrum is at these times too small.               His reasons for holding
   this view   are  as  follows   : — "A   trace  of  sodium will give its cha
   racteristic line ; but, according to Simmler, a much larger quan
   tity of manganese is needed to obtain a recognizable reaction than
   that which can be detected by the well-known blowpipe reaction
   with carbonate of soda. Consequently spectrum-analysis                   does
   not depend alone upon the presence of a body, but also upon the
   presence of a certain quantity.              And although manganese is
   always   left in  the  iron,   it  may  not   be left in sufficient quantity
  at the termination of the blow to produce the spectrum, and for
  this reason the lines disappear."
      To this theory there are some strong objections.                1st. If we
  take manganese in sufficient quantity and hold it in a flame, the
  spectrum will increase in brightness until a uniform temperature
  is attained ; but when the amount of manganese vaporized
  begins to diminish, its spectrum will gradually decrease in.
  brightness until it disappears.             Now, if the disappearance of
  the manganese-lines in the Bessemer spectrum is owing to the
  diminution of the quantity of manganese, we should infer that
  these lines would gradually grow more indistinct and then fade
 away ; but, on the contrary, the manganese-spectrum                   increases
 in brilliancy from its first appearance, and is more intense just
 before being swept away than at any other time.                   The analysis
 of the smoke, which appears when the flame ceases, proves that
 a considerable quantity is still volatilized; and it is notable that
 in manganiferous iron this quantity increases towards the close
 of the blow.         2nd. It would be more difficult to account by
 this theory for the non-appearance of the sodium-line at the
beginning of the blow, as sodium then in all probability exists
 in the issuing gas in sufficient quantity to produce its spec
trum at a high temperature, as it is only by special precaution
that we can keep it out from any flame.                    3rd. A still greater
 difficulty   would    arise  in    applying   this  theory to the spectra of
sodium and lithium at the close                of  the blow.    As has before
been stated, these lines sometimes disappear at the moment of
complete decarbonizatiou, and sometimes remain.                   In the former
case,   to  say   that   our   friend    sodium     had  given  out   would be

           with Coloured Glasses and with the Spectroscope.          11
doing great injustice to that element, as it has never given ua
reason for bringing so grave a charge against it.      Dr. Wedding,
in attempting to demonstrate that the non-appearance of the
manganese-lines      is owing to the lack of sufficient quantity
 volatilized to produce its spectrum, makes the following state
ments    : —
    Prom' analyses made by Brunner we find that the manga
nese contained in the iron falls from 3'460 per cent, in the. raw
 material to 1-645, 0-429, and finally to 0-113 per cent, in the
 decarbonized product, and that the protoxide of manganese in
the slag first increases from 37'00 per cent, to 37-90 per cent.,
and then sinks to 32"23 per cent., and, furthermore, that a certain
 quantity of manganese is to be found in the smoke.         How much
 manganese is really lost by volatilization cannot be determined,
 since data are wanting as to the absolute quantity of slag and
 iron ; consequently we cannot determine how much manganese
 has been lost by means of the eruptions.
    But since the manganese contained in the pig-iron decreases
 constantly, and that contained in the slag after the termination
 of the boiling-period also decreases, a considerable volatilization
 of this body is probable just at the time when the spectrum
 is best developed.     Comparing with this the experiments that
 can be made in the laboratory, we arrive at the hypothesis
 that the oxidized manganese which has entered into the slag
 is not volatilized, but is retained by the slag ; it can therefore
 get into the flame only in the shape of solid or fluid combi
 nations.
     In  the above statements the results of the analysis prove
 that some of the manganese in the slag is volatilized. We
 cannot consider the manganese-spectrum during the entire pro
 cess to be due wholly to the volatilization of the manganese directly
 from the iron ; for while the amount eliminated from the iron
 grows continually less, the manganese-spectrum grows brighter.
 Owing to the intimate mixture by the blast of the iron and
 slag, the manganese oxide contained in the latter is brought
 into contact with the melted iron and vaporized.         This mixing
 of the slag and iron would cease at the termination of the
 process ; and this would account for the sudden diminution of
 smoke.
     If there were a sufficient carbonic-oxide flame to render the
  escaping gases glowing, it is evident they would not issue from
 the converter as dark smoke, but as incandescent vapour
 having its characteristic spectrum.       The lack of sufficient flame
  may therefore account for the disappearance of the manga
 nese spectrum.       The Bessemer flame presents other problems
 and opens an intensely interesting field for scientific investiga

tion  ; and by the use of more delicate instruments than have
yet   been    employed for this purpose, discoveries may be made
which will throw new light upon the subject of spectrum-
analysis.
II.   On the     Spectra of Carbon.         By W. MARSHALL WATTS,
   D.Sc., Physical- Science Master in the Manchester Grammar-
    School*.
        the Philosophical Magazine for October 1869           I described
IN and       figured   a   spectrum  of carbon, which, so far as I know,
had not been previously observed, viz. the spectrum obtained
when the spark from an induction-coil is taken in carbonic an
hydride or carbonic oxide, and a Leyden jar is included in the
circuit.   I  have recently had the opportunity of mapping the spec
trum with      a three-prism spectroscope of Browning's.
   I  have converted the angular readings into wave-lengths by
means of an interpolation-curve carefully drawn from exact ob-

   The brightest groups of lines are denoted by the Greek letters ;
and the reading of each line is given on the same scale to which

band is shaded with dark lines which are closer together at the

           following few experiments do not exhibit any new facts ;
THE      but they illustrate known facts in somewhat new forms,
and may in some cases be found useful as lecture-experiments.
   §  1.  Magnetism of solid Sulphate of Iron. — The soft-iron poles
of a powerful electromagnet, of the form shown in Plate I. fig. 1,
are brought nearly into contact with one another, their upper sur
faces being in a horizontal plane.       A half sheet of thick cream-
laid note-paper is laid upon the poles, and powdered dry sulphate
of iron is strewn upon the paper.         On tapping the paper, the

powder arranges itself immediately above the poles in a manner
which need not be represented in a diagram, because the lines
of accumulation are identical with the edges of the poles, as in
fig. la.     No especial precaution is required for the produc
tion of this effect. The powdered crystalline sulphate should
be dried for a few seconds above a lamp on a sheet of paper.
The effect is shown well if black glazed paper is employed, or a
thin sheet of mica or of glass such as is used for mounting mi
croscopic objects.    The image of the magnetized sulphate of iron
may    be thrown   on a screen in the usual way.     As might be an
ticipated, no lines indicating lines of magnetic force are exhibited.
    § 2. Magnetism of solution of Sulphate of Iron.
                                                        — This is usu

of mica resting on the two poles.        The visible effect       is,

are brought within about one eighth of an inch of one another,
and two or three drops of the solution suspended between the
poles in contact with both (fig. 2a).      The liquid mass will find    a
position of equilibrium resulting from its weight, cohesion, and
adhesion to the iron.     On exciting the magnet, the liquid mass
is  seen to rise so as to collect around the upper edges of the
poles, as in fig. 26.        motion of half an inch can be easily
                                A

easily thrown on the screen.

 of bismuth may be finely ground in a porcelain mortar for an
 hour, and the finer portion shaken through a linen bag containing
 a lump of the metal.       The residue which refuses to pass is em
 ployed.     This is strewn uniformly and not too thickly on a sheet
 of white glazed paper, which is laid upon the poles of the electro
magnet.       On exciting the magnet and gently tapping the paper,
 figures of accumulation are produced, such as are shown in
fig. 3, a and b. If glass be used instead of paper, the relative
position of these lines and the edges of the magnet can be ex
amined.       In a the poles are nearer together than in b. In a
the continuous lines represent the edges of the poles as seen
through the glass.        The dotted masses show the distribution of
the powder.        In b the magnetic poles are omitted, but are re
presented by dotted lines, which consist of finely pencilled ridges
of powder accumulated immediately above the edges of the iron
poles. When the poles are as near together as they are in a, no
such lines are seen. These lines disappear on continually tap
ping the paper or glass, and therefore, I conclude, are not to be
attributed to any region of attraction, or to any exceptional
structure in the bismuth, but may be compared to the ridge of
powder which will rest on the edge of a blunt wedge pointing
vertically upwards when powder is strewn on it. Lying, in fact,
immediately above the region of maximum repulsion, they are in
unstable equilibrium.
     If the paper (for the following experiment paper is preferable to
glass) supporting the uniformly distributed bismuth-powder be
moved horizontally, one or two little ridges of powder are formed
 (according to the nearness of the poles), which remain stationary
as the paper passes beneath them, the particles shifting and
rolling so as to maintain the same positions with regard to the
poles beneath. With care a whole sheet of paper may be passed
beneath.       These rolling ridges are best seen when the poles are
at a distance intermediate between the distances in a and b, so
that there is only a narrow isthmus of bismuth-powder situated
equatorially between the poles, as in fig. 3 c. The ridges are the
isthmus of powder, and the accumulation p or q (fig. 3 c) , ac
cording as the paper is moved towards q or p respectively.           I
have not found any further structure in the distribution of the
bismuth-powder analogous to the structure in the arrangement
of particles of iron under similar conditions — no indication, in
fact, of lines of diamagnetic force.      The bismuth separated from
the nitrate by zinc, or from the subnitrate by zinc and sulphuric
acid, has not in my hands proved so good for showing these effects
as    the powdered metal.       These diamagnetic phenomena       may
easily   be transferred  to the  screen in the usual way.

IV.    On the Electromotive Force on the Contact              of different Metals.
                              By E. EDLUND*.
        a previous  paperf        I
                                have proved that if a voltaic current
IN traverses     an electromotor in the same direction as the cur
rent produced by the electromotor itself, an amount of heat is
absorbed in the electromotor which is proportional to the electro
motive force multiplied by the intensity of the current.              the    If
current is in the opposite direction, a quantity of heat is pro
duced which is also proportional to the same product.            For the
same intensity of    the  current, the quantities of heat absorbed or
produced are therefore proportional to the electromotive forces.
If   a current is allowed to traverse a conducting-wire consisting
of two different metals, at the place of contact between them there
must be an alteration of temperature, because there exists at that
   lace an electromotive force.              If
                                        the current goes in the same
5 irection as that caused by the electromotive force, cooling ensues
at the place of contact ; but there is an increase of temperature in
the opposite case.      Now experiment has long shown that heating
or cooling occurs at the place of contact between two metals when
 a voltaic current traverses          it,
                                    and that this alteration of heat, as
 theory requires,      proportional to the intensity of the current.
                         is
 Hence measurement
           a                   the quantities of heat absorbed or pro
                              of
 duced on the passage of the voltaic current gives         determination
                                                                    a
 of the magnitude    of the  electromotive   force produced      the conby
 tact of the metals.     This method of determining electromotive
 force has the advantage of keeping the circuit closed during the
 measurement, so that the force          in full activity. The changes

 metals     by current passing through them have been, frequently
                 a
 investigated    ;but the magnitude of these changes of temperature
 depends   on  the  specific heat of the metals, on their conductivity
 for heat, on the cooling during the experiment, &c., and there
 fore cannot give     direct measure of the electromotive forces.

  the ends, opposite to each other, and at right angles to the faces.
  Through these tubes passed the metal wire to be investigated,
  consisting of two wires soldered together, in such a manner that
  the place of soldering was just in the middle of the cylinder.
  On the tubes in question caoutchouc tubes were fitted, which, to
 make them air-tight, weru firmly tied both over the copper tube
  and over the metal rods. With the same object the space between
 the wire and the metal tube was filled with melted wax.               To
 preserve   the wire  from  conducting  communication       with the cop
 per cylinder, the two tubes were lined internally with caoutchouc.
 At one end of the copper cylinder a metal tube, bent at right
 angles and provided with a stopcock, was soldered, to which was
 fitted air-tight a glass tube.   This tube was provided with a scale
 divided into millimetres. The copper cylinder with the glass tube
 was fastened on a mahogany board, which could be placed, and
 secured by screws, at different angles with the horizontal. In
 all the experiments the glass tube formed an angle of 5° with
 the plane in question.       The copper cylinder had such a posi
 tion that the wire traversing it was horizontal. After the wire
 to be investigated had been introduced, the cylinder was tested
 by fixing a small compression-pump to the metal tube and ob
 serving the pressure on a water-manometer           in connexion with
 the tube.     To keep the temperature around the copper cylinder
 constant, it was surrounded by a double cylindrical zinc jacket
 which held 5'85 litres of water.    The internal diameter of the zinc
jacket was 150 millims., so that the annular space between this
 and the copper cylinder was 35 millims. wide.           The zinc jacket
 was in four parts, so that it could be conveniently inserted in its
position ; and suitable apertures were provided for the passage of
the wire and of the above-mentioned metal tube.                 The zinc
jacket   at the time  of the experiments,  was  filled with  water which
had the same temperature as the air in the room.            In this man
ner the zinc jacket acquired a temperature which did not mate
rially vary during the short time which was necessary for an
experiment.       On the further end of the glass tube a short caout
 chouc tube was placed, which was connected with an open cylin
 drical metal box 55 millims. in diameter.            Into this box the,
liquid   was  poured  which  was to serve  as index   in reading off. By
 raising or lowering the box the column of liquid could be made
 to stand at any suitable position in the tube ; the internal dia
 meter of this tube was about 2'5 milliras.         When the tube was
 too narrow, the capillarity acted so strongly that the column of
 liquid was seriously impeded in its motion, and the air-thermo
 meter thereby became less delicate.      In the first four of the sub
 sequent experiments spirit was used as index, and in all the
 others a coloured liquid containing spirit (cognac) ,

     3.  The experiments     were made in the following manner.
 After the wire which was to be investigated had been introduced
 into the copper cylinder and the whole apparatus suitably ar
 ranged, the ends of the wire outside the jacket were connected
 with the poles of five Bunsen'a cells.       The intensity of the cur
 rent was measured with a rheostat.         There was moreover in the
 circuit the usual commutator.         To drive part of the air out of
 the copper cylinder, a more powerful current was used in the
 first case than that afterwards employed for the proper measure
 ments ; thereupon the liquid was poured into the box and the
 intensity of the current reduced to the magnitude intended for
 the subsequent experiments.        During the cooling the liquid rose
 in the glass tube; and by raising or lowering the box a suitable
 position was obtained, which was then permanently adhered to.
 After the lapse of some time the index remained stationary, aud
 thus showed that the copper cylinder lost just so much heat as
 was developed by the current in the wire.            As in all the ex
 periments the temperature of the copper cylinder but very
 slightly exceeded that of the surrounding air and of the zinc
jacket, it may be assumed, without any material error, that its
 loss of heat is proportional to its excess of temperature. Although
this excess of temperature is unknown, we have for it a reli
able relative measure.      The index in the glass tube gives the
mean temperature of the air in the copper cylinder.           That the
excess of temperature of the copper cylinder bears to the mean
temperature a definite relation, which is independent of the
degree of heating, is proved by the experiments themselves.          If,
as shall immediately be shown, the quantities of heat ,be deter
mined which are produced or absorbed at the place of contact of
the two metals by the passage of the current, it will be found
that these quantities, as theory presupposes, are proportional to
the intensity of the current.      This result would not follow from
the experiments, unless it could be assumed that the mean tem
perature measured by the index bears a definite relation to the
excess of temperature of the copper cylinder.          After the index
has come to rest it gives thus a relative measure for the quantity
of heat which the copper cylinder loses during a given time; and
this quantity is equal to that which is produced by the current
in the same time.       Now we assume that while the current con
tinuously traversed the experimental wire, the index has remained
at the scale-division a, or that it has advanced A + a divisions
from the place which it assumed before the passage of the cur
rent. The quantities of heat produced by the passage of the
current are of two sorts.        Owing to the voltaic resistance, a
quantity   of heat  is produced in the entire wire which is propor
tional to the square of the intensity. If the intensity of the current

                    on the Contact      of different Metals.            21
be s, and m be a constant,       this quantity of heat will be expressed
by ms2.     On the    other  hand, according to the direction of the
current, an amount of heat is produced or absorbed at the con
tact which is proportional to the intensity of the current, and
may be designated by ±ns, in which n is another constant.
We thus find ms* + ns=A + a. If now the direction is reversed,
the index after a few minutes is stationary in a new position               «',
and we get ms2 + ns=A.       +      in which the sign before the second
                                  a',
term  is  altered.    From this we obtain +ns=a—a'.               The dif
ference between the two stationary positions of the index when
the current first goes in one and then in the other direction thus
becomes    a  measure for the quantities of heat in question.
    The above method of obervation would furnish very rigorous
determinations of the quantities of heat in question             the heat
                                                                   if
ing of the air in the copper cylinder were the only cause of the
motion of the column of liquid. But this         far from beingthecase.
                                                    is
Variations in the barometric height during even the few minutes
which are required to effect two successive readings are frequently
sufficient materially to alter the position of the column of liquid.
 One day, on which violent storm prevailed, no observations could
                         a
be made; for, owing to variations in the pressure of the atmosphere,
the column of liquid was continually moving backwards and for
wards.     This, however,    is   exceptional.    To avoid this unplea
santness   as  far as  possible,  the  experiments were made thus —     :   •
After the current had circulated for           sufficient length of time,
                                                a
the position of the column of liquid was observed              the current
                                                                   ;
was then reversed and the new position of equilibrium observed,
 upon which the current was again reversed and the first observa
tion repeated. Of the first and third readings the mean was taken           ;
 and the same course was continued until so many determinations
 had been obtained that the mean was sufficiently accurate.              As
 the time between two successive observations was approximately
 equal, accurate results must thus have been obtained, assuming
 that the barometric pressure varied uniformly.              It would not
have been impossible         to  procure  accurate    corrections for the
 errors which alterations in the barometric height produce.              If,
 for instance, we had two perfectly equal air-thermometers, one of
 which, as      here the case, was used exclusively for determining
               is
 the voltaic heating, and the other for measuring variations in
 the pressure,      bysimultaneously    reading the two the necessary
 corrections would be obtained.         The same object would also be
 obtained  if  the glass tube were not allowed to communicate with
 the air through the open metallic box, but with            large air-tight
                                                               a
 closed vessel whose temperature was kept quite constant. Mean
 while the method used was considered adequate to the object in
 view. We pass now to the proper observations.

   4. Experiment 1. — The wire experimented with consisted of
copper and iron soldered together with tin.          The numbers under
the head   " deflections
                         " are the differences between the two posi
tions of equilibrium of the column of liquid when the current
went in opposite directions.        These numbers are therefore pro
portional to the quantities of heat sought.            In all the follow
ing experiments the copper wire used was taken from one and
the same coil.      The wire was 1 millim. in diameter.          The dia
meter of the iron wire was about the same. When the posi
tive current went from copper to iron the place of soldering
was cooled.     The column of liquid, both in this and the three
following experiments, consisted of spirit, for which reason they
are not accurately to be compared with the later experiments.

 German silver and copper soldered with tin.              The German-silver
 wire was 1 millim. in diameter. When the positive current went
 from the German silver to the copper at the point of contact, a
 cooling resulted.

   Experiment 11. — In this experiment the copper wire was sol
dered by means of tin to a bismuth rod 2*5 millims. square.
When at the place of contact the positive current went from
the bismuth to the copper, cooling resulted.

    With an intensity = tg. 45° the deflection becomes equal to

    Experiment 12. — The copper wire was soldered to a silver
wire 0-6 millim. in diameter.            With this combination not the
least deflection    could  be   observed.      The same was the case with
a combination of zinc and copper.
    The foregoing experiments give the following electromotor-
series, in which, when two successive metals are in contact, the
current at the place of contact goes from the preceding to the
 succeeding — bismuth, argentan (German silver), platinum, cop
per, and iron. The two metals silver and zinc are so near copper
that the experiments left it undecided whether they precede or
 succeed the last-named metal.              The relative numerical values
are as follows   : —

    5. In order to ascertain the thermoelectric relations of these
 metallic combinations,       the following experiments were made.
 The soldered wires were twice bent near the soldering, so that
 they were parallel to each other, and the place of contact was
 inserted in a test-tube which was placed in a large vessel filled

 26           Prof. E. Edlund    on the Electromotive  Force
 with cold water.     In order that the water might be warmed very
 slowly by the air in the room, the glass beaker was coated with
 a layer of cotton-wool and covered with a pasteboard disk, through
 a hole in which the test-tube was inserted. In this test-tube was
 placed a delicate thermometer, and the space at the top between
the wires and the thermometer stopped with cotton-wool.           Thus
the temperature of the test-tube was kept constant long enough for
 the place of soldering to acquire the temperature which the ther
mometer indicated.       The free ends of the wires were connected
with the conducting-wires of the magnetometer, which were of
copper.     The connexion between the two different metals was
surrounded by cotton-wool, after the bulb of a delicate thermo
meter had been adjusted as near the place of contact as possible.
The deflections of the magnetometer, which were read off in the
usual manner with a telescope and scale, were proportional to the
intensity of the current. The conducting-power in the circuit
for thermoelectricity    was measured by means of a magneto-
inductor, the coil of which was inserted in the circuit.           The
deflections which were obtained by      the induction-currents caused
by the inductor gave thus a measure for the conducting-power.
                     I
    In what follows will merely give the mean numbers obtained.
    Experiment 13. — Bismuth-copper.
    The deflection = 305 -5. The difference of temperature at the
two places of contact = 120>8. With the magneto-inductor a
deflection of 174 divisions was obtained.          Hence this number
represents the conductivity       in the  path  of  the thermoelectric
current.
    Experiment 14. — Argentan-copper.
      Deflection =61-8.      Difference of temperature =    110<9.
       Conducting-power = 224-0.
    Experiment   15. — Platinum-copper.
       Deflection = 22'0. Difference of temperature        = 11°'8.
       Conducting-power = 226-5.
    Experiment 16. — Zinc-copper.
      Deflection = 2'5. Difference of temperature = 13°'l.
       Conducting-power = 230-5.
    Experiment 17. — Silver-copper.
      Deflection = 2'0. Difference of temperature        = 13°'7.
      Conducting-power = 232'0.
    Experiment 18. — Copper-iron.
      Deflection = 73'0.      Difference of temperature = 12°"8.
       Conducting-power = 228-8.
    In these metallic combinations the thermoelectric current went
at the warmer place of contact from the first-named metal to the
succeeding one.

                      on the Contact    of different Metals.              %f
    If the foregoing observations be calculated for a difference of
temperature of 10° and a conductivity = 100, we obtain for
              Bismuth-copper the deflection          .   .  92-27

    In the thermoelectric series the metals are therefore in the
following order: — bismuth, argentan, platinum, zinc, silver, cop
per, and iron. We see from this that the order in the series, which
is determined by the heat absorbed or produced on the current
passing through the place of contact, is the same as that which
is conditioned by the thermoelectric properties of the same me
tals.     In   the combinations      zinc-copper       and silver-copper the
quantities of heat were so small that they could not be measured ;
but we also find that in the thermoelectric series zinc and silver
are very near copper, and form with it a very inconsiderable
thermoelectric force.        In order to compare with one another the
numbers obtained, they can be reduced so as to be equivalent for
one of these combinations — for example, for copper-iron. W«
thus obtain the following Table of comparison : —

           Copper-iron      .• .•  .•   .    24'93              24-93
    In  the combinations argentan-copper and platinum-copper the
numbers in the two series are almost equal, from which it might be
assumed that the electromotive and thermoelectric forces are pro
portional to one another.         Yet this is most decisively refuted by
the combination bismuth-copper.             In order to be quite convinced
 that this latter combination did not depend upon a faulty mea
 surement of the thermoelectric current, the determination was re
 peated, by which a deflection of 88-7 divisions was obtained when
 the difference in temperature of the two solderings was 10°, and
 the conducting-power was 100.            The result was therefore about
 the same as before. Yet there was a reason for doubting that some
 error might have crept in in the determination of the numbers for
 bismuth-copper ; for when this pair of wires was removed from the
 air-thermometer, the bismuth broke near tbe place of soldering,
 which necessitated a new soldering before this combination could

 28    On the Electromotive    Force   on the Contact   of different Metals.
 be again investigated.       This circumstance might possibly give
 rise to an error ; and hence the experiments with bismuth-copper
 were repeated.
    Experiment 19. — A new bismuth-bar, somewhat thicker than
 the last, but from the same piece of bismuth, was soldered to the
 copper, on which the observations were made in the usual
 manner.
    There were thus obtained : —
                                    Deflections.
                                        81-0
                                        73-0
                                        77-0
                                        78-5
                      Mean     .   .    77'4
                  Intensity of the current = tg. 29°.
     If from  this the deflection be calculated for an angle of 45°,
 it is found to be    =?; 139'6, thus almost equal to the number pre
 viously obtained (141'3).
    The magnitude of the thermoelectric current with the new bis
 muth-copper combination was next determined, as well as, for
 comparison, those with three of the combinations                 previously
 mentioned.      So great a resistance from the rheostat was now
interposed in the circuit, that the resistance could in all the
experiments be regarded as quite equal.            It is only necessary to
adduce the mean numbers suitably reduced in order to facilitate
inspection and comparison with the preceding.              In this manner
it was found that the thermoelectric currents for these combina
tions were as follows : —
                                       '
                   Bismuth-copper        ,.   .  .   78*47
                                      ....
                   Argentan-copper        .  .   .   24-17
                   Platinum-copper        .  .   .    8'30
                   Copper-iron                       24'93
    These numbers, within the limits of errors of observation, are
equal to those previously obtained, except that for bismuth-cop
per, with which combination the deflection was smaller than be
fore.     This is doubtless due to the new bismuth-bar being some
what different from the first.        Yet it is seen that the exception
which the combination bismuth-copper makes does not depend
upon a faulty determination.
    According to Seebeck, the various metals have the following
order in the electric-tension        series :— silver, platinum, copper,
iron, bismuth, and zinc, in which each preceding in contact with
the succeeding is electronegative.          Although different observers
have found the order different, partly in consequence of the

On the Heat Developed in the Combination       of Acids and Bases.   29
metals being impure, it is clear that there is no similarity between
the electric-tension series and that which the metals form as re
gards the heat produced or absorbed on the passage of a current.
As, then, from the theoretical proofs which we gave in a former
paper, the quantities of heat in question furnish a measure of the
electromotive forces, it must be concluded that the electric-tension
series is in no close connexion with these forces.         Hence it is
highly probable that the electrical tension does not exclusively
depend on the contact between the two metals, but on the layer
of gas or of water which is condensed on their surfaces — a view in
favour of which many reasons might be urged.             On the other
hand, it was seen that the thermoelectric series is the same as
that for the electromotive forces.       The metals which in contact
with each other produce the greatest electromotive force, also
produce the most powerful thermoelectric current when the place
of contact is heated ; but these thermoelectrical currents are not
in all combinations proportional to the corresponding electromo
tive forces.
V. On     the  Heat Developed in the Combination of Acids and Bases.
    — Second     Memoir.     By THOMAS ANDREWS, M.D., F.R.S.,
    Hon.    F.R.S.E.,  Vice- President of Queen's College, Belfast*.
       a paper communicated      to the Royal Irish Academy in 1841,
 IN I     gave an account of a large number of experiments on the
heat disengaged when acids and bases, taken in the state of di
lute solution, enter into combination, and when bases, insoluble
 in water, are dissolved in dilute acids.       The following general
 conclusions or laws were deduced from those experiments : —
     Law 1. —The heat developed in the union of acids and bases
 is determined by the base, and not by the acid — the same base
 producing, when combined with an equivalent of different acids,
 nearly the same quantity of heat, but different bases different
 quantities.
     Law 2. — When a neutral is converted into an acid salt, by
 combining with one or more atoms of acid, no change of tempe
 rature occurs.
     Law 3. — When a neutral is converted into a basic salt, by
 combining with an additional proportion of base, the combina
tion is accompanied with the evolution of heatf.
     Three years later   I laid before the Royal Society of London
 the results of an experimental investigation of the heat developed
 when one base is substituted for another in chemical compounds.

The law deduced from this inquiry is implicitly involved in the
foregoing, of which it may indeed be regarded as a necessary
consequence.        It was enunciated in the following terms : —
    Law 4. — When one base displaces another from any of its
neutral combinations, the heat evolved or abstracted is always
the same, whatever the acid element may be, provided the bases
are the same*.
    Finally, the law of metallic substitutions, first announced in
the Philosophical Magazine for August 1844, was thus stated in
a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1848.
    Law 5. — When an equivalent of one and the same metal re
places another in a solution of any of its salts of the same order,
the heat developed is always the same ; but a change in either
of the metals produces a diiFerent development of heat.
    In 1845 [1844] a paper appeared by Graham on the heat dis
engaged in combinations, the second part of which refers to the
heat produced when hydrate of potash is neutralized by different
acids f.     The results arrived at by this distinguished chemist
exhibit a close agreement with those contained in my first com
munication to the Royal Irish Academy.
    The concluding part of the elaborate memoir of MM. Favre
and Silbermann on the heat disengaged in chemical actions is
chiefly devoted to the same subject.          A large number of experi
ments are described, which are nearly a repetition of those            I  had
previously published.        Their results bear a general resemblance
to those given by myself in 1841 ; but they widely differ in the
details.     The authors of this able memoir fully recognize the
accuracy of my fourth law, which asserts the equality of thermal
effect when one base is substituted for another.          " M. Andrews,"
they observe,
                  " avait en effet etabli que, quel que soitTacide d'un

& une autre pour former un nouyeau            sel est la meme, lorsque
1'on considere les deux memes bases         "J.
    In a preceding paragraph of the same memoir, the authors
object to what they conceive to be my first law, and state that it
is not in accordance with the results of their investigations.             As
the question     is one  of some   importance,    I may perhaps      be  per
 mitted to quote the passage in the original language.
                                                                  " Ses con

curate statement of my first law.           It did not declare that pre
cisely   the  same   amount   of heat  is  disengaged by all the acids in
combining with the same base, but that the heat is determined
                 "
by the base, the same base producing, when combined with an
equivalent of different acids, nearly the same quantity of heat."
A comparison of the results of MM. Favre and Silbermann with
those in my original memoir will show that             I had fully recog
nized and described the deviations from the other acids, exhibited,
on the one hand, in excess, by the sulphuric acid, and on the
other, in deficiency, by the tartaric, citric, and succinie acids.
"If    we refer,"   I  remarked, in the original memoir of 1841, "to
the first, second, and fourth Tables, as being the most extensive,
from the large number of soluble compounds formed by potash,
 soda, and ammonia, it will be observed that the sulphuric acid
 developes from 0°-8 to nearly 1° more than the mean heat given
 by the other acids ; while the tartaric, citric, and succinic acids
 fall from 00-4 to 0°'55 short of the same.           A minute investiga
 tion of the influence of the disturbing sources of heat will no
 doubt discover the causes of these discrepancies.                   The high
 numbers for sulphuric acid are probably connected with that
 acid's well-known property of developing much heat when com*
 bining with successive atoms of water,            All the other acids de-
 velope nearly the same amount of heat in combining with the
 same base, the greatest divergences from the mean quantity
  being, in the case of potash, + 00-24 and — 00-13; in that of
  soda, +00-26 and — 0°'14; and in that of ammonia, +0°-17
  and — 0°'05.       These differences are almost within the limits of
  the errors of experiment "*,
     But although there is a superficial agreement between my
  original results and those of MM. Favre and Silbermann, they
  will be found, when examined closely, to differ widely in detail,
  and on points of great importance.           I had found that the oxalic
  acid disengages almost exactly the same amount of heat in com
  bining with the soluble bases as the hydrochloric, nitric, and
  many other mineral acids ; and this observation             I  have always
  regarded as one of the main foundations of Law I.              MM. Favre
  and Silbermann, on the contrary, have inferred from their expe
  riments that " the following organic acids — the oxalic, formic,
   valeric, and citric — disengage sensibly the same quantity of heat,
   but it is less (plus faible) than that given by the foregoing mi
   neral acids" — among which they enumerate the nitric and hydro
   chloric.    According to my experiments, no distinction of this
   kind can be admitted between acida derived from the mineral
   and organic kingdom, inasmuch as the oxalic acid developes at

32           l)r. T. Andrews   on ike Heat Developed in
least as much heat in combining with the bases as the hydro
chloric, nitric, and several other strong mineral acids.
   The experiments to be described in this paper were made some
years ago ; but their publication has been deferred from acci
dental circumstances.     I have, however, recently repeated a few
of the more important of them with a slightly modified form of
apparatus.     The solutions were taken in so dilute a state that
the heat disengaged never exceeded 3°'5 C.         A standard solu
tion of sulphuric acid was prepared and carefully analyzed, by
precipitating a given weight with a soluble salt of barium, and
weighing the sulphate of barium. The strength of the alkaline
solutions was adjusted with great care by means of this standard
acid.   The same solution of each alkali was employed in all the
experiments, and the quantity used in each experiment was de
termined by careful weighing. The acid solution was of such a
strength that, after being mixed with the alkali, an excess of two
or three per cent, of acid was present.       The alkaline solution
was contained in a light glass vessel, in which a large platinum
crucible holding the acid was carefully floated.       By giving a
rapid rotation, by means of a light atirrer, to the acid solution
in the platinum crucible, a perfect equilibrium of temperature
was soon established between the two liquids.       The initial tem
perature of the solutions was usually about 1°'5 below that of
the air, and the final temperature of the mixture about 1°'5
above it.   The corrections for the heating and cooling action of
the surrounding medium were determined with great care.          The
mechanical process of adding the acid to the alkaline solution pro
duced no change of temperature ; and as the heat disengaged in
the combination raised the liquid almost instantly to the maxi
mum temperature, the whole correction required was for cooling.
The first temperature was read one minute after the addition of
the acid to the alkaline solution, the mixture being stirred du
ring the whole of that time.     If & represents the correction, and
c the excess of temperature above the air in Centigrade degrees,
the value of 8 will be given by the following expression : —
                            S=exO°-012.
   As  a proof of the accuracy of the method of mixture adopted
in this inquiry,   I may mention that, being desirous to know
whether the dilute acids employed in these experiments produced
any change of temperature when mixed with water, I made the
experiment with nitric acid by the method just described, sub
stituting water for the alkaline solution, with the unexpected
result of a fall of 00>01. On varying the conditions of the ob
servation, so as to obtain a larger effect, it was ascertained not
only that a diminution of temperature had actually occurred, but

                the Combination    of Acids and Bases.             S3
that the observed fall represented approximately its true amount.
When hydrochloric acid of equivalent strength was diluted to the
same extent, an elevation of temperature of 00-05 was produced.
    The accuracy of experiments of this kind, where the whole
thermal effect observed amounts only to 2° or 3°, depends greatly
on the thermometer employed.          Unless its indications are per
fectly trustworthy in every part of the scale, the labour of the
inquirer will only end in disappointment.      I have therefore taken
every precaution   to  secure this  important object.    The tube of
the thermometer was calibrated and divided with care, according
to an arbitrary scale, by means of a dividing-instrument contrived
for the purpose, and provided with a short screw of great accu
racy, made by Troughton aud Simms.             The divisions, etched
finely on the glass, corresponded to about 00-05 C. ; and the
readings could be made with certainty to less than 0°-01.         The
division of the scale corresponding to 0° was determined from
time to time in the usual way ; and another point, about 30° C.,
was fixed by comparison with four other thermometers similarly
constructed, whose scales extended from the freezing- to the
boiling-point of water.     The readings of these four instruments,
when reduced    to degrees, rarely differed from each other within
the limits to which they could be read, or 0°-02.        The reservoir
of the thermometer used in these experiments was 75 millims.
long, and, when immersed in the liquid, occupied nearly its en
tire depth.
   As some uncertainty always exists with regard to the thermal
equivalent of glass vessels,  I made two sets of comparative expe
riments — one with a thickly varnished copper vessel, and the
other with a vessel of platinum.      The mean result of these expe
riments coincided almost exactly with the result obtained when
the glass vessel was employed.
   The weight of the glass vessel which contained the alkaline
solution was 58 grms., and corresponded thermally to 1T4
grms. of the solutions formed.       The thermal equivalent of the
reservoir of the thermometer and of the stirrer was 0-9 grm.
The alkaline solution weighed 160 grms., and contained the
equivalent of 1*738 grm. of SO3.         The acid solution weighed
42*5 grms.     Hence the entire thermal value of the apparatus,
in terms of the solution formed, was : —
                                                   grms.

    It is interesting to observe how closely the results in the
three vertical columns agree relatively with one another.                       The
acids follow in the same order under each base ; and even the
differences in the amount of heat disengaged by the several acids
in combining with the different bases approximate in many cases
closely to one another.           Thus the heat given out when the sul
phuric acid combines with potash exceeds that given out when
the oxalic acid combines with the same base by 0°-320, the cor
responding differences in the case of soda and ammonia being
0°-313 and 0°-328.          If, in like manner, we compare the differ
ences between the heat disengaged by the acetic and tartaric
acids, we fall upon the numbers 0°-120, 0°-121, and 0°-116.
Even in the case of the oxalic, hydrochloric, and nitric acids,
which disengage so nearly the same amount of heat, the same
order is observed with the three bases.              It must be particularly
                                        D2

36          Dr. T. Andrews      on the   Heat Developed in
remarked that the oxalic acid disengages from          0°-022 to 0°'058
more heat in combining with these bases than           the hydrochloric
acid, and from 0°'065 to 0°-111 more than the          nitric acid.    The
conclusion of MM. Favre and Silbermann, that          the organic acids
(oxalic, formic, acetic, &c.) disengage sensibly less heat than
the mineral acids, is thus entirely disproved, and the original
results recorded in my work of 1841, according to which the
oxalic acid disengages at least as much heat as the nitric, phos
phoric, arsenic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, boracic, and other mi
neral acids (with the exception of the sulphuric acid), are fully
confirmed.      The tartaric, citric, and succinic acids, it is true (as
 was also shown in the same work), give out about fa less
 heat than the average of the other acids ; but the acetic and
 formic acids fall scarcely ^ below the mean, and the oxalic
 acid is always above it.      These results, in all their main features,
 are fully corroborated by the experiments recorded in this paper,
 which were performed with a more perfect apparatus and a more
 exact thermometer than I had at my command in my earlier in
 vestigations.      A reference to the same paper will show that
  while acids differing so widely from one another as the oxalic,
  phosphoric,    arsenic, nitric, hydrochloric, and boracic acids
  scarcely present any sensible difference in the quantities of heat
  which they disengage in combining with the bases, and while,
  of the other acids examined, the sulphuric acid (and probably
  also the sulphurous acid) presents an extreme deviation of
  about one-eighth above the mean, and the tartaric-acid group
  a deviation of about 7'ff below        it,the bases, on the contrary
  (and  the  subsequent     researches  of  Favre and Silbermann have
  confirmed    this  result), differ altogether in thermal power from
  one another.      Thus equivalents of the oxides of magnesium and
  of silver give out 40-1 and 10<8 of heat respectively in combi
   ning with nitric acid, the former oxide having therefore 2'3 times
   the thermal power of the latter.        Yet, as is   well known, both
   these bases fully saturate the acid, and the resulting solutions
   are even neutral to test-paper.        For these reasons  I      have no
   doubt whatever that the first law, as enunciated in 1841,         is  the
 expression of   atrue physical law, and that in the combination
 of acids and bases in presence of water the heat disengaged              is
 determined     by
                 the base and not         by
                                       the acid.  It true that, in
                                                           is
 this as in similar physical inquiries, experimental results cannot
 immediately be obtained free from complication or disturbing in
 fluences.   The same remark applies to the experimental proof
 of the great law discovered     Dulongand Petit, which connects
                                  by
 the specific heats and atomic weights of the elementary bodies,
 and also to that of the remarkable relations discovered by Kopp
 between the composition and boiling-points of many organic

                  the Combination     of Acids and Bases.                  37
liquids.     We have already seen an illustration of one of these
disturbing influences, in the fact that dilute nitric acid, when
mixed with water, gives a slight fall of temperature, hydrochloric
acid a rise ; and the differences of specific heat in the solutions
formed will, to a small extent, modify the results.                 But the
cause of the higher thermal power of sulphuric acid              I  have  not
been able to discover ; and future researches must decide whether
it depends upon some disturbing cause, or (which is less probable)
upon its possessing an exceptionally high thermal power.                 One
condition, however, is essential, or Law 1 will not apply.               The
acid and base must be capable of combining when brought into
contact, and of forming a stable compound.                 In the paper so
often referred to,       I showed that hydrocyanic acid and potash,
which fail to fulfil this condition, do not disengage the normal
amount of heat when mixed; and the same observation will
doubtless be found to apply to a large number of metallic oxides,
which form unstable compounds with, and imperfectly neutra
lize, the bases.
    As regards the experimental proofs of the other laws, even
those of the fourth law, the truth of which is admitted by MM.
Favre and Silbermanu, they are only approximative ; and here
also we meet occasionally with peculiar and unexpected results.
Thus a slight fall of temperature occurs, as Hess showed long
ago, in the conversion of the neutral sulphate of potash into the
acid salt ; and I found, as indeed might have been expected from
their alkaline reaction, that in the conversion of the ordinary
phosphates and arseniates into super- salts, a disengagement
of heat occurs amounting to about one-seventh of that disen
gaged in the formation of the salts themselves.              In other cases
results, at first view startling and apparently anomalous, will be
found to be strictly in accordance with the general principles
already laid down.         In the formation of double salts there is no
disengagement of heat — a principle announced in 1841, and
which ought perhaps to be enunciated as a distinct law, although
it is implicitly involved in Law 2. Again, if tribasic phosphoric
acid or arsenic acid is added in fractional portions to a solution
of potash till the subsalts are formed, the heat disengaged on
each addition of acid corresponds to the amount of acid added ;
but after this point has been reached, the disengagement of
heat follows a different law.          The pyrophosphoric acid, on the
other hand, behaves in the same way as the nitric acid and most
other acids, when added in successive portions to solutions of
potash or soda, equal increments of heat being evolved for equal
additions of acid, till the pyrophosphate of potash or soda is
formed *.

                                    Appendix.
    In  the following Tables        I have given the results described in
this communication and those of 1841 in a form which admits
of comparison with one another, and with those of MM. Favre
and Silbermann.           I  have also added a few determinations re
cently    made    by   M.   Thomsen    of Copenhagen*.                  It will be seen
that the original experiments of 1841 exhibit, on the whole, a
fair agreement with those now communicated to the Society.
From the small scale on which they were performed (the whole
weight of the solutions after mixture being less than 30 grms.),
the imperfect form of the apparatus, and the uncertainty of the
thermometric indications,          I  have indeed been surprised to find
them so near the truth.            The results of MM. Favre and Silber
mann do not exhibit the precision which might have been ex
pected from the high character of those experimentalists, and
from the accuracy of other parts of their great work.                         The mer
 curial calorimeter employed by them appears to have been little
 adapted to its purpose ; but after making due allowance for its
imperfections,       I am at a loss to account for the serious errors
 into which they have fallen.             M. Thomson's experiments have
 evidently     been  made     with   care,    and his results agree compara
 tively with my own ; but the absolute amount of heat obtained
 by him falls far short of what           I  have found.           It is indeed much
 easier to obtain results relatively than absolutely correct.                        The
 numbers given in this paper will,               I  believe,      be   found    rarely to
 differ relatively more than ^ Q from the truth j but they may
 hereafter require a small correction in respect to their absolute
 value.      That correction, however, can scarcely be more than
 JQ of the whole amount; and                   I   have little doubt that the
 number, for example, given by Thomsen to express the heat dis
 engaged in the combination of soda with nitric acid will prove to
 be as far below the true number as that given by MM. Favre
 and Silbermann is above it.

                          By   Dr.   L.  BLEEKRODE*.
 "VI^HILST          engaged   in some experiments wherein               I  tried to
            ignite gun-cotton    with    the    electric   spark,   I thought to
facilitate its explosion by wetting it with a highly inflam
mable liquid, as, for example, the bisulphide of carbon [CS2].
But it was only this latter substance that was immediately set
on fire by the spark — while the gun-cotton did not explode, but
remained apparently intact amidst the burning bisulphide, pre
senting almost the aspect of amass of snow slowly melting away.
   This experiment may be easily repeated by moistening gun-
cotton with bisulphide of carbon, ether, benzine, or alcohol,
and igniting it afterwards with some flame or other ; all these
liquids yield the same results; and it is without danger, even if
great quantities are used.
   This effect is not due to the presence of water, as is proved
by the fact that benzine or the bisulphide of carbon, which may
be easily had without any trace of water, act in the same manner
as ether or alcohol ; but the explanation of this singular beha
viour of so eminent an explosive substance as gun-cotton belongs
to the very interesting researches of Professor Abel " On the
Combustion of Gun-cotton and Gunpowder"f, from which                              I

make the following quotation : — " These results indicate that
if,  even for the briefest space of time, the gases resulting from
the first action of heat on gun-cotton upon its ignition in open
air are impeded from completely enveloping the burning extre
mity of the gun-cotton twist, their ignition              prevented; and     is
as    it   the comparatively high temperature produced
           is                                                          their                     by
combustion which effects the rapid and more complete combus
tion of the gun-cotton, the momentary extinction of the gases,
and the continuous abstraction of heat by them as they escape
from the point of combustion, render              impossible for the gun-
                                                               it

 to destructive distillation."
    In the same paper are described numerous experiments to
prove the accuracy of this statement           and these were made with

 when ignited under the same conditions as gun-cotton, behaves
 in   adifferent way     for example,
                          :                piece of gunpowder weighing

 was equal to O65 inch of mercury             when in contact with wire

 facts preseut themselves       when   gunpowder         spread on      disk

a  true explosion, caused               by

THEupon        its structure.    As this structure is formed under
circumstances that have no analogy in the ordinary treatment
of metals by heat, it is worthy of separate study. When a
metal is cast into the desired form, the homogeneousness of

other irregularities that none can realize except those who have

42         Mr. W. H. Waleun          on Solutions for depositing
 and the zinc solution was allowed to infiltrate considerably into
the external cupric solution ; the result was that the botryoidal
 form entirely disappeared, the metal being deposited in tufts
 close together (when viewed by the naked eye) and rising verti
 cally from the surface of the cathode.         These, when viewed with
 a microscope, were seen to be perfectly separate tufts standing
up at right angles to the surface.          The influence of a small pro
 portion  of zincic  sulphate     to  the  gallon of depositing solution,
as recommended by Napier* (one ounce to the pound of mcupric
 sulphate), is known to nearly annul the botryoidal form, and to
render the deposit tough, compact, and even ; but, to test the
action of an excess of this salt, a solution was made as follows: —
    2. Abnormal solution. — Cupric sulphate, one pound ; sulphuric
acid, one pound ; ziucic sulphate, four ounces ; water, one gallon.
    On trial with a Maynooth cell, this solution yielded a result
like in character to that produced by the infiltration of the zinc
solution from the porous cell, but more marked.
    The general characteristic of electrobrassing-solutions,        when
in good order, is to deposit the metal in needles at right angles
to the surface, more or less detached from one another, accord
ing to the state of the solution and the electric power employed.
This peculiarity can be traced to the fact of alkaline solutions
being used for this purpose, the metal of the alkali being prone
to be deposited (for an infinitely small duration of time) toge
ther with the heavy metals, and to the hydrogen copiously given
off during deposition.         With Morris and Johnson's solution        f
 (the solvent solution of which is composed of potassic cyanide
and ammonic sesquicarbonate) it was found impossible to dep.osit
a thickness of metal of more than '01 inch free from spongy or
tree-like formation. Other solutions were found to give a jjke
result. Although in facility of management and constancy, of
action the author found that a solvent solution composed of po
tassic cyanide and neutral ammonic tartrate            J was superior. to
the other known brass solutions, this solution would not deposit
good metal of more than '03 inch thick, hydrogen being given
off (in less quantity than in other solutions) during depositioa.

the metals, together with potassie cyanide and an excess of am
monia, could be worked with a single-cell arrangement                 (the
porous cell containing the same materials as the external cell
without the copper and zinc) without the evolution of hydrogen,
the author found that this was owing to the presence of the oxides
of the metals, as well as their cyanides, in the solution ; and,

after many experiments, he has adopted the plan of adding to
any brass electrolytic solution (but preferably to that containing
potassic cyanide and ammonic tartrate, mentioned above) the
oxides of the constituent metals as well as their cyanides, and, if
this does not perfectly stop gaseous evolution, some cupric am
monide*.        The resulting solution has been found to produce
brass of a uniform character ; and it gives a deposit which, when
microscopically examined, is in texture very much like that pro
duced by the acid copper solution containing zinc, recommended
by Napier ; the solution is capable of depositing the alloy to any
 thickness.      If combined oxygen is carried to the cathode by the
 cupric   ammonide,     the action may be expressed by the equation

     The formula for cupric ammonide is that of Malaguti and
  Sarzeau.     The cupric ammonide and the eliminated hydrogen
  go to the cathode, chemical reaction then takes place, copper is
  deposited, ammonia is in solution, and water is formed.
     The imperfect results afforded by ordinary brass solutions are :
     1st. The porous character of the deposit, arising from the se
  paration between the parts of the needle-shaped structure.
     2nd. The constant and brisk evolution of hydrogen, being
  favoured by the pointed character of the deposit from its com
  mencement, augments as the coating grows in thickness, and
  gives in a short time, and at the attainment of an insignificant
  thickness, a tree-like formation, which still further degenerates
  as the coating proceeds, so as to render the accomplishment             of
  any thickness more than a mere film impracticable.            In practice,
  the article being coated is taken out every few minutes, scratch-
  brushed, and then replaced. With two hours of this treatment,
  the coating is still porous and is very little better than that given
  by a skilful application of bronze-powder, and then it has to be
   varnished (when used for coating iron) to prevent rust-spots
   forming on its surface by the action of the air.
      3rd. The evolution of hydrogen consumes electric pow.er, and
   renders a high intensity requisite to make up for the loss ; so
   that, with ordinary solutions, twoBunsen's cells, of considerable
   effective positive surface, are barely sufficient to bring out the
   article in a serviceable condition.
      4th. It is very difficult, and in some cases impossible, to pre
   vent the exudation of some of the solution occluded within the
   pores.    This exudation causes unsightly spots, which are only
   apparent after the work has been completed some hours.

44                 Mr. A. S. Davis     on the Probable
    The results achieved by the total prevention of the evolution
of hydrogen, by the author's process, are : —
    1st. The attainment of a perfectly solid coating with no pores.
    2nd. The ability to deposit to any thickness without any de
terioration of coating, not only rendering the external protective
coating of varnish quite unnecessary, but making it easy to coat
a given article to any thickness without removing it from the
bath until it is finished.     If desired, the coated article may be
pickled    in brass-finisher's  pickle, or it may be burnished, filed,
or otherwise treated as solid brass, to produce a serviceable
article.
    3rd. There being no evolution of hydrogen during deposition,
all the electric force is utilized in depositing metal, and no more
than one Wollaston's or Smee's cell is necessary to give a perfect
result.    To save time in practice, it is often advisable to use a
single Bunsen's or Mayuooth cell, or equivalent magneto-electric
power.
    4th. The solidity of the coating prevents the possibility of any
exudation or formation of spots, for there are no pores to occlude
the solution.
    Many square feet of cast and wrought iron have been coated,
and many varieties and different qualities of brass have been
produced, by the author's process.         Amongst other work pub
licly  exhibited  is a cast-iron  roller weighing ninety-six pounds
and having a coating of twenty-nine pounds.
    The iron articles coated by the new process have all the
strength of iron and the beauty of brass, in consequence of the
complete command obtained thereby over the quality of the de
posit, as well as its thickness and perfect structure.

VIII.    On the Probable Character     of Cometary Orbits.    By A. S.
   DAVIS, B.A., Mathematical Master, Leeds Grammar-School.
                     [Continued from vol. xl. p. 190.]
        a previous paper on   this subject I arrived at the conclusion
IN    that out of every hundred comets approaching the sun in
hyperbolic orbits, and having perihelion distances greater than
the radius of the earth's orbit, more than twenty-three on the
average will have excentricities greater than 1'02.
    The assumptions on which this result was obtained were, first,
that the parallaxes of the stars nearest the sun are about half a
second; and secondly, that the velocities of comets at a great
distance from the sun vary from zero to three radii of the earth's

                       Character    of Cometary Orbits.                  45
orbit per annum, and that between these values there are as
many comets with one velocity as with another.             Let us consider
whether these assumptions require modification.
    First, with regard to the assumption as to the parallax of the
nearest stars, it is to be remarked that there are only two stars
known to have parallaxes as great as half a second.               Hence in
only   two  directions   from    the  sun are we certain that  the distance
of the nearest stars       is  as small as that  which   corresponds to a
parallax of half a second.
    But the greater the distances of the nearest stars are assumed
to be, the less will be the percentage of comets with excentricities
greater than 1'02.          It will be well, in order to avoid all possi
bility of obtaining too high a percentage through assuming too
small a value for the distance of the nearest stars, to calculate
what the percentage would be on the extreme assumption that
 their parallax is only -05".        (As the sphere which would enclose
 all the stars whose parallaxes are greater than '05" will be 1000
 times as large as the sphere which encloses the two stars whose
 parallaxes are greater than '5", it is extremely improbable that a
 large number would not be met with within this sphere in all
 directions from the sun.)          The result of calculation on this as
 sumption    is  that,  of   the  comets  whose perihelion distances are
 unity, the average percentage having excentricities greater than
 T02 lies between 19 and 23, the first of these values being the
 percentage calculated when R is taken equal to 400,000, and the
 second when R is taken equal to 4,000,000.
     Secondly, with regard to the velocities which comets have on
 first coming into the sun's attraction, we remark that the smaller
 these velocities are assumed to be, the smaller will be the per
 centage of comets with excentricities greater than 1'02. We
 must then inquire whether we have assumed these velocities to
  be greater than they really are.
               I
     Now, as have before remarked, the average velocity of comets
 before coming under the predominant attraction of the sun must
 be as great as the average velocity of the fixed stars. Let us con
 sider, then, what evidence we have regarding the velocities of
 the stars.
     I. The velocities of the stars relatively to the sun arising from
  the sun's motion in space is about 1'6 per annum.
     II. The sums of the squares of the proper motions of the stars
  before and after correction for the sun's motion differ by only
  a small fraction of the whole unconnected sum.              The explana
  tion of this fact appeal's to be that the average proper motion of
  the stars is much greater than the sun's proper motion.
     III.  "When the parallax as well as the proper motion of a star
  is known, the component of its velocity perpendicular to the line

4(1                     Mr. A. S. Davis        on the Probable
in which it is  seen may be ascertained.     Dividing the proper
motion by the parallax, this component is obtained expressed in
terms of the radii of the earth's orbit per annum.
   The following Table exhibits the components of the velocities
thus calculated of the stars which are believed to have a sen

   The average of these velocities is much higher than the greatest
value we assumed for the whole velocities of comets at a great dis
tance.    It must, however, be noticed that many of these stars
were selected as likely to exhibit a sensible parallax because of
their large proper motions, and therefore that their average velo
city cannot be taken altogether as an index of the average velocity
of all stars.
   IV. More than 300 stars are catalogued as having proper mo
tions greater than 0"'5.            If
                                we assume, what will certainly be
the fact, that most of these stars have parallaxes much less than
0"'2, then most of them have proper motions much greater
than 2-5.
   V. By the displacement of the lines in the spectrum of the
light of Sirius, it has been found that it is approaching the sun
with a velocity of 29-4 miles a second.   This is a velocity of 10-14
radii of the earth's orbit per annum.
                                         I
   For these reasons we may think conclude that the velocities
of the stars, and therefore of comets, when at a great distance
from the sun, are on the average greater than the velocities which
we have assumed comets to have in our calculations, and, there
fore, that the percentage of hyperbolic comets having excentrici-
ties greater than 1'02 resulting from our calculations will be less
than the actual percentage.
   We have hitherto only considered those comets which approach
the sun in hyperbolic orbits.     It           is,
                                        however, quite possible that
comets may approach the sun for the first time, coming from the

                        Character of Cometary Orbits.                                   47
interstellar regions of space and passing away never' to return
again, in orbits which in the neighbourhood of the sun are ellip
tical, but which lose their elliptical character in those parts
which are so distant from the sun that the attraction of the stars
is not insensible compared with the sun's attraction.    This will
be the case for any comet whose relative velocity with respect to
the sun when first it comes under its predominant attraction is
less than that due to a fall from an infinite distance— that                           is,
                                                                                         if
R   be   its distance from the sun,        ifit   is   less than A / —.
    With regard to the probable number of comets moving in such
elliptic orbits compared with the number of comets moving in hy
perbolic orbits,   may be remarked that though the number of co
                   it
mets having at     great distance from the sun velocities relatively
                   a

                                             be very small compared          with the
whole number of comets, yet these comets are more likely to
be drawn near the sun and thus to be observed from the earth
than comets with larger velocities, and, therefore, that the number
of comets with such elliptic orbits and perihelion distances so
small that the comets may be observed from the earth may
not be small compared with the number of hyperbolic comets.
I will now attempt to calculate what this number will probably be.
   Let us consider comet at distance
                        a             a      so great that the direc

                  it                   wholly independent of the
                                                 is
sun's position with respect to it.   That this may be the case, we
must take     Rso great that the attractions of the stars upon the
comet may be as great as the sun's attraction, and therefore the
resultant attraction upon the comet not necessarily in the direc
tion of the sun.    Let us consider first what would be the sub
sequent  motions   of comets         if,
                                upon arriving at the distance                                R,

                                          any attraction except that
of the sun. We shall take into consideration those comets only
whose subsequent orbits would be elliptical — that          those co   is,

48                 Mr. A. S. Davis  on the Probable
value of  e is given by the equation

                                        R + y"
Substituting this value in the expression above, we obtain
           — log^-i — x 8g= log — x
                  «T  j             y
                                        Bq very nearly.
    Thus, on the supposition that after comets have arrived at a
distance R from the sun they cease to be attracted by the stars,
the probable number of comets having perihelion distances be
tween q and q + Bq and excentricities less than unity is propor-
               •p
tional to log  — X Bq.     But the attraction of the stars upon 'a
comet does not cease when it has arrived at a distance R from
the sun.     The effect, however, of their attraction will be to di
minish the number of comets with perihelion distances so small
that they can be observed from the earth ; for their attraction
will generally diminish the force acting upon the comet in the
direction of the sun, and will cause the direction of the whole
resultant attraction not necessarily to lie in the direction of the
sun. Thus the comets will have their directions of motion less
deflected towards the sun than they would be if they were not
attracted by the stars, and consequently will have larger perihe
lion distances, so that fewer will be observod from the earth.
                           T>
We may then take log — x       Bq as a superior limit to the number
of comets with perihelion distances between       q and q + Bq, and
excentricities less than unity.    We have, therefore, the ratio of
elliptic to hyperbolic orbits less than
a  ratio which for moderate values of q docs not differ much from
unity.
    Hence out of every hundred comets approaching the solar
system for the first time and having perihelion distances equal
to unity, about fifty will move in hyperbolic orbits, and of these
fifty about ten or eleven at least will have excentricities greater
than 1'02.      For comets with perihelion distances larger than
unity there will be even a larger percentage than ten or eleven
having exceutricities greater than 1-02.
    We are thus led to the conclusion that a large majority of
those comets whose orbits are un distinguishable from parabolas
are not visitors to the solar system for the first time, because, if
they were, the percentage of comets with excentricities greater
than 1'02 would be very much smaller than by theory it should be.

                    Character  of Cometary Orbits.                49
   I  now wish to point out a possible method by which comets
of very long period may have become permanently attached to
the solar system.
   The known elliptic comets are supposed to have had their
orbits changed into ellipses by perturbations produced by the
planets ; and there are several reasons for believing this to be the
true account.      Thus the planes of their orbits have a decided
tendency    to make  a small angle with the plane of the ecliptic,
and a large percentage of them have a direct motion.           Both
these facts agree well with the theory that they have had their
orbits changed by the perturbing influence of the planets.
    It may be well here to remark that this tendency of the planes
of the orbits of periodic comets to have a small inclination to the
plane of the ecliptic does not arise from any disturbing action of
the planets upon their orbits after they have become periodic,
but arises from the fact that a non-periodic comet is more liable
to become changed into a periodic comet the smaller its inclina
tion to the ecliptic upon its first approach to the sun. The
disturbing influence of the planets upon the planes of the orbits
of periodic comets will on an average act as much to increase
as to diminish their inclinations to the ecliptic.        But when
we come to consider the parabolic comets, we find that the comets
having a retrograde motion are more numerous than those which
have a direct motion, and also that the planes of their orbits ex
hibit no tendency to make a smaller inclination with the plane
 of the ecliptic than with any other plane.    Out of 1 74 parabolic
comets, 101 or 58 per    cent,  have a retrograde motion, and 102
or 59 per    cent, have the planes of their orbits inclined at an
angle greater than 45° to the ecliptic.     These facts are opposed
to the theory that these comets have had their orbits changed by
the attractions of the planets ; and we are thus induced to seek
for some other cause.
    May not an adequate cause be found in the resisting medium
which is supposed to surround the sun? We have seen that
many comets must approach the sun for the first time moving in
elliptic orbits.   The aphelion distances of some of these orbits
will be less than the distance of the nearest stars, and may be so
small that, if they be diminished to any considerable extent, the
comets will become permanently attached to the sun.         Now the
effect of a resisting medium upon a very excentric orbit in
changing the length of the major axis will be much greater in
the course of one revolution than it is in the case of an orbit of
moderate excentricity such as Encke's. We may form a rough
notion as to what effect the resisting medium would have in di
minishing the semiaxis of the orbit of a comet of long period by
the following approximate calculations.

Thus, on the assumption that, under the same circumstances as
to velocity and distance from the sun, the resisting medium would
offer the same amount of resistance to the comet of long period
as to Encke's comet, we arrive at the conclusion that its aphelion
distance will be diminished              by
                                 about -018 of its original length.
  A   diminution to this amount would be sufficient to change                 a
comet's motion in some cases into      periodical revolution about
                                               a
the sun.     There are, however, reasons for believing that the
retardation which comets of long period have undergone on first
becoming attached to the solar system must have been greater
than the retardation which Encke's comet now experiences.      The
first reason        is,
                 that   comet appears to lose at each approach
                              a
to the sun its rarest and most volatile parts, or those which
offer the greatest resistance to motion     and the second

at the period when it first became attached to the solar system,
the nebulosity about the sun was probably much greater than
it now is.
    Lastly, we have already noticed that, out of 174 parabolic
comets, the number which have a retrograde motion is consider
ably greater than the number which have a direct motion, and
also that the number which have an inclination to the ecliptic
greater than 45° is considerably greater than the number which
have an inclination less than 45°.
      If these facts are not due to mere chance (and that they
are due to chance is improbable),          they are themselves an evi
dence that the parabolic comets are not, for the most part,
visitors to the solar system for the first time*.           But if these
comets are periodic, and if they have become so by some cause
which has acted equally on comets approaching the sun with
direct and retrograde motions and in any directions, then we
should expect that the comets with a retrograde motion would
be more numerous than those which have a direct motion, and
also that those whose planes are inclined to the ecliptic at an
angle greater than 45° would be more numerous than those
whose planes have an inclination less than 45°.           This we should
expect, because a greater number of those with a direct motion
than of those with a retrograde motion and a greater number of
those with an inclination less than 45° than of those with an
inclination exceeding 45° would be subsequently changed by the
attractions of the planets into comets of comparatively short
periods; and therefore, of those left unchanged, a majority
 would have retrograde motions and large inclinations to the
 ecliptic. It is a confirmation of this theory to find that, if we
 take into account all known comets, 48'9f per cent, and 51*1
 per cent, respectively, or numbers very nearly equal, have direct
and retrograde motions.
     The sum of what     I   have endeavoured to prove is : —
     I. That the great majority of comets whose orbits are undi-
 stinguishable from parabolas are moving in elliptic orbits, and
 are permanent members of the solar system.
     II.  That these comets have not, like the comets of short pe
 riod, become permanently attached to the solar system through
 changes which have been produced in their orbits by the per
 turbing attractions of the planets ; and that the loss of velocity
 which they have experienced in passing through the resisting

                    By  RICHAKD     A. PROCTOR, B.A.*
       cannot but be regarded as a remarkable circumstance that
IT the nature        of the zodiacal light should in the present state
of astronomy continue to be a qutestio vexata.               I do not here
refer to the physical constitution of this object, respecting which
we may possibly be unable for many years to form a satisfactory
theory, but to the determination of the actual position of the
zodiacal light in space.       Astronomers have been able to deter
mine from geometrical considerations the paths of such objects
as comets and meteors ; it would therefore seem that the posi
tion of such an object as the zodiacal light ought ere this to
have been determined.
    Yet it must be admitted that there are peculiar difficulties
in this problem.        We can reason respecting the distance and
motion    of  a  comet, because we know that our observations are
made on one and the same body, whose motions are in accord
ance with the laws of gravity.           It is otherwise with respect to
the zodiacal light.       \Ve see a certain glow or radiance occupy
ing a definite position with respect to the horizon and to the
celestial circles ; but we have no means of ascertaining whether
the objects from which that radiance proceeds are the same at
any one time as at any other, or indeed (as will presently appear)
whether a single one of the constituents forming the zodiacal
gleam at one season is present within the same region of the
solar system at another.
    The geometrical conditions applicable to the zodiacal light
are, however, too definite to admit of question ; in other words,
the path to be followed in seeking for a theory of this object is
unmistakable.         Hitherto, so far as    I am aware, that path has
not been traced out far enough for the attainment of definite
views, the perplexities which presently surround us as we follow
it having seemed perhaps to render further research hopeless.
    It happens, however, not unfrequently that the very difficul-

ties surrounding a subject of this sort assist us — in this way,
that they enable us to reject theories which otherwise might
engage our attention and so cause perplexity.             Precisely as the
very complexity of a lock makes us all the more certain that a
key which opens the lock is the key really appertaining to                     it,
so, where      subject of astronomical research presents many per
               a
plexing phenomena, these become so many reasons the more for
accepting       theory which
                 a                is  not contradicted        by
                                                               any one of
them.
    This   is,
            I    think, the case with the zodiacal light. We are
able, as
       I     hope now to show,         byconsidering the peculiarities of
this object to get rid, one after another, of various theories which
might otherwise distract our attention.              And though           by
                                                                        this
process   of elimination   we  may   not  be  enabled  to determine   quite
the true theory of this object, we can yet considerably narrow
the field within which selection has to be made.
    The first considerations to be dealt with are those which de
pend on the normal features of the zodiacal light.                   It well
                                                                          is
known that the light exhibits usually the figure of an oblique
conoid whose axis lies close           by
                                        the ecliptic, and whose vertex
lies ata   varying   distance   from    the  position of the sun.      Near
 the axis the light grows brighter, except close               by
                                                                the vertex,
where  it   is even fainter than at the other parts of the border.
The following Table, prepared           byHerr Klein from modern ob
servations, indicates the varying range of the vertex from the
place of the sun, though         itmust be remembered (and will be
recognized at once by every one familiar with the varying posi
tion of the ecliptic during the year, and other like circum
stances) that these measures indicate variation in the extent of
visibility rather than (of necessity) any real variation in the
extent of the light.

                 Mr. R. A. Proctor   on the   Zodiacal Light.                55
   The setting of the zodiacal light when the western half is
visible,   and the rising of the light when the eastern half is
visible,   take place quite regularly, and in a manner precisely
corresponding with what would be observed if the zodiacal light
were a distant object like a planet, a star, or a portion of the
Milky Way.
    Now these circumstances at once enable us to reject the theory
that the zodiacal light is a terrestrial appendage, by which                  I
understand for the moment an object lying within the earth's
atmosphere.        For there can be no question whatever that if any
definite portion of our atmosphere were rendered luminous in.
any way, that portion would either occupy an unchanged posi
tion or would shift according to the laws regulating the process
of illumination, or according to the winds or other like terres
trial causes. Now that on any given occasion such causes
might so operate as to give the illuminated air the appearance
of rising or setting, as celestial objects do (that            is,
                                                                 not merely
rising   or  setting, but   rising   or  setting along declination-paral
lels), is quite possible, however unlikely.          To take an illustrative
instance    :   balloon seen at any one instant between an observer
                a
and the sun might be carried           by    the winds so as to continue
between him and the sun, even until the hour of sunset. But
to suppose that night after night at any station                a relation so
peculiar would characterize the illuminated air,                    like sup
                                                                   is
posing    that     balloon,
                    a         started   day   after day from   a given place,
would day after day fulfil the condition considered above. This
is  obviously incredible.         But even  if it   were credible,      would
                                                                        it
be insufficient, since the region of our atmosphere which would
have to be illuminated, in order to account for the zodiacal light
as seen in one place, would, as seen from other stations, present
an appearance wholly different from that of the zodiacal light.
In fact, the former place were in England, the zodiacal light
            if
would actually be in the zenith of places 900 miles or so west or
east of England.
    Next we have the normal aspect of the zodiacal light in dif
ferent latitudes to consider.           Now we have the most positive
assurances from astronomers of eminence that the zodiacal light,
wherever seen, occupies ordinarily precisely those regions of the
heavens corresponding to the theory that             it   istoo far from the
earth to have an appreciable parallactic displacement.                We have
 the evidence of practised astronomers like the Astronomer Royal
for Scotland, Captain Jacob, and others          ;   and all the evidence we
 have points to the conclusion that the zodiacal light, as seen in
the tropics, extends at any moment over those same parts of the
 stellar heavens which     it   illuminates as seen from our northern
stand-point.       The limits of the light may seem greater in those

56              Mr. R. A. Proctor      en the   Zodiacal Light.
 latitudes than in ours ; but the axis of the conoidal gleam is
situated precisely as with us.
    Now it seems wholly unquestionable that this quality of the
 light should dispose at once and for ever of the theory that the
zodiacal light is due to the existence of a ring of matter around
the earth.
    Let it be remembered that there is only one way in which the
 ordinary aspect of the zodiacal light can at all be interpreted on
 such an hypothesis.        If there were a ring of meteorites as far
 from us as the moon        is,   then undoubtedly there would be       a
 gleam   in  the west after  sunset,    and in the east before sunrise, in
 the position where we see the zodiacal light.           And further, the
 individual meteorites producing any portion of that gleam would
 undoubtedly rise and set much as the zodiacal light             observed
                                                                  is
to do. But there would also be          a   gleam,   anda  much  brighter
 gleam, in the south.       The meteorites rising and setting would
 turn only  a   small portion of their illuminated faces towards us,
 those in the south (on or close       by  the ecliptic) would be " full,"
 so to speak, and their combined lustre would be proportionately
 more considerable.      Now supposing the ring exactly coincident
 with the ecliptic, the earth's shadow would fall on the part due
 south.     But the width of this shadow would (on the supposi
 tion we are considering) be relatively small.            At midnight, in
our latitudes, we should undoubtedly, on this supposition, see
two arms of light extending from the eastern and western hori
zon along the ecliptic, each growing brighter and brighter
towards the south   ;   and a    relatively narrow black rift would lie
between the bright extremities of these arms.              It no theory
                                                              is
that this would be the case, but            a simple deduction from the
most obvious geometrical laws.
    If, then, we are to have ring round the earth,
                                  a                              must lie
                                                                  it
far within the moon's orbit, so that the earth's shadow may be
wide enough to cover the meteorites along the whole of that
long arc which. under ordinary circumstances           is undoubtedly un-
illuminated.      The earth's shadow cannot be more than 8000
miles across anywhere, and we must have our ring at such                a
distance that this width of 8000 miles may correspond to (or
subtend) that wide arc of darkness actually observed under or
dinary circumstances.        (It  is absolutely essential that ordinary
circumstances should be accounted for             ;   only when this has
been done need we begin to inquire into extraordinary circum
stances.)
    Now we need not leave our own latitudes to decide how far
off the ring should be to account for the apparent dimensions of
the zodiacal light, because on the theory that the earth's shadow
falling on ring of some sort defines the limits of visibility of

the light, it would follow, precisely as in the case just con
 sidered, that the light would grow brighter and brighter up to
 the very edge of the shadow.         (Supposing that edge to corre
 spond to the extent of the earth's shadow, there would be a
 somewhat ruddy bordering ; but up to the commencement of
 that fringe there would be a regular increase of brilliancy.)      But
 passing over this consideration (and also the consideration that
 the observed aspect of the zodiacal light in our latitudes is wholly
 inconsistent with the aspect thus shown to be due to the hypo
thesis we are dealing with), we may take as most favourable to
 the hypothesis of a meteoric ring near the earth those observa
 tions of the zodiacal light in tropical regions which give to the
ordinary apparitions of the light the greatest observed extension
from the sun.
    We have it on the authority of Professor Piazzi Smyth that,
even when he observed the zodiacal light under exceptionally
favourable     conditions (from an elevation, namely, of no less
 than 11,000 feet above the sea-level), the western tongue had
 completely set fully four hours before the eastern tongue began
 to rise. Now, even if the eastern tongue were just beginning to
rise when the western tongue had fully set, there would still be
an arc of 180° between the two vertices*.            But the shadow of
the earth would not account for such an arc as this between the
 vertices, unless the outer part of the ring had a radius not ex
ceeding ^/2 x radius of the earth (even in the most favourable
 case of a station near to the equator) ; and with such a radius as
 this the outer part (even) of the ring would be always invisible
from places having a higher northerly or southerly latitude
than 45°.
    And even if we set this demonstration on one side for a mo
ment, it is yet obvious that, whether a ring lying relatively near
the earth coincided in plane with the equator or with the ecliptic,
or with any intermediate plane, it could not possibly exhibit
any approach to coincidence with the celestial ecliptic when
viewed from high latitudes.             Further, as seen from high
northern latitudes, such a ring would always have a parallactic
displacement, causing it to lie to the south of its geocentric
position, and vice versd ; whereas no such association between
the latitude of the observer and the apparent position of the
zodiacal light has ever been observed, far less such a systematic
association as the case requires.
    It is geometrically impossible, then, that the ordinary aspect
of the zodiacal light can be accounted for by any theory which
represents it as due to a ring of light-reflecting bodies around
   *  It must be remembered that each vertex, us the zodiacal light was
seen by Professor  Smyth, lay close by the ecliptic.

"68              Mr. R. A. Proctor on        the  Zodiacal Light.
 the earth, whether that ring be close by the earth or at a dis
tance comparable with the moon's*.
•   We need not consider the theory that the light may be due
to a self-luminous ring around the earth, for obvious reasons.
    Now, passing from the normal features of the ring to more or
less exceptional peculiarities, we find ourselves compelled to re
ject yet one other theory of the light ;           I mean the theory that it
is due to a disk of minute          bodies   travelling in orbits of small
eccentricity around the sun.
    The peculiarities which oppose themselves most strikingly to
this theory are those which relate to the position and extent of
the zodiacal light, though it will be obvious that the observed
variations in the apparent brightness of the light are iiot readily
 explicable on this hypothesis.
    Admitting the existence of a disk of bodies travelling as sup
posed, it will be evident that the changes affecting the motions
 of any member of the system would correspond exactly to those
 which would affect the motions of any considerable orb travel
 ling at a similar distance from the sun. In other words, the
 changes would resemble those slow periodic changes which
 affect the orbits of the earth, Venus, and Mercury.                   Nor is it
 conceivable that the members of the system would so interfere
with each other's motions as to affect appreciably at any time the
 appearance of the disk.          Now changes such as these, affecting
 the individuals of a set of bodies which at any one time were
 spread with a certain uniformity (as the ordinary appearance of
 the zodiacal light would imply to be the case with its constitu
ents), could not account for the observed changes in the position
 and extent of the light.         The axis of the gleam has been seen
 at times, by practised observers, inclined at a considerable angle
 to the plane of the ecliptic. The extent of the zodiacal light
    * While    dealing with the relations presented by the Saturnian ring-
 system,   in 1864,  1 was led to apply the formula, with suitable changes of
 elements, to the case of a ring circling the earth, being invited to the in
 quiry by the perusal of the observations made by Lieutenant Jones, and
 comments made thereon by Baron Humboldt.            I found that there is not a
 single hypothesis as to the dimensions of such a ring which would lead to
 results according with, or even in the slightest degree approaching, the
 results of observations made upon the zodiacal light. This conclusion is
 embodied in a note at p. 117 of that treatise ; in which note I remark that
 such investigations
                        " prove that the zodiacal light cannot be due to a
                                                                             ring
 of a minute satellite surrounding the earth, the appearance of the ring in
 high latitudes being altogether different from that which would be pre
 sented by a ring surrounding the earth.       I am careful to refer to these re
 searches and their results, because remarks have been published implying
 that  I have somewhat hastily come to a decision on the points here dealt
 with.    A complete mathematical investigation of the subject made fully
 six years since may be regarded as fairly meeting those remarks.

           Mr. E. A. Proctor     on the   Zodiacal Light.         59
has varied at times in the most remarkable manner, while its
luminosity has been so variable that sometimes for months to
gether it has been scarcely perceptible (in our northern lati
tudes)
         •
           while at others it has been singularly conspicuous.     I
set on one side for the moment those observations by Lieutenant
Jones which would imply that at times the zodiacal light in
creases so greatly in extent as to become visible at once both on
the eastern and western horizon.          I
                                         also set on one side those
observations by M. Liais, according to which the zodiacal light
can be seen at times extending as a complete arch from the
eastern to the western horizon. Assuming these observations to
be reliable (and those by M. Liais do not seem open to ques
tion), a true theory of the zodiacal light may be expected to
account for them.      But without insisting on this, it is evident,
I  think, that the admitted variations of the zodiacal light, in
position, extent, and splendour, do not admit of being interpreted
by the theory that the light is due to a disk including always
the same materials moving in orbits of small eccentricity.
    Nor do our difficulties seem removed if we assume that the
constituents of the disk travel in orbits of considerable eccen
tricity, so long as we suppose that the actual constitution of
the disk is constant, or nearly so, amidst whatever variations in
the distribution of individual constituents.
    Yet the general aspect of the zodiacal light, and the consider
 ations already applied to other theories, suffice to prove that
there is always present around the sun as centre a disk, whether
 composed of discrete meteorites, of vaporous masses, or of some
combination of these and other forms of matter.        The materials
 of this disk must be in motion around the sun in accordance
 with the laws of gravity ; at least we have no evidence whatever
inviting us to the supposition that they differ in this respect
from all the other constituents of the solar system.
    We are thus led to the conclusion that the bodies composing
 the zodiacal light travel in orbits of considerable eccentricity,
 carrying them far beyond the limits of what we may now term
 the zodiacal disk.    The constitution of the disk thus becomes
 variable, and that within limits which may be exceedingly wide.
 They must be so, in fact, if all the recorded variations of the
 zodiacal light are to be accounted for.        In other words, it is
 requisite (if  our evidenceis   to be explained) not only that the
 paths of the materials composing the zodiacal light shall be for
 the most part very eccentric, but that along those paths the
 materials should not be strewn in such       away that    given por
                                                            a
 tion of any path is  at all times occupied    by constant, or nearly
                                                    a
 constant quantity of matter.
    According to this view, the constituents of the zodiacal light

60           Mr. R. A. Proctor        on the    Zodiacal Light.
would (at least   as respects distribution along their several paths
and the general figure of those paths) resemble very closely the
meteoric systems which, as we know, the earth traverses in the
course of her annual motion around the sun.
   By considering the zodiacal light we have thus been led to a
theory involving, and associated with, the theory of meteor-
systems as now established by the labours of Adams, Leverrier,
Schiaparelli, and others. But it is worth noticing that, by rever
sing the process, and considering first the theory of meteor-
systems so established, we are led quite as readily to the theory
that there must at all times exist in the sun's neighbourhood a
disk of discrete constituents which would present precisely such
an appearance as the zodiacal light.             I
                                                 have shown elsewhere
that this result is a simple mathematical deduction from the
evidence.
   But setting this consideration wholly on one side, the fact re
mains that all other theories of the zodiacal light (that         is,
                                                                    of the
motions of its constituent parts, without reference to its physical
constitution) have been eliminated.         It remains only to be shown
that this theory     iscontroverted       by
                                           no peculiarities in the ob
served appearance of the zodiacal light, and also that we should
inquire what further general laws,         ifany, may be predicated of
the motions of the bodies composing this object.
   The fact that the axis of the zodiacal light          ordinarily close
                                                          is
to the ecliptic,is  accounted for on the assumption that the various
paths along which the constituents of the zodiacal disk travel,
tend to aggregate towards the neighbourhood of the ecliptic.
There  is  nothing, however, to prevent individual systems from
having  a  considerable  inclination to that plane.
   The observed variation of the zodiacal light in brilliancy, posi
tion, and extent  is  obviously to be expected according to the view
of its structure now under consideration.
   The simultaneous appearance of an eastern and western light
and Liais's observation of       acomplete arch of light have to be
accounted for as highly exceptional but, at the same time, recog
nized phenomena.        It easy to see that both these phenomena
                            is
may be regarded as indicating the occasional but very exceptional
extension of the zodiacal disk to         considerable distance beyond
                                          a
the orbit of the earth.      But     must not be concealed that there
                                     it
are great difficulties to be removed before this interpretation can
be regarded as satisfactory.
    Let us suppose, for instance, the case of thin luminous disk
                                                      a
occupying the whole orbit of Mars, and that the earth              in the
                                                                  is
part of her orbit    where  her  distance  north  or south  of this  plane
is greatest. Then      itwill be evident that the outline of the disk,
as seen from any part of the earth, would correspond very nearly

                   Mr. R. A. Proctor      on the Zodiacal Light.                 61
to a great circle of the heavens, and that the whole of the visible
heavens south or north of that great circle would be hidden by
the luminous disk.             In other words, a region of the heavens far
larger than that occupied by the arch of Liais, or by the eastern
and western lights of Jones, should be occupied by the zodiacal
light if it had some such extension as we have assumed in the
case       of this luminous disk.
      It    is to be remembered, however,         that,   assuming    (as we are
bound to do) a considerable degree of flatness in the actual figure
 of the zodiacal disk, and more especially of its more distant por
 tions, then much more light would be received from those parts
 towards which the line of sight is directed at a considerably acute
 angle, than from those parts which the line of sight crosses nearly
 at right angles.          And it is easy to see that, on any reasonable
 assumption as to the range of zodiacal substance which it is ne
 cessary that the line of sight should traverse in order that any
  appreciable light may be received, the occasional visibility of
 the light where the superior planets alone can be seen becomes
 as readily explicable as the ordinary visibility of the light in those
 parts of the sky where the inferior planets become visible.
       It will be seen that all that can be strictly said to have been
  demonstrated in this paper is the fact that the zodiacal light is
 associated with the sun, and not with the earth, — that it is not
  due to solar light reflected from bodies travelling within the
  earth's orbit, whether in circular or elliptic orbits, — and that, if
  the major part of the zodiacal light is reflected solar light, then
  the paths of the bodies reflecting that light must resemble those
  of the meteors encountered by the earth.                  As the spectroscope
  seems to show that at least a portion of the light* of the zodiacal
  gleam is not reflected solar light, we cannot, in the present state
  of our knowledge, definitely decide on a theory as to the motions
  of the bodies to which the light is due ; for the solution of the
  problem is obviously bound up with the interpretation of the
  physical nature of the zodiacal light.             If some solar action, for
  example, rouses luminosity in certain definite directions (as, for
  instance, near the plane of the sun's equator) in some such way
  as light is caused to appear along radial lines through and be
  yond the heads of comets, our power of theorizing from such
  considerations as have been dealt with in this paper would be
       *   I use this mode of speaking, not by any means as doubting the accuracy
  of Angstrom's observation, but       because, even if the greater part of the light
  gave a continuous      spectrum, yet this spectrum might remain undiscernible
   i u   a  when bright lines corresponding to a very minute proportion of the
  total light were seen with case.       Nay, such bright lines as Angstrom found
  in the spectrum of the phosphorescent light from the sky might be detected
   when a continuous spectrum from the much brighter light of the zodiacal
  radiance remained unseen.

62            Dr. W.    J. M. Rankine    on the Hypothesis  of
limited.      It would still remain certain that the zodiacal light is
not a terrestrial appendage (either near or far off); but what sort
of solar appendage it might be would be a problem as difficult
 to solve as that presented by comets.
     If the radiated structure of the sun's corona as seen under
favourable atmospheric conditions should be confirmed as more
than an optical phenomenon, it is not impossible that we might
be put in the way of interpreting the zodiacal light.
X.     On the Hypo thesis of Molecular Motions in Thermodynamics,
    By W. J. MACQUOHN RANKINE, C.E.,LL.D., F.R.SS.Lond.
    tfEdin.*
1.    TF I     rightly understand the question raised by Mr. Heath,
      A    it is not whether the two propositions called respectively
the First Law and the Second Law of Thermodynamics correctly
express the facts of experiments respecting the relations between
heat and mechanical energy from which those laws have been
arrived at by induction, but whether those two laws follow from
the hypothesis that thermometric heat consists in some sort of
molecular motion — and in particular whether the contraction of
the space within which a system of moving bodies is confined
causes of itself acceleration of their motion ; for if this be esta
blished, the two laws of thermodynamics             readily follow from
the hypothesis.
    2. According to a proposition laid down by all the writers
on thermodynamics          who have treated of the before-mentioned
hypothesis,      the acceleration  of the motion of a system of bodies
by    the contraction    of the  space within which they are confined
is a necessary consequence of the elementary principles of dyna
mics.      According to Mr. Heath's views, unless      I  misunderstand
 them, that proposition is inconsistent with the principle that a
 body under the action of a pair of equal and opposite forces is
 neither accelerated nor retarded — in other words, with the first
law of motion.
     3. In order that the alleged inconsistency should exist, it
 would be necessary that each of the bodies under consideration
 should be under the action of no force, or of balanced forces.
 But that is not so ; for the bodies under consideration are par
 ticles moving within a limited space ; therefore their motions in
 any given direction are limited in extent ; therefore during cer
 tain parts of their motions, and especially when they are near
 the boundaries of the containing space, those motions must be
  continually varying, certainly in direction, and possibly both in

direction and in velocity ; therefore the particles cannot be under
the action of balanced forces, nor of no force.
   4. If one boundary of the limited space within which the
moving particles are contained is a moveable piston, that piston
may be at rest, or may have a uniform velocity, or a variable
velocity ; and the condition to be fulfilled in order that the pis
ton may be at rest, or may move uniformly,                      is,
                                                       that the pressure
applied  to its outer surface  shall  be equal to  the  pressure exerted
against its inner surface             by
                                the confined particles.
   5. The various investigations of the consequences of the hypo
thesis of molecular motions with which         am acquainted, though
                                                         I
differing  much  in detail, are  all identical in  principle and      do    ;       I
not know of any passage in the writings of any one of                the
authors of those investigatious, which                   is,
                                                either avowedly or im
plicitly, in the slightest degree inconsistent with the dynamical
                       now quote in Mr. Heath's words — No
                                                              "
principles which           I                                                    :
acceleration, and therefore no heat,     generated  isthe action of   by
forces which are in equilibrium
                                     " and "where the force meets
                                ...

                                                         is
acceleration."
   6.   With respect to the mode of applying those principles, the
following remark may              seem      a   nevertheless of im
                                                truism, but    is
portance to the present discussion.       In reasoning about the
effects of forces, the body as to whose acceleration or retardation,
or uniformity of motion, conclusions are drawn, ought to be the
same with that to which the forces are applied and no conclusion;
as to the motion or rest of one body can be drawn from the fact
of the equilibrium or non-equilibrium of the forces applied to
another body.      For example, the outside and inside of piston
                                            if                                  a
be acted on           by
                  equal and opposite pressures, the legitimate con
clusion      that the piston will remain at rest or move at
             is                                                  uni                a
form speed the equilibrium of the forces applied to the piston
                  :
proves nothing as to the state of motion or rest of the substance
that     confined
        is             it. by         If,
                                on the other hand, the outside and
inside of the piston be acted on by unequal pressures, the legi
timate conclusion         that the piston will be accelerated or re
                            is
tarded, as the case may be; and nothing can be concluded as to
the state of the particles confined.         In order to determine
 whether or to what extent these particles will be accelerated                           by
an alteration of the space within which they are confined, we
must consider whether there         any want of equilibrium amongst
the forces exerted on them                  by is
                                    the piston and        each other.  by
 Unless the particles are at rest, there cannot be equilibrium                           ;
 for they are not free to move uniformly in straight lines to an
 indefinite distance     and their motions,
                            ;                 they move at all, must
                                                          if
 certainly be deflected, and possibly accelerated and retarded                           ;
 and such changes imply unbalanced forces.

64           Dr. W.   J. M. Rankine   on the Hypothesis   of
   7. As to my having in my paper of October             " represented
the piston as imparting vis viva to the particles without losing
any of its own," I consider that I was warranted in doing
so, because    I  provided, in the investigation, for the action of
a pressure on the outside of the piston sufficient to balance
that produced by the impulse of the particles against the in
side, and therefore to impart to the piston exactly the same
quantity of energy which it imparts to the particles.
   It is easy, however, if desired, to provide for the possible re
tardation or acceleration of the piston through auy inequality of
the pressures exerted on its outer and inner faces, as follows.
   Let u be the mean velocity of the piston during the small in
terval of time dt, and — du the retardation during that interval.
Let — v be the normal component of the velocity, relatively to
the vessel, with which a set of particles are moving towards the

to the piston, is —(v + u); and the mean normal velocity, re
latively to the piston, with which they rebound, is +» + «; and
relatively to the vessel, » + 2w.
   Let mdt be the aggregate mass of the particles which act on
the piston in the interval dt.     Their mean total change of velo
city is 2 (v + u) ; therefore the outward pressure exerted by them
on the piston, and the inward pressure exerted by the piston on
them, are each equal to

comprehend all sorts of effects that are produced by a force
acting through a space, whether the overcoming of another force,
such as an attraction, repulsion, or pressure, or the acceleration
of a moving mass (see, for example, Thomson and Tail's ' Natural
Philosophy/    § 241).
   9. In the following investigation, the forces exerted by the con
fined particles on each other are taken into account.      Let P be
the pressure applied to the outside of the piston ; Q the pressure
exerted by the confined particles against the inside of the piston ;
let Sx denote a distance through which the piston is or may be
shifted, and be positive inwards ; let M be the mass of the piston
and M its velocity.  Then, by the principle of the conservation of
energy,  we  have
                       (P-Q)Stf=M«8«;                                (6)
and in order that the velocity of the piston may be nothing or
uniform (that     in order that we may have either M=0 or 8a = 0),
                    is,
the condition to be fulfilled        — Q=0.

 by the external pressure in driving the piston inwards through

ferred from the piston to the particles on which                acts     it        is

                                             is                   by

near the piston as to exert upon       appreciable forces.

the piston moves with a uniform velocity, we may substitute
T?Sx for Q&r ; and the same is the case, indeed, if at the end of
the motion denoted by 8# the piston returns to the velocity
which it had at the beginning of that motion, and also if the
piston starts from a state of rest at the beginning and returns to
a state of rest at the end of the motion Sx.               If, on the other

    12. The reasoning which has been applied to particles moving
within a space of which a piston forms one boundary is evidently
applicable to particles moving within any space capable of en
largement and contraction, and bounded by a surface of any
kind which is not crossed by the moving particles.                The boun
dary    of   the space may  be   a mathematical       surface,  having at its
two    sides    systems  of particles  which     meet   and   press or repel
each other at the surface, but do not cross it; and then the con
sideration of the mass of the piston may be omitted from the
problem.
    13. It can be shown that, for the particles at and near such a

the confined particles through compression varies proportionally
to »2, other circumstances being alike ; and hence may be de
duced the second law of thermodynamics ; but this has so often
been explained by different authors and accordiug to different
methods, that it is unnecessary to enlarge upon it now.

  rPHE     following communication was read: —
    1    " On   the Mathematical Theory of Combined Streams." By        ' W.
  J. Macquorn Rankine, C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS. Lond. and Edinb.
      1. Object of this Investigation. — The principles of the action of
  combined streams were to a certain extent investigated by Venturi,
  and stated in his essay ' Sur la Communication latcrale du Mouve-
  ment dans les Fluides' (Paris, 1/98).         The principle of the conser
 vation of momentum, so far as I know, was first explicitly applied to
  combined streams by Mr. William Froude, F.R.S., in a paper on
  Giffard's Injector, read to the British Association at Oxford, in
  1860, and published in the Transactions of the Sections, p. 211.
  Various other authors have treated the same problem by different
  methods, based virtually on the same principle. A very complete and
  precise investigation of the theory of combined streams, in every
 case in which two streams only are combined, is contained in
  Professor Zeuner's treatise 'Das Locomotivenblasrohr " (Zurich,
  1S63). The theoretical conclusions are tested by comparison with
 experiment, and applied to practical questions, especially those rela
 ting to the apparatus from which the treatise takes its name. The
 object of the present investigation is to apply similar principles to
 the combination of any number of streams ; and the demonstration
 of the fundamental dynamic equation differs from that given by
 Zeuner in method, though not in principle, being effected at one ope
 ration by the direct application of the principle of the equality of
 impulse and momentum, instead of by the consideration of the loss
 of energy that takes place during the combination of the streams.
     2. Terms and Notation used, and Suppositions made. — The several
 streams which are combined will be called before their junction, the
 component streams; the stream formed by their combination will
be called the resultant stream.          The passages through which the
 component and resultant streams flow will be called respectively
the supply-tubes and the discharge-tube.            The combination of the
streams will be supposed to take place in a short cylindrical cham
ber, with its axis parallel to the direction of flow, which will be called
the junction-chamber.
    At one end of the junction-chamber are the outlets of the supply-
tubes, which will be called the nozzles ; at the other end, the inlet
of the discharge-tube, which will be called the throat.           It will be
supposed, further, that the supply-tubes are so formed as to direct
the component streams at the nozzles so that they shall all flow
sensibly parallel to each other and to the resultant stream.            The

   The forward impulse exerted in a unit of time upon the mass of
fluid in the junction-chamber by the pressure at the nozzle end of
the chamber is paA.     The backward impulse exerted in the same
time on the same mass by the pressure at the throat-end of the
chamber is P0A. By the second law of motion, the difference be
tween those impulses is equal to the change of momentum produced ;
that is to say,
or, dividing both sides by A,
And this is    the general dynamical equation of the combination of
any number of streams of any fluids.
    If the preceding equation, as applied to a combination of two
streams only, be compared with the equation not numbered, which
immediately precedes equation 60 in Zeuner's treatise, it will be seen
that they are virtually identical, although different in form, and de
monstrated by different methods.
   5. Loss of Energy at Junction. —    If a given mass of any fluid at
the bulkiness s and pressure p is contained in a reservoir, from
which it is capable of being expelled by the inward motion of a piston
loaded with an external force equivalent to the pressure, it is known
that the potential energy of the mass of fluid and of the piston
relatively to a point at the level of the centre of mass of the fluid
is expressed by multiplying the mass by     I    °tdp, the relation between
                                            Jo
s and p being that which is called adiabatic ; that is to say, such
that no heat is received or given out by the fluid. Hence the loss
of energy in the junction-chamber in each unit of time is given by
the following expression : —
of which the first, or positive term, denotes the aggregate energy,
actual and potential, of the component streams as they enter the
junction-chamber;     and the second, or negative term, expresses the
 total energy, actual and potential, of the resultant stream as it leaves
 that chamber. That lost energy takes the form partly of visible
eddies and partly of invisible molecular motions — that       is,
                                                             of heat.

   1. " On the Superficial Deposits of the South of Hampshire and
the Isle of Wight."  By Thomas Codrington, Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper treated of the gravel deposits covering the tertiary
strata of the country between Portsmouth and Poole, and of the
Isle of Wight.
   The strikingly tabular character of the surface best seen on the
                                                           is
east of the Avon, where from the coast for more than twenty miles
inland a  gravel-covered plain can be followed, rising gradually from
80 feet to 420 feet above the sea, at the rate of about 20 feet per
mile. The high plains of the New Forest, to the eye perfectly level,
and indented by deep valleys, are portions of this table-land.    The
plateau between the Bournemouth Cliffs and the Valley of the Stour,
and detached gravel-capped hills further inland, are the remnants of
a similar table-land on the west of the Avon, while eastwards the
same character prevails up to Southampton Water. Sections parallel
with the coast show the level nature of the country, broken only by
well-defined river-valleys.   On the east of Southampton Water        a

72                       Geological Society : —
similar tabular   surface, sloping at a steeper angle towards the
shore-line, and cut through by the valleys of the Itchen, Hamble,
and Titchfield rivers remains ; and in the Isle of Wight the gravels
capping the flat-topped tertiary hills coincide with a corresponding
plain sloping northwards.
   The gravel covering these table-lands is composed chiefly of sub-
angular chalk-flints, with a varying proportion of tertiary pebbles.
Sarsen stone blocks are found everywhere ; and on Poole Heath
granitic pebbles, and in the gravel of Portsea large boulders of
granitic and palaeozoic rocks are met with. In the Isle of Wight,
chert from the Upper Greensand and materials from the Lower
Cretaceous beds also occur.      The colour of the gravel is generally
red; and the origin of the white gravel, which often overlies the
red, is to be ascribed to the bleaching action of vegetable matter.
Brick-earth is generally associated with the gravel at all levels but
the highest; but the contorted appearances attributed to glacial
action only occur at low levels.
   No organic remains have been found in the gravel covering the
plains, while the valley-gravels of the district have afforded mam
malian bones and teeth of the usual species.        Flint implements
have been found at Bournemouth at 120 feet above the sea, at Ly-
mington, near Southampton, at 80 and 150 feet, and also along the
shore between Southampton Water and Gosport, at 35 feet above
the sea, from gravel forming part of the covering of the tabular
surface, and unconnected with the river-valleys.
   The gravel capping the cliffs of the south coast of the Isle of
Wight, in which the remains of Elephas primigenius have been
found near Brook and Grange, was probably deposited in the same
river-basin as the mammaliferous gravel of Freshwater ; and the cut
ting back of the coast-line by the sea has given the tributaries of a
river which flowed by Freshwater northwards to the Solent a direct
outfall to the sea ; and the streams thus intercepted at a high level
under the changed condition of flow, have originated the Chines.
   The gravel cliff of the Foreland, at the eastern end of the Isle of
Wight, consists principally of raised shingle, which towards the
south thins out, and is overlain by a thick deposit of brick-earth, a
continuation of which caps the cliffs up to the chalk, and in which
a flint implement was found by the author at 85 feet above the
sea.
   General Considerations. — The marine gravel, with granite boul
ders covering the south of Sussex, is continued westward by the
gravel with similar boulders covering Portsea Island ; and this again
by the Hill-head gravels, with largo blocks of Sarsen stone, these
lower gravels being bordered on the south by the raised shingle de
posits of the Isle of Wight, and on the north by the higher marine
gravels of Avisford, Waterbeach, and Bourne, from which the lower
gravel is divided by a well-marked          step,  extending beyond
Portsdown Hill to Titchfield, and traceable on the west of South
ampton Water.       The Hill-head gravels are considered to be an
estuarine deposit, of the same age as the marine gravels of Sussex

The Rev.   J.   Gunn   on the Forest-bed   in Norfolk and Suffolk.   73
and the low -level gravels of the river- valleys ; they are supposed
to have been formed when the Isle of Wight was still joined to the
mainland, and all the rivers now reaching the sea by Poole Har
bour, Christehurch Harbour, Southampton Water, &c. were affluents
of a river communicating with an estuary opening to the sea in the
direction of Spithead.
   The gravels lying above the step, such as those of Avisford and
Waterbeach, Titchfield Common, Beaulieu Heath, and Bournemouth,
are looked upon as equivalent in position and age to the high-level
valley gravels.
    The level of the gravels on the highest parts of the table-lands
is such as to indicate an age far greater than that of the highest
gravels of the river-valleys ; but the uniform surface from the 400-
feet level downwards points to a long continuance of similar con
ditions, during which the gravel from the highest levels to that of
the Bournemouth cliffs was deposited.     The area that can with any
probability be assigned to the catchment-basin of a river such as
that which has been before alluded to, is only three quarters of the
basin of the Thames above Hampton, within which it is difficult to
imagine that such an extent of gravel could have been spread out ;
and the inclination of the flattest of the table-lands is for a river
such as only mountain-streams have, and quite incompatible with the
spreading out of large even surfaces more than twenty miles across.
    It is considered more probable that the materials of the gravel
were brought down from the chalk country on all sides by rivers,
 and spread out in an inlet of the sea shut in on the south, and open
 ing out eastwards. This view is not without difficulties : it involves
 a gradual upheaval of the land, which, when the highest gravels
now remaining were being spread out at or near the sea-level, must
 have stood more than 400 feet lower ; and a considerable part of
 this upheaval must have taken place since the formation of the
 gravel in which implements fashioned by man are imbedded.
   2. " On the relative position of the Forest-bed and the Chilles-
ford Clay in Norfolk and Suffolk, and on the real position of the
Forest-bed."    By the Eev. John Gunn, M.A., F.G.S.
   The author commenced by stating that both at Easton Bavent
and at Kessingland the Forest-bed is to be seen forming part of the
beach, or of the foot of the cliff, and underlying the Chillesford
Clay.   He con; 'dered that the soil of the Forest-bed had been depo
sited in an estuary, and that after its elevation the trees, of which
the stools are now visible along the coast, grew upon         it,
                                                               and the
true Forest-bed was formed. After the submergence of this, first
freshwater, then fluvio-marino, and finally marine deposits were
formed upon     it
                 ;and the author proposed to give the whole of these
deposits the name of the
                             " Forest-bed series." The author sug
gested that the Forest-bed itself    isrepresented inland by the stony
bed which lies immediately upon the chalk and between          and the
                                                               it
Fluvio-marine and Marine Crags, his theory being that the surface
of the Chalk, after supporting     a Forest-bed fauna, was gradually
covered up by successive Crag deposits.

  Limestone of Midderidge, Durham."          By Albany Hancock, Esq.,
  P.L.S., and Eichard Howse, Esq.
     The specimen described by the authors was remarkable for the
 great development of the ventral scutes, which were of large size,
 minutely striated, imbricated and arranged in diagonal lines, sloping
 from behind forward, giving the surface of the fossil a strongly
 ribbed appearance.     The authors stated that it was allied to Dasy-
 ceps and to Pholitlerpeton scutir/erum (Huxl.); but, from the pecu
 liar characters of its scutes, its elongated narrow muzzle, and some
 other peculiarities presented by the head, they regarded it as form
 ing the typo of a new genus, which they proposed to name Lepido-
 tosaurus.   The species they named L. Duffii, iu honour of its disco
 verer, Mr. Joseph Duff.
    4. " On Proterosaurus Speneri, von Meyer, and a new species,
 Proterosaurus Huxleyi, from the Marl-slate of Midderidge, Durham."
 By Albany Hancock, Esq., F.L.8., and Eichard Howse, Esq.
    In this paper the authors described a specimen which they referred
to Proterosaurus Speneri, von Meyer — and one of a smaller form,
which they regarded as new, and described as ProUrosaurus Hux
 leyi. Both were from the same part of the Marl-slate of Midde
ridge, Durham.      The two species agree in having the limbs and tail
long, and the neck long and composed of seven vertebrae, in the
 number of dorsal vertebrae, in the number and character of the bones
of the hand, and in some other particulars, sufficient, with these, in
the opinion of the authors, to justify the reference of both to the
genus Proterosaurus.      In P. Huxleyi tho ribs are flattened instead
of rounded at the proximal extremity, and less widened and grooved
at the distal extremity than in P. Speneri ; the hind limb is consi
derably longer in proportion to the fore limb ; and the distal extre
mity of tho humerus is only twice as wide as the constricted part,
instead of three times, as in the old species.

    1. " Notes on tho Lower portion of the Green-slates and Porphyries
of the Lake District between Ulleswater and Keswick."              By H.
Alleyno Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc., M.A., F.E.S.E., F.G.S., Lecturer on
Natural History in the Medical School of Edinburgh.
    The author describes the characters presented by the lower part
of that series of rocks, named by Professor Sedgwick the " Green-
slates and Porphyries," which overlie the Skiddaw Slates in the
Lake District.     Ho notices the sections of this series in Borrowdale,
on the east sido of Dcrwentwatcr, between Keswick and the Yale of
St. John, in the Yale of St. John, in Matterdale, in Eycott Hill,
between Ulleswater and Haweswater, and in the neighbourhood of
Shap. In tho Borrowdale section the sequence of tho rocks is given
by the author as follows. Resting on the Skiddaw slates there are : —
(1) a felspathic trap ; (2) a great series of ashes, breccias, and amyg

Mr.    J. "VV.  Hulke   on some   Plesiosaurian Remains from Dorset.      75
daloida, often showing slaty cleavage and worked as slates, but with
several intercalated bands of trap ; and (3) a second trap.            This
appears to be a normal section, and is repeated, but diversified by
the results of folding and faults, in the other localities described by
the author, except that in the Vale of St. John the true slaty series
seems to be entirely wanting.
    2. "Observations        on some Vegetable Fossils from Victoria."
By    Dr.  Ferdinand    von  Miiller and E. Brough Smyth, Esq., F.G.8.
    Mr. Smyth stated that the fossils, of which specimens were for
warded by him, were obtained in one of the deep leads at Haddon, near
Smythesdale. No leaves have been obtained from the bed, which
consists of a greyish-black clay ; the fruits and seed-vessels were
obtained about 180 feet from the surface, and represent a flora not
very dissimilar to that now characterizing some parts of Queensland.
The specimens sent include the fruits of a supposed new genus of
Coniterae, described by Dr. von Miiller under the name of Spondy-
lostrobug.     It is most nearly allied to Solmostrolus, Bowerbank ; but
its five valves are not keeled.        The columella forms the main body
 of the fruit ; and the seeds are apparently solitary.      The species was
 named Spondylostrobus Smythii.          The remaining specimens consisted
 of: — a solitary fruit of a genus of Verbenaceae ; an indehiscent com
pressed fruit, probably belonging to the proteaceous genus Helicia ;
 a nut nearly allied to the preceding ; a large, spherical, unilocular,
 3-seeded nut with a thick pericarp, perhaps from a Capparideous
 plant ; a 5-valved capsule of an unknown genus ; and fruit- valves
 of three other plants, probably belonging to the Sapindacese, and
 perhaps allied to Cupania.           One of the last may belong to the
 Meliaceous genus Dyspxylon.             Dr. Miiller considered that these
 remains indicate a former flora analogous to that of the existing
 forest-belt of Eastern Australia.
     3.  " Note    on  some   Plesiosaurian   Eemains   obtained by    J.  C.
 Mansel, Esq., F.G.S., in Kimmeiidge Bay, Dorset.           By J. W. Hulke,
 Esq., F.E.S., F.G.S.
     The remains described in this Note represent two new species of
 Plesiosaurus.       The dorsal vertebra of the first species are distin
 guished by extremely short contra, with hollow articular faces.
 The antero-posterior diameter of 4 centra ranges between 1 and 1-3
 inch, the transverse horizontal diameter between 4 and 4-6, and the
 vertical between 3-8 and 4 inches. For this Plesiosaur the author
 proposes the specific name of P. brachistospondylus.
     The other species, of which the greater part of the spinal column
  and portions of the breast and pelvic girdles and limbs are pre
  served, is a long slender-necked Plesiosaur exceeding 16 feet in
 length.      Its limbs are much larger in proportion to the whole length
 than in the typical Liass:c forms of this genus ; but what particularly
  distinguishes it from these are the massiveness of the humerus and
  femur, the larger size of the wing-like expansion of the postaxial
 border, a well-developed trochanter, and especially three articular

76                        Geological Society:  —
facets at the distal end of the femur, corresponding to which the
 second segment of the paddle, representing the leg, contains three
 coequal bones.     The author noticed the impression of a third bone
in this segment in the matrix in which a paddle of Pliosaurus port-
 landicus is imbedded, and the ossicle on the postaxial border of the
fibula in Plesiosaurus rugosus.        He compared the paddle-bones of
the Kimmeridge Plesiosaurus with those of Ichthyosauri and of the
Liassic Plesiosaurs and of Pliosaurus ; he drew attention to the very
close resemblance of the humerus and femur to type specimens of the
femora of Pliosaurus brachydeinis and P. trochanterius in the British
Museum, and traced a similar resemblance between the elements of
the cnemion and tarsus and those of the Dorchester and Portland
Pliosaurian paddles.       For this creature, combining a long, truly Ple-
siosaurian neck    with  Pliosaurian-like   limbs, the author proposed the
name of Plesiosaurus Manselii.
    4.  " Notes  on the Geology of the Lofoten Islands."          By T. G.
Bonuey, M.A., F.G.S., Tutor of St. John's College, Cambridge.
   The author described the general appearance of the Lofoten
Islands, which have commonly been described as composed of gra
nite, but which, he stated, really consist of gneissic rocks. Tho
scenery of some of the islands, on which he did not land, resembled
that of the Cambrian and Cambro- Silurian districts of Wales and
Cumberland ; and the interior of Hassel showed dark rounded fells,
resembling in outline some of the softer Welsh slates.           At Stok-
marknaes and at Melbo there is a granitoid rock of pinkish-grey
colour, consisting of felspar and platy hornblende, with some mica
and quartz.      The Svolvaer Fjeld in Ost Yaago shows a distinctly
bedded structure in the cliffs near Svolvaer, the debris at the foot of
which consist of a rock resembling syenite, and a quartzite contain
ing a little hornblende and felspar. Bedding was also observed
towards the Oxnses Fjord. The islets near this coast consisted
chiefly of a granitoid rock resembling a syenite, showing traces of
bedding to the west of Svolvaer.        Seams and veins of quartz, horn
blende,   &c. occurred    in  some  of the islets ; and these were some
times   too regular  to  be explained by deposition in fissures.      Near
the   Svolvaer  post-office there was gneiss coarsely foliated, containing
hornblende and mica, with pink orthoclase felspar.             Tho author
concluded, from his observations, that, with few exc3ptions, the so-
called granites of the Lofoten Islands are stratified, highly meta
morphosed rocks, quartzites, and gneiss, generally with much fel
spar in the latter, and with more or less hornblende in both, and
that they are inferior in position to the gneiss and schists of tho
mainland, and to the more slaty rocks of the southern and western
parts of tho same islands.         He compares them with some gneiss
from Dalbcg on the west coast of the island of Lewis.
   5.  "  On Dorypterus Hofmanni, Germar, from tho Marl-slate of
Midderidge, Durham."           By Albany Hancock, Esq., F.L.S., and
Richard Howse, Esq.
   The material for this paper consisted of four specimens of Do

Staff Commander      J. II.  Kerr on  Icemarksin Newfoundland.       77
rypterus Hofmanni, which have been discovered by Joseph. Duff,
Esq., in the marl-slate of Middcridge, and are believed to be the
first examples of this Fish which have been obtained in this country.
The stratum from which they were procured is the same as that
described by Prof. Sedgwick in his paper published in the Trans
actions of this Society (2nd series, vol. iii. pp. 76-77). The spe
cimens show that the " ribbon-shaped " process mentioned by
Gennar is part of a peculiar exoskeleton, and that Dorypterus pos
sessed ventral fins, which were situated in front of the pectorals,
or "jugular."       Hitherto no fishes with ventral fins other than
" abdominal " in position have been known to occur earlier than the
Cretaceous   epoch.     The tail is heterocercal, not homocercal as
Gennar supposed.       The dentition is not displayed in any of the
specimens, and the teeth were probably small and inconspicuous ;
but the general structure of the fish shows it to be most nearly
allied to the Pycnodonts.
    6. " Observations on Ice-marks in Newfoundland."           By Staff
Commander J. H. Kerr, E.N., F.R.G.S.
    The author describes and tabulates the grooves and scratches
observed by him on rock-surfaces in various parts of Newfoundland,
especially Conception Bay, the neighbourhood of St. John's, and the
north of Bonavista Bay.      From the diversity of the direction of the
markings and other considerations, he considers that they must have
been produced by glaciers, and he believes that the main features of
the country were much the same as at present before the glaciation
took place.    The author thinks that the land has not been sub
merged since it was freed from its coating of ice.

    The author described the general form of the ground and the pre-
glacial condition and glacial deposits of the districts of Wirral and
Western Lancashire, and draws from his observations the following
general conclusions. That before and at the commencement of the
glacial epoch the north-west of England was more elevated above
the sea-level than at present, but afterwards gradually subsided,
during which process marine denudation produced the plains of
Wirral and Western Lancashire.        Part of the latter has since been
covered with glacial deposits 200 feet thick.     The valleys running
in the strike of the Triassic strata appear to have been formed by
subaerial agencies.    It is probable that when the glacial epoch com
menced the hilly country was covered with immense glaciers, or
with an ice-sheet, which, as the land sunk, reached the sea. The
High-level Lower Boulder-day was probably produced by this land-
ice. The land continued subsiding until it stood 100 feet lower
than at present, submerging the lowlands of Lancashire and Che
shire to a depth of rather less than 2o fathoms, the coast-line being
surrounded by an ice-foot, which received on its surface quantities
of pebbles and boulders from the lake-district.          These, on the

 78                       Geological Society.
 breaking up of the ice-foot, were spread over the lowlands, forming
 the Low-level Lower Boulder-clay.     The climate then improved, al
 though subsidence still continued, and the sandy and gravelly de
 posits of the middle drift were produced — these deposits, at whatever
 elevation they occur, having been found in shallow water during
the constant subsidence of the coast-lino. The surface of the middle
Drift shows traces of what seems to have been subaerial erosion,
leading to the supposition that the land must have risen and suffered
denudation before that depression during which the Upper Boulder-
clay was deposited, at which period the climate again became ex
tremely cold, and fresh glaciers were formed. Before the elevation
of the Upper Boulder-clay the climate was greatly ameliorated.
    8. " On the Preglacial Deposits of Western Lancashire and Che
shire."    By C. E. De Eance, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author believed that after the deposition of the Esker Drift
the country rose to from 200 to 300 feet higher than at present ;
but in the course of this elevation there was a pause, during which
denudation took place, and the low plains, now covered with peat
moss, came into existence.      From the consideration of the present
depths of the channel between Great Britain and Ireland, the
author inferred that an elevation of 200 feet would have caused
the coast-line to run from the Mull of Galloway to St. David's Head j
and Ireland would have been so connected with Wales as to render
possible the migration of mammals, plants, and of man himself.
Glaciers probably still persisted in the lake-district during the whole
of this period of elevation.        During a subsequent subsidence
drainage became greatly obstructed, peat was formed, the sea en
croached upon the land and worked its way eastward over the sea-
bottom of postglacial times, a movement yet in progress.      Here and
there sand has begun to blow, forming dunes.

Rev. W. Bleasdell, M.A., Rector of Trenton.
    The author described some phenomena of ice-transport observed
in Canada, especially those produced by the flood, anchor, or pack-ice
produced in the rapids of the Canadian rivers.        To this he attri
buted the entire disappearance      of Crab Island in the River St.
Lawrence, near Cornwall.      This island occupied about an acre and
a half within the memory of men now living ; it has now entirely
disappeared, and the water above it is gradually deepening.         The
island, according to the author, has been carried away piecemeal by
the action of miniature icebergs, floated off by a rise in the water
produced by a dam of anchor-ice below.

            ON THE SPECTRUM OF THE AURORA BOREALI8.
                          BY JOHN BROWNING, ESQ.
               the display of the Aurora Borealis which occurred on the
DURING evenings   of the 24th and 25th of October, I confined my atten
tion to observing the spectra of the light, taking it in different parts
of the sky. When the spectroscope was directed to the more lumi
nous portions, which were generally of a silvery white, the spectrum
appeared to me to consist of only one line.                 I could not succeed in
Terifying the position     of  this line  ;  but   it   appeared to be situated be
tween   D  and  E  in  the  spectrum.         When       observing the light of the
red portions of    the   sky, a   faint  red    line     became  visible. I had no
means of verifying      the  position   of   these    lines with  any degree of ex
actitude ; but   I  was able to throw into the field of view a faint con
tinuous spectrum from a distant light, and also the bright yellow
sodium-line produced by a spirit-lamp.
   The colour of the green line was very peculiar ; had I not bee
able to observe it by comparison,           I  could not have formed any idea
of its position. It was an exceedingly light silvery green, or greenish
grey, and often seemed to flicker.                Besides the two lines I have
particularly described,      I  occasionally suspected others, one in the
red and one in the blue ; but I could not be at all sure of this. The
colour of the light of the aurora seen over the greater portion of the
heavens resembled exactly that of the discharge of electricity from
an induction-coil through a vacuum formed from atmospheric air. —

 NOTE ON THE USE OF EYE-SCREENS IN TELESCOPIC AND OTHER
            RESEARCHES.           BY RICHARD A. PROCTOR, B.A.
   Most observers with the telescope keep the unemployed eye open
while studying with the other the features of an object in the tele
scopic field of view.      Closing the unemployed eye produces, in fact,
palpably injurious effects.         But I suppose every one must have no
ticed how much better the features of a faint object are seen, when
with the hand or any screen the unemployed eye is protected,
even though it be only from the luminosity of the star-lit sky.               I find
that much better results are obtained when the unemployed eye is
guarded from the access of all light whatever by a screen lined with
black velvet.     Yet better vision is secured if the screen is so con
trived as to guard the employed eye also from all light except what
reaches it from the object.         This can easily be managed by having
a screen covering both eyes, but with sliding doors, by which a
small circular aperture opposite either eye can be opened or shut
at will.    Each aperture can have outside it a small tube passing
over the eye-tube of the telescope.               Or (preferably for some pur
poses) a small sleeve-curtain with an elastic circular opening at one
end can be attached at the other over either eye-aperture.                  Then if

80                Intelligence and Miscellaneous  Articles.
 the opening be passed over the eye-tube and suffered to close by its
 elasticity, the desired result will be secured.
    From my own experience I feel confident that, for certain special
 orders of research, the use of eye-screens of this sort (the details
 being arranged according to convenience) will be found of great
 service.     I may particularize observation on moonlit nights, the
 examination of faint nebulae or the search for them, the search for
minute points of light, delicate spectroscopic and polariscopic re
searches, and the investigation of questions concerning the colours
of the planets, of the lunar regions, &c. The following description
of the modus operandi will serve to supplement the above general
sketch. The equatorial being set on any delicate object, the ob
server fastens the screen over his eyes, attaches the sleeve-curtain
over the eye he proposes to work with, slides the elastic ring over
the eye-tube, and suffers it to close round that tube.      Having seen
that the object is in the field and the rate of driving just, he closes
both the eye-doors, keeping his eyes open and directed on the per
fect blackness of the velvet lining. When he thinks the eye suffici
ently prepared, he draws out the sliding eye-door over the telescope-
eye, and is then able to apply the full powers of his eyesight (under
exceptionally favourable conditions) to the examination of the object
he has to deal with,
    I am desirous of learning how far the efficiency of such contri
vances depends on aperture — that is, whether the performance of
large telescopes is as much improved as that of smaller instruments.
If any Fellows of the Society should care to experiment on this
matter (which is not unimportant, I conceive), they would be confer
ring a favour on me by communicating the results they may obtain.
I refer here simply to the comparison between the work of a telescope
used in the ordinary way and when supplemented by eye-screens.
    I may renew here my suggestion of the great importance of ap
plying such contrivances during the examination of the corona in
total solar eclipses, whether with the telescope, spectroscope, or
polariscope.      As regards the spectroscopic analysis of the corona,
any method by which the visibility of a very faint continuous spec
trum can be increased (and I imagine that eye-screens such as I have
proposed would have such an effect) cannot but be well worth
trying.     It seems highly probable that the variations in the accounts
given so far depend wholly on the amount of opening in the slit — a
narrow slit giving a very faint continuous spectrum and three some
what brighter lines (one can scarcely speak of bright lines in this
case), which are under these circumstances very difficult and delicate
objects of observation ; a somewhat wider opening gives a continu
ous spectrum, bright enough to obliterate two of the lines, but leav
ing one (the one Professor Harkness saw) fairly visible ; a wider
opening shows only a continuous spectrum, the lines being all ob
literated.     This at least is the explanation which seems alone con
sistent with the principles of spectroscopic analysis ; and it is ob
vious that, if it be just, any increase in the eye's power of apprecia
ting faint light must be a great gain. — Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical Society, November II, 1870.

                     [By JOHN BALL, F.R.S.*
                been absent from England,      I have but lately seen
HAVING   the interesting paper  by Mr. James Croll in the last vo
lume of this Journal, wherein, continuing the discussion respect
ing the theory of glacier-motion put forth by the llev. H. 'Moseley,
he has done me the honour of replying to the remarks made by
me on the same subject in July last, and at the same time has
developed rather more fully the views previously published by
himself, which may for brevity be designated the molecular theory
of glacier-motion.
   I must, in the first place, confess that, in the few pages pub
lished in this Journal for last July,      I gave a very incomplete
statement of my own opinions in regard to the cause of the mo
tion of glaciers.     My object was to state very briefly what
seemed to me insurmountable objections to the arguments used
                                                        I
by Mr. Moseley ; and even in this respect I fear that have failed
to express myself with the requisite fulness and precision.         I
now beg permission partially to supply the deficiency, and at the
same time to explain why I think it unnecessary to supplement
the received theory of glacier-motion by a hypothetical assump
tion as to the molecular condition of the ice in a moving glacier,
and to what extent I think that theory does require modification.
   I am happy to find myself in full agreement with Mr. Croll
                           " crawling "
respecting the so-called                  theory of Mr. Moseley, of

82        Mr. J. Ball on the Cause   of the Motion of Glaciers.
facts of glacier-motion.    The point for discussion is whether the
ordinary theory, which affirms that a glacier descends by its weight
through the processes of fracture and regelation, has been over
thrown by the arguments and observations opposed to it by Mr.
Moseley. Mr. Croll admits the force of some of the objections
urged by me to the views of Canon Moseley, but nevertheless
 retains the opinion already expressed by him in March 1869,
that " Canon Moseley has successfully shown the insufficiency of
the generally received theory of the descent of glaciers."
    It is known to all who have followed the controversy, that the
argument against the received theory depends upon observations
made by Mr. Moseley on the shearing-force of ice, determined
by the weight or pressure requisite to shear a square inch of
that substance.                          I
                    In my last paper sought indirectly to show
 that these observations were inapplicable, because the physical
fact which Mr. Moseley had in view is not the same, but totally
different from that which obtains in a moving glacier.          It will
perhaps be simpler to say that     I  demur altogether to the use of
the term shearing-force until its meaning is accurately defined,
and is shown to be appropriate to the argument to which it is ap
plied. In some substances the amount of resistance opposed to
the separation of adjoining particles is nearly independent of
temperature, and of the time during which the pressure is applied.
In other bodies which oppose a very considerable resistance to
fracture, the particles gradually change their relative positions
under the prolonged action of even slight pressure ; and in some
of them the amount of change depends very much on their tem
perature while exposed to pressure.        If we are to use the same
term for every process by which the particles of solid bodies
change their relative positions, whether by actual fracture or by
more or less slow rearrangement, we shall merely introduce con
fusion into our physical conceptions.        What, to take a familiar
instance, is the unit of shear of ordinary sealing-wax ? Measured
by the method employed by Mr. Moseley, it would be repre
sented by a considerable weight, which would not vary very
much within the ordinary range of temperature in our rooms.
 His argument would apply at least as well to show that a glacier
of sealing-wax at, say, 20° below its point of fusion could not
descend from the mountains into the valleys, though it most
certainly would do so far more rapidly than our ice-glaciers do.
    I  must be allowed to remind Mr. Croll that the utmost
amount of relative displacement of the particles of ice in a
moving glacier amounts to a difference of the sixteenth part of a
line in twenty-four hours between the motion of two points
one inch apart.    If any one will make careful observations to
ascertain the pressure necessary to produce that amount of dis

         Mr.  J. Ball ort the Cause   of the Motion of Glaciers.      83
 placement in glacier-ice, not in compact ice from our ponds, he
 will have ascertained a fact that is at least prima facie applicable
 to the consideration of the cause of glacier-motion ; but as in
 the present state of our knowledge the observations of Mr.
 Moseley do not contribute in the slightest degree to determine
 the amount of that pressure,     I must continue to deny the cogency
 of the argument derived from them.           I shall presently endea
 vour to show that the determination of the unknown force in
 question would by no means conclude the controversy, even
 though the resistance were much greater than the force of gra
vity acting on a given section of the glacier-mass ; but          I wish
to make a further preliminary remark on thia portion of the
subject.
    Mr. Croll explicitly admits that Mr. Moseley's argument is
 defective, inasmuch    as he takes no account      of the time during
 which   a given  pressure    must be applied in order to shear ad
joining surfaces of ice    ; and,  in accordance with the views which
 he holds as to the molecular action of heat upon ice, he assumes
 that the reason why time enters as a condition into the pheno
 menon is that it is necessary for the communication             of heat,
 and enters as a condition merely so far as it determines the
 quantity of heat received.       Reasoning on this basis, Mr. Croll
 argues that, inasmuch as     in Canon Moseley's experiments the re
 sults obtained were due to pressure plus a certain small amount
 of heat, if they had been obtained with less pressure acting for
 a longer time, they would have been the result of a greater
 amount of heat combined with the pressure.          The unit of shear
  determined by Canon Moseley is certainly not too large. Having
 concluded from these premises that the existing theory has been
 overthrown by Canon Moseley's objections, Mr. Croll introduces
  his own very ingenious views as to the molecular effects of the
 propagation of heat through ice as affording the only possible
 explanation of the phenomena of glacier-motion.
     With the most sincere respect for Mr. Croll's acuteness and
 the usual accuracy of his reasoning, I think that on this occa
 sion there is an obvious begging of the question, in first assu
 ming that his molecular hypothesis is alone capable of account
 ing for the fact that the effect of pressure upon some bodies
 largely depends upon the time during which it acts, and then
 arguing from this fact to show that it is necessary to admit the
 truth of the hypothesis.      There is a large class of bodies which
 are capable of changing their molecular condition and becom
 ing fluid by the application of heat, but which are also capable
  of modifying their form, or undergoing changes in the relative
 positions of. their particles at temperatures very much below
 their melting-point.      Is Mr. Croll prepared to maintain that in

84      Mr. J. Ball   on the Cause  of the Motion of Glaciers.
every such instance the motion is to be accounted for only by
supposing conversion into the fluid form of the particles at the
moment when they are changing their relative positions ? Or if
not, why should he imagine that a special hypothesis is neces
sary in regard to ice ?                I
                             So far as know, the fact that ice will
change its form under moderate pressure without fracture at a
temperature notably below its melting-point was, for the first
time, established by the experiment published by Mr. W.
                                           '
Mathews in the Number of ' Nature for the 24th of March
last.    In ascertaining that a thick plank of ice supported at both
ends subsided about 1| inch in twenty-four hours, during a
 sharp frost, under the pressure of its own weight alone, Mr.
Mathews did not disclose a fact which ought to excite surprise.
So far from being anomalous, this property of ice is in full ac
cordance with what we know of the behaviour of other similar
bodies.     I am, however, at a loss to understand whether Mr.
 Croll maintains that the fact can be accounted for only by assu
ming that each molecule of the ice momentarily became fluid as
it shifted its relative position so as to allow of the bending of the
ice.    If this occurs when the temperature is considerably below
the freezing-point, the so-called molecular hypothesis cannot
 stop here.     It must be extended to all bodies which are capable
 of changing their form under pressure without fracture at tem
 peratures below that of liquefaction.        If, on the other hand,
 Mr. Croll does not consider his hypothesis to be applicable to
the case in question,    I  must ask why he holds it to be requisite
in the case of a glacier, where the amount of relative disturbance
of the particles is very much less than in the experiment of Mr.
Mathews.
    I  would especially beg Mr. Croll to consider the many
grounds, both theoretical and experimental, on which we are
led to hold that the temperature of the interior of great glaciers
is very nearly, if not absolutely, constant, and how impossible it is
to hold that their advance can be dependent on the passage
through their mass of any sensible quantity of heat such as
could effect the molecular changes which he contemplates.
    If the molecular theory of Mr. Croll is no longer to be ap
 plied specially to the conduct of ice under pressure, but is ex
tended generally to all, or most, plastic bodies that yield slowly
to pressure, I shall merely say that it appears to me to lack an
tecedent probability, and to be at least premature.        In spite of
recent progress, our knowledge of the molecular constitution of
matter is yet far too imperfect to enable us to reason with any
confidence on the general question raised by Mr. Croll.        Should
he be induced to follow up the inquiry, it may in the hands of
so acute a thinker lead to important results; but in the mean

         Mr.   J. Ball   on the Cause   of the Motion of Glaciers.     85
    time, so long as the phenomena exhibited by ice are strictly
   analogous to those offered by other substances of the same class,
 I     shall not think that any special hypothesis is required for their
   explanation.
        In cpnclusion I venture to state the explanation of the cause
   of glacier-motion which appears tome to be best consistent with
   the facts, and which    I   am content to submit to those who are
   familiar with the phenomena, without entering into detailed ar
   guments, already well-known to those who have attended to the
   subject, and which could not be fully set forth without infrin
   ging unduly on the space accorded to me.
                               I
        In the first place, must dwell for a moment on the fact,
  familiar yet constantly forgotten, that glacier-ice is a very differ
  ent substance from the ice that is formed in winter on the sur
  face of lakes and rivers.        However slight the external indica
  tions of the fact may be, it is a congeries of separate fragments
  more or less perfectly welded together, but not possessing a
  uniform or common crystalline structure, and showing by the
  frequent presence of air-bubbles, and by its behaviour when ex
  posed to radiant heat, an inferior degree of solidity.           On this
  account I objected to Mr. Moseley's experiments on shearing-
 force, because I held them to be inapplicable to glacier-ice; and
I     further hold that, if the most careful experimenter were to
 determine the shearing-force of a given square inch of glacier-
 ice, it would be unsafe to conclude that the resistance offered by
 an adjoining square inch, or a number of other equal sections of
 the glacier, would be found nearly equal.
     I    further note, as an essential characteristic of the great
 glaciers whose onward motion is rapid, that they are traversed
 by fissures often of great width, and of depth great even rela
 tively to the dimensions of the glacier.
       Finally, I consider it to be an established fact that all consider
 able glaciers, even those of the second order when they lie below
 what is called the snow-line, have a fixed internal temperature
 of 32° Fahr., from which they never vary by more than a mi
 nute fraction, and that the influence of the seasons, still more
that of day and night, penetrates but a very moderate distance
from their exterior surfaces.
      Glacier-ice is a substance which at the temperature of freezing
is capable of yielding, very slowly, to moderate pressure.              A
portion of the motion of all glaciers, and the whole, or nearly
the whole, of the motion of glaciers of the second order .(that is
to say, of those which lie on the slopes of mountains, but do not
fill a definite trough or valley-channel) is due to this cause, and
is effected independently of fracture and regelation       (ifthe former

    86        Mr.   J. Ball   on the Cause     of the Motion of               Glaciers,
    term is limited to disruption of a sensible or measurable amount*).
    In the larger glaciers, and especially those which lie in a deep
    trough and whose bed is very irregular, a new phenomenon
.   comes into play.         Glacier-ice, though imperfectly solidified, is
    yet rigid enough to transmit very considerable pressures ; but
    there is a limit at which pressure upon ice at 32° F. has the
    effect of reducing it to the liquid state.        At any given moment
    of the progress      of a great glacier, especially in summer, certain
    points are subjected to enormous pressure.                A given square
    inch in the section of the glacier, instead of sustaining, as
    Mr. Moseley assumes, merely the pressure of a parallelepiped
    of equal section lying behind              it,
                                              may at    given moment have
                                                                 a
    to bear the pressure due to mass hundred or thousand times
                                         a           a                    a
    as great in section.       The effect may either be that fracture en

    regular channel than in one of uniform width and slope — because
    in the former case the irregular distribution of pressure more
    surely determines the yielding of the mass at one point, and
    thus leads to the transference of the maximum pressure through
    out many successive points.

  the views of Mr. Croll, if he admits, as      I think all must admit,
  that the temperature of the interior of the glacier is constant ;
  and especially when it is coupled with the other fact, that a gla
  cier continues to advance in winter, even at times when, owing
  to the absence of a snow covering, the temperature of the su
 perficial stratum is considerably below the freezing-point.
     Admitting that other causes, and especially the infiltration
 of surface-water, may have a small share in the result, I think
 the main point to be considered is this : the condition of the
 glacier is such that,  if we consider the superficial stratum to be
 absolutely   neutral— or,  in other words, that the forces acting on it
 are such as to make it move exactly at the same rate as the next
 underlying portion —a certain not inconsiderable rate of motion
 is attained.    In such a state of things let a change take place
 in the condition of the superficial stratum by which the forces
 that resist its onward movement are very much diminished ; it
 is obvious that by its weight and by the cohesion existing be
 tween it and the remainder of the mass, this will tend to drag
 the lower portion forward.       As far as we can judge of the nature
 of plastic bodies, it would appear that the resistance which they
offer to change of form diminishes in a ratio far more rapid than
 the increase of pressure.     Their molecular condition is in a state
of unstable equilibrium : at a given moment certain pressures
 are balanced by certain resistances ; but a slight increment of
pressure may overcome the resistance and cause change in the
relative position of the particles.      This, as   I believe, is the true
explanation of the effect of warm weather on advancing glaciers ;
find the effect is aided by the fact that through open crevasses
the heat often penetrates partially into the interior.        Conversely,
winter cold increases to a slight extent the resistance to the on
ward motion of a glacier, by making the superficial stratum
rather less ready to yield than the interior of the glacier, so that
the rate of advance is then reduced somewhat below what may be
termed its normal velocity, namely that which it would obtain if
the influence of the superficial stratum were absolutely removed.

    of certain Cornish Rocks. By       J.  ARTHUR PIIILLIPS, F.C.S.,

THE      sisting of
                     " killas" a name applied by Cornish miners
to all sedimentary cleavable rocks.         It is difficult to determine
the geological age of these, further than that they belong to the
palaeozoic era ; and it is believed, from the rare and imperfectly
                   * Communicated    by the Author.

88       Mr. J. A. Phillips   on the Cliemical    Composition and
preserved fossils which have been discovered, that the majority
of them are of Devonian age.
    This extensive region of sedimentary rocks encloses five large
and several smaller masses of granite, which, without rising
very prominently above the common level, protrude as "islands
of granite out of a sea of slate *.
                                    "
    Both the slates and granites of this portion of Great Britain
are traversed by numerous dykes of granitic and porphyritic
rock called ekam, by occasional trap-dykes, by numerous copper
and tin lodes, and by various cross-courses and jlucans, the latter
being fissures filled with clay.
    This formation is characteristic, not only of the whole of
Cornwall, but also of a large portion of Devonshire. ^Masses of
serpentine occur in various localities in this district, particu
larly in the south-western portion of Cornwall, in the vicinity of
the Lizard Point.
    Typical killas is a clay-slate, often of a grey, bluish-grey, or
greenish-grey colour, and frequently acquires a brownish-yellow
or buff tint, from weathering : its colour, however, varies very
considerably in different localities, besides which it is not unfre-
quently stained by dendritic markings of oxide of iron and
other minerals.       It is usually exceedingly fissile, the planes of
fracture being very commonly much contorted, and presenting
smooth unctuous surfaces, not unlike those of faults or fissures
called slickemides, and apparently produced by friction : killas is
often more compact near its junction with the granite than else
where, and in such localities, without any well-defined line of
demarcation, frequently encloses numerous subordinate layers of
granular or semi-crystalline rocks.
    Professor John Phillips remarks, with regard to these depo
sits, " The general impression concerning the schistose rocks of
 Cornwall is that their mineral composition is a mixture of quartz,
felspar, and mica, and so probably is that of most clays and
shales ;'t-     He further observes, " It is hazardous to reason on
phenomena so remarkable as those of Cornwall without refe
rence to other districts.        Nothing but prejudice or indolence
will permit geologists acquainted with other districts to neglect
the singular and curious facts connected with the Devonshire
and Cornish chain.          We may freely admit that they in some
 cases point to agencies not yet familiar to our philosophy ; that

          Microscopic Constitution of certain Cornish Rocks*             89
serpentines and killas, and of the disseminated and venigenous
minerals in them, will kindle a brilliant light in the most secret
laboratory of nature ; but one thing is wanting, an exact de
scription of all the characteristic facts observable, in each particular
case, without the adornments of theory or the disarray of new
nomenclature "*.         Since the foregoing was written (now fifteen
years ago) but little has been done with the view of elucidating
the composition        and constitution of Cornish rocksf.            It is
therefore hoped that the following results of a series of careful
analyses, and of numerous microscopical examinations, may be
of some value as a small instalment of that mass of exact infor
mation so necessary to a more accurate knowledge of the petrology
of one of our most important mining districts.
   The methods which have been employed in conducting the
various analyses will be found fully described at the end of this
paper; and with regard to the sections for microscopical exami
nation, it may be observed that they have been prepared in the
usual way, but that the softer varieties of killas require exceed
ingly careful manipulation.            In the case of the more fissile
specimens,     it was  often   found    very difficult to obtain satisfac
tory   sections   at right angles     to the cleavage-planes ; and even
when procured, great care was required in mounting, to prevent
their entire disintegration in the balsam employed for that pur
pose.     Each section was examined by the aid of two different
arrangements of the instrument.               The first, spoken of as "a
low power," magnified 60, and the second, mentioned as "a
high power," about 400 linear.             The polariscope could be con
veniently     used  with  both.    Higher powers were sometimes, but
not often, employed.

     Thin sections of this slate, when examined by transmitted
 light under a low power, exhibit no decided evidence of struc
 ture, but appear aa a milky-white mass in which arc dissemi
 nated numerous moss-like semi-crystalline markings of a brown
 ish-green colour. They are also observed to be traversed by
 various fissures, which have become filled by crystalline transpa
 rent quartz. When examined by the aid of a high power, this
 rock is found to be composed of an aggregate of minute granules
 intimately blended together and without definite outlines. There
 are also some grains of oxide of iron and other dark markings
 hot sufficiently opaque for this substance ; some of these are ap
parently fragments of hornblende, whilst others are probably
patches of a chloritic mineral.
     This slate has in fact undergone so great a change, that the
individual grains, of which it was originally composed, can only
be made out by means of the polariscope.             When the prisms are
crossed, the mass breaks up into a kind of shadowy mosaic of
light and dark or variously coloured patches without definite
outlines.

    When microscopically examined,            this    rock does   not differ ma
terially from that obtained nearer the surface, excepting that the
grains of oxide of iron are larger but less numerous, and that it
contains fewer of what appear to be broken crystals of a horn-
blendic mineral. The granular fragments of which it is composed
are also larger and more distinct than in the former case ; and on
examination of transverse sections it becomes evident that, in the
majority of instances, their larger surfaces are nearly parallel
with the planes of cleavage of the slatef.               The chloritic mineral,
mentioned as occurring in killas from the adit-level, is also very
abundant ; and about the margin of many of the patches of this
substance peculiar markings are observed.                   These, which may
perhaps be the result of forces producing cleavage, will be more
fully noticed when describing the appearance of sections of clay-

This, in common with many other Cornish slates lying above the
natural drainage-level of the country, is very light in colour, the
prevailing tints being light grey and buff, and bears the appear
ance of weathering.        It adheres strongly to the tongue, has a
decidedly clayey      smell   when freshly broken, and divides with
difficulty into laminae, of which the surfaces are entirely without
polish. Its specific gravity is low ; and it is divided by headings
variously coloured, apparently by infiltration of Water containing
oxide of iron.

 rock are     seen to be chiefly made up        of an aggregation of trans
 parent angular particles, giving           colours   with polarized light;
 disseminated throughout the mass are numerous shades and
 patches of a greenish colour, which are probably due to chlorite.
 Under a high power they are found to contain many black grains
 of magnetite and titaniferous iron, together with fan-like aggre
gations of transparent acicula* crystals, which often diverge
from a particle of oxide of iron as a centre.
    Besides these radiated combinations, there are other appa
rently similar crystals, which cross each other in all directions ;
these, as well as the former, are probably either hornblende or
schorl.      There are also some broken and- rounded fragments of
mica and of a semi-translucent mineral, which is not sufficiently
opaque for oxide of iron j these-last are mechanically embedded

    This slate, under a low power, does foot show any distinct
structure, but is seen to be thickly dotted with dark spots.
When examined by the help of a high power its structure still
remains indistinct, but numerous clusters, about T()3or> of an inch
in diameter, of reddish-brown crystals become distinctly apparent.
They are generally opaque ; but some of them, which have been
ground very thin during the preparation of the sections, appear
to result from the aggregation of several hexagonal plates : these
 crystals are probably micaceous ironf.
    In addition to the crystalline nodules above referred to, the
matrix of this slate is traversed in all directions, but chiefly lying
in planes parallel with the cleavage, by long transparent crystals
   * Of which "35 was lost in the water-bath.
   t Having been uiiable to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion with regard
to the exact nature of the dark crystalline bodies occurring in this rock, I
forwarded a section to Mr. II. C. Sorby, F.R.S., with a request that he
would be kind enough to examine it. After having done so, he writes as
follows: — " The dark crystals in the slate from Delabole are similar to what
I have seen   in many others.     As far as I can make out, they are imperfect
hexagonal plates ; and since the general character clearly shows that they
must at all events contain much iron, it seems very probable that they may
be more or less altered specular iron. This, of course, would well agree with.
the fact of its containing titanic acid."

sing in a north-easterly direction from the farm of Quoit to a
point about a quarter of a mile north of the turnpike-road from
Truro to St. Austell, where it expands into a large mass at the
summit of the hill ; thence it extends, in diminished proportions,
in a south-easterly direction to the sea at Duporth.           This rock,
which is of a dark green colour verging on black, is exceedingly
hard and tough, and is extensively worked, at the point of its
greatest expansion, as a material for making roads.           The quarry
from which this stone is obtained adjoins the "sanctuary fields"
belonging to the glebe of the parish of St. Mewan, and has long
afforded a road-material of such remarkable excellence that it is
carted to considerable distances to be employed for that purpose.
    In the quarry above referred to, this rock is distinctly crystal
line, frequently encloses patches of iron pyrites, and attracts the
magnetic needle.       Tu some smaller openings which have been
made upon it on its south-eastern extension, its crystalline cha
racter has to a considerable extent disappeared, and pyrites has
been replaced by oxide of iron.              Fragments of rock free from
pyrites were chosen for analysis ; and three separate analyses were
made, with the following results*           —

98      Mr.  J. A. Phillips  on the Chemical Composition    and
   Thin sections, when examined under the microscope, exhibit
unmistakable evidence of extensive alteration.      The felspar does
not generally present any distinctive characteristics, although iu
a few instances the parallel striping peculiar to triclinic varieties
was observed. In addition to felspar this rock contains numerous
semi-transparent yellowish-brown crystals, probably hornblende ;
there is also a green mineral which has a fibrous structure, show
ing colours with polarized light ; this is believed to be a variety
of hornblende.
   Many black grains of oxide of iron, and some well-defined
hexagonal crystals (which, as phosphoric acid has been shown to
be present, are in all probability apatite), are disseminated
throughout the mass ; there is likewise an abundance of a green
ish chloritic mineral, which is doubtless a secondary product.
Mr. Samuel Allport, F.G.S., an acknowledged authority on the
microscopic structure of rocks, to whom        I submitted a section,
agrees  in  the opinion that  this is probably a diorite that has un
dergone much alteration.
   Those portions of the eruptive dyke which are in close proxi
mity to, or come into direct contact with, the enclosing slaty rock
not unfrequently exhibit a quasi-schistose structure.          Sections
made from specimens of this description were found to have lost
all traces of crystalline arrangement, and to consist of an amor
phous felspathic base, in which a greenish chloritic mineral is
disposed in parallel bands.        Some of the sections which have
been prepared from this variety of the rock are traversed by mi
nute veins of crystalline quartz enclosing numerous well-defined
crystals of hornblende; and it was observed that the chloritic
bands were frequently bent at their point of intersection with
the veins of quartz.
    "Greenstone," Blowing-House Hill, St. Austell. Sp. gr. =2-89.
—Some twenty years since, a quarry was worked for road-mate
rial immediately below the old schoolroom on Blowing-House
Hill, St. Austell. The general appearance of the stone obtained
from this locality is very similar to that of the rock from the
" Sanctuaries," excepting that it has a somewhat duller aspect,
and is divided by a series of oblique cross headings which impart
to it a tendency to divide into rhomboidal masses.       It is also less
decidedly crystalline than the rock previously described; and
although in no degree fissile, it nevertheless exhibits a grain re
sembling that of some varieties of metamorphosed schist.            The
following   results were obtained   by analysis :—

    It will be observed that the chemical composition of this rock
is almost identical with that of the diorite extending from Quoit
farm to Duporth, with the exception of its containing an appre
ciable amount of oxide of manganese, and that the percentage of
soda is only about one half of that found in the former case.
    Under the microscope it is seen to consist of a compact fel-
spathic matrix, enclosing a few indistinct crystals of felspar,
together with large quantities of the greenish chloritic mineral
referred to in the description of a diorite from St. Mewan.          This
last is arranged in approximately parallel bands and patches,
many of the latter having the appearance of partially decom
posed crystals of hornblende ; the central portion of these retain
to a certain extent their original structure and colour, whilst the
edges have become transformed into chlorite, or some nearly
allied mineral.
    This rock, which also contains many black grains of oxide of
iron, and a few hexagonal crystals, which are perhaps apatite,
may be either a metamorphosed slate, or a diorite which has be
come much changed by the effects of a gradual re-arrangement
 of its constituents.    I however incline to the opinion that it is
an altered clay-slate.

band of a dark green rock which is there extensively quarried
 for road-making.      Its total width may be taken at about fifty
 yards ; but it is more or less intermixed with the enclosing clay-
 slate, from which it is separated by no well-defined walls or lines
 of demarcation, since the two gradually merge into each other j

 serpentinous    greenstone.     Its general      structure is decidedly

     The microscope shows this to be a highly metamorphosed rock,
 consisting of an amorphous matrix porphyritically enclosing yel
 lowish-brown or green patches with indistinct crystalline forms,
 which are evidently pseudomorphs.                 There are also many black
 grains of magnetite, and crystals of some pyroxenic mineral —
 probably schiller-spar or diallage.
     This appears to afford an illustration of the gradual produc
 tion of serpentine, by the absorption of magnesia &c., by strati
 fied and other rocks ; in the same way the analyses of the two
 specimens of killas from Botallack would seem to indicate that
 some of the clay-slates in that district may have become to a

 long, easily separable crystals.    This is probably the result of metatnorphic

    The microscope shows this rock to consist of a cryptocrystal-
line base, spotted by oxide of iron &c., and enclosing indistinct
green or yellowish-brown crystalline forms — pseudomorphs after
pyroxene ? These crystals give irregular colours with polarized

    Orthoclase, Roche. Sp. gr. = 2'55. — On the right-hand side
of the road leading from St. Austell to the village of Roche, and
at a distance of a mile from the latter place, a deposit of yellow
ish-white crystalline felspar is quarried ia the bottom of a shallow
ravine.
    The area over which this mineral extends has not been accu
rately determined ; but it has been worked, on the course of the
hollow, by means of shallow pits, for a length of about one hun
dred yards, and to a width of some sixty feet. It is enclosed in
granite containing considerable quantities of schorl, and is tra-
which in other portions of the same deposit remains unchanged, with the
exception of having become hardened into a kind of stone.
   This asbestus, which is found for a distance of several yards on either
side of a band of schistose serpentine crossing the valley nearly at right
angles, has evidently been produced in situ, and encloses pepitas of water-

afford good specimens of tourmaline and of well-crystallized
cassiterite, which is usually associated with the former ; crystals
of tourmaline are found in the felspar, as well as in the veins of
quartz by which it is intersected.
   These workings are locally known as the

the felspar, after being separated from quartz and fragments
stained by oxide of iron, by careful hand-picking, is shipped for
use in the manufacture of certain descriptions of pottery.
    Professor W. H. Miller, P.E.S., of Cambridge, who kindly
made for me a crystallographic examination of this mineral,

 spar is consequently orthoclase.
     In making the foregoing analyses the following general rou
 tine was adopted.
     The amount of moisture present was ascertained by heating a
 weighed quantity of the finely pulverized rock in a water-bath
 until it ceased to lose weight. Another weighed portion was
 moderately ignited, in a platinum crucible, in one of Griffin's
 gas-furnaces, and the loss of weight noted.
     About thirty grains, more or less, of the finely powdered rock
 was intimately mixed, in a platinum crucible, with from five to
 six times its weight of pure carbonate of sodium, and fused at a
 high temperature in a gas-furnace.

      The fused mixture was treated with dilute hydrochloric acid
  and subsequently evaporated to dryness.            The dried residuum
  was then moistened with hydrochloric acid, water added, and
  solution of the chlorides assisted by the application of heat.
  Silica (a), now separated by filtration, was washed, dried, and
  ignited.
      After adding a few drops of nitric acid to the filtrate from
  silica, for the purpose of ensuring the peroxidation of all the iron,
 it was evaporated to dryness, treated with dilute hydrochloric
 acid, and filtered, thus separating a small additional quantity of
 silica (b).
      The nitrate from the second evaporation, after separation of
 silica b, was rendered nearly neutral by ammonia, and acetate of
 sodium added.         The solution was then briskly boiled, and the
 precipitated    basic  acetates of iron and aluminium were collected
 and washed.         This precipitate was dissolved in hydrochloric
 acid, a few drops of nitric acid added, and, after cooling, re-preci
 pitated by ammonia, washed, dried, ignited, and weighed. After
 weighing, this was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and a third
 small portion of silica         obtained
                                (c)          by
                                             filtration.
     The iron in the filtrate from silica     was reduced to the state
                                              c
of ferrous oxide     by  the introduction of weighed pieces of metallic
zinc; and after making due allowance for the amount of that
metal contained in the zinc added, the quantity of iron present
was ascertained       by   Penny's process.   This, after being trans
formed     by  calculation into ferric oxide, was subtracted from the
united weight of ferric oxide and alumina before found (less
silica c), the difference in weight being regarded as alumina*.
    * When phosphoric acid was found in rock, the amount of that sub
                                             a
 stance as well as that of ferric oxide, indicated by volumetric estimation,
 was deducted from the united weights of ferric oxide and alumina, as deter
 mined by the balance, and the difference was regarded as alumina.
    For the sake of checking the accuracy of the results obtained in estima
 ting alumina by difference, the ferric oxide and alumina were in several in
 stances redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the solution treated with an
 excess of pure hydrate of sodium in  a   platinum dish, and, after boiling, the
 ferric oxide was separated by filtration.      The ferric oxide was then re-
 dissolved, precipitated by ammonia, washed, dried, and weighed.
    The filtrate containing alumina, in solution in caustic soda, was afterwards
acidified with hydrochloric acid, chlorate of potassium was added to de
stroy organic matter, the solution boiled, and the alumina precipitated by
ammonia and carbonate of ammonium, washed, dried, and weighed.
    In all cases, however, it was found necessary to re-dissolve the oxide of
iron twice, and to treat the solution each time with hydrate of sodium in order
to obtain satisfactory results.    Even when this was done, the quantity of
ferric oxide found was invariably slightly in excess of that indicated by vo
lumetric analysis;    and although this difference seldom exceeded two-tenths
of one per cent., the volumetric process was finally adopted, as being both
more accurate and more expeditious.

104     Mr.      J. A.   Phillips on   the Chemical Composition and
   In   order to determine the respective amounts of ferrous and
ferric oxides present, separate fusions were made, in a covered
platinum crucible, of weighed quantities of pulverized rock mixed
 with six times their weight of carbonate of sodium, the surface
 of the mixture being covered by a thick layer of pure carbonate
 of sodium.
     The contents of the crucible were thus both fused and allowed
to cool in an atmosphere of carbonic acid, produced by the de
composition of the alkaline carbonate by silica and silicates,
besides being preserved from oxidation by a fused covering of
 carbonate of sodium.
     The crucible and its contents were now introduced into a
 beaker containing hot dilute hydrochloric acid which had been
 previously boiled, and the whole covered by a glass plate.      As
 soon as bubbles of carbonic acid had ceased to be evolved      the
 solution was allowed to cool, and the amount of ferrous oxide
 estimated by a standardized solution of bichromate of potassium.
     The ferrous oxide thus found was subsequently converted by
 calculation into Fe2 0s, and deducted from the total amount of
 iron estimated as ferric oxide.
     The lime was obtained from the filtrate from the precipitate
 by acetate of sodium, by the addition of ammonia and oxalate of
 ammonium, and was weighed as carbonate of calcium.        To the
 filtrate from the calcium salt, phosphate of sodium was added for
the precipitation of magnesia as pyrophosphate of magnesium.
Titanic acid was estimated by the process recommended by
Riley*, which was conducted as follows.

present in. these rocks was soluble when the finely divided sub
stance was digested with nitric acid, the following process was
adopted for its estimation.
    About 100 grains of the finely pulverized rock was attacked
by nitric acid in a platinum dish, and evaporated nearly to dry-
                                           '
ness to remove the excess of acid.           The insoluble matters were
removed by filtration, and the filtrate reduced to a very small
bulk by evaporation ; molybdate of ammonium was then added
and the beaker, carefully covered, set aside in a warm place
for twenty-four hours to allow of the formation of a precipi
tate.
     The precipitate (when one was obtained) was thrown on a filter
and washed with cold water, to which had been added molybdate
of ammonium and a little nitric acid.
     Strong ammonia was now poured on the filter, and the filtrate
evaporated to dryness in order to render insoluble any silica
which, at the same time as the yellow precipitate, might have
been dissolved by ammonia.           The residue was then taken up by
 hydrochloric acid, insoluble matter separated by filtration, and
 ammonia and magnesium mixture added.                After being set aside
 for twelve hours to allow of the formation of the magnesium-salt,
 the clear liquor was drawn off by a pipette, the precipitate re-dis
 solved by a few drops of hydrochloric acid, and re-precipitated
 by the addition of ammonia.              This precipitate was washed,
 dried, ignited, and weighed as pyrophosphate of magnesium,
 from the weight of which the amount of phosphoric acid was cal
 culated.
     When the rock under examination was found to contain an
 appreciable amount of manganese or (as in the case of the ser
 pentine) oxide of nickel, the general routine of analysis required
 the following modification.
     The filtrate from silica was neutralized by ammonia, chloride
 of ammonium added, and finally sulphide of ammonium.                   The
 precipitate    thus produced    was   dissolved  in  hydrochloric   acid to
  which a few drops of nitric acid had been added, evaporated to
  dryness for the purpose of separating traces of silica, and re-solu
  tion effected in hydrochloric acid. This, after filtration, was
 treated by carbonate of barium, by which oxide of iron and alu
 mina were precipitated* ; these were subsequently estimated in
  the usual way.
     * In order to remove any sulphuric acid resulting from the action of ni-
  trohydrochloric acid on the sulphides, a few drops of chloride of barium
  were added to the nitrate before the addition of carbonate of barium.   In
  the event of a trace of alumina having escaped precipitation by carbonate
  of barium, it is readily separated from oxide of manganese or oxide of
  nickel by digestion in an excess of hydrate of potassium or hydrate of
  sodium.

 106     On the Chemical Composition    of certain Cornish Rocks.
    The oxide of manganese, or oxide of nickel, was obtained from
the filtrate from oxide of iron and alumina and excess of car
bonate of barium, after the removal of baryta in the form of sul
 phate of barium.
     Oxide of chromium was estimated by fusing in a platinum cru
cible about 100 grains of pulverized rock with four times its
 weight of carbonate of sodium, and half that quantity of nitrate
of potassium.
    The fused mass was then treated by boiling water, a certain
amount of alcohol added, and the whole heated gently for several
hours.     The insoluble matter was subsequently separated by
filtration, acetic acid in excess added to the filtrate, and the
chromium precipitated as chromate of lead by the addition of a
solution of the acetate of that metal.
    The estimation of sulphur was effected by attacking a weighed
portion of the pulverized rock with nitrohydrochloric acid and,
after removing the insoluble matter by filtration, precipitating
the sulphuric acid as sulphate of barium ; from the weight of
this the amount of sulphur originally present was calculated.
    In the earlier analyses the alkalies were estimated by fusion
with baryta in the usual way; but after having made several
estimations of potassaand soda in the same rock by the two pro
cesses, the following was ultimately adopted as being more ex
peditious and at the same time equally accurate.
    A convenient weight (from 30 to 35 grains) of the finely pow
dered rock was thoroughly attacked in a platinum dish by strong
hydrofluoric acid, and, after the addition of sulphuric acid, evapo
rated to dryness and ignited over a gas-flame ; the residue was
now treated with distilled water which was well boiled, taking
care to break down all lumps by means of a glass rod.
    The whole was transferred without filtration to a large beaker,
and excess of ammonia and carbonate of ammonium added.
    After the separation by filtration of insoluble matter, and of
the precipitate by ammonia and carbonate of ammonium, the fil
trate was evaporated to dryness and the ammoniacal salts expelled
by ignition.     The residue was treated with sulphuric acid, and
again evaporated to dryness and ignited to drive off excess of
sulphuric acid, dissolved in water, baryta-water added in excess,
and filtered.    The filtrate was acidified with acetic acid, evapo
rated to dryness, ignited, and the carbonate of barium and char
coal separated by filtration ; the alkaline carbonates in the filtrate
were now decomposed by hydrochloric acid, and the whole eva
porated to dryness.       A few drops of solution of carbonate of
ammonium were then added, and the platinum dish strongly
heated to drive off ammoniacal salts.       The residue was treated
with water, any insoluble matter separated by filtration, and the

   XV.   On the Light from the Sky, its Polarization and Colour.
By theHon. J. W. STRUTT, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge*.
       is now,   I  believe,                admitted that the light which
 IT we receive from thegenerally
                               clear sky is due in one way       or another
to small suspended particles which divert the light from its re
gular course.      On this point the experiments of Tyndall with
precipitated    clouds   seem quite decisive.      Whenever the particles
of the foreign matter are sufficiently fine, the light emitted late
rally is blue in colour, and, in a direction perpendicular to that
of the incident beam, is completely polarized.
     About the colour there is no prima facie difficulty ; for as
soon as the question is raised, it is seen that the standard of
linear dimension, with reference to which the particles are called
small, is the wave-length of light, and that a given set of par
 ticles would (on any conceivable view as to their mode of action)
produce a continually increasing disturbance as we pass along
 the spectrum towards the more refrangible end; and there
 seems no reason why the colour of the compound light thus
 scattered laterally should not agree with that of the sky.
     On the other hand, the direction of polarization, (perpendicular
to the path of the primary light) seems to have been felt as a
 difficulty. Tyndall says,
                               " . . . . the polarization of the beam by
 the incipient cloud has thus far proved itself to be absolutely inde
pendent of the polarizing-angle.          The law of Brewster does not
 apply   to matter   in this condition;      and it rests with the undula-
 tory theory to explain why. Whenever the precipitated particles
 are sufficiently fine, no matter what the substance forming the
 particles may be, the direction of maximum polarization is at
 right angles to the illuminating beam, the polarizing angle for
 matter in this condition being invariably 45°.             This  I consider
 to be a point of capital importance with reference to the present
 question" f. As to the importance there will not be two opi
 nions; but     I  venture to think that the difficulty is entirely
 imaginary, and is caused mainly by misuse of the word reflection.
 Of course there is nothing in the etymology of reflection or re
 fraction to forbid their application in this sense ; but the words
 have acquired technical meanings, and become associated with
 certain well-known laws called after them.               Now a moment's
 consideration of the principles according to which reflection and

108        The Hou.     J. W.       Strutt on   the   Light from   the   Sky,
refraction are explained in the wave theory is sufficient to show
that they have no application unless the surface of the disturbing
body is larger than many square wave-lengths ; whereas the par
ticles to which the sky is supposed to owe its illumination must
be smaller than the wave-length, or else the explanation of the
colour breaks down.    The idea of- polarization by reflection is
therefore quite out of place ; and that " the law of Brewster
does not apply to matter in this condition
                                           "
                                              (of extreme fineness)
is only what might have been inferred from the principles of the
wave theory.
    Nor is there any difficulty in foreseeing what, according to the
wave theory, the direction of polarization ought to be. Conceive
a beam of plane-polarized light to move among a number of par
ticles, all small compared with any of the wave-lengths.             The
foreign matter, if optically denser than air, may be supposed to
load the jether so as to increase its inertia without altering its
resistance to distortion, provided that we agree to neglect effects
analogous to chromatic dispersion.                If
                                               the particles were away,
the wave would pass on unbroken and no light would be emitted
laterally. Even with the particles retarding the motion of the
sether, the same will be true            if,
                                      to counterbalance the increased
inertia, suitable forces are caused to act on the sether at all
points where the inertia        altered.
                                    is      These forces have the same
period   and  direction as the undisturbed   luminous vibrations them
selves.    The light actually    emitted  laterally    thus the same as

would be caused       by forces exactly the opposite of these acting on
the medium otherwise free from disturbance; and             only remains
                                                                   it
to see what the effect of such forces would be.
    On account of the smallness of the particles, the forces acting
throughout the volume of any one are all of the same intensity
and direction, and may be considered as whole.          a   The determi
nation of the motion in the aether, due to the action of periodic        a
force at   a given point, requires, of course, the aid of mathema
tical analysis ;   but very simple considerations will lead us to               a
conclusion on the particular point now under discussion.               In
the first place there      is complete symmetry
                                a                   round   the direction
of the force.     The disturbance, consisting of transverse vibra
tions, is  propagated outwards in all directions from the centre                j
and in consequence of the symmetry, the direction of vibration
in any ray lies in the plane containing the ray and the axis                    ;
that  is  to say, the direction of vibration in the scattered or
diffracted ray makes with the direction of vibration in the in
cident or primary ray the least possible angle.               The sym
metry also requires that the intensity of the scattered light
should vanish for the ray which would be propagated along the
axis; for there    is   nothing to distinguish one direction trans

                       its Polarization and Colour.                      109
verse to the ray from another. We have now got what we want.
Suppose, for distinctness of statement, that the primary ray is
vertical, and that the plane of vibration is that of the meridian.
The intensity of the light scattered by a small particle is con
stant, and a maximum for rays which lie in the vertical plane
running east and west, while there is no scattered ray along the
north and south line.          If the primary ray is unpolarized, the
light scattered     north   and  south is entirely due to that component
which vibrates east and west, and is therefore perfectly polarized,
the direction of its vibration being also east and west. Similarly
any other ray scattered horizontally is perfectly polarized, and
the vibration is performed in the horizontal plane.            In other di
rections the polarization becomes less and less complete as we
approach the vertical, and in the vertical direction itself altogether
disappears.
    So far, then, as disturbance by very small particles is con
cerned, theory appears to be in complete accordance with the
experiments of Tyndall and others.              At the same time, if the
above reasoning be valid, the question as to the direction of the
vibrations in polarized light is decided in accordance with the
view of Fresnel.        Indeed the observation on the plane of polari
zation of the scattered light is virtually only another form of
Professor Stokes's original test with the diffraction-grating.              In
its present shape, however, it is free from certain difficulties both
of theory and experiment, which have led different physicists who
have used the other method to contradictory conclusions.               I con
       I
fess cannot see any room for doubt as to the result it leads to*.
    The argument used is apparently open to a serious objection,
which I ought to notice.          It seems to prove too much. For if
one disturbing partide is unable to send out a scattered ray in
the direction of original vibration, it w ould appear that no com
bination of them (such as a small body may be supposed to be)
could do so, at least at such a distance that the body subtends
only a small solid angle.         Now we know that when light vibra
ting    in the plane    of  incidence  falls on a reflecting surface at an
angle of 45°, light is sent out according to the law of ordinary
     * I only mean tlmt light, as is generally supposed, consists of trans
                          if
versal vibrations similar to those which take place in an elastic solid, the
vibration must be normal to the plane of polarization.     There is unques
tionably a formal analogy between the two sets of phenomena extending
over a very wide range ; but it is another thing to assert that the vibrations
of light are really and truly to-and-fro motions of a medium having mecha
nical properties (with reference to small vibrations) like those of ordinary
 solids.   The fact that the theory of elastic solids led Green to Fresnel's
formulae for the reflection and refraction of polarized light seems amply
sufficient to warrant its employment here, while the question whether the
analogy is more than formal is still left open.

 reflection, whose direction of vibration is perpendicular to that in
 the incident ray.      And not only is this BO in experiment, but it
 has been proved by Green* to be a consequence of the very same
 view as to the nature of the difference between media of various
 refrangibilities as has been adopted in this paper.          The appa
rent contradiction, however, is easily explained.             It is true
that the disturbance due to a foreign body of any size is the
 same as would be caused by forces acting through the space it
fills in a direction parallel to that in which the primary light vi
brates ; but these forces must be supposed to act on the medium as
it actually is — that              is,
                            with the variable demity.       Only on the
supposition of complete uniformity would             follow that no ray it
could be emitted parallel to the line in which the forces act.
When, however, the sphere of disturbance          small compared with
                                                                    is is
the wave-length, the want of uniformity           of little account, and
cannot alter the law regulating the intensity of the vibration
propagated in different directions.
    Having disposed of the polarization, let us now consider how
the intensity of the scattered light varies from one part of the
spectrum to another, still supposing that all the particles are
many times smaller than the wave-length even of violet light.
The whole question admits of analytical treatment              but before             ;
entering upon that,          may be worth while to show how the
                                   it
principal result may be anticipated from           consideration of the

of space, time, and mass. Since the ratio whose expression we        i,

to another X is the only quantity which varies, and we                             have the
important law         :   —
    When light is scattered by particles which are very small com
pared with any of the wave-lengths, the ratio of the amplitudes of the
vibrations of the scattered and incident light varies inversely as the
square of the wave-length, and the intensity of the lights themselves
as the inverse fourth power.
   I  will now investigate the mathematical expression for the
disturbance propagated in any direction from a small particle
which a beam of light strikes.
   Let the vibration corresponding to the incident light be ex
pressed by       A cos —          bt.     The acceleration    is
so that the force which would have to be applied to the parts
where the density is D', in order that the wave might pass on
undisturbed,    per unit of volume,
                  is,
To obtain the total force which must                   be supposed to act over the
                          by
                       the particle, the factor    must be introduced.

The opposite of this conceived to act at           (the position of the
particle) gives    the  same  disturbance  in  the medium as       actu             is
ally caused      bythe presence of the particle.    Suppose, now, that

no loss of generality, because of the symmetry which we have
shown to exist round the line of action of the force.         The ques

    One reservation, however, must not be omitted.                   Since we
have supposed the medium uniform throughout, whereas it
really has a different density at the place where the force acts,
our investigation does not absolutely correspond to the actual
circumstances of the case.          As before remarked, no error is on
that account to be feared in the law determining the intensity of
the vibration in different directions ; but it is probable that the
coefficient, so far as it depends on D : D', may be changed*, and
there may be a change in the phase comparable with —                   -x  the
                                                                     A*
linear dimension of the particle, which is of importance when the
scattered and primary waves have to be compounded.
    So much for a single particle.           In actual experiments, as, for
instance, with Professor Tyndall's "clouds," we have to deal
with an immense number of such particles ; and the question
now is to deduce what their effect must be from the results
already obtained.        Were the particles absolutely motionless, the
partial waves sent out in any direction from them would have
permanent relations as to phase, and the total disturbance would
have to be found by compounding the vibrations due to all the
particles.     Such a supposition, however, would be very wide of
the mark ; for, in consequence of the extreme small ness of X, the
slightest motion of any particle will cause an alteration of phase
passing through many periods in a less time than the eye could
appreciate.      Our particles are, then, to be treated as so many
unconnected sources of light ; and instead of adding the vibrations,
we must take the intensities represented by their squares.                Only
in one direction is a different treatment necessary, namely along
the course of the primary light.           I  mention this because it would
not otherwise appear how the reduction in the intensity of the
transmitted light is effected ; but we do not require to follow the
details of the process, because, when once we know the intensity
of the light emitted laterally, the principle of energy will tell us
what the primary wave has lost.

   Before making out the theory, I had endeavoured to ascertain
by observation the actual prismatic composition of the blue of
the sky, and had obtained preliminary results.     The experimental

method (the description of which must reserve for another oppor
tunity) was fully adequate to the comparison of two given lights ;
but the difficulty was to find something to compare the blue
light with. In the only complete set of observations that I have
hitherto been able to make, the blue of the sky (apparently a
very good one) taken from the neighbourhood of the zenith
was compared with sunlight diffused through white paper,

 worth notice that the conclusion as to complete polarization per

    By many physicists, from Newton downwards, the light of the
 sky has been supposed to be reflected from thin plates, and the
 colour to be the blue of the first order in Newton's scale.         Such
 a view is fundamentally different from that adopted in this paper,
 though it might not at first seem so.          In support of this asser
 tion, it may be sufficient to notice that the two theories are
 at variance as to the law connecting the intensity with wave
length. By an argument from dimensions similar to that already
used, it is easy to find how the intensity of the light reflected
 from a thin plate (thin, that                  is,
                                       compared with any of the wave
lengths) varies with X. Instead of our former quantities,              r,           T,    X,
we now have merely           and X,  the thickness of the plate.

the reflected vibration necessarily varies as               must also be
                                                                      8,   it
proportional    to  X"1,  and  so  the   intensity of the  reflected  light
  ccX~2 instead of X~4.       The ordinary analytical expression for
the reflected light leads readily to the same conclusion (Airy's
Tracts,   p.  297). There can,         think, be no question that the
                                                1
composition     of the light  of the  sky agrees more nearly with the
latter than with the former law.

•9  of the ray   A gets through, only '018 of R would be able to
penetrate.     For the rays of still higher refrangibility, which
Professor Stokes found abundant in the electric light but missing
in the solar rays, the fraction would be smaller still ; but am   I
not aware of any measurements of smaller wave-length on which
to found a calculation.
    We have hitherto supposed that the light scattered by the
 finely divided matter reaches the eye without modification, and
 we have taken no account of any change in the composition of
the primary light before diffraction.       If x be the total length of
 the path of the ray through the turbid medium, we may express
 the quality of the light in terms of a?; for it makes no difference
 whether the lateral leakage takes place before diffraction or after.
 In  fact
 an expression which shows that      I  vanishes for very small as well
 as for very large values of \, while for some definite value (say A)
 it rises to a maximum (I0).      Expressing I in terms of I0 and A,
 we have
                            I    A4    ,_£
 from which we may fall back on our original law by supposing
 A indefinitely small, and replacing A4I0 by a finite constant.
 An approximate idea of the character of these lights may be ob
 tained by subtracting the successive curves of fig. 2.        Thus the
 difference of the curves marked 2 and 4 represents a light having
 its maximum brightness (of course relatively to the primary
 light) in the blue-green portion of the spectrum.        I find by cal
 culation that, if the maximum intensity be at b and be taken as
  unity, the intensities at G and C are given by the numbers -713,
  •710 respectively.    The colour would be greenish ; but whether

 XVI.     Addendum to a Paper on the Theory of the Tides. By the
 llev. T. K. ABBOTT, Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Dublin*.
         a former    Number of this Magazine (Jan. 1870) I gave ele
  IN mentary        proofs of the principal theorems in the Theory of
 the Tides. In order to complete the elementary treatment of the
 subject, it is desirable to give simple constructions for the disturb
 ing force, the velocity of the current, and the height of the tide.
 The two latter I propose to give in the present paper ; it would
 be superfluous to occupy your space with the former.
      It is in fact readily shown by elementary geometry that in
 the figure    tj where   E B E'   represents the hemisphere        under the
  moon, and a circle O c1 c B/is described round the radius directed
  to the moon, the tangential disturbing force at a is proportional to
  the perpendicular cp.          If  a a1 be the space passed over in the

        miniature-spectroscope, the spectrum of the aurora borealis
as shown in the annexed engraving.      To obtain sufficient bright
ness, the slit was opened rather wide.
   With an alcohol-flame, the wick of which was impregnated
with sodium- and lithium- salts, the lines of lithium and sodium
were at the same time produced ; and their position was used for
the approximate determination of the lines of the aurora borealis.
The line in the green part of the spectrum                is,
                                             in all probability, the

On the contrary, the above-represented red line has not, to my
knowledge, till now been observed.      Certainly this line occurs
with sufficient intensity only in those parts of the sky which
even to the naked eye appear intensely reddened.          But the
green line also was always present in these spots, and, indeed,
so intense that very seldom did the red line produce an equally
strong optical impression.   In the blue portion of the spectrum
there only sometimes occurred faint band-like streaks, among
which     broad dark band on

I believe that have ascertained, by simultaneous observation
of the sodium and lithium spectra, that the red aurora-line does
not agree with any maximum of brightness in the spectra of the
four gases investigated.          It is more refrangible than the red
hydrogen-line C ; and its situation would be nearest to the place
of the group of dark atmospheric lines a, between C and D in
the solar spectrum, to which corresponds a mean wave-length of
G'0006279 millim.          It may therefore be maintained that the
spectrum of the aurora borealis corresponds, in its principal lines,
with none of those of known terrestrial substances hitherto ob
served.      On the contrary, the observations of Winlock and
Young* make it very probable that three green lines of the spec
trum of the protuberances observed during a total eclipse of the
sun coincide with three lines in the spectrum of the corona and
in that of the aurora borealis.          According to the measurements
hitherto made, the most refrangible of these lines coincides with
one which, according to Kirchhoff's scale, is numbered 1474,
and, according      to Angstrom, has a wave-length             of 0'0005323
millim.     Kirchhoff and Angstrom agree in designating this line
as one    belonging to the spectrum of iron.
    All these circumstances seem only to increase the difficulties
opposed to a satisfactory explanation of the aurora borealis ; so
 that Angstrom, in the work above cited, declares the hitherto
 assumed analogy between the phenomena of the light of the
 aurora and those presented by the passage of electricity through
 rarefied air to be disproved by the non-coincidence of the aurora-
 spectrum with any known spectrum of the atmospheric gasesf-
 I  nevertheless believe that, by the following considerations,                I
 shall be able to make the assumption very probable, that, if the
 luminous developments exhibited in the aurora are indeed, after
 the analogy of the rarefied gases brought to incandescence in
 air-exhausted spaces, of an electrical nature, they must belong to
 so low a temperature that it is impossible at the same temperature
 to observe the spectra of incandescent gases in Geissler's tubes.
 This would render possible and, as very simple, also probable
 the following explanation : — That tlie spectrum of the aurora
 borealis does not correspond with any known spectrum of the atmo
 spheric gases is only because, though a spectrum of our atmosphere,

 by the rarefied air in the electric egg ; this, however, is not the ease."

      The considerations in question result from the theorem deve
 loped in the preceding memoir*, of the equivalence of thickness
  and density of the radiant layers in the conditions of density
 prevailing in the higher regions of our atmosphere.            Let us de-
 iiote by Ax and E* the value of the absorptive and the emissive
 power, referred to unity of thickness and density at a determined
 temperature, for the wave-length         \ ; further, let m and a- be the
 thickness and density       of the luminous layer of gas ; we thus have
 for the brightness E of the part of the spectrum belonging to X,
 according     to the theorem mentioned,       the expression
 It   will be seen that, for a given gas and a given temperature,
 this expression depends only on the value of the product of nur.
      Let us conceive, then, for example, aGeissler's tube filled with
 rarefied atmospheric air ; and let us take the diameter of the
 central channel at 1 millim. as unit for the thickness m, and as
 unit for a- that density of the included air which corresponds to
 a temperature of 0° C. and a pressure of 1 millim. of mercury.
 If now by means of an induction-apparatus the air in the tube is
rendered 'incandescent, at constant temperature the spectrum of
the incandescent layer of gas would remain qualitatively and
quantitatively unaltered, if the thickness of the luminous layer
 (consequently, in the case considered, the diameter of the channel)
were increased from 1 millim. to 1000 millims., but to compensate
for this the pressure of the included gas were diminished from
1 millim. to y^^ of a millim.             Wiillner, in his investigations
" On the Spectra of Gases in Geissler's Tubes," found that the
current of a smaller RuhmkorfF's apparatus, in the cases of ni
trogen and oxygen, could not overcome the resistance until the
pressure in the tubes had been reduced by exhausting to 94 and
64 millims. respectively.          But although at these pressures the
gases became permanently luminous, yet the intensity of the
light was still too small for spectroscopic investigation.           With
nitrogen     the   requisite brightness     was  first obtained when   the
pressure was reduced to 46 millims. ; with oxygen, to 28-30
millimsf.
     I will hence assume that, with the apparatus used by Wiillner,
at about 50 millims. pressure the induction current passes through

a  Geissler's tube filled with atmospheric air, and with a thickness
of the radiant layer of 1 millim. a sufficient amount of light is
developed for the observation of the atmospheric spectrum.             But
if now this thickness of the luminous layer be compared with the
thicknesses present in the aurora borealis, the latter must evi
dently be taken as incomparably greater, and, especially at spots
far from the zenith, may be estimated at miles*.           But if we even
assume for the thickness of such a layer only 1 kilometre, this,
at the same temperature as that in the Geissler's tube in the
present example, could have only the millionth part of the den
sity of the air contained in the tube, and so only O'OOOOS mil
lim. pressure at 0° C., if the spectrum of the incandescent gas
in the tube were to correspond perfectly with that of the aurora
borealisf.     Here, then, the question arises, whether it is allow
able to assume such low rates of pressure in those regions of our
atmosphere in which the aurora borealis is developed.
    As regards the height the accounts of various aurorse boreales
are very divergent.           Thus, not to mention earlier accounts,
HansteenJ finds for the aurora of January 7, 1831, the height of
26 [German] geographical miles, by combining the measure
ments of the apparent height of the dark segment at Berlin and
at Christiansand in Norway.             On the contrary, the observations
of Farquharson§ make it probable that aurorae boreales in ge
neral have a much less altitude, and sometimes descend quite to
the region of the clouds.
    The latter view is corroborated by many more recent observa
tions, especially in the polar regions, made by Parry, Wrangel,
Franklin, Hood, Richardson, and others; so that the height of
from 10 to 20 geographical miles, assumed in the following cal
culations as that of the lower parts of the aurora borealis, may
be presumed to be at all events rather too great than too small.
If, assuming a uniform temperature everywhere of 0° and the
normal condition of the barometer at the surface of the earth, we
calculate the atmospheric pressure at those heights, we shall find
   * This may offer a very simple explanation of the fact that, in general,
with increasing distance from the zenith the brightness of the aurora
borealis increases, as far as the boundary of the dark segment.
   t In all these considerations, it is obvious that the apparent magni
tude of the luminous layer is always assumed to be sufficient, to cause
the variation of distance of the latter to have no effect on the brightness
of the spectrum.       In like manner the influence of absorption in the
deeper and non-luminous layers of the atmosphere is neglected.

for it   at the height of 10 geographical miles O078 millim., and
at the   height of 20 miles 0-00001 millim.
    To a layer 1 metre thick of the incandescent air of the aurora
borealis, then, at the height of 10 miles, a pressure of 78 mil-
lims. in the Geissler's tube would be equivalent, and at the
height of 20 miles a pressure of O'Ol millim., in order to pro
duce at the same temperature a spectrum just as bright as that
of the aurora borealis.
    But since, as before remarked, the thickness of the luminous
layers in the aurora is most probably to be estimated as amount
ing to, not metres, but kilometres, we should obtain so high a
value for the pressure in the Geissler's tube equivalent to the
thickness even at the height of 10 miles (namely, 78 metres of
 mercury for a layer 1 kilometre thick), that the quantity of elec
tricity produced by even the largest induction-apparatus would
 not possess sufficient tension to overcome the resistance of the
 air compressed to such a degree. And even if the tension were
 sufficient, the temperature produced by the discharge would be
 so high that the spectrum could only be brilliant and continuous,
 and hence not comparable with that of the aurora borealis.
     Prom this it is evident that the quantity of incandescent gas
 particles in a Geissler's tube, in comparison with that in the
 aurora borealis, is probably extraordinarily minute.       But since,
 notwithstanding this,     the  spectrum  of a gas rendered, incandes
 cent in such a tube by electricity must at least possess the bright
 ness of the aurora-spectrum in order, even with the best appa
 ratus as regards intensity of light, to afford a spectroscopic
 analysis, it follows that the emissive power of the incandescent
 gas particles in the tube must be immensely greater than that of
 those in the aurora borealis.         Such a difference of emissive
 power, however, can only be effected by difference of tempe
 rature.
     If, then, the light developed in the aurora borealis arises from,
 incandescent gas particles of our atmosphere,      the temperature at
 which this takes place must be very much lower than that necessary
  to render the same gases incandescent in Geissler's tubes.
     Still, according to Kirchhoff's theorem, the temperature may
  not be lower than that of a perfectly black body in a state of
  incandescence, the continuous spectrum of which, in the places
  corresponding     to the aurora-spectrum,    is of equal brightness
  with this.
     From these considerations it results that all the gas-spectra,
  of various orders, which we can artificially produce can, generally
  speaking, only belong to high temperatures ; for the relatively
  great brightness of so small a quantity of the incandescent par
 ticles shows that there must be a great emission of light from

each  individual particle, and this can only be effected by a high
temperature.
   If, on the other hand, we observe very simple and faintly
luminous spectra where, in spite of the marvellously tenuous
distribution of the substance (as in the aurora borealis, the co
rona, the zodiacal light, and nebulae), considering the enormous
thickness of the radiant layers it must be admitted that a great
number of luminous particles are effective, the temperature of
the gases here incandescent may in general be relatively low.
These considerations satisfactorily corroborate the conjecture of
Lockyer *, that the simple spectra of nebulas do not belong to
high, but to relatively low temperatures.
     Remark.   — Probablythe admissibility of the comparison above
instituted between the aurora borealis and a Geissler's tube
might be doubted, because in the latter the gas, on being heated,
cannot expand, as in the aurora, and hence its density remains
constant.    Yet, as regards the above considerations, but very
little importance can be ascribed to this circumstance, because
the diminution of the density is only a secondary effect of the
increase of temperature, and occurs relatively much later than
the optical effect of the incandescence ; and even if it were taken
into account, it would necessitate only unimportant alterations
in the example treated.     On the other hand, I consider it pro
bable that at least a part of the remarkable phenomena of motion
observed in the aurora borealis are to be referred to the disturb
ances of equilibrium arising from such important differences of
temperature in the extremely rarefied strata of our atmosphere.

frMIE proposition        which I understand     is good thermodyna-
 J- mics, though        to my mind very questionable mechanics,
may be thus stated.       If P and Q are the forces tending respec
tively  to  contract  and   expand the volume V of a unit of gas,
and  if     —       = 0,  and  if actual contraction of V does take
        (P Q)8V
place by the uniform descent of the piston through the space 5V,
then the internal energy of the gas will be augmented by the
energy due to the action of P through the space 8V.
   Those who accept this proposition do so in the belief that it is as
                                 is is,
true in mechanics (that      when the energy spoken of regarded as
                                                                 is
molecular motion) as          in thermodynamics, where such energy
                                it
is identified with heat.     And they admit, as      mechanical prin-

ciple, that when (P — Q)5.r=0, P can generate no motion, but
with the remarkable reservation that this is to be understood
only of motion in the point or body to which P and Q are actu
ally applied : but it seems to be held that, under certain cir
cumstances at least, P may augment the motions of other bodies
to which it is not applied.
   In order to maintain the equality of the forces acting upon
the piston during its descent, and therefore the uniformity
of its motion, it is necessary, since Q increases during the con
traction of V, to augment P also by a quantity constantly
equal to the augmentation        of Q.    Mr. Rankine finds M -j-,
                                                                  ut
where M is the mass of the piston, aud u its velocity, for the
value of this increment of P.         And he finds the expression
2m . u . (u + v) for the increment of the internal energy of the gas
caused by the descent of the piston through the space udt.        He
states as his final result that Yudt + Mudu = 2mu. (u+v)dt,
which he interprets in words to mean that the internal energy
of the gas will be increased by a quantity represented by the
work done byf + the energy lost by the piston through retardation.
   I cannot admit the correctness of the equation in which Mr.
Rankine has expressed the final result of this his corrected in
vestigation.       I
                If have myself rightly apprehended the argument
he has followed, the result should have been symbolically ex
pressed as follows.
   Before the motion the equality of action and reaction gives
                          P .udt = Q,udt,
during and after the motion we have
               P. udt + ~Mudu = Qudt + 2
therefore
                       M.udu =
And this result, being independent of both P and Q, is conclu
sive against the proposition it was advanced to support, viz. that
the energy generated was to be proportional to the whole action
of P through udt or to Vudt,
   But, on the other hand, I must admit that although it sup
ports the principle I have been contending for, that when new
energy is generated it is due to the difference between P and Q
and not to the entire action of either of them, yet so far as it
seems to show that some new energy is generated in contraction,
even while P and Q are always in equilibrium, I am bound to re
move this difficulty, or else to admit that a contrary opinion to my
own has been, at least to a certain extent, established.

words, of two spectroscopes, each of which may be used singly,
and which are in part complementary to each other.            The one
part, which is a simple direct-vision spectroscope, is provided with
a prism of novel construction.       This prism consists of five ele
ments, two of which are of flint glass, each having a refracting-
angle of 84°; the other three prisms are of crown glass; one of
them has also a refracting-angle of 84°, the other two of 87°. as
shown in Plate II. fig. 4.
    This portion of the apparatus is furnished with a positive eye
piece with an equivalent focal length of 1 inch, and it is also
provided with a cylindrical lens of 1 inch radius.        The arrange
ment of this portion of the apparatus is shown in fig. 1.
    The compound spectroscope, which is represented in fig. 2, is
provided with a similar spectral prism.        It has a tube furnished
with a slit, and a collimator, and likewise an observing-telescope.
The object-glasses of the latter and of the collimator are of the
same focal length, namely 4 inches; their aperture is ^ of an inch.
    The observing-telescope carries, moreover, a needle-micrometer
with an eyepiece of ^-inch focal length. It is also provided
with two red sun -glasses, which admit of being used either singly
or together.     This compound spectroscope is moreover furnished
with a small divided position-circle situated at B.
    The spectral prism can be unscrewed from the simple appa
ratus (fig. 1) and inserted at A, between the observing-telescope
and the spectral prism of the compound              apparatus (fig. 2),
whereby the dispersion of the spectroscope is doubled, and the
entire instrument rendered available for the observation of the
solar protuberances.
    With the view of such observations, a peculiar construction has
been given to the slit (fig. 3), by means of which, through the
 medium of a screw, its twjD steel jaws can be simultaneously
 moved away from the centre and opened to the distance of nearly
 a quarter of an inch.     The slit is further fitted with an arrange
 ment for throwing aside the illuminating prism that is employed
 in comparing the spectra of flames.         This latter movement is
 effected by means of a small lever, to the long arm of which the
 prism in question is attached, and the short arm of which is in
 serted into an aperture in the rotating ring R. When such a
 motion has been given to this ring that the aperture at which
 the light enters (a) is closed, the prism no longer remains oppo
 site the slit, so that the cone of rays derived from the refractor
 has then free passage through the full width of the jaws.
     The lateral movement near K on the observing-telescope
 enables any separate colour of the spectrum to be brought into
 position, while a similar movement at K' near the slit serves for
 altering the angle of incidence of the rays, thus bringing into

the field of view the extreme portions of the spectrum, even when
extended by the employment of the two systems of prisms.
   With respect to the rectification of the instrument, it is only
necessary to observe that all the parts that unscrew are provided
with suitable marks ; and, speaking generally, the apparatus may
be looked upon as in adjustment when the so-called Fraunhofer
lines are situated at right angles to the spectrum.
   The cylindrical lens, it should be remarked, is to be employed
only iu stellar observations ; in other cases it should be removed.
It admits of being turned round in position 90°, and can thus
be placed either normal or parallel to the slit.      If, for instance,
the cylindrical lens is situated within the focus of the refractor
and with its axis normal to the direction of the slit, it will elon
gate the little circular disk of a star parallel to the slit, or, in
other words, it will form a luminous line coinciding with the
direction of the slit, whereas in the opposite case the caustic of
the cylindrical lens will lie crosswise to the slit.         It should
therefore be placed normal to the slit when observing in conver
ging light, or when placed within the focus of the refractor ;
while, on the contrary, it has to be set parallel to the slit when
observing beyond the focus, or in diverging light, in which case
the caustic of the cylindrical lens coincides with the slit as before.
And since the rotation of the cylindrical lens causes a change of
direction in its caustic to the amount of 90°, this motion admits
of the apparatus being always brought into the proper position,
whether the cylindrical lens be in the converging or in the diver
ging cone of rays of the refractor.
   Bearing in mind that the little observing- telescope and the
collimator are of equal focal length, it is easy to calculate the
spectroscopic amplification of the refractor employed.         The am
plification is equal to twice that of the focal length of the refrac
tor, expressed in French inches, when the half-inch eyepiece is
used, and is equal to the simple focal length when, instead of
the half-inch, the 1-inch eyepiece is employed.        Were the focal
length   of the observing-telescope  and of  the collimator  not equal,
the amplification would increase as the focal length of the colli
mator diminished, and vice versd.
   With reference to the efficiency of the instrument here de
scribed,  I  beg leave, in conclusion, to quote the following pas
sage, translated from a letter addressed to me by Dr. Schellen of
Cologne, on the 27th of September last. The writer therein says,
" after duly adjusting your refractor of 34 lines aperture, in the
possession of Herr von Camphausen,        I was not only enabled to
see at once brightly and with great distinctness the lines H «, H/3,
and D 3, but also, on widening the aperture of the slit, to observe
at different places on the sun's limb various solar protuberances."

             XX. Estimation of Zinc        on Galvanised  Iron.
                By THOMAS T. P. BKUCE WARKEN*.
 ]%/T
       ANUFACTURED            articles of iron, when coated with zinc,
1.T-L     are said to be
                         " galvanized."        The word galvanized was
probably    suggested  by  the   fact  that  iron  covered with zinc was,
in its earlier introduction, produced by means of galvanic action.
    Iron in the form of wire is galvanized by drawing through a
bath of molten zinc, and in other forms (as sheets &c.) by simple
immersion or dipping.        The surface of the iron being rendered
chemically    clean immediately before coming into contact with the
zinc, a portion of the zinc combines with the iron at its surface
and forms a thin layer of alloy, to which a further quantity of
zinc readily adheres.      The alloy of iron and zinc, when freed
from the     uncombined    zinc, is capable of taking up a definite
quantity of mercury, which, when carefully heated, is again given
 off without any apparent alteration in the alloy.
    The following process, which is based upon these considera
 tions, is recommended more especially to the notice of telegraph
 engineers for estimating quantitatively the amount of zinc on
 galvanized iron wires.
    The wire when weighed is carefully cleaned with dilute sul
 phuric acid and immersed in mercury for a few hours, or until
 all the zinc which is capable of being dissolved is removed. The
 crystalline amalgam, which after a short time forms on its sur
 face, should be wiped off and the wire left undisturbed at the
 bottom of the mercury for four or eight hours.
    The adhering particles of mercury being removed, the wire is
 well rubbed with a chamois leather and weighed.            The lossf will
 not only show the extra quantity of zinc on the wire beyond what
 is actually required for producing a chemically galvanized sur
 face, but will expose those parts of the wire to which the zinc has
 not combined and which would in a short time scale off. The
 wire, if properly galvanized, should be uniformly coated with
 amalgam, and present a bright silvery appearance when rubbed.
     This wire is now heated so as to expel the mercury, and again
    *
      Communicated by the Author.
    t To this must be added the weight of mercury retained by the alloy.

                       of Zinc on Galvanized     Iron.               1 33
 weighed when cooled.        From this loss we may obtain with tole
 rable exactness the amount of zinc which remains, and which
 immersion in mercury will not remove.
     This quantity of zinc appears to be combined with the iron, as
 it does not volatilize, and becomes very imperfectly oxidized when
 exposed for some time to a red heat under access to air.
     The existence of the zinc, after this treatment, may be shown
 by the readiness with which the iron wire again takes up mer
 cury, and admits of being polished.           The smallest quantity of
 zinc remaining on the wire becomes immediately visible by its
 lustrous appearance when rubbed after immersion in mercury :
 when the whole of the zinc is removed, the wire ceases to give a
 silvery appearance.      The removal of the zinc immediately in
 contact with the iron can only be effected by the oxidation of the
 iron and zinc together.
     Repeated experiments prove that this quantity of zinc, which
 is combined with the iron, can be readily ascertained from the
 quantity of mercury which sublimes when the wire is held in a
 non-oxidizing flame.       The mean of several observations shows
 that the mercury is taken up in the proportion of eleven parts to
  seven parts of zinc.    The difference between the extremes from
 which this mean is taken is '025 in eleven parts mercury.          The
 proportion   of zinc has been  verified   by analysis in the humid way.
     The following experiment will more clearly illustrate the ope
ration of the test : —
       Weight of galvanized wire         .   .   .   =50 grains.
       Weight after immersion in mercury             =46      „
       Weight after expelling mercury .          .   =45      „
 This will give 5 grains for the weight of zinc removed by immer
sion in mercury.
       Weight of mercury taken up by alloy =1 grain,
 which will represent O46 grain of zinc combined with the iron.
Consequently 50 grains galvanized iron wire contains 5'46 grains
zinc, of which only 0*46 is in chemical combination.
    In all the specimens examined, the irregularity in the thickness
of the zinc was so great that no reliance can be attached to its
estimated value.

XXI.    Researches on the Specific Heats, Densities, and Expansions
                of some Liquids.      By C. MARIGNAC*.
                        PART  I. SPECIFIC HEATS.
                 narrating, in    a previous memoirf, some prelimi
 WHEN       nary  researches upon the part played by water in saline
double decompositions, and its influence on the thermal effects
which accompany them,        I  noticed some apparently very singular
facts, but could not yet regard them as certain, since in my
calculations   I  had not taken account of the specific heats of the
solutions employed.
    Intending subsequently to resume their examination by more
rigorous methods,      I  undertook a series of researches on the spe
cific heats of the solutions.         I  was not then aware that M.
Thomsen had been for some time engaged in a work of the same
kind and had nearly brought it to a conclusion.               He has just
announced that the results of his observations (of which he has
already given a summary J) will shortly be published.
    Although this publication almost renders unnecessary the
continuation of my work, and mine are still far from being so
comprehensive as M. Thomson's researches, I wish to state the
results at which I had already arrived ; for several of the com
pounds on which       I  have been occupied have been likewise the
subject of his experiments, and it will not be uninteresting to
compare results which, obtained by very different methods, will
show, if one may judge from those he has already published, a
very satisfactory accordance.         I have also examined some solu
tions to which, perhaps, he has not turned his attention, and
which will lead me to add some general observations to those
which he has already presented.
    For the determination of the specific heats of aqueous solu
tions,  I  have used one of the most simple and well-known me
thods : it consists in measuring the rise of temperature produced
in an ascertained weight of liquid by the introduction of a
heated body.
    Two objections have been made to this method, impugning its
accuracy.
    The first is founded on the difficulty of knowing exactly the
temperature of the body which is immersed in the liquid, or
rather (for I shall show, further on, that in operating as I have

done, this knowledge is of little importance) of being perfectly
sure that it has always the same temperature.
   To remove this difficulty,              I
                                use as source of heat a mercurial
thermometer with a large reservoir.     As it is important that the
heat be transmitted as rapidly as possible, I have had thermo
meters constructed the reservoir of which is formed of a tube of
9 millims. internal diameter, and about 50 centime, long, spirally
coiled, so as to admit of being entirely immersed and agitated in
a cylindrical vessel containing from 150 to 250 cubic centimetres
of liquid. The value in water of these thermometers varied from
15 to 21 grammes.      The transmission of the heat was suffici
ently rapid for the maximum to be reached in 30 seconds.        The
stems of these thermometers were graduated in divisions of about
a millimetre, of equal capacity, and corresponding     to about                         T\y
of   degree.
     a
   Before the experiment, the thermometer     heated, in    stove,
                                                               is                  a
to   few degrees above the temperature at which
     a                                                  intended         it   is
to be immersed in the liquid.  It then taken out and gradually
                                                    is
approached to the vessel, and the immersion takes place the
moment the mercury arrives at the point determined.        do not              I
think that the error which one may commit in operating thus
will amount to quarter of   a  division (^ of degree); and as
                                        a                           a
the thermometer was immersed at          temperature about 40°
                                                         a
above that of the liquid of which the heating was to be mea
sured,   itevident that the possible error from this source could
              is
not exceed Y^fy-
   The second and more serious objection     the inexactness ofis
all the methods proposed for correcting the errors produced                             by
the radiation of the vessel which serves as calorimeter.     But
there    isvery simple means of rendering correction needless.
              a
Instead of comparing, as has generally been done, the variations
of temperature produced               by
                            the same source of heat in arbitrary
weights of water and the liquid whose specific heat we wish to
measure,       sufficient to reverse the problem, and determine
              it   is
the relative weights of water and of the liquid which undergo
the same alteration of temperature                       by
                                         the addition of the same
quantity of heat.    In this way, and especially the experiments    if
are made immediately after one another, in the same atmospheric
conditions, the influence of all exterior causes acts in precisely
the same manner iu each case, and consequently involves no
perturbation.
     Besides,           will
                   be understood that here absolute identity of
                   it
temperature    not     is
                    requisite.  Provided that, in the two experi
ments compared,    the  temperatures differ     only    few hun- by       a
dredths of   degree (which
                   a            very easy to ensure after
                                       it      is          single                  a
preliminary experiment), all correction may Le dispensed with.

136       M. C. Marignac    on (he Specific  Heats, Densities,
    Tlie variation of temperature produced in the liquid by the
immersion and agitation of the heated thermometer was mea
sured by a very sensible thermometer, the divisions on which
corresponded to -^ of a degree, and which was read by means
of a horizontal telescope.
    The saline solutions were contained in a silvered brass cylin
drical vessel, of which the value in water had been determined
by previous experiments, and found to be 13 grammes, including
the thermometer.      However, even a notable error in this value
would only involve a scarcely perceptible one in the result of the
experiments, since it would affect equally the specific heats of
water and the solution compared with it.
    For strongly acid liquids I used a vessel of very light glass, of
which the equivalent in water was 14-9 grammes.
    To avoid as much as possible accidental and variable external
influences, these vessels were suspended by their spread upper
brim, by means of a tin plate perforated with a circular hole, in
the middle of a large cylinder of the same metal, itself immersed
 in water at the surrounding temperature.
    For the experiments to be perfectly comparable, it is neces
 sary to wait, before commencing them, till the temperature of
 the liquid in the calorimeter is quite stationary under the influ
 ence of the external radiation and of the superficial evaporation.
 This makes the first experiment of a day rather long; but it is
 easy afterwards, by following the course of an exterior thermo
 meter, to bring the liquid immediately to such a temperature
 that it will not vary sensibly during a much longer time than
 the duration of a determination.
    When about to commence this investigation,          I  thought it
  would be sufficient for me to determine by a series of trials made
  upon water an empiric relation expressing, for each difference
 between the temperature of the heated thermometer and the
 temperature of the bath, the ratio of the quantities of heat given
 up by the first and gained by the second.          I
                                                But had to abandon
 this idea, and to compare directly the experiments made on each
 solution with similar experiments, made immediately before and
 after, on water.
              I
     In fact, have remarked that, while all the determinations
 made in one and the same day, or sometimes in two consecutive
 days when the atmospheric conditions have not changed, are in
  general very accordant, it is not quite so satisfactory when ex
 periments made at periods somewhat more distant are compared,
 even when the conditions of temperature are the same.           This
  may be due either to atmospheric influences other than the
  temperature (for example, the hygrometric state of the air), or
 to the fact that, at periods a little distant, one does not preserve

                  and Expansions   of some Liquids.              137
the same uniformity in the movements necessary for immersing
and agitating the heated thermometer in the bath.
    As each experiment could be made very rapidly, the determi
nation of the specific heat of each solution was always repeated
at least five or six times ; and the determination was made by
comparing the results with those of as many alternate similar
experiments on water.
    In reality this does not render the determinations laborious,
except in appearance ; for in order to compare experiments made
on a solution with those made on water, several days intervening
between the two series, it would be necessary to compare almost
daily the thermometer of the calorimeter and the heated ther
mometer with a standard one ; now this comparison, to attain
the necessary degree of precision, would take at least as much
time as the experiments relative to the determination of the spe
cific heats.
    In short, it ought to be remarked that this mode of operating
not only has the advantage of rendering all correction needless,
and of avoiding the errors that might result from a displacement
of the zero in the thermometers used, but also renders insensible
those which might be caused by an imperfection in the gradua
tion of the thermometers — an imperfection which it is impossible
completely to avoid in experiments where an error of -j^)0 of a
 degree has a very sensible influence on the results.     In compa
rative experiments on water and another liquid, if the heating is
 the same in both cases, and if the initial and final temperatures
are, within a few hundredths, the same in the one as in the
other, the determination is affected by the errors of graduation
of the thermometer to the exceedingly slight amount of only a
few hundredths of a degree.
   As the promised speedy publication of the memoir of M.
Thomsen on the same subject diminishes greatly the importance
of my own researches,      I do not purpose to give in detail the
numbers of all my experiments, but shall merely indicate the
mean results.
    I will nevertheless, in order to give the means of judging the
course    I have pursued and the agreement presented by the dif
ferent observations, state in detail the experiments which refer
to two series of determinations.     I take as examples those on the
specific heat of the solutions of hydrochloric acid containing, to
one molecule of acid (IIC1 = 36'5), 50 and 100 molecules of
water (900 and 1800) respectively.
   The study of these two solutions having taken place on two
consecutive days, under absolutely similar atmospheric condi
tions,  I  have united in a single .series all the experiments made
on water.

been obliged to take for the purpose tubes of rather thick glass.
It   results from this thickness, and the torsion they have under
gone, that they are extremely apt to break when subjected to
the abrupt changes of temperature produced                       by

   140       M. C. Marignac       on the Specific Heats, Densities,
   only reached at the end of three or four minutes, so that the
   slightest difference in the action of exterior causes, or in the
   agitation of the balloon, may exercise a perceptible influence on
   the result.    Very concordant results are nevertheless obtained
   when the external temperature remains nearly constant, provided
  great care is taken to keep the temperature of the calorimeter,
  for more than five minutes, absolutely invariable.
      By reason of the small specific heat of sulphide of carbon, I
   should have been obliged, if I had wished to make use of water
  in the experiments for comparison, to put only 10 grammes of it
  into the balloon, which would not have been sufficient to com
  pletely bathe the thermometer ; and it is to be feared that, under
  these conditions, the experiments would have been hardly com
  parable.     I therefore preferred to take for comparison sulphide
  of carbon itself, a liquid the specific heat of which is well known.
  M. Regnault has determined very carefully, and has given the
  following formula for the calculation of the quantity of heat ne
  cessary to raise its temperature from 0 to         f  :—
                   Q=0-2352314* +0-00008143131 P.
      By means of this formula it is calculated that the mean spe
  cific heat, between 1 7° and 44°, the limits of my experiments,
  is 0'2374.       The experiments of M. Him* indicate a rather
  higher number ; for he finds 0-23878 for the specific heat at 30°.
  1 have adopted the mean number 0'238.
      Before commencing the determinations which relate to these
               I
 solutions, made a great number of preliminary determinations
 on water, in order to know the conditions necessary to be fulfilled
 to make them comparable.
      I ascertained that as long as the quantity of water in the bal
 loon remains the same, we may vary its temperature at the
 moment of immersion, even to a considerable degree, without
producing any sensible change in the value of the ratio           r=
                                                                     f—  (i
                                                                            j
                                                                     —t
so that all the experiments made in these conditions lead to the
same number for the equivalent in water of the balloon and the
thermometer contained in it.
     But if we change the weight of water in the balloon, we find
a different number to express the equivalent               in question, and
the new series of experiments is not comparable with the former.
     It is easy to account for these results, if we remark that there
are two principal causes of loss of heat — the exterior radiation
of the calorimeter, and the fact that, at the moment the maxi
mum is indicated, the liquid in the balloon has still a tempera
ture higher than that attributed to it in the calculation when it
is supposed to be brought to the temperature of the calorimeter.

                 and Expansions   of some Liquids.                   141
   Now the time occupied by the experiments remains the same
whatever the elevation of temperature obtained, since the maxi
mum is attained, towards the end, so much the more quickly as
the excess of temperature, being greater, determines a stronger
radiation. Hence the first of the causes of loss above mentioned
is nearly proportional to the elevation of temperature attained,
so that the ratio of the variations of temperature of the balloon
and of the calorimeter is always reduced by it in the same pro
portion ; consequently the ratio remains constant for all the ex
periments of one and the same series.
    As to the loss of heat produced by the second cause, it is pro
 portional both to the amount by which the interior temperature
 exceeds the exterior (and this will be proportional to the heigh
 of the temperature of the calorimeter), and to the weight of
 water contained in the balloon.
    It follows that only those experiments can be compared in
 which the liquid contained in the balloon represents the same
 value in water, but it is not necessary that the initial temperature
 shall be always the same.
    Consequently    I united in one series all the experiments made
 at different times on pure sulphide of carbon, to deduce from
 them the value of the balloon and the thermometer, only taking
 care to use always nearly the same weight of that liquid (about
 43 grins.), and afterwards to take of the various solutions weights
 equivalent to that quantity as regards their specific heat.
    In stating the results of my observations,       I will commence
 with the aqueous solutions.

 notation, hydrogen being taken as unity ; they are therefore
 identical with those of M. Thomsen.
    In the Tables of results I designate by
    n the number of molecules of water to one molecule of the
        substance dissolved ;
    c the specific heat of the solution per unit of weight ;
    p the molecular weight of the solution ;
    C=pc the molecular heat, both that given by experiment, and
        that resulting from an empiric formula indicated further on
      for   each case.

the water contained in it.      To obtain these differences     have

    The empiric formula by means of which the above results were
obtained, and the specific heats of any other solution may be
calculated,   is : —
    But it must be remarked that for solutions containing less
 than five molecules of water it would give quite inaccurate results.
    Sulphuric acid is one of the bodies the specific heat of which
has been already made known by M. Thomsenf.                      His experi
 ments are not directly comparable with mine, because he refers
his solutions to anhydrous sulphuric acid, to which he supposes
 added 5, 10, 20, &c. equivalents of water.              But it is easy to
 compare his results with those deduced from the preceding for
 mula for the molecular heats. We thus find, n having the same

   The agreement is    as satisfactory as could be expected.
   I feared that the method employed in these determinations,
very suitable for saline solutions or for mixtures of acid with
water in excess, would involve much uncertainty in the case of
sulphuric acid monohydrated or mixed with a very small pro
portion of water.
   Indeed, such a liquid tending, instead of evaporating in con
tact with the air, to absorb humidity from it and become heated,
the experiments are no longer made in identical conditions with
those of the experiments for comparison on water ; so that, to
obtain a temperature stationary at the beginning of an experi
ment, the temperature of the acid-bath must be about 4° above
the atmospheric.     Besides, the great difference in specific heat
of the liquids obliges us to use very different volumes of them.
   This fear induced me to repeat the determinations for the mo
nohydrated acid, alone and with from one to five equivalents of
water, by the second method — the one          I used for the solutions
in sulphide of carbon.
    But then another difficulty is encountered.        Either on account
of the viscosity of the concentrated acid, or because the greater
volume we are obliged to put in the balloon in order to have a
calorific mass equal to that of the water prevents the different
 parts from being so well mixed by the agitation, the transmis
sion of the heat to the water of the calorimeter takes place more
slowly. Now, if the experiment lasts longer, the losses by ra
diation are no longer identical.          This inconvenience can be
remedied, after some trials, by so regulating the velocity of the
agitation of the balloon in the calorimeter that each of the ex
 periments shall occupy the same time.
    This second series of experiments gave the following results,

    Let us now compare these results with those of the preceding
 experiments   or obtained by other observers.

1 44       M. C. Marignac       on the Specific Heats, Densities,
   H'OSO3.         I found:—
                  c=0-3315 between 17° and 22°             ;
                  c= 0-3363          „     20 „ 56.
   These numbers confirm one another, their difference being just
that which should result from the difference of the temperatures.
   Previous determinations had given : —
   0-3095, Person*.
   0-343 between 21° and 46°, H. Koppf.
   0-3413       „     13 „       77, PfaundlerJ, old determinations.
   G'355        „     22   „     80,   Pfaundler§, recent experiments.
   It may also, by analogy, be concluded, from the whole of the
observations of the last-mentioned          savant with respect to the
highest temperatures, that the result would have been about
0-352 between 22° and 60°.
   We see that my results are a little lower than those obtained
 by MM. H. Kopp and Pfaundler.                Supposing that they used
in their experiments sulphuric acid merely concentrated by pro
longed boiling, this alone would go far to explain the difference.
 In fact, such an acid contains fa of an equivalent of water too
 much. We should therefore have, starting from the result I
 obtained for the monohydrated            acid (namely, c = 0-3363 and
 C = 33):—
   99-5 for the molecular weight of the acid concentrated              by
            boiling,
    34-5 for its molecular heat, and
     0'3467 for its specific heat.
    HaO, S03 + Aq.        I  find c=0'4411      between 20° and 56°.
    This result agrees exactly        with the last observations    of M.
 Pfaundler ; for he obtained
                      0-447 between 22° and 80°,
                      0-444       „      22    „ 70,
    H80,S08+5Aq.            I  obtained
                      0-5764 between 15° and 19°,
                      05833         „     20 „ 56.
   The difference between these results appears to correspond
 well with that between the temperatures.
   The results, therefore, of these determinations seem to me to
confirm those of the first series.
   It will moreover be remarked that these experiments confirm

the first equivalent of water added to monohydrated sulphuric

that of the water added, while for every further dilution there is
a very considerable loss of specific heat.        This is probably con

ordinary temperature.       I have not been able to operate on solu

                                                 9800°
    We see that for solutions containing more than 200 molecules
of water the specific heat is less than that of water alone, and
that the specific heat is always diminished by the addition of
water to a solution of sulphate of soda.
    Observations on the specific heats of these solutions have
already been published by M. Schuller*.            His experiments were
not made on solutions of the same standard as those which                   I
 examined ; but he has deduced from his results an empiric for
 mula by which the specific heat may be calculated for all propor
 tions of salt dissolved.    This calculation, applied to the solutions
 which  I  have studied, would give the following results, which            I

  than the half of the sum of those of sulphuric acid and the neu

  produced by that mixture.

always less than that of the water by itself which they contain.
This is true even of the most concentrated solution I have ex
amined, which contained 24-5 for 100 of acid.                There is thus
always a diminution of specific heat by the mixture of the water
with these solutions.

obtained by M. Thomsen have been already published.                   Here

 sugar    isalways sensibly equal to the sum of those of the two
 liquids mixed.
    It may therefore be admitted that the specific heat of any so
 lution of sugar      the sum of those of the water and the sugar,
                           is
 that the mean number 147 expresses the molecular heat of sugar
 in the liquid state, and that its specific heat per unit of weight
 is consequently 0*430.
    According to M. H. Kopp, the specific heat of sugar in the
 solid state    0-301, its molecular heat 103.
                     is                          The ratio of these
 numbers to those belonging to the liquid state offers nothing
 abnormal.

 of salts, acids, and bases.  In consequence of the difficulty of finding such
 bodies presenting in addition the conditions of great solubility, perfectly
 definite composition, and not combining with water, the aqueous solution
 of sugar     the only one
               is            am aware of suitable for these experiments.
                                     I                                                      I

on pure sulphide of carbon, taking for the specific heat of this
liquid the number 0-238.             Five series of observations, made
during    these  researches,     served    to determine the equivalent in
water of the balloon containing the liquid, with the interior
thermometer, which showed the temperature stationary at 43°'59
 at the moment the balloon was immersed in the calorimeter.
     The calorimeter, in every case, contained 140 grms. of water,
to which must be added 13 grms. as the equivalent of the vessel
and the thermometer.           The balloon contained about 44 grms. of
sulphide of carbon, or of each solution a weight determined by
a preliminary experiment to obtain always the same heating of
the calorimeter.

     18-1 represents the molecular heat of sulphide of carbon ; the
 last column expresses therefore the amount by which the pre
 sence of an atom of sulphur increases the specific heat of the
 solution.
     According to M. Person, the specific heat of melted sulphur,
  between 120° and 150°, is 0'234; its atomic heat is therefore
  7'5 ; but the number would certainly be less, if it could be de
  termined at a temperature of from 18° to 43°.
     Thus the atomic heat of sulphur dissolved in sulphide of car
  bon is only a little less than that of melted sulphur, and is
  diminished in only a slight proportion by a considerable dilution :
  in fact the last solution contains only 4 per cent, of sulphur.

     According to M. Person, the specific heat of melted phosphorus
  would be 0-2045, consequently its atomic heat 6-3.
     Phosphorus enters, then, with all its specific heat into con
  centrated solutions in sulphide of carbon.           This heat diminishes
  gradually,   but very slightly,     in  solutions  more  and more dilute.
    Bromine.   — I first  determined,      as a means of control, the specific
  heat of liquid bromine compared with sulphide of carbon.                For
  this purpose I had to operate on 90-5 grms. of bromine.
     For its specific heat between 18° and 43°-6 I found 0-1125.

This number agrees exactly with the determinations of M. Reg-
nault, who found 0-11294 between 13° and 58°. The atomic
heat is therefore equal to 9.
    For the specific heat of the mixture Br + CS2 (51 per cent, of
bromine) I found 0'174, and consequently 27' 1 for the molecular
heat.     This is exactly the sum of the heats of the two liquids in
the mixture.

    According to    MM. Favre     and Silbermann, the specific heat of
fused iodine is 0-1082; therefore its atomic heat is 13-7.
     Thus iodise is dissolved in sulphide of carbon without its spe
 cific heat being sensibly diminished.
     A solution with 10 molecules of sulphur, containing 14'3 per
cent, of iodine, is very near saturation.      I could not operate on
 more concentrated liquids.
     We see that all these solutions present a character very dif
 ferent from that observed in the aqueous solutions of acids and
 salts.    The diminution of specific heat resulting from solution,
 or from dilution when this exists (as in the case of sulphur and
 phosphorus), is always within narrow limits.           Above all, the
 molecular heat of these solutions never becomes inferior to that
 of the solvent alone.
                          General Observations.
      In the preliminary summary of his great work on the specific
  heats of aqueous solutions, M. Thomsen announces that he can
 deduce from his observations the general conclusion that a dimi
  nution of specific heat always results from the mixture of water
 with a solution.
      The generality which he attributes to this law is perhaps de
  pendent on the fact that all his researches were made upon cpm-
  binations belonging to one class (hydrated salts, acids, and
  bases).    It is known, in fact, that a mixture of water and alcohol
  has a specific heat superior to that of its elements.          It results
  from the facts reported in this memoir that solutions of sugar
  have a specific heat equal to that of their elements.             It may
  even be remarked that among the few bodies for which M.
  Thomsen has published the results of his experiments there, is
  one which behaves like sugar, viz. ammonia ; certainly the dif
  ferences do not reach the limits of error admitted by him as
  possible.
      But, with this reserve, it is nevertheless true that this dimi
  nution of specific heat is very general, and that its proportion is
  often very considerable.      Thus we have seen that a solution of

                         and Expansions   of some Liquids.                          151
 hydrochloric acid containing 24'5 per cent, of acid, or one mole
 cule for 6'25 of water, has a specific heat about 1 1 per cent, less
 than that of the water alone which it contains.
   .This is a very remarkable fact.      Indeed, some years ago*
M. H. Kopp showed, after a general recapitulation of the re
searches made by himself and his predecessors on the specific
heats of combinations, that the molecular specific heat of any
definite compound, organic or inorganic, is nearly equal to the
sum of the specific heats of its elements, —the differences being
either of the same order as the errors of the determinations or
as the differences which may result from a simple change in the
physical state of one and the same body.        We know, besides,
from the experiments of M. Regnault on alloys (that          on the           is,
combinations    which,         by
                            their indefinite  composition,  seem   to
come the nearest to solutions), that they are subject to the
 same approximate law.
     Itseems, then, that we are justified in regarding this as                           a
general principle. How           that does not apply to solutions
                                 is it      it                                           ?
Two hypotheses may be made on this subject —                 :
   This anomaly may be due to           purely physical cause. The
                                          a
laws resulting from the observations of MM. Kegnault and
 Kopp refer to the solid state of compound bodies perhaps they    ;
are true for that state only.
    But   ifthis were the fact, all solutions ought to behave in the
 same manner and present an analogous diminution of specific
 heat in proportion as the dilution        increased.   Now we have
 just seen that       not so.
                     it   is     There        is is
                                            sometimes an increase in
 the specific heat   and in other cases
                         ;                    remains equal to that of
                                                  it
 the liquid mixed.    The chemical nature of the bodies evidently
 exercises     great influence on these phenomena; they must,
                a
then, have     chemical cause.
                a
    We are thus led to the second hypothesis.         The specific heat
of  solution ought always to be equal to the sum of the specific
     a
heats of the bodies mixed, except the small variations resulting
from modification of the physical properties (cohesion, dilatabi-
lity, &c.).         But most solutions
                                     have   very unstable chemical
                                                      a
 constitution, and one that varies both with the degree of dilu
tion and with the temperature.       Every change of temperature
involves, then,   change in the chemical constitution,
                     a                                      chemical      a
work,  which    itself
                    is the source of an absorption or    disengage    a
ment of heat.    This, of necessity, augments or diminishes         so              by
much that which must be transmitted to the solution to change
its temperature, and consequently its apparent specific heat.
Therefore the difference between the specific heat of        solution       a
and the sum of those of its elements will be the proof, and ap-

152        M. C. Marignac        on the Specific Heats, Densities,
proximately the measure, of the work produced by the chemical
reaction determined by the change in the temperature of the
liquid.
    We ought hence to conclude that, for example, when a mix
ture of water and alcohol is heated, there is produced between
these bodies a reaction by which heat is absorbed, while solu
tions of saline compounds undergo, when their temperature is
raised, a chemical transformation which disengages heat ; finally,
certain solutions (as the aqueous ones of ammonia and sugar,
and the solutions of simple bodies in sulphide of carbon) should
present no change in their chemical constitution at different
temperatures.
    It would be venturing too far into the domain of hypothesis
to attempt to state precisely the nature of the chemical reactions
that may be determined by change of temperature in a solution.
 It may be that they affect only the state of combination, more
 or less intimate, of the solvent and the body dissolved ; but it
 is possible that they may be of a nature more profound, and in
certain cases affect even the composition of the body dissolved —
 for example, that a chloride may be transformed into a hydro-
 chlorate.     It is certain, however, that if two classes be made,
 the first including those bodies the dissolving of which induces a
 considerable change in their specific heats, the second those
 which are not so affected, it will be remarked that the latter are
 of such a nature that it is impossible to suppose any alteration
 produced in their chemical constitution, and that nothing seems
 to indicate that they can form definite combinations with the
 solvent* ; while the same cannot be said of the saline compounds,
 acid or basic, all of which belong to the first class.
     Besides,   I do not pretend to be the first to advance this hypo
 thesis.    I  cannot say where it is first to be found ; but the
 same idea is expressed by M. Pfaundler in a note on the specific
 heats of the first three hydrates of sulphuric acidf.              Having
 ascertained that the addition of one molecule of water to the
 monohydrated        acid augments the specific heat by a quantity
 equal to that of the water added, while the addition of a se
 cond molecule only increases it by a little more than half
 that quantity, he thence concludes that probably the action
 of the heat determines a chemical modification in the solution
    * Ammonia (which, from M. Thomson's experiments, belongs to this
  second class) seems, at first view, to form an exception, its chemical cha
 racter giving an air of probability to the notion that it would combine
 with water ; nevertheless the properties of the solution, and its total de
 composition by spontaneous evaporation, have always caused the rejection
 of the idea that it could be regarded as a combination.

     containing three molecules       of water, which changes its appa
     rent specific heat.
         Pursuing the same hypothesis, he has more recently* pro
     posed the study of the specific heats of solutions and their ele
     ments as a means of determining the degree of dissociation
     produced in them by heat.             I  cannot, however, share his
     opinion of the results    to  be  expected from this study ; for his
     calculations rest upon a principle the accuracy of which is not
     demonstrated — namely, that the heat disengaged by the total
     combination of the two bodies would be the same at all tem-
—
     peratures.
          It must be acknowledged that this hypothesis of a change in
     the chemical constitution of solutions according to the tempera
     ture removes a great difficulty.      It very easily accounts for what
     takes place in a mixture of water and alcohol.          The combination
   •
     of these two bodies disengages heat; it seems very natural to
     admit that the rise of temperature of the mixture determines a
     dissociation, which must necessarily absorb heat and conse
     quently increase the apparent specific heat. On the contrary, it
     is difficult to conceive that the rise of temperature of a mixture
     of water and sulphuric acid determines a chemical action that
      disengages heat — that is to say, a more intimate combination.
               I
          Yet do not think that this difficulty ought to cause the re-
""
     jection before-hand of this hypothesis as baseless ; and it appears
     to me useful to enunciate or recall these theoretic ideas at a time
      when several able investigators are directing their researches to
      these questions.
           I will add another consideration which seems to me to de
      monstrate well the existence of this internal chemical work, deter
       mined by the change of temperature, in certain solutions.           Let
      us compare water and a saline solution, that of chloride of sodium
      for example.     This is less compressible than water ; therefore
      more work must be consumed to produce an equal change of
      volume without alteration of temperature.            But, on the other
       hand, its coefficient of dilatation is much higher than that of
       water, and its specific heat less.    For these two reasons a much
      less quantity of heat is necessary to produce the same change of
      volume accompanied by a rise of temperature.             These two facts,
       apparently contradictory, can only be explained by admitting
       that an internal chemical work, determined by the rise of tem
      perature, has furnished a part of the heat necessitated by the
      dilatation.
           In a subsequent article I will exhibit the results of my study
       of the densities and dilatations of the aqueous solutions the spe
       cific heats of which have been determined in this memoir.

Derbyshire."       By the Eev. J. M. Mello, M.A., F.G.S.
     The author describes the sequence of the rocks seen in a quarry
 in Tideswell Dale as follows : — Beneath a thin layer of surface-soil
 is a bed of Toadstone, containing concretionary balls, and much de
composed above ; beneath this is Toadstone in large blocks of inde
finite shape, very hard, dark-green, and apparently doleritic, nine
 or ten feet thick, passing downwards into a coarse and much de
 composed bed, partly amygdaloid, partly vesicular, about 1 foot
thick.     Beneath the Toadstone rocks, and without any sharp line of
demarcation, is a thick bed of indurated red clay, 3 yards in thick
 ness, presenting a regularly prismatic columnar structure, resting on
 a thin bed of greenish-yellow clay containing fragments of lime
 stone, which covers beds of good Derbyshire marbles containing
 corals.     The author suggests that the columnar clay-bed may
perhaps be a local development of that which forms partings in the
limestone near Litton Tunnel.
     11. " On the Physics of Arctic Ice as explanatory of the Glacial
 Remains in Scotland."       By Dr. Robert Brown, M.A., F.R.G.S., <fcc.
     In this paper the author entered into an extended inquiry how far
 the formation of the boulder-clays and other glacial remains in
 Scotland and the north of England can be accounted for on the
theory of a great ice-covering having at one time overlain the country
 in much the same manner as it does now Greenland and other
 extreme Arctic countries.        Taking the hypothesis of Agassiz as his
  groundwork, Dr. Brown entered into a minute description of the
 present glacier-system of Greenland, and the nature of Arctic ice-
 action, and into an inquiry how far glacial remains in Britain
 correspond with those at present in course of formation in Green
 land and at the bottom of Baffin's Bay, Davis Straits, and the
 fjords and bays adjoining these seas. These inquiries were com
 menced in the year 1861, and have been continued at intervals
 ever since, up to the present summer, in various portions of the
 Arctic regions, the continent of Europe, in Great Britain, and in
 North America across to the Pacific. The result of these extended
 researches have led him to conclude :— 1. That the subazoic boulder-
 clay corresponds with the moraine profand e which underlies glaciers,
 and in all likelihood is the immediate base on which the ice cap of
Greenland rests. 2. That the fossiliferous, laminated, or brick-clays
find their counterpart in the thick impalpable mud which the sub-
 glacial streams are pouring into the sea, filling up the fjords, even
shoaling the sea far out, and, in some cases, absolutely turning the

                 Royal Geological    Society of Ireland.           155
glaciers from their course into other valleys.       Allowing the very
moderate computation that this impalpable mud accumulates at the
rate of only six inches per annum, a deposit of fifty feet in a cen
tury must form.
    If Scotland was at one time covered with an ice cap, or had gla
ciers of any extent (as cannot he doubted), then this deposit must
have been equally forming, and as a geological formation must be
accounted for.     No difference could be detected between this glacial
mud and the present brick-clays ; and every fact went to show that
it was to this that we must look for the formation of these lami
nated fossiliferous clays. The amount of earth deposited on the
bottom by icebergs was very insignificant indeed, and could in no
degree account for the boulder-clay, though it was shown that much
of the boulder-drift in some places could be so accounted for. It was,
however, demonstrated that there was a great distinction between
the boulders which belonged to the moraine profonde and those which
were carried off on icebergs as part of the ordinary lateral moraines.
    The fjords, as already partially advocated in a paper in the Jour
nal of the Eoyal Geographical Society (vol. xxxix.), he considered
 due to glacier action, the glaciers having taken possession of these
 fjords when they were mere valleys, when the coast was higher than
 now. He further showed that the American explorers are in
 error when they describe the coast of Greenland as rising to the
 north of 73°, and subsiding to the south of that parallel. There had
 been a former rise of the coast, and a fall was now in course of
 progress through the whole extent.       Whether these had previously
 alternated with other rises and falls is not clearly evidenced by
 remains ; but no doubt exists that a rise preceded the present sub
 sidence.   Numerous facts were adduced in support of this assertion.
 The remainder of Dr. Brown's paper was occupied in an attempt to
 apply the doctrines regarding the physical action of Arctic ice-
  action to account for the Scottish glacial remains, and to deduce
 therefrom evidence      regarding the changes Scotland underwent
 during,  and  subsequent to, the glacial period.

 Geological Survey of Ireland,

 castle Coal-field, and its relation to the Carboniferous Rocks of the
 West of Scotland."      Read January 11, 1871.
     The object of the paper was to prove that the coal-field of Bally-
 castle, co. Antrim, was referable to the type of the lower coal-field
 of Scotland, and consequently of the age of the Lower Carboniferous
 series — in other words, of the Mountain-limestone.
    The Carboniferous series of Ballycastle, which had been described
 in 1829 by Sir R. Griffith, F.R.S.*, was shown to consist of three
 divisions, in descending order: —

 Dublin Society, 1829.

   1.     The Upper, consisting of massive sandstones, shales, with
        beds of coal, black-band and clay-band, ironstone, &c. (Lingula
        squamiformis).
  2.      The Middle,     consisting of a thin bed of limestone lying
        between   shales, with carboniferous-limestone genera and species
        of shells, crinoids, and corals.
  3.     The Lower, consisting of massive       reddish grit and conglo
        merate with thin beds of shale.
   The author showed that the Carboniferous Limestone of Ireland
undergoes in its extension northwards changes similar to those of the
same formation in Britain when traced from Derbyshire into Nor
thumberland and Scotland.      The calcareous member thins away and
is replaced by sedimentary strata of sandstone and shale, showing
approximately terrestrial conditions productive of coal and ironstone.
It was thus that in the case of the Glasgow coal-field the limestone
of Derbyshire, several thousand feet in thickness, was represented by
only thin bands of earthy limestone interstratified with a thick
series of grits, shales, &c., with ironstone and coal.      In a similar
manner the Ballycastle coal-field, with only a few feet of limestone
shown in the cliffs of ttte Bay, was the representative of the Carbo
niferous Limestone of the centre of Ireland, nearly 3000 feet in
thickness.
    Mr. Hull considered the lower division (No. 3) of the Ballycastle
beds (as above described) to be undoubtedly the representative of the
 " calciferous sandstone series " of the Geological Survey, which lies
 at the base of the Carboniferous rocks of the West of Scotland, and
 that the middle and upper divisions (Nos. 2 and 1) correspond to
the Carboniferous Limestone series, or lower coal-field of that country.
    As regards the palaeontological evidence, it was in favour of this
 view as far as it had been studied.    Out of thirty-three species ob
 served in the limestone band of Ballycastle Bay, 50 per cent, had
 been described in the Lower Carboniferous rocks of the West of
 Scotland ; and one of the uppermost seams of coal lying above the
 limestone had yielded Lingula squamiformis, a form characteristic of
 the Limestone series in the north of England, Scotland*, and Ireland.
 Mr. W. H. Baily, F.G.S., concurred in the view of the age of these
 beds on palseontological grounds.
    The author concluded by pointing out several features of similarity
 between the Ballycastle beds and the lower coal-series of the West
 of Scotland, such as the occurrence of several beds of " black-band
                                                                        "
 ironstone, the hydraulic and earthy character of the limestone of
 Ballycastle Bay, exactly resembling the "Arden" and "Cowglen"
 bands of Glasgow.      Some uncertainty still remained whether there
 were any beds in the Ballycastle district as high in the geological
 series as the millstone-grit, or true coal-measures ; but until more
 light could be brought to bear on this question by further explora
 tion, and a complete investigation by the Government surveyors, the
  author meanwhile regarded the whole series as Lower Carboniferous.

Daniell's elements, to the combination copper and zinc in dilute sul
phuric acid, and the thermo-elements German silver and copper, cop

wise specially mentioned, the determinations were made by Poggen-
dorff's compensation method. The electromotive forces are throughout
expressed according to Ohm's law, e=wi, where the resistance to is
expressed in Siemens's units, and the intensity i in the magnetic unit
introduced by Weber.         The electromotive forces thus measured I
shall express by Siemens-Weber.
   To measure the electromotive forces of the hydroelectric circuit, a
tangent-compass of twenty-four turns was used, the mean diameter
of which was 258'4 millims.        The coils formed a circuit with a rect
angular section 27 millims. in breadth and 9'4 millims. in height.
The magnetic needle was a rectangular magnet 20 millims. in length
with pointers affixed.
     I will here give a formula for such a tangent-compass for the
correction of the first degree, which can be frequently applied in

very delicate reflecting galvanometer was determined in Weber's unit.
A  second galvanoscope with an astatic needle, as well as the Siemens's
scale, was used in the experiments to reduce the current in the ther

            ON THE DURATION OP FLASHES OF LIGHTNING.
        BY o. N. ROOD.       (FROM A LETTER TO DR. w. GIBBS.)
    After the completion of my first set of experiments on the dura
 tion of the discharge of a Leyden jar, I became anxious to make
 some measurements of the duration of a flash of ordinary lightning,
 which may be considered equivalent to the discharge of an im
 mense jar with an enormous striking-distance.       The results of Fed-
 dersen have shown that the duration of the discharge is increased by
 an addition to the size of the jar, as well as by augmentation of the
 striking-distance ; and as both these quantities are so large with a
 flash of lightning, it was reasonable to expect that the duration of
 its discharge would be prolonged in some corresponding ratio.
 During the violent thunder-storm of last August, which occurred in
 the evening, I happened to be at a house commanding an unob
 structed view of the horizon ; and this circumstance, taken in con
 nexion with the frequency and proximity of the electrical discharges,
 induced me, although entirely unprovided with apparatus, to at
 tempt a measurement of their duration.        A circular disk, 5 inches
 in diameter, was hastily cut from white cardboard, while a steel
 shawl-pin served as an axis on which it was made to revolve by con
 stantly striking its edge tangentially with the right hand, the pin
 being held in the left. The maximum velocity attainable in this way
 was always employed.        The general indications at the time were
  that the rate thus obtained was considerably more uniform than

  160            Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.
 might have been expected ; and subsequent quantitative experiments
 have confirmed this idea.      The first experiments were made by ob
 serving   black  figures  traced near the circumference of the disk,
 which was illuminated solely by the rapidly recurring flashes ; and
 it often happened that the figures, with their details, were seen quite
 as clearly and sharply as though the disk had been stationary ; on
 the other hand, sometimes the edges seemed blurred, as though the
 disk had moved through a few degrees during the act of discharge.
The result being doubtful, the mode of experimenting was quickly
 changed ; about fifteen narrow radial apertures were made near the
circumference of the disk, and the flashes and illuminated clouds
 were observed through these openings, the disk being made to re
 volve as before.    The distance of the eye from the apparatus was
 about 8 inches ; and it was of course adjusted so as to obtain distinct
 vision of the disk.      The result was that sometimes the openings
were seen quite unchanged in appearance, but more frequently they
were most distinctly elongated into well-defined streaks some de
grees in length.      They were observed often and without difficulty ;
but, as further confirmation, I may add that I requested Professor
Joy, who was ignorant of the actual form of the aperture, to state
his opinion of their apparent shape while the disk was in rotation.
The reply was that they resembled Prince Rupert's drops, a not un
fair description of the phenomena in question.      Repeated estimates
of their size were then made with paper and pencil.          Some time
afterward I measured the velocity which I could communicate to
this disk in the manner above described, by attaching to it a small
hollow axis through which the steel pin passed, the disk being then
caused to wind up a thread stretched by a small weight.        The rate
of rotation thus attainable was found to be about twelve revolutions
per second, which is a little more than I had anticipated.      The ave
rage size of the streaks was 9°, corresponding to a duration of j^s
of a second.     It hence results that the duration of the flashes of
lightning on the occasion referred to was, in round numbers, about
Tf^j of a second, some of them, however, seeming to be confined to
smaller limits.
    I know of only a single circumstance which might militate against
the correctness of the above conclusion ; and it is but fair to give it
such weight as it may carry.        Becquerel has succeeded, with some
difficulty, in observing a faint phosphorescence when an electric dis
charge is passed through rarefied air ; and it is not absolutely impos
sible that the effects observed by me were due to a cause of this
kind.
    This point can hereafter readily be decided by observing with a
revolving disk, not the distant clouds, but a sheet of white paper
placed so as to receive the light from the electrical flashes. — Silli-

            calorimetricmethods hitherto adopted are objectionable
THEon account        of the relatively large quantities both of the
liquid needed for the calorimeter and of the substance examined,
which have to be employed for the purpose of diminishing the
error caused by heat unavoidably lost in the experiment.         Satis
factory estimations of specific heat can scarcely be obtained by
the more exact methods hitherto in use, unless the weight of
substance employed is at least from 10 to 40 grms.                Rare
substances   in a state of perfect purity  can  only   be obtained   in
such quantities after almost insurmountable difficulties ; and it              is,
 only on this account, conceivable that we do not yet know the
specific heats of all elements as yet obtained in the pure state,
although such estimations are of fundamental importance in con
trolling the atomic weights.
    The instrument about to be described will serve to remedy
these objections.     The principle on which         acts consists in
                                                          it

In order to arrange the instrument for use,           cylinder of ice       a

after filling along with the perfectly dry glass point, the weight
of the enclosed water is obtained.        The open limb is then com
pletely  filled with  boiled   mercury   by means of a long capillary
glass tube,   which  prevents     air-bubbles adhering to the sides of
the tube.          If
                 the apparatus be now exposed in the open air to a
temperature under 0° C., an ice-cylinder is formed which at last
partly closes up, leaving a thin column of water unfrozen.           By
freezing this last portion of water the ice already formed is ex
posed to very great pressure, which sensibly alters its specific
gravity ; this pressure is so great that it can burst a glass tube
able to resist a pressure of 80 atmospheres.
   To remove this irregularity, and to allow the formation of ice
during the whole experiment to take place under the same pres
sure, it is simply necessary to surround the whole instrument
with sawdust and to expose only the upper part at a to an air
temperature under 0° C.           After a mass of ice has been formed
at a by exposure to a low temperature, it is allowed to melt, with
the exception of a small portion in the centre ; and the freezing
then proceeds regularly downwards from a to b, and can be very
convenientlyregulated      if the limb containing the water is gradually
raised as required out of the sawdust.        The cylinder of ice forms
a half-spherical cavity at its base, which proceeds unchanged till
the level of the mercury at b is reached and the last portions of
water are frozen from above to below.       As soon as the formation
of ice ceases, the whole apparatus is exposed for some time to a
temperature under 0° C., so as to freeze the last traces of water
which are found at b between the mercury and the glass.            The
cylinder of ice thus formed, perfectlyfree from air-bubbles, resem
bles the purest crystal for clearness and transparency.    By tightly
inserting  the  cork     in the open  limb of the apparatus (A), the
tube     B  joined to

   I  have constructed this ice-producing apparatus in the form
shown at fig. 3. The two semicylindrical tin-plate vessels a and b
correspond to the single vessel A shown in fig. 2, and are con
nected by tubes with each other and with the tube a ; while the
similar tin-plate vessel, the outside of which is marked c, corre
sponds to the vessel B, fig. 2.          These two vessels, forming two
 concentric chambers round the tube «„ possess a great cooling-
 surface, and are both immersed in the same freezing-mixture.
The arrangement of tubes in fig. 3, by which the circulation of
the cooled alcohol is accomplished, is easily understood, as the
corresponding caoutchouc tubes are denoted by the same letters
as in £g. 2.      The alternate suction of the alcohol is managed
 by  means  of  the   stopcock II, which is connected at w with the
water-pump. When this stopcock is placed in one position,
the tube q communicates with the exhausting- tube w, and the
tube p with the outer air ; when placed in the other position,
the reverse takes place, and w communicates with p and q with
the outer air.      The production of the cylinder of ice becomes a
very simple operation by this arrangement.              The cooling-appa
ratus with its caoutchouc tubes is placed in the freezing-mixture,
p and q are connected with the stopcock H, and w with the
water-pump ; the caoutchouc stopper with the tubes m, n at C
is sunk in the inner vessel of the instrument, and, lastly, the
tubes m and n are connected with the corresponding glass tubes
of the cooling-apparatus. If, after the stopcock of the water-
pump has been opened, the reversing stopcock is turned alter
nately, the stream of cooled alcohol can be kept at work as long as
necessary for the production of the cylinder of ice. The formation
of this last is easily observed with the naked eye or with a tele
scope, and presents some not uninteresting peculiarities.                  The
temperature     of  the  air-freed   water  in the  outer  vessel        (b,
                                                                        fig.    1)
sinks   by degrees (without freezing taking place) far below 0° C.,
while the outside of the vessel becomes covered with              acoating of
ice formed from atmospheric moisture, which even vigorous
shaking cannot remove.            At last, when the temperature has
sunk very low, the formation of ice begins suddenly, and spreads
in few seconds from
   a                       X   to ji.   The whole vessel down to these
limits  is filled with thin plates and needles of ice; but the
water from      /* to the level of the mercury at          /8    not frozen.
                                                                is
By continued cooling the formation of the ice-cylinder now
begins, and     isallowed to go on until      it  has attained      thickness
                                                                     a
of from   6 to 10 millims. This shell of ice below          p appears com
pletely amorphous, as clear and transparent as the purest crys
tal;  the upper part between        p  and  \,   however,    is not transpa
rent, and has    a  coarsely   fibrous   texture.    When,     however,      the
instrument has stood in snow for some days at 0° C.,              this  coarse

168           Prof. R. Bunsen's Calorimetric Researches.
fibrous texture entirely disappears.       The ice between X and p
now consists of smooth rounded transparent grains.          If the in
strument, after continued use, is exposed to the heat of the
room, the single grains melt on their surface, and thereby free
themselves from each other and ascend in the liquid, and in doing
 so occasionally appear like globules of the yeast plant strung
together.      In order, then, to understand more clearly the for
mation of ice, so far as the use of the instrument is concerned,
 the calorimeter, with its ice-cylinder carefully surrounded by
 snow, was observed for a considerable time.       The instrument in
this and in all the following experiments was placed in a large
earthenware decanting-jar, from the lower aperture in which the
 water formed by the melting of the snow could constantly flow
 out; in this way contact of the lower part of the instrument with
 the water was avoided. The instrument soon becomes surrounded
 with a compact mass of congealed snow (Firneis) . If after twelve
 or fifteen hours, owing to external melting of this ice, a consider
 able space is formed at the sides of the jar, this space is in
 creased by cutting away with a wooden spatula the loosely
 caked Firneis, which is pushed below the calorimeter and its
 place supplied by fresh snow.        The first experiment was made
  with fresh-fallen snow which was perfectly free from earthy im
 purities.     Some hundredweights of this snow were preserved in
  a clean wooden box as a supply for refilling during the experi
  ments.     With such a supply the calorimeter can be kept work
  ing for a whole week, and refilled twice daily without the ice-
  cylinder needing to be renewed.       During the whole length of
  the observations, which took five days, the inner vessel, sur
  rounded by a cylinder of ice, was closed with an india-rubber
  stopper, and the whole instrument, with the exception of the
  scale, enclosed on every side with melting snow.       The tempera
  ture of the room in which       the  experiments were made varied
  from 0°-5 C. to 6° C.      The experiments are collected in Table I.
  Column I. contains the times of the observations in hours;
  column II. gives the readings of the calorimeter-scale during
  the same times; those marked with asterisks are the observed
  values, from which the remaining ones are calculated by in
  terpolation.     The mercury which escaped from the scale-tube
  was weighed up to the thirty-first hour, and the weights found
  converted into divisions of the scale by means of equation (1).
  Column    III.  is calculated by means of equation (3), and repre
  sents the weight in grammes of the ice formed in the instrument
  from the commencement of the time.

   This Table shows : — first, that about 2 grammes of the water
contained in the calorimeter were frozen at the temperature of
melting snow during the first seven hours ; secondly, that this
freezing at the temperature of the melting snow continued for 114
hours in a decreasing ratio ; and, lastly, that after this length
of time a period arrived when, at the temperature of the melting
snow, the water ceased to freeze.         The disproportionate quan
tity   of  ice formed at    the  beginning of the experiment clearly
depends on the low temperature of the ice-cylinder at first, it

consideration shows : — If we assume that the quantity of ice (^)
formed within the first seven hours has been caused by the loss
of heat which the water suffers in heating the ice cylinder from
 — 1° to 0°, then the mean temperature which the ice cylinder
must have had in order to produce that weight of ice is obtained
from the equation

for the specific heat of ice, and G for the weight of the ice
cylinder after cooling to P. In this equation G only is unknown.
In order to determine       it,
                            the open end of the scale-tube was

 determined.    The weight sought

    By substituting the same in the equations, we obtain for the
weight of the ice cylinder used in the observations

order to cause by its heating to 0° C. the formation of ice found
by the observations in the first seven hours.
    Since it can be concluded from the determination of specific
heats given below that a time of seven hours is more than suffi
cient to equalize a difference of temperature of 7° C. in the instru
ment, the formation of ice, which (as is seen from Table                 has           I.)
lasted more than 100 hours, must be ascribed to some other
cause than that considered.        Without entering into the question
whether (as C. Schultz* assumes) this cause be due to the air con
tained in the snow-water, or whether the transformation of snow

soaked with just so much boiled water at 0° C., or distilled water
at the same temperature which has been first shaken up with air,

 observations.     On the other hand, the slightest impurity in the
 snow produces such          constant deposition of ice on the ice cy

 the scale in     minute. Snow which contains only traces of salts
                    a

 purities from the street-pavement, shows this lowering of the
 melting-point in the most striking manner.              River-ice, so pure

 that only the purest snow can be used in these experiments.
It   is also advantageous to experiment in room whose tempera        a
 ture is   not much above 0° C., and not to begin the observations
  until the formation of ice on the ice cylinder does not cause an
 alteration of more than        few divisions of the scale in an hour.

  on the care with which absorbed air         excluded from the water and

   After one of these weights, heated under the tongue, has been
 dipped in, the mercury-thread can be allowed to go back to the
desired mark.      The great alteration on the scale caused by in
troducing a weight only warmed to 37° C. is quite sufficient to
indicate the extraordinary sensitiveness of the instrument.     The
elevation of temperature which 0'4 grm. brass at 37° C. caused
on dipping into about 20 grins, of water was found by the ther
mometer to be only 00>07 C. ; while with the calorimeter just
 described the variation amounted to 20 divisions of the scale,
each of which, in the instrument used, measured a millimetre.
    In reference to reading off on the scale, we have still to re
mark that before each observation with the telescope it is neces
sary (especially when the scale-tube is very narrow) to shake it
gently until the capillary resistance is overcome, and the mer
cury-thread by further shaking does not alter its position.
    Table I. shows that the mercury-thread of the instrument was
not completely stationary.       The alteration, which may amount
from 1 to 3 divisions in an hour, either in a positive or negative
direction, is nearly proportional to the time, as is easily proved
by using the calorimeter.        The small error thus caused is re
moved in the following way : — As soon as the observer sees that
the instrument has become stationary enough, he notes from
half-hour to half-hour the position of the mercury-thread. If
the alteration of the mercury amounts in m0 minutes to TO scale-
divisions, then the deviation caused by disturbing influences is
for one minute
    The time M0 and the position of the mercury-thread QQ are
now observed at the moment when the substance to be examined
is taken from the heating- vessel /, fig. 4, and dropped into the
calorimeter- vessel a, fig. 1.    Both observations are repeated an
hour later, and M, and Qt thus obtained, and lastly, once more,
as at the beginning of the experiment, the alteration of the mer

                  2. Estimation      of Specific Heat.
    In order to obtain the specific heat of a substance, it is best
to estimate once for all, in divisions of the scale, the amount of
heat given up by one gramme of water when it is cooled from
1° C. to 0° C. ; we have then to divide by this value, W,,,, the
amount of heat W which a grain of the substance to be examined
loses under the same circumstances.          Suppose the weight of sub
stance to be G, its temperature t, the number of corrected divi
sions of the scale T, then we obtain the desired specific heat
from the equation
in which t represents the boiling-point of water at the barometric
pressure which existed during the experiment.
    The apparatus (fig. 4) is employed to impart to substances the
constant temperature t ; and it is represented one- sixth of its real
size. The tin-plate vessel A, provided with a water-gauge, holds
enough water to produce a current of steam for twelve hours
when heated by the gas-lamp underneath.           The current of steam
passes through    the  india-rubber     tube a  and the outer glass ves
sel (B) into the second india-rubber tube, b, which is connected

   The chief advantage which the instrument described possesses
over all other calorimetric       arrangements,     not to mention its
great sensitiveness, consists in the fact that all the heat which
the body gives up        employed to melt ice.
                             is                     The weight of sub
stance which      placed in the water of the vessel a, fig.
                   is                                            at 0° C.                 1,
is so small compared with the weight of the water itself, that
the temperature never reaches 4° C.          Since water at this tem
perature possesses    its maximum     density, the heated liquid at the
bottom of the vessel       can never rise, and
                                  a                  protected from theis
loss of heat not needed for the melting of the ice by            column                   a

conducting heat        indefinitely small.
                         is
   This process      very nicely seen in the ice cylinder when
                        is
has been used for thirty or forty determinations, when there                                             is it
found, quite at the bottom of the vessel a, hollow space filled            a
with water, which very generally has the form of little digesting-             a
flask, while the ice cylinder in the whole space above appears
quite unaffected.      The weight of the substance to be examined
need   not exceed  0'3   or at most     gnus., according to the great

or  if it   is affected by contact with air or water, it is enclosed
just   as  in organic      analyses, in as light a glass tube as possible,
whose weight is noted along with that of the substance.                         If
the substance floats on water, either by itself or when enclosed
in a glass tube, the latter is loaded with a spiral of platinum
wire, also weighed, and heavy enough to sink it.                      Perhaps it
would be still more convenient to use a light and well-stop
pered platinum vessel.             The amount of heat which the glass
tube and platinum spiral give up are calculated as follows.                     If
 we call Gg the weight of the glass tube, t its temperature, and
Wg. the amount of heat measured in divisions of the scale
which 1 grm. of the same glass as the tube gives up on cooling
from 1° C. to 0° C., and if we denote the same quantities for
 platinum by Gf, t, and Wp, then we obtain the equation
                           s
    Next, the constants W,, Wp, and W^ have to be determined
once for all.       Wp is found by the equation
                                           T
 From the following observations, in which G represents the
weight of platinum used in the experiment,
                                T = 216-6,
                                t =ioo°-o c.,
                                 G= 4-5942 grms.;
 therefore
                             Wp= 0-4692.
 W,   was calculated by the same equation from the following ob
 servations with two kinds of glass, in which G represents the
 weight of glass used in the experiment, and the data for the
  determination of T are given by equation (5).

     Thus the values obtained by the ice-calorimeter are seen to
 agree very nearly with those obtained by Regnault, but are
 always a little less. Whether or not these constant deviations
 are due to differences in the methods adopted can scarcely be
 decided from so few experiments, especially as these were made
          I
 while was engaged with other work ; but still, although the
 were not made with very special care, they were free from any
 considerable source of error.

pure elements whose specific heats have not been determined

          We must make the following remarks with regard to the ma
      terials used, and the results obtained, in these experiments.                   The
      ruthenium was prepared from the material known as "iron
       residues
                  " of the St. Petersburg mint, which is
                                                                   perfectly free from
      osmium.         This material was heated with chloride of barium in
       a current of chlorine, and the grey powder obtained was fused
      with potash, and a considerable quantity of rutheniate of potash
      obtained.       The oxide prepared from this salt by fractional pre
      cipitation with carbonic acid was converted by hydrochloric acid
      into chloride, the aqueous solution of which was precipitated by
      hydrogen, and the metal so obtained in the form of shining scales
      was freed from every trace of oxide by heating it in a current of
      hydrogen. It was found by testing free from all other platinum-
       metals.       As was to be expected, the specific heat found agrees
                                              N2

with the atomic weight         hitherto accepted. The calcium was
prepared by electrolysis from pure chloride of calcium.                It
formed small pale golden-yellow globules of bright metallic
 lustre, which speedily become grey on exposure to the air.
Before enclosing it in the glass vessel, it was scraped bright in
an atmosphere of dry carbonic acid.          On testing it was found
to be nearly perfectly pure.        From the specific heat found, it
may be concluded that the atomic weight hitherto accepted,
Ca=20, is correct, and must not be halved, as has become ne
cessary in the case of the alkaline metals.
    By allotropic tin is meant that peculiar modification of the
metal which appears to be formed from ordinary tin exposed for
 a length of time to very low temperatures.        The piece used for
experiment    was obtained   from  the large mass transformed    during
 an unusually long and severe winter, in which Fritsche observed
 this remarkable allotropism, first described by him. The mass
 consisted of an aggregation of angular stalks loosely coherent in
one direction, and crumbling by slight pressure.          This tin, as  I
convinced myself, is of a high degree of purity, is free from any
trace of arsenic or antimony, and dissolves entirely in trisulphide
of potassium without any residue of metallic sulphides.             The
little stalks of which it is composed are not brittle, but ductile
like ordinary tin. The specimen of ordinary tin examined was
obtained by melting the allotropic metal.          Both modifications
possess nearly   the  same  specific gravity.
    The indium used appeared perfectly free from tin, cadmium,
and iron.    After oxidation by nitric acid and evaporation with
sulphuric acid, it left no trace of sulphate of lead when dissolved
in alcohol.    1'0592 grm. of the metal was dissolved without loss
in nitric acid, and yielded on evaporation and ignition T2825
 grm. oxide of indium.      If  we regard the latter, according to the
hitherto accepted view, as consisting of equal atoms, the value of
 the atom of indium from this determination is
                              In = 37-92;
which figure agrees very nearly with Winklcr's determination,
                              In =37-81.
This atomic weight, multiplied by the specific heat     sc> gives for the
atomic heat of indium the value
which does not agree with the other ones. Therefore the hypo
thesis that the formula of oxide of indium is InO appears no
longer tenable.     If the atomic weight be taken as once and a half
the above,                        = 56-7;

            Prof. R. Bunsen's Calorimetnc Researches.                        181
the atomic heat becomes
                               se  In = 3-23,
 which is nearly equal to that of the other elements.               The atomic
 weight 56-7 removes the anomaly produced by considering the
oxide of indium as a monoxide, and ranks it in its whole beha
viour with the trioxides which do not form alums.                      Therefore
the formula; of column II. Table VIII. must be substituted for
 those hitherto accepted in column I.

    The ammoniochloride         of indium, prepared by R. G. Meyer,
 has, according   to  the  new    formula;, a composition analogous to
 the ammoniochloride       of rhodium, which also contains 2 atoms
of water.    I  have not yet been able to investigate whether or not
the modified atomic weight is confirmed by the isomerism of
 these salts, but     I  shall return to it in an investigation on
rhodium.
    I have not yet been able to ascertain the fitness of the instru
ment for determining the latent heat of liquidity, as the present
winter has been very unsuitable for such experiments.                      I will
 only remark that the latent heat of liquidity of water can already
be derived from the experiments given in this communication
with an exactness which leaves nothing to be desired.                   Accord
ing to equation (2), one division of the calorimeter-scale corre
sponds to

 gives the number of divisions of the scale corresponding to one
 of the units of heat defined at the beginning of this paper.
 Therefore a division of the calorimeter-scale corresponds to

     It will  be possible to determine the. heat of combustion              of
  gases by   the  ice-calorimeter       with  much    greater accuracy than
  could be done by the method hitherto available.               It follows, by
  equation (4), from the heat of combustion of hydrogen, that 10
  cubic ccntims. of this gas at 0° C. and 760 millims. pressure
  would produce by its combustion with oxygen an indication of
  453 divisions of the scale in the calorimeter of the instrument de
  scribed.    It suffices, therefore, to burn very small quantities of
  gases (easily prepared pure when so little is required), and to
  measure the difference produced on the scale, in order to obtain
  directly the heat of combustion in thermal units, without intro
  ducing any of the very uncertain corrections hitherto unavoidable.

                            By W. B. BIRT, F.R.A.S.*
                              [With Two Plates.]
                  the last seven years the subject of "Lunar Activity,"
DURING  or the present existence of eruptive action productive of
            "
 "change on the moon's surface, has been much agitated. In the
 summer of 1864 my attention was more particularly directed to
it, and    Isuggested that        arigid and careful examination of the
moon's disk should be made, the result being embodied in "                                 a
catalogue of lunar objects," as all previous records were insuffi
cient to determine the question.             This, of course, must be                      a
long and laborious work but until ;                 itaccomplished, at all
                                                         is
events for     aportion   of the   moon's  surface,       utterly impossible
                                                         it   is
to decide       an
               if   object  not   previously   observed   be really " new,"
or     one presenting
      if                      different aspect has undergone
                              a                                       change.  a
This state of affairs was very prominently brought out in the
celebrated case of " Linne         ;" the evidence was clearly insufficient
to establish that       achange had really taken place.              was not,
                                                                           It
however, the vagueness or imperfection of the evidence collected
in 1866, 1867, and 1868 that occasioned the failure, but the
want of precision which characterized the earlier observations,
and the doubt resting upon the accuracy of the earlier drawings
and descriptions, the object having been lost sight of during                              a
period of twenty-four years between 1842 and 1866.                       This      •
doubt still continues.
   In February 1869, Mr. Pratt, of Brighton, careful observer,    a
sent me    a                               "
              drawing of the floor of Plato,"           walled plain in the
                                                              a
northern part       of  the  moon,     as seen  with  his  8^-inch silvered-
glass reflector     :the drawing contained eleven spots            previously
                                                                           ;
no more than five or six were known.                The positions of these
 spots differed so greatly from those with which            was acquainted,
                                                                  I
that  I was    induced to request that observations of Plato might
be sent to me       ; and   I have received between March 1869 and
December 1870 as many as 1594, contributed                            by
                                                               the following

-Bedford, Mr. Birmingham of Tuam, Mr. Joynson of Liverpool,
Mr. Cook of Preston, Mr. Whitley of Truro, Mr. Ormesher of
Patricroft, and Messrs. Ingall and Neison of London.
   Having ascertained the positions of the spots observed pre
viously to 1869, one of the first steps was to identify them and                       ;
in the course of that year every one was reobserved and several
new ones added (see Plate III., which contains        plan of Plato   a
with the estimated positions of the spots).    As the observations

                 found myself in a position to attempt a discussion

was seen more frequently than any of the others ; the number of
observations, therefore, would be a measure of its comparative
high visibility.   Taking this spot as the standard, the ratios be
tween the observations recorded of it and those of the other spots
respectively would be the degrees of visibility appertainingto each.

   The agencies known to affect the appearances of lunar objects
arc illumination, reflection, and libration, which are more or less
regular in their operation      consequently the variations in visi
                                       ;
bility dependent upon them should also be regular, and exhibit
phenomena of periodicity.      Another and much more powerful
agency in affecting the visibility of such objects as we are now
dealing with consists in the variable conditions of our own atmo
sphere, which are far from being regular in their occurrence.
Before we can arrive at sound conclusion on the phenomena
                                  a
presented      by
               the spots,       necessary to eliminate the effects of
                                  it    is
these agencies    and no better mode presents itself than that of
                      ;
obtaining     long series of observations, during the period of
              a
which opposite effects are likely to be compensated and differ
ences arising from instruments, observers, &c. neutralized.
   In order to ascertain,      possible, the agencies affecting the
                                   if
spots, the degrees of visibility have been computed for every pair
of lunations from April 1869 to November 1870 inclusive, and
the results projected in curves.       Upon the supposition of no
other agencies than those above named affecting                            the spots, we

                        relative to Lunar Activity.                  185
ought to have, after a sufficient interval for determining normal
visibilities, a regularity of the phenomena observed ; for example,
the curves ought to present regular maxima and minima corre
sponding to changes of illumination, reflection, and visual ray,
if these agencies are capable of affecting visibility. And as re
gards the earth's atmosphere, which docs affect in no small
degree
          " visibility," the whole of the spots, we might suppose,
would present similar inflexions of their curves ; indeed the area
of Plato is so small in comparison with that of the disk, that it
is difficult to conceive how any of the spots can be differently
affected by changes in our own atmosphere, further than that those
within reach of vision under all circumstances of change in our
atmosphere would exhibit at all times nearly the same degrees
of visibility, while small and faint spots (seen only in the finest
weather and with the largest apertures) would, as the observa
tions proceed, continually decline in visibility.
    In the first trial, purely tentative as it was, the curves of spots
Nos. 19, 5, 13, 14, 22, 7, and 16 were compared, and it was
found that they presented well-marked acuminated maxima in
August and September 1869 (see Plate III.). These, with the
exception of No. 7, are situated on the western part of the floor.
    In addition to the spots on the floor of Plato, there arc certain
markings, as represented in the accompanying sketch (fig. 1).
These markings, which are very variable in visibility and intensity,
 are given of a uniform whiteness.        There is reason to believe that
some have disappeared ; indeed it is not expected that on any
occasion the floor can be seen as represented in the sketch ; it is
only intended to indicate those portions which during the last
fifteen years have been free from markings ; those on the sketch
have all been seen since the beginning of 1860, and by far the
greatest number within the last two years.            Four light streaks
 crossing the floor from north to south arc given in the first edi
 tion of Beer and Madlcr's large map, and mentioned in Der

   186       Mr. W. R. Birt      on some recent Investigations
   Mond, p. 267 ; they are scarcely, if at all, perceptible in the
   new edition of the map.       Space and time are important elements
   in unravelling the complexity of natural phenomena ; and in the
   more extensive basis furnished by the observations of twenty
  lunations, it is essential to combine the two in order to arrive at
  a just appreciation of the results.      Plate IV. contains the more
  important curves obtained in the course of the twenty lunations;
  and while they necessarily present the features included in the
  curves of Plate III., the additional portions furnish evidence of
  the operation of agencies confined apparently to certain localities,
  and which accordingly cannot be referred to such as are extra
  neous to the moon ; for example, illumination, reflection, &c.
      On Plate IV. may be found several pairs of similar curves,
  the most striking pair being that of Nos. 19 and 13.              These
  spots, with No. 16, are situated on a somewhat bright curved
  streak on the north-west part of the floor.       The peculiarities of
 the curves   of these   spots  consist of the bold maxima of August
  and September 1869, which signify that in those lunations the
 spots were very frequently seen, much more so than either pre
 viously or since. Another feature is the rarity of visibility of
 the spots Nos. 19 and 13 during the last six lunations.              The
 curve of the neighbouring spot No. 16 is not characterized by
 this rarity of visibility ; on the contrary, it actually increased,
 and the spot was seen more frequently at the time when the
 minima of Nos. 19 and 13 occurred.         The spot whose curve most
 nearly agrees with that of No. 16 is No. 5. It will be seen from
 Plate IV. that, with only one exception (October and November
 1870), the inflexions of the curves are similar, but the range in
 the case of No. 16 is less. The logical inference is that the va
 riations of visibility of the two spots were produced by the same
 agency, or at all events by similar agencies.
     The most remarkable circumstance connected with the curve
 of No. 16 is its departure from the type of its neighbour No. 19,
 and its conformity to the curve of No. 5.        It is difficult to un
 derstand this unless    we  take into consideration the structure of
 Plato. Crossing the plain from N.W. to S.E. is a fault which
has dislocated the border in two opposite points, each marked by
a gap or depression in the wall.        Now the spots Nos. 5 and 16
are not far removed from this fault on the west ; and if we were
to admit a local action connected with this fault, we might pro
bably obtain an explanation of the coincidence of the forms of
the two curves furnished by spots so widely separated as Nos. 16
and 5.
     A third pair of similar   curves are those of Nos. 22 and 7, still
more widely separated than Nos. 16 and 5, No. 7 being near
the east border, and No. 22 near the west border. The spots are

                     relative to Lunar Activity.                   187
nearly opposite the one to the other ; and the inflexions of the
curves, which in the early portions resemble those of Nos. 19
and 13, are nearly similar.      This similarity is not, as in the case
of Nos. 16 and 5, explicable upon the presence of a fault ; ne
vertheless the four spots agree in being situated near the border.
Now it has been ascertained by careful observation under oblique
illumination, that the floor of Plato dips towards the border as if
a fissure existed just within it.      The similarity of the two sets
of curves, the spots being near the border, is remarkable, and
goes far to connect in some way the phenomena of visibility with
the localities of the spots.
    While upon this part of the subject, it may be well to solicit
attention to the remarks of Scrope and Hopkins relative to the
formation on the earth of tracts similar to Plato on the moon.
If   with Scrope we suppose the expansion of subterranean beds
 of crystalline or other rock to have taken place at a great depth,
 under a a, fig. 2, elevating the overlying strata, and, with Hop
 kins, that when the surfaces thus elevated attained a condition
                                  Fig. 2.
  at which the tension and cohesion just balanced each other, the
  slightest increase of tension would rupture the surface and pro
  duce two systems of fissures, which might be considerably aug
  mented by earthquake-waves accompanied by the sudden subsi
  dence of the tracts between the two principal lines of fissures, —
  we have the conditions for the production of such a region as
  Plato, the annular fissure opening outwardly being indicated by
  the dip of the floor to the border.     Within and below the area,
  however, another fissure must occur, as at s, opening in the re
  verse direction, i. e. towards the lava which may exist in the
  interior, and which would ascend in the fissure and perhaps
  force its way through some minor cleft to the surface.           Plato
  presents all the features which are characteristic of its having
  had such an origin : the floor, some 3800 feet below the general
  summit of the wall, may be regarded as evidence of its having at
  some anterior period subsided not a very great depth compared
  with the diameter (60 miles); the general smoothness of the
  floor may have resulted from the upwelling of fluid material
  through the central and other orifices j the existence of the
  " fault " across the floor
                              may testify to its having been shaken
  and dislocated by an " earthquake," the openings in the wall

  188         Mr. W. R. Birt   on some recent Investigations
  strengthening the evidence; and the spots, intermittent in their
  visibility but persistent in their existence, may probably be re
  ferred to those minor openings found more or less in the neigh
 bourhood of fissures.
     The curve of spot No. 14, situated nearly midway between
  spots Nos. 5 and 22, is the most remarkable of the series, par
 taking, on the one hand, of the features of the curves of Nos. 19,
  13, and 22 in the increase of visibility in August and September
  1869, and, on the other, of Nos. 5 and 16 in the inflections of
 the curves during the six lunations February to July inclusive ;
 it also agrees with the curve of No. 5 in the maximum of August
 and September 1870.         Of all the spots, No. 14 has manifested
 the greatest variation of visibility.
     Not only are the spots which manifested increased visibility,
 as stated above, restricted in
                                   " locality," but the epoch August
 and September 1869, at which this increase occurred, is very
 marked, and decidedly separates the nine spots Nos. 19, 13, 22,
 7, 14, 5, 16, 12, and 20 from all the others, constituting them
  a distinct group, as given in Plate IV.        It is to be borne in
 mind that this group is about & fourth part of the whole number
 of spots yet known on Plato, and the values of the maximum
 degrees of visibility so great as to preclude the idea that a fa
 vourable state of the earth's atmosphere is the only element
 which contributed to their development.
     A second manifestation of increased visibility occurred in Fe
 bruary and March 1870, which, like the former, was restricted in
 locality. This, however, was not the same, but extended as a band
 south of spots Nos. 1 and 4 ; and two only at a considerable dis
 tance from this band, viz. Nos. 13 and 20 of the first group, were
affected, and that in a very subdued degree.            The additional
 spots forming    the  second group   are Nos.  18, 9, 11, 17, 10, and
 29. The forms of the curves of these spots, given on Plate IV.
 group II., are suggestive of the spots themselves having been sub-
 •ected either to very different influences  from those which affected
 the spots of the first group ; or, if the same agencies were in
operation on both occasions, it is very certain that such agencies
had a very restricted range indeed, and were confined to a very
small portion of the moon's surface, so small that the effects of
changes in the earth's atmosphere must be manifested over a
much greater extent of the moon's surface.
    Maxima of visibility of a somewhat subdued character, except
in the case of spot No. 5, occurred in August and September
1870 over a somewhat larger area than that embraced by group       II.
On this occasion neither of the spots Nos. 13 and 20 were
affected, but Nos. 22 and 7 exhibited increased visibility. Refer
ence has already been made to the similarity of the curves of

                     relative to Lunar Activity.                 189
these spots.     Nos. 5 and 14 are also spots which were not
affected at the epoch of February and March 1870 ; and these
with No. 22 form, as it were, an outlying area to the locality of
group II.     Spots Nos. 6 and 7 also form an additional area on
the east, so that the increase of visibility of the spots of group
III., viz. Nos. 22, 14, 5, 18, 9, 11, 6, and 7, occurred over an
area extending from the west to the east border of Plato.       It is
remarkable that spots Nos. 17 and 10 did not increase in visi
bility at this epoch, although situated on the area of group II. :
nor did No. 29 ; but this spot is situated near the north border.]
    In connexion with the third group, and especially with spot
No. 5, is a phenomenon of which mention should be made. In
the spring of 1870, some months after the maximum visibility
of No. 5 in August aud September 1869, a streak which had
not before been recorded was seen extending from No. 5 to
wards No. 14 as a faint object.        In December 1870 a streak
was observed    on the opposite  side or eastward of No. 5 ; the two
form an easy and at present somewhat bright object connecting
two arms of the " trident."
    From a careful consideration of the whole of the phenomena
presented during the twenty lunations, especially the three
 groups of maxima at the epochs above stated, I am strongly dis
posed to regard the agencies at present known capable of affect
ing the appearances and visibility of lunar objects as perfectly
 inadequate to produce the phenomena indicated by the curves.
 The true nature of the agencies that have been instrumental in
 their production can only be arrived at by long-continued obser
 vation. With a double length of curve, resulting from the ob
 servations of twenty additional lunations, we shall be better able
 to determine if the curves of such neighbouring spots as Nos. 19,
 13, and 22 will retain the features which are now so characteristic
 of them — or that the inflections of the curves of Nos. 5 and 16
 and of 22 and 7 will be continued, indicative of a physical con
 nexion of some kind between spots so widely separated as they
 are.   In the mean time, as the observations proceed these parti
 cular features may be confirmed, or new relations developed,
 leading us onwards to a clearer view and a juster appreciation
 of those forces which it is not impossible may yet be in operation
  on the moon's surface.

XXVI.     On the Influence of Density and Temperature on the Spec

    J-^     from          it,
                      exist in two states essentially different from
each other.     In the one the rays can be spread out into so-                a
called discontinuous spectrum, with conspicuous maxima of bright
ness ;  in the other, into continuous spectrum.

of Frankland, Wiillner, and others have proved that, in general,
the discontinuous-spectrum state passes into that of the continuous
spectrum      by
               rise of temperature.     But the transparency of the

magnitude, multiplied by          a  constant,   is nothing else but the
function of the wave-length and temperature denoted by              J  in
KirchhofFs above-mentioned treatise.
    This function has the following remarkable properties : —
     (1)  J is independent of the peculiar properties of the body
 (cf.  Kirchhoff,   /. c. p. 392).
     (2)  At  constant    temperature, therefore, in one and the same
spectrum,      J  varies continuously with the wave-length till the
                                               J
value of the latter is reached at which vanishes (ibid. p. 393).
     (3) It may be pronounced in the highest degree probable that
the function J, at constant temperature, presents no conspicuous
maxima or minima with the change of wave-length (ibid. p. 393).
    From the last two properties of the function J, it follows that
" when, in the spectrum of an incandescent body, strongly pro
nounced maxima or minima are seen, its absorptive power, con
sidered as a function of the wave-length of the incident rays,
must have conspicuous maxima or minima with those values of
the wave-length."
     By the help of this principle, Kirchhoff infers theoretically
the possibility of reversing the discontinuous spectra of flames ;
and since this inference is confirmed by observation, conversely
an empiric verification of the two properties mentioned of the
            J
function may herein be seen.

only slightly different values X and         \,  can likewise be but little
different from each other.
    Now, as in the above expression (2) the magnitudes AA and
AA,, by their definition, can only be positive and never greater
than unity, and therefore 1— A* and_l— AA/ must always be
proper fractions, that expression is convergent for increasing
values of m or of A to a limiting value which is reached when
OT=OO or when Ax=A*, =1.                   In both these cases we have
simply
This may be verbally expressed as follows -.—The ratio of bright
ness of two adjacent parts of a discontinuous spectrum constantly
diminishes with the multiplication of the luminous layers, or as the
coefficient of absorption of the same layer becomes greater, to tliat
value which,     for   the same wave-length and the same temperature,
corresponds to       the continuous spectrum of a body which at the
given thickness is perfectly opaque and black.
    This diminution of the ratio of brightness of two immediately
adjacent parts of the spectrum with simultaneous increase of
their brightness must necessarily make itself perceptible to the
eye, first, as a widening of the lines by diminishing sharpness of
their borders, and then gradually as incipient continuity of the
entire spectrum.
    4. It can now be shown that, cseteris paribus, increase of the
density of a luminous gas must produce precisely the same effect as
the above-considered multiplication of the laijers ; for if we regard
the weakening produced by absorption upon a ray as the effect
of a definite sum of particles which the ray meets with in its
passage through the absorbing medium, it follows that the mag
nitude of the absorption thus produced is dependent only on the
number and not on the distribution of the operative particles, pro
vided we may assume that their absorptive effect is independent of
 their distance*.       This assumption becomes the more probable the
    •
       In order to prove by experiment the admissibility of assuming this in
in  a given case,  (for example, the solution of a colouring substance in va
rious quantities of the solvent), only homogeneous light, obtained by using
 the narrow bands of a spectrum, can be employed in the requisite photo
metric measurements.        The employment of coloured glass must d priori
 be regarded as inadmissible for this purpose, since, strictly speaking, it
 always transmits all the rays, only in different degrees of intensity, so that
 when the quantity of light is sufficiently small, or the glass thick enough,
the rays most weakened are almost or quite imperceptible to the eye.

 same wave-length      aud the unit of density, the quantity  of light emitted

more widely the individual particles of the absorbent medium are
separated — that               is,
                      the less its density is.   Accordingly,    the                       if

has   adifferent number of absorbent particles to pass in an equal

                               ;        it   is
made, the number must change proportionally to the density.

Analogously to the absorption let EA and EA/ be referred to the
quantity of light emitted at the unit of density    and accordingly        ;
let EAlT and EA/<T denote the quantity of light of that layer corre
sponding to the density cr. As the temperature and wave-length
are supposed to be constant during these alterations, from the
above-mentioned properties of Kirchhoff      function the following's
from the whole spectrum can be represented as the value of the following
integral,

Hence,     if we introduce the above values for AA,, and      A^  and
again put
we obtain for the ratio of brightness of two adjacent parts of the
spectrum, as a function of the density of the incandescent gas,
 the following expression : —
 Since at constant temperature the value of a alters proportionally
 to the pressure, this formula shows that with increasing pressure a
 widening of the lines of the spectrum must take place, which gra
 dually passes into continuity of the entire spectrum.
     Further, it must here be remarked that these phenomena are,
 within certain limits, independent of the particular nature of the
 function according to which the coefficient of absorption of a
 substance changes with its density, supposing only that this co
 efficient continuously increases with the density and converges
 towards the value 1.          Greater than 1 its value cannot become
  without contradicting its definition. On this account, also, the
  coefficient of absorption of a substance cannot continually in
  crease proportionally with the density, because otherwise there
 would be a value of the latter at which the case mentioned would
  occur.
     If, now, we consider that with bodies in the liquid or solid state
  the coefficient of absorption has extraordinarily far greater values
  than with gaseous bodies, it is explained why the spectra of the
  denser bodies must in general be continuous.
     When the compared parts of the spectrum are not adjacent,
  but X and X, belong to sufficiently distant spectrum-lines, the
  preceding formula shows that this ratio also is a function of the
  pressure, which with continuous increase of the latter continously
  approaches the limiting value ^p       •

    In the case first considered, for the value <r= 1, the spectrum-
 line investigated would appear 20 times as bright as its imme
 diate environs, and hence might, to the eye, stand out as a sharp
 bright line from a dark ground. If, for example, the pressure
 of 1 millim. of mercury in a Geissler's tube corresponds to the
 value <r=l, on the pressure being increased to 500 millims.
 the brightness of the parts of the ground immediately adjacent
 to the line would be to that of the line in the ratio of 10 to 11 ;
 so that the latter would be already much widened, and its edges
 must appear indistinct.
    The second case shows that, by compression of the incandescent
 gas, different parts of the spectrum may reverse their ratio of
 brightness.     In the example cited, at the commencement of the
 compression    the  brightness Ex<r of a line belonging to the wave
 length X is five times that (EA(ff) of one the wave-length of which
 is \r   With 50 times this pressure the two lines have nearly
 equal  brightness.     But if the pressure is increased to 500 times
 its original amount, the line which at first was the darker becomes
 nearly 4 times as bright as the other.
    If the density diminishes constantly to 0, the ratio of bright
 ness approaches the value r-.       Differentiating according too- the

 take place in one and the same place in the spectrum, at con

trum, one will be the brightest, since in a given spectrum both
AX and -— vary       as functions   of\.
    Having regard, now, to the fact that, so soon as the value of
E\<r sinks below a certain limit (given by that of the sensibility
of our eye), the place in question of the spectrum vanishes to our
perception, from these considerations             results the following
theorem    : —
    If with the temperature constant the density of an incandescent
gas is constantly diminished, the number of the lines of its spectrum
must also be diminished and finally, in general, the whole spectrum
 be reduced to a single line, the situation of which depends on the
 temperature and quality of the gas.
    I believe that this theorem may be regarded as confirmed by
 the observations published during the past year, by Fraiiklaud
 and Lockyer, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 112.
 The passage in question is as follows : —
    " Under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, the
 very complicated spectrum of hydrogen is reduced in our instru
 ment to one line in the green corresponding to F in the solar
spectrum.
    " The    equally complicated spectrum of nitrogen is similarly
 reducible to one bright line in the green, with traces of other,
 more refrangible, faint lines."
    Yet these observations do not permit us at once to draw con
 clusions as to the temperature of those heavenly bodies which,
 like many of the nebulae, present the remarkable phenomenon of
 very simple spectra j the preceding considerations show that such
 conclusions would be inadmissible,           since, at any temperature,
sufficient rarefaction of the incandescent gas may reduce its spectrum
 to a single line, the situation of which, in the case of one and the same
 substance, is dependent on the temperature only.
 \   Having regard to the above-demonstrated principle of the
 equivalence of the density and the thickness of the radiating layer,
 it may even be maintained that the values of the temperature

simple spectra may agree not remotely with those of the nebulae,
because in the latter the enormous thickness of the radiating
layer supposes an almost infinite rarefaction of the luminous gas.
   On the other hand, it is obvious that the continuity of a ne
bular spectrum is not, sufficient to permit a conclusion as to the
density, because, according to the above-mentioned principle, the
same effect may also be produced by a sufficient thickness of the
radiating layer.
   Meanwhile the following consideration  of the subject may at
least serve to determine the lower limit of the temperature of a
nebula the spectrum of which is discontinuous : —

spectrum,     less than or equal to the brightness of this line.
                      is                                                                 It

that, by virtue of the equivalence of thickness and density, the number m

    7. The dependence of the position of the lines of a disconti
nuous spectrum on the temperature and quality of the incan
descent gas, above recognized theoretically as admissible and
probable, is very remarkable, and appears to me quite adequate
to explain the remarkable phenomenon, discovered by Pliicker,
of the so-called spectra of different orders of one and the same
body ; for the value of the expression for the ratio of brightness
of two adjacent places in the spectrum,
                       Ex,
                           =   [l-(l-AxKJJx
is dependent, when       a is constant,    only on the values of the ab
sorptive powers AA and A*        , since  =^   for this case may always be
                                             '
taken as =1.          But these values may have, for the same wave
length and continuous alteration of the temperature, similar
maxima and minima to those which they in fact possess for the
same temperature and continuous           alteration of the wave-length,
whereby they produce the phenomenon of discontinuous spectra.
The simplicity and continuity attributed to Kirchhoff's function
J  refers only to the ratio between the magnitudes Ex and AA>
not to the magnitudes themselves.                  While that function is
the same for all bodies, Ex and AA (as functions of the tempera
ture and wave-length) are directly dependent on the particular
 condition and character of the body.            We thus see that the ex-
                "F\
 pression for   e— , with   alteration   of the temperature, may solely
                "A^ff
 through alteration of the values of Ax and Ax, assume different
 values which are greater or less than unity.           From this it follows
 that the ratio of brightness of two adjacent places in the spectrum
 may   be reversed by alterations    of temperature, and a minimum ap
pear in   the place     a
                      of former     maximum.
    Hence, in relation to the changes of in tensity of adjacent parts of
 a spectrum, there is an essential difference between the effects of
 temperature and those of pressure : the ratio of intensity may be
 reversed by changes of temperature ; its reversal is not possible
by changes of pressure.         By increase of the latter a difference
 of intensity can only be made to vanish, it cannot be reversed.
 When, therefore, inversions of this kind are observed in different
 spectra of one and the same substance, this is the result of dif

200        M. F. Zollner    on the Influence   of Density and
ference of temperature only.        The following theorem may there
fore be pronounced general : —
    When the difference between two spectra of one and the same in
candescent gas is suck that, for rays of any rcfrangibility, to a
maximum of the one spectrum a minimum of the other corresponds,
the temperatures proper to the two spectra must be different.
    The origination of spectra of different orders of one and the
same gas must therefore be regarded as a phenomenon evoked
especially by alterations of the temperature, and not of the den
sity of the incandescent gas.
    8. In like manner as Kirchhoff empirically infers the conti
nuity of the function     J  with alteration of the wave-length      \ and
with constant temperature, the continuity of that function with
constant    \ and variable temperature may also be inferred.
    In reference to the first-mentioned continuity, Kirchhoff (I.e.
p. 293) remarks as follows : —
                                                      J
    " For a constant temperature the function changes continu
ously with the wave-length, as long as the latter falls short of
the value at which, for that temperature,           J   begins to vanish.
 The correctness of this assertion may be inferred from the con
tinuity of the spectrum of an incandescent platinum wire, as
 soon as we assume that the absorptive power of this body is a
continuous function of the wave-length of the incident rays."
    This conclusion rests upon the fact that the spectrum of incan
 descent black opaque bodies presents to our eye the totality of all
 the functional values of      J  proper to the different values of X
 in juxtaposition in space as they correspond to the temperature
of the incandescent body. Now, if the strength of the physiolo
gical impression produced in our sensorium by the different
 values of  J in a spectrum were not likewise a function of the
 wave-length, or, in other words, could we assume that the phy
 siologically determined ratio of intensity of two different parts
 of the spectrum is equal to the mechanical, the course of the
function   J  with alteration of the wave-length could be repre
sented simply by the photometrically determined curve of inten
 sity of a given spectrum at constant temperature of the incan
descent body.
    Although, from the circumstance adduced, such a represen
tation is not possible, and the nature of the physiological func
tion according to which the optical impression of a homogeneous
ray changes with the wave-length while the vis viva is constant
is unknown, it may yet be maintained of this function also that it
must necessarily be continuous*; for if this were not the case, the
   * The notions  " continuous " and " discontinuous " are not to be taken
here in a mathematical sense, but with reference to the absence or presence
of strongly prominent maxima or minima.

         Temperature on the Spectra     of Incandescent Gases.      201
spectra of incandescent opaque bodies could not make a conti
nuous impression on our sensorium, unless the discontinuity of
the physiological function were such that a maximum value in
the one function were always compensated by a minimum in the
other.     But since the assumption of such a relation between
the incandescent body and our sensorium would evidently be
absurd, from the continuity of the spectra of incandescent opaque
bodies the continuity of the function     J  follows, as well as that of
the physiological    function  of the   intensity of the sensation in
its dependence on the wave-length.
   That the function J, for a constant value of X, does not change
discontinuously with the temperature, but much rather increases
continuously therewith, may be inferred from the circumstance
that, as far as observations have hitherto gone, the spectrum of
an incandescent opaque body becomes continuously brighter in
all its parts with increasing temperature, even though the quick
ness of this increase may be very different for different values
of X. From this it follows that, for those values of the tempe
rature for which E possesses strongly prominent maxima or
minima, A must also have such maxima or minima, and that,
in general, the alterations undergone by E through changes of
temperature must be accompanied by alterations of A in the same
direction.   Now, since, according to the observations hitherto made,
the values of E for all values of X have been found to increase with
rising temperature, the values of A. also must be supposed in general
greater with a high than with a lower temperature.
    Hence results an important consequence in relation to the
conversion of a discontinuous spectrum into a continuous one,
at various temperatures, by increase of the density of the in
candescent gas ; for if we consider the ratio of intensity of two
adjacent parts of the spectrum, where for the values of X and
X,
    (which differ but little from each other) the values of the
                          V

two functions -rA and     ~   can differ but little, and hence their
                 A\       Ax,
ratio may be taken as equal to unity, then according to the
earlier part of this memoir the expression for this ratio is
                             _
                        Ex,,    l-(l-Axy

consequence of this will be, first the widening of the line in ques
tion, and finally the continuity of the whole spectrum.
   In the example above adduced we put AA=(MOO, and
               and for these values the ratio of intensity of the

202        M. F.  Zb'llner on the Influence  of Density and
parts of the spectrum considered was diminished from 20 to        I'l
by increase of the pressure from cr=l to o-=500.          But now let
these two values be supposed 5 times as great, thus,
                              AA=0'500,
                              AA/=0-025,
we then obtain the following scries of ratios of intensity for    dif
ferent values of a : —
                               AA= 0-500         AA =0-100
                               AA= 0-025         AA= 0-005

                80                 1-1               3-0
    Here, then, the ratio of intensity, starting from the same
value, reaches the small value        I'l at a pressure less than one
eighth part of that requisite with a lower value of the absorptive
power.
    The results last obtained may be expressed in the two follow
ing theorems : —
    The greater the absorptive power in two adjacent parts of a
fpectrum, the more quickly does the ratio of their intensity change
with the density.
    Taking into account the generally greater values of the ab
sorptive power at higher temperature, it hence follows further
that,
    The higher the temperature of the incandescent gas, the more
quickly is  a discontinuous spectrum converted into a continuous one
by increase of the density.
    13y the aid of the first theorem, from the great changes un
dergone by a certain line in a spectrum (for example, the hy
drogen-line F) through alterations of the pressure, relatively
great values of the absorptive power in that part of the spec
 trum may be inferred, provided that we duly consider the dif
ference of the dispersion in the various parts of a spectrum pro
duced by refraction.
    From the second theorem it follows that, the density remain
ing the same, a discontinuous spectrum can be converted into a
continuous one by a sufficient increase of the temperature of the
incandescent gas.       This consequence is confirmed by Wullner's
observations, in which, with equal magnitudes of the pressure,
 discontinuous spectra corresponded to the weaker discharges,
and continuous ones (or altered iu that direction) to the stronger,

           Temperature on the Spectra        of Incandescent Gases.        203
the effect being the same as an increase of pressure would have
produced with weaker discharges*.
     9. In our investigations hitherto, only two parts of the spec
trum have been compared.              But when the object is to deter
mine generally the changes in the contrast with which a bright
line stands out from, the darker ground, the alterations in the
brightness of the ground on both sides of the line must be taken
account of.        Here two cases may occur : either the values of
the absorptive power on the two sides are equal, so that its curve
declines symmetrically from the maximum ; or this symmetry
 does not exist.       It is obvious that in the latter case (which,
being evidently      the  most general, will be the most frequent) the
 widening produced in the lines by alterations of density must
 be quicker on that side of the line on which the absorptive
power is the greater and hence its curve declines less steeply.
 Although, as above remarked, the maximum of brightness of a
 line cannot be displaced by alterations of density alone, yet the
 effect of the asymmetry mentioned will in general be that the
 middle of the line widened by increase of the pressure will no
 longer coincide with that of the line previously to the widening,
 so that, on the supposition made, the following theorem may be
 advanced : —
      T/ie middle of a line widened by increase of the pressure is dis
placed toward that side of the spectrum in which the greater values
 of the absorptive power of the incandescent gas are situated.
      Hence we. must not at once refer the displacement of the cen
  tres of unequally wide lines of the same substance in different
  sources of light to an alteration of the refrangibility by the ap
 proximation or removal of the luminous body.                 In general, such
 a cause must not be assumed as certainly existing until the dis
  placement of several lines of the same substance, in a qualita
 tively and quantitatively accordant manner, has been shown.
      10. The widening of lines through increase of the vapour-
  density of the incandescent gas can be very simply shown in the
  lines of sodium, if we, by pushing a grain of chloride of sodium

  Geissler's tube, as seen when produced by discharges from a Leyden jar,
 with that produced at much higher pressure by discharges from the simple
 induction-apparatus.     His words are : —
     "With further increase of pressure H/s and Hy expand continually more,
  to that soon they appear as only maxima of brightness on a continuously
 luminous background which is growing brighter ; at the same time H« be
  comes gradually less sharp, indistinct at its edges, and widened, so that when
  the pressure of the gas is 300 millims. the spectrum produced by using the
jar has about the same appearance as when, without the jar, the pressure of
  the gas amounted to nearly 3 atmospheres.       The brightness of the spectrum
 is alto about the same."

204 Influence of Density     on the Spectra  of Incandescent Gases.
more or less deeply into the flame of a Bunsen's burner, deve-
lope different quantities of sodium vapour.         With small quan
tities the lines are fine and sharp ; with large quantities, much
widened, and the edges indistinct.
    But in this case the more refrangible of the two lines of sodiwn
widens considerably more than the other, so that with the greatest
amount of vapour which can be developed in the given manner the
more refrangible line is fully twice as broad as the other.
    From this fact must be inferred, in accordance with § 8,
greater values of the absorptive power for the values of X be
longing to the more refrangible sodium-line, and accordingly,
on account of the continuity of Kirchhoff's function           J, also
greater values of   the emissive  power.    Both   these consequences
are confirmed by observation.
    When the two sodium-lines in the solar spectrum are com
pared, we find, on viewing them more carefully, the more re
frangible decidedly darker than the other — a fact which proves
the greater absorptive power in this part of the spectrum.
    If, further, we compare the bright sodium-lines in any source
 of light, we always find the more refrangible brighter than the
other, whether the vapour-density be great or small.         This dif
 ference of brightness becomes even very striking when the fol
 lowing method of observation is employed.             The slit of the
 spectroscope is gradually opened    till the inner edges of the lines
 thus widened exactly touch.       The adjacent bright bands then
show such a considerable difference in brightness, that it strikes
 the eye at the first glance.    By this observation, then, also the
 greater emission for the values of A. belonging to the more re
frangible line D is proved.
    In order, by observation of the sodium-lines, to verify the
asymmetry which, according to the theory we have developed,
was to be expected in the widening, with the aid of my reversion-
 spectroscope   I brought each of the bright sodium-lines in one
 spectrum into coincidence with the analogous line in the other
 spectrum, so that each line became the prolongation of the
 other, and the two together apparently formed only a single line
 of double the length. In the more refrangible line, which with
 increase of the vapour-density was the most widened, no dis
 placement was perceptible; meanwhile there appeared to take
 place in the other line, as the bightness increased, an extremely
 slight displacement in the direction of a diminution of the refran-
gibility.
    Even if we attribute no force of proof to this observation,
 as being too uncertain, yet, on the other hand, an interesting
 observation made by Dr. J. J. Muller, Private Instructor and
 Assistant in Physics at the Physiological Institute in this place,

  Polarization of Light obliquely incident            on   parallel plates. 205
while engaged in other investigations, cannot well be explained
otherwise than by the assumption of such an asymmetrical
widening of one or the other of the two sodium-lines.
   He has found that the Newton's interference-bands which,
with a difference of path of about 20,000 undulations, are pro
duced in a piano-parallel glass plate of 5 millims. thickness by
homogeneous light from sodium, are displaced almost the whole
distance of two rings when the intensity of the sodium-flame is
varied, in the manner above indicated, by alteration of the
amount of vapour.      With this displacement is connected a si
multaneous diminution of the sharpness of the rings as the in
tensity increases, until they completely vanish, this being a
necessary consequence of that diminution of the homogeneity of
the light which is expressed in the widening of the lines. The
magnitude and direction of this displacement points to a diminution
of the refrangibility of the light, to which in the spectrum a dis
placement of one or the other sodium-line of at most 2^0-755 of
their reciprocal distance would correspond.
   Hence it is evident that this method of observation is vastly
more delicate for the indication of asymmetry in the widening
of the lines than the spectroscopic one, as long as its application
is not prevented by the want of sufficient light.
   Fuller details on these experiments will be communicated by
Dr. Miiller in a special memoir which will shortly be published ;
and    Iintend to treat the theorems developed in the foregoing in
their application to the investigation by spectrum-analysis of the
physical constitution of the heavenly bodies, and particularly to
the determination of the conditions of temperature and pressure
of the solar atmosphere.

   The ray of intensity £, which is polarized in a plane perpendi
cular to the plane of incidence, will give rise to a reflected ray of
intensity £w2, and a refracted ray of intensity |(1 — wa) at the
first surface, where

    Now consider first only the light polarized in the plane of in
cidence.
   The ray refracted into the first plate is divided up at its second
surface into an internally reflected ray of intensity ^(1— v*)v*,
and a refracted ray of intensity £(1— v2)*.
   A similar division will take place at each surface with every
successive internally reflected ray.
   The intensity of the light passing out of the plate on the side
on which it entered will be
                                              -

refracted portion, and ^v9(l — k9) of the reflected portion.        In
these are included all the rays arising from the successive internal
reflections inside the plate which take place before reflection by
the third surface.

           time ago Professor Beetz called my attention, in con
SOME
   versation,    to the circumstance that the experiments on the
electrical deportment of an electrophorus-cake     do not always
succeed with that certainty which might be expected from an
apparatus whose functions are supposed to be thoroughly known.
As just at that time      was engaged on my recently published

  once occured      to me to use this mixture in testing the electro-
  phorus-cake.      I was thereby convinced, not only that this powder
  furnishes an     excellent   means of investigating the working of
 the apparatus, but also that this working is far from being so
 completely understood as is generally assumed.
     The only theory of the electrophorus corresponding to the
 present state of science is that of Riess* ; and it is this which we
 find in all the text-books of physics.            The essential part of this
 theory   is  that   during  the rubbing    of   the  cake three layers are
 formed — two jof the same kind on the two surfaces, and one
 electrically opposite in the interior.        Of these, one is supposed to
 pass to the form, so that only the two opposite electricities re
 main upon the cake ; by their cooperation all the phenomena may
 be explained on known laws.
     This theory contains two very doubtful points.                  First, the
 experiment upon which lliess bases his assumption of three layers
 may just as well be explained in a different and, indeed, simpler
 manner.       Secondly, it is not very easy to understand why elec
 tricity should pass from the cake to the form, and not between
the cover and the cake.
     In the sequel it will first of all be shown that the first-men
 tioned experiment must indeed be differently explained.                  A new
theory, prompted by the experiments, will be proposed, by which
the second point will also be readily explained.
     I must, however, first of all briefly discuss the methods which
may be used in such investigations, in order to explain the signi
ficance of the powder mixture for this purpose.
     § 1. To investigate the deportment of the individual parts of
 an electrified insulator two means have heretofore been principally
in use. Either the body has been laid directly upon an electro
scope, or, when this was not possible, a proof-plane was used for
transference.       The results thus obtained must be used with great
caution if they are not to lead to false conclusions.
    Assuming that, after having laid an electrified body (for in
stance, an electrophorus-cake)       on the cap of an electroscope, a
positive deflection has been obtained, we can by no means con
clude that there is positive electricity at the place in the body
investigated.       Such a deflection only teaches that at the place
in question negative electricity is attracted and positive repelled.
If   the divergence continues even after the removal of the body,
either positive electricity has passed to the electroscope or negar
tive to the body.
    Hence by the electroscope we only ascertain the direction of
the force-components acting at the point in question.                  The use
of the proof-plane may lead to still greater errors.                It may be

216      M. W. von Bezold's Investigations       on the Eiectrophorus.
used in two ways ; either first the body to be tested is touched
with it and then the electroscope, or when first in contact it is mo
mentarily connected with the earth.     It may happen in the first
case that the disk when   raised has no electricity, even when at
the place touched there was some, or quantities otherwise distri
buted have really exerted a decomposing action at the place in
question.    Here the question is solely and simply to know
whether the force at work between the insulator and the proof-
plane is strong enough to permit electricity to pass between the
two.    Only when this is the case can an electroscopic indica
tion be obtained, which, however, gives nothing more than the
direction of the force which acted at right angles to the proof-
plane.
   The other mode of testing with the aid of the disk is princi
pally applicable when the forces at work are too small to permit
a passage between the body and the disk.      The repelled elec
tricity is then removed by the earth-connexion, and only the
attracted remains, and then gives a deflection on the electroscope.
If, however, the action upon the disk was too powerful, the thin
layer between the body to be tested and the proof-plane is tra
versed by sparks, and afterwards no indications at all, or at most
too feeble, are obtained.      Of course in this case, too, we only
acquire   information  as to the direction of the force, without any
 indication as to its locality. Conclusions as to the magnitude
of this force are entirely untrustworthy ; for we can never be cer
tain whether in the present case the thin layer of air has acted
as a complete insulator, or whether it has been traversed by
sparks.
   But, apart from this uncertainty, testing with the earth-con
nected proof-plane is accompanied by another great evil.              On
such a disk the value of the potential function is always =0.             If
now electricity is only diffused on non-conductors (that            is,

by  the  approach   of  the proof-plane.    Hence   all  the data which
are obtainable, even in the most favourable cases, with the aid of
such earth-connected planes only refer to the greater or less mo
dification of the system of forces      bythe presence of the plane.

that at the places covered with the yellow sulphur negative

covered with red lead.            But in this   case we have the incalculable
advantage that this result is not obtained merely for one single
point as by the direct application to the electroscope, or as
the mean value of a larger surface is obtained with the plane, but
that the electrical deportment of each individual point of ex
tended surfaces may be seen at a glance.     Moreover the peculiar
arrangement of this powder enables us to draw a tolerably safe
conclusion as to the seat and the origin of the quantities of elec
tricity in operation.
    A rubbed surface after being sprinkled exhibits bands which
indicate the direction of the rubbing.         If electricity has passed
to the disk by a spark, peculiar dust figures are obtained ; and
after glimmering discharges, spots of dust.            If, however, it is
a case of action at a distance, larger portions of the surface are
found uniformly covered with one and the same powder.                  The
least action exerted by the disturbing influence of adjacent bodies
 (a point, Sec.) is at once perceptible to the eye ; and any one who
will take the trouble to repeat with a good (polished) ebonite
plate the experiments subsequently described, will be astounded
at the simplicity and precision of the means mentioned and at
the beauty of the phenomena.           He will also at the same time
be convinced that the results obtained with the means hitherto
 employed, just on account of such local disturbances, must always
be liable to great uncertainty.
    From this point of view the following very instructive experi
ments may be made, which afford an excellent opportunity of
studying the points here mentioned.
   If  on one surface of an ebonite plate which rests upon insula
ting supports, and is beyond the sphere of action of points, a
 positive spark is passed by means of a needle, after sprinkling,
a yellow star is obtained upon the upper surface.               Upon the
lower one, on the contrary, a yellow spot with indistinct edge is
obtained, the magnitude of which is about equal to that of the
star.   If  near the lower surface there was a point or a flame, an
indistinct red spot is observed on this surface.                 If,
                                                               finally, the
 plate lay upon      metal plate in connexion with the ground, after
                     a
 the sprinkling on the lower surface          well-defined red spot
                                                     a                      is
 formed,   the  extent  of which     less
                                       is than that of the positive star
— that   is,   negative Lichtenberg's figure.
                 a                                 In the first case elec
 tricity was only active on the upper surface, which indicated also
 on the lower surface its presence              by
                                            action at      distance only.
                                                             a
 In the second, negative electricity had really passed to the lower
 surface, but only       by glimmering discharge, in the third, how
                              a
 ever,  by   spark-discharge.
             a
   If   an insulating surface to which       powerful discharge passes

 be covered with     a perfectly unelectrical insulating plate (ebonite

  218     M. W. von Bezold's Investigations on   the Electrophona.
  or glass), and  if the latter be  sprinkled, a yellow or a red spot
  will be obtained which will have approximately the same extent    as
  the positive or negative figure formed upon the lower plate.      If
  the cover be raised before the sprinkling, no trace of such a spot
  will appear upon it. The first case, then, is only the result of
  an action at a distance.
     Besides the means hitherto mentioned, there is another which
  in many cases yields very beautiful results. We may investigate
  the magnitude and direction of the action at a distance in the
  vicinity of the body to be investigated.       We may then draw a
  conclusion as to the arrangement of the masses in action, as is
  done in the case of terrestrial magnetism.       For this purpose  I
  constructed a small shellac needle 4 centims. in length, at each
  end of which was a pith ball, and which, like a torsion- balance,
  was suspended by a cocoon-thread.          One ball was negatively
 and the other positively charged ; and it behaved in respect of
  electricity like a magnetic needle in reference to magnetism.
  From the centre of the needle a very light plumb was hung (a
 cocoon-thread loaded with a minute weight), nearly reaching the
 plate, which was provided with a network of squares 5 centims.
 in the side. While now the plumb was brought as accurately as
 possible over a corner of this net, the direction of the needle
 could be determined with tolerable accuracy by sighting, and
 thereby the direction of the horizontal components.         Observa
 tions of the vibrations now gave their magnitude.
 •' A
        comparatively small number of such observations places one
 in a position to construct a series of level-surfaces which give the
 most interesting conclusions.
                            I
     In this investigation have used this means also, but, for want
of space, must defer the communication of the interesting results
for more complete publication in another place. For the pre
sent, it may be sufficient to remark that these results are in com
 plete accordance with the theory here developed.
     § 2. This being premised,     I will turn to the chief point of
this investigation — to the question of the three layers of electri
city in the cake of an electrophorus.
    Against the assumption of these three layers, objections to
the same effect have been urged in another quarter since       I com
menced the present investigation.           Poggendorff, in a paper
" On the manner in which Non-conducting Substances are acted
on inductively," expresses the view that we must conceive the
influencing of non-conductors transferred to the surface — a view
which seems to me perfectly correct in the case of the influencing
of such bodies. If in the sequel I do not adopt this view, it is only
because the facts may all be explained as a simple case of action
at a distance, and it is unnecessary to assume that the insulator

    M. W. von Bezold's Investigations       on the Electrophorus.        219
or its surfaces are influenced.      Moreover my entire theory may
be altered so as to fit in with PoggendorfFs point of view, and a
decision between the two does not seem possible as long as we
have no clear conception of the manner in which electricity passes
to an insulating- surface.
    The experiment on which Riess* bases his assumption of the
three layers in the electrophorus-cake is the following :—
    If  a resin (shellac or ebonite) disk held in the hand be rubbed,
when tested by an electroscope it will exhibit negative electricity
on both surfaces. If, however, the disk be rubbed while it is placed
on a metal plate, the rubbed surface (A) will indicate negative
electricity, but the lower (B) none at allf. If now the nega
tive electricity of the rubbed surface (A) be removed by passing
it through a flame, the positive electricity of the lower surface
 (B) can be at once recognized, and the upper surface (A) will
 appear unelectrical.     If the lower surface (B) be then passed
 through the flame it will be unelectrical, and the upper one
 negative.     By repeating this, first one and then the other sur
 face may be alternately made unelectrical.
    These experiments are quite correct, and may be very beauti
 fully repeated with the powder-mixture ; we shall subsequently
 revert to them, when all the experiments relating to the theory
 of the electrophorus have been described in their due connexion.
    To complete this series of experiments, it must be added
 that, instead of laying the cake while it is rubbed upon a metal
 plate, it may just as well be held in the hand and the unrubbed
 surface afterwards passed through a flame.            From these experi
 ments, Riess concludes that there are three electrical layers in
 an electrophorus-cake rubbed while it is held in the hand. This
 assumption is quite superfluous.         Remembering the well-known
 fact that the action of electricity at a distance is the less altered
 by the interposition of an insulator the more perfect this insu
 lator, it is intelligible that a cake of such a material, after elec
 trifying one side, must exhibit exactly the same phenomena, even
 if no other force is at work than that action at a distance.
 For while by applying the rubbed side A the negative electricity
 produced by friction passes directly to the electroscope, by ap
 plying the surface B the positive electricity excited by induction
 in the electroscope will pass to B, and the electroscope will
 therefore also diverge with negative electricity.
     If  the disk lies during the rubbing upon a metal plate, in
 consequence of the action at a distance exerted by this rubbed
  surface, in this plate the electricity is separated, and positive elec-
    • Die  Lehre vender Reibungselektricildt, vol. i. p. 294.
    t  This, however, is only the case if the rubbing was strong enough.
  When feebly rubbed the diak acts just as if it were merely held in the hand.

 220     M. W. von Bezold's Investigations            on the      Ekctrophorus.
tricity passes to the surface B in the form of sparks.       But this
quantity of electricity is insufficient to overcome the action at a
distance of the negative electricity of A, and hence it will not be
recognizable by the electroscope.     Indeed, on the average, as we
shall afterwards see, the action of the primarily excited negative
electricity will still somewhat predominate. Investigated bymeans
of the powder, the positive star is seen upon B — not, however,
yellow on a neutral ground, but black (that                 is,
                                                  free from dust) on
a  red ground,      the disk was dusted while held in the hand, or,
                    if
still better, laid upon high insulating supports.        That    the              is,
action of the primary negative electricity prevents the nega
tive sulphur from lying upon the places covered with positive
electricity and the presence of such places

  the smaller attraction which they exert towards the red lead.                         If
  the action at       distance of the primarily excited electricity be
                  by a
 diminished          placing the disk with the rubbed side upon                         a
 plate in connexion with the earth, yellow stars will appear im
 mediately after the dusting.
      The experiments with the flame may be explained in an en
 tirely analogous manner.             If,
                                       for instance, the unrubbed side                  B
 be passed through the flame,           it  readily seen that on this side
                                             is

                                                                  if
                                                                  it
 that   there  was  previously   no electricity upon        it,
                                                           and that its elec-
  troscopic indication was only occasioned             by
                                                       the action at     dis      a
 tance of the electricity primarily excited upon A. We may even
  suppose that the decomposition             by
                                           induction     transferred to the
                                                           is
 flame itself,   or to  the layer of precipitated vapour which        every  is
 where formed on the plate when the flame            passed over it.
                                                      is                 But
 in that case negative electricity must be removed                 by
                                                               the action of
   points of the flame, while the positive electricity remains upon
 the surface.
    If   now the surface     A    treated with the flame, the negative
                                 is
 electricity present can only partially be removed, since            mostly
                                                                        it   is
 bound    (if
          I     may be allowed the expression)             by
                                                         the positive of the
 surface B.      Of course the positive electricity now present upon
B    preponderates      and thus, as Riess states,
                         j                                 by
                                                        alternately passing
the surfaces through the flame, first one and then the other elec
tricity will preponderate, of course with continually diminishing
 intensity. Making the experiment with the mixed powder,                                if
 first of all only      small place upon
                         a                     plate of ebonite
                                                  a                      is
                                                                    rubbed,
 we see    red  and   yellow spots alternately    formed    upon the corre
sponding sides.
     In order to explain the positive electricity which appears upon
B   afterit  has been laid upon an earth-connected plate, or has been
once treated      by the flame, Riess assumes that there                is
                                                                    positive a
layer in the interior.        Hence, to explain the last-named tact, he

    M. W.   von Bezold's Investigations on the Electrophorus.      221
ought to have assumed a series of alternately positive and nega
tive layers in the insulator.
    It has hitherto only been shown that the facts observed by
Riess may be explained otherwise than by the assumption of
three layers.     It now remains to prove that they must be other
wise explained.      This may  be done with the aid of an experiment
which    is quite analogous to one described in the paper in Pog-
gendorff's Annalen already cited.      If the disk be electrified while
it is not lying on the bottom plate, and if it be treated with the
flame first of all upon the rubbed and then upon the unrubbcd
side of the plate, on Riess's hypothesis the positive layer must
predominate, which is said to have been in the interior of the
insulator. On my view, on the contrary, the plate should be
quite unelectrical.
    Experiment shows, in fact, that the plate really loses all elec
tricity.     But it must be made with great caution.      I  could only
get it perfectly clear by taking a larger ebonite plate (at least 25
centims. in diameter), and by only rubbing this in one small
place in the middle. When a greater part of the surface was
electrified or a smaller plate used, it could not be avoided that
 some positive electricity should pass from the tips of the fingers
of the hand in which it was held, from the sleeves, &c. to the
 unrubbed side ; and thus the experiment became indecisive.         An
investigation with the powder-mixture makes evident all such
 disturbing influences.
    § 3. The experiments are now to be described which serve as
 basis for the new theory, which is founded only on electrical
action at a distance.    A few repetitions could not here be avoided,
 as they were indispensable for the comprehension        of the whole.
 Two circular ebonite plates were used for the experiments.         One
 was 5 millims. in thickness, and its diameter was 45 centims. ;
 when used as an electrophorus-cake, it was placed upon a zinc
 disk 52 centims. in diameter, and had a cover 45 centims. in
 diameter.     The other plate was only 4 millims. in thickness,
 and its diameter was 23 centims.        Experiments were moreover
 made with plates of ordinary green glass, and identical results
 obtained — of course, with the opposite sign.
    The larger of the two ebonite plates had already been in use
 fora year as an electrophorus-cake, and in accordance with this
 was ordinarily protected by its cover.     Oddly enough, at the out
 side edge of this plate, where it was exposed to the light, a
 breadth of 5 centims. exhibited a totally different behaviour from
 that of the central part.    The small plate was quite new, and in
 its entire extent behaved exactly like the central part of the
 other.     As I convinced myself both in this manner and other
 wise that that peculiar deportment of the edge had its origin

222       M. W. von Bezold's Investigations  on the Electropfiorus.
only in an alteration of the surface, and not in the nature of the
electrophorus, I take no account of it in this preliminary notice.
The descriptions refer only to a new plate, or to the part of
an old one which has been protected by the cover.
    With these plates the following experiments were made : —
    First Experiment. — If the cake be rubbed while supported
vertically on a table and only held loosely at the upper edge,
after the dusting it will be found covered on both sides with red
oxide of lead.     The two surfaces present nevertheless different
appearances.      The rubbed surface exhibits streaks, from which
the direction of the rubbing may be inferred, occasionally inter
mingled with yellow places.       On the other side, on the contrary,
the powder is tolerably uniform. With stronger rubbing the
passage of positive electricity to the plate cannot be avoided, as
can be readily ascertained after sprinkling with the powder.
    The explanation of this experiment has been given above.
Here it is a case of a single negatively electrical layer, and hence
positive electricity is attracted on both sides.
     Second Experiment. — If the plate be feebly rubbed while it it
lying upon the form (abgeleitete Bodenplatte), after being lifted
up and dusted it acts just as if it had been rubbed in the air.
If   now the cover be laid upon such a cake resting in the ordi
nary manner upon the form, a positive spark may be taken
from the cover which has been lifted off. But if the cake be in
verted so that it lies with the rubbed surface upon the form, the
cover after being removed gives either no electricity at all, or at
most only traces.     If, however, the cake, while its rubbed side is
still turned towards the plate, be laid upon insulating supports
(for instance, rods of sealing-wax), positive electricity is obtained
from the cover when it is laid upon it and removed in the ordinary
manner, and the more the higher the supports are.
     These experiments show that, with very feeble'primary electri
fying, electricity passes neither between the cake and the form
nor between the cake and the cover, and therefore that in this
case only that which is directly excited can come into play.
     1 f now the cake rests in the normal position on the plate, the
 action of the originally excited electricity upon the cover is but
 little enfeebled by the positive electricity attracted on the far
 more distant form, and hence the cover when raised must exhibit
 distinct quantities of positive electricity. If, on the contrary,
 the cake has its rubbed side turned towards the form, owing to
 the positive electricity collected in the closely adjacent form, the
 action of the originally excited electricity upon the far more dis
 tant cover becomes extremely small, and hence when raised the
 cover will be found to be unelectrical.
      A simple calculation shows that the quantities of electricity in

     M. W.       von Bezold's Investigations               on the Electrophorus.        223
the two positions upon the cover must be as D to d* ; D being tho
thickness of the cake, and d the thickness of the layer of air be
tween it and the form (relatively to the cover).   But this ratio
-j   is   ]in   any case   a    very large number.                If,    however, the cake
is removed from the form, the positive electricity collected upon
the form loses its influence, and to        greater extent the higher

will in general be no essential difference from the previous case.
Only when the rubbing          too strong, which may be recognized
                                      is
 by   a crackling sound when the cover            laid upon the cake,

can   a circle of yellow rays and stars be observed in those parts
over which was the edge of the cover.          We will first of all neg
lect this case, and assume that the upper surface presents the
appearance previously described            will now, on the contrary,
                                                 ;   it
be found that the lower surface exhibits            highly remarkable

and for the most part very beautiful image, and one which dif
fers according to whether the cake during the dusting (with the
 surface A) was on the form or on high supports.
    In the former case the entire surface          covered with yellow
                                                                  is
 stars which have partially      red central spot in the latter case

no sulphur sticks to the surface, but the same stars appeal-
 black (that        is,
                  free from dust) upon the surface.         the dusting           If
 has been effected in the first position, and         then the cake be if
 raised, the sulphur flies from the stars towards the edge.
    This experiment teaches that during the rubbing the space
 between the form and the cake           traversed   is sparks, and the      by
 positive electricity strikes on the cake in the form of the well-
 known stars.
    But the quantity of this positive electricity far smaller than       is
 that of the negative which       on the surface A, because, when the
                                           is
 latter   isnot bound            by
                            the positive electricity attracted in the
 form, the action of the primarily excited electricity preponderates
 for after the raising the sulphur      not attracted, but repelled,
                                                 is                                         by ;
 those parts, which are undoubtedly covered with positive elec
tricity.
   This affords an excellent example how the electricity present
at   a  definite place may be made electroscopically imperceptible
 by   the stronger action at  distance of quantities elsewhere dis

tricity which has passed to the lower surface can only come into
operation when the stronger electricity originally excited is
bound, after inverting the cake negative electricity can only so
long occur in the cover as the cake is near enough to the form,
while with increasing distance of the cake a position must be
reached at which the sign of the spark taken from the raised
cover changes.     That this is the case is seen from the follow
ing experiment.
   Fourth Experiment. — If the cake of an electrophorus which
has been strongly rubbed in the normal position be inverted and
laid with the rubbed side upon the form, the cover after being
touched and raised will yield negative electricity. But if the cake
be laid upon gradually higher supports, the quantity of negative
electricity furnished diminishes with extraordinary rapidity, dis
appears completely at a certain distance between the form and
the cake, while at greater distances gradually stronger positive
charges occur.     This can be admirably seen        instead of an
                                                              if,

upon    a     test-plate;   for then continually decreasing negative
figures are       obtained, followed    by
                                       continually increasing positive
ones.

   Fifth Experiment, The experiments              previously    instituted
have shown that when the electrifying            not excessive, no elec
                                                   is

always been assumed, while         does pass from the unrubbed sur
                                   it
face and the form.       This remarkable fact will be more easily
comprehended from the following experiment.
   If  the cake be rubbed while        lies upon insulating supports,
                                        it
and if    be then covered with an entirely unelectrified ebonite or
         it
glass plate, and     then
                      if      conductor be placed upon this latter —
                               a
after dusting, positive figures will be seen upon this plate.       These
become much smaller          the cake be laid upon the form.
                              if                                       The
conductor might also be placed directly upon the cake but this      ;
would in general yield no trustworthy results, since the shape of
the figure formed upon the part rubbed always depends on the
very varied excitation of the individual places.
   This experiment teaches that          by
                                         the vicinity of the form, and
of course also           by
                       the positive electricity deposited npon the
surface      B,
             the decomposing force which             can exert upon
                                                        A                      a
higher   point     diminished.
                    is             Hence      atransition   of electricity
takes place    more   readily  between   the  cake  and    the form than
between the cake and the cover, which        only subsequently placed
                                              is
upon    it
         ; for the electricity originally excited      for the most part
                                                         is
bound       that on the form and the surface B.
             by                                          If the original
excitation was too powerful, the space between cover and cake

            On the Corona seen in Total Eclipses       of the Sun.             225
may always be traversed by sparks ; part of the originally excited
electricity is thereby neutralized, aiid we have the original case.
Hence it is that for each electrophorus there is a maximum
action, depending on the condition of the air, which cannot be
exceeded by any rubbing, be it ever so strong. All this may
indeed be deduced from the known fundamental principles of
electricity ; it nevertheless seemed desirable to confirm this by a
special experiment.
   From the experiments here adduced it follows that all pheno
mena observed on the electrophorus may be explained by action
at a distance, and that it is unnecessary to have recourse to
the assumption of an inductive action in the insulator.                All
these explanations      may readily      be  put  into a  mathematical
form. This will be done in the more complete paper, in which
much of the experimental detail will be discussed.           Here I was
only concerned    to  produce  in  their  connexion  the most   essential
experiments,   and   to give their  explanation   in general  outline.
   Briefly summed up, we may say that the process in the ordi
nary mode of using the electrophorus is as follows :—
   The electricity produced by rubbing the upper surface of the
cake acts inductively      upon the form.
   If   the original excitation is strong enough, the (opposite) elec
 tricity of the form traverses the space between the latter and the
 cake, and passes to         it,
                            forming spark discharges.
    Both     bythis electricity which has passed, and       bythe residual
 electricity in tlie form, the primarily excited      of
                                                       the upper surface          of
 the cake   ispartially bound.

 superimposed cover and the cake              is is

discussion  of the theory.

226           Prof. W. A. Norton        on the Corona seen
   The grounds upon which I have maintained the auroral
origin of the corona in different publications are the following :
   1. The corona cannot be the permanent atmosphere of the
sun, shining by reflected light, since its outline is neither cir
cular nor oval, but exceedingly irregular, and it extends out
from the sun many times further in some directions than ia
others.   The utmost that can reasonably be maintained is that
for a small portion of its outward extent, for which the grada
tion of light is nearly uniform, it may possibly be a solar
atmosphere.
   2. The natural indications of the aspect of the corona are
that it is chiefly composed of separate masses of luminous
matter, of unequal brightness and length, radiating out from
different points of the sun's limb.  The general radiated struc
ture of the corona, and the great comparative outward extent
of the luminous radiations in certain directions, have attracted
the attention of the observers of all modern eclipses.     Some
streamers have been seen to extend more than 1,000,000 miles
from the sun, while others did not extend to one quarter of this
distance.
    3. Keasoning analogically     from the earth [ to the sun, we
naturally   conceive the  body of  the sun to be surrounded by a
permanent atmosphere.        On the same grounds we should infer
that the space exterior to this atmosphere is pervaded, either
occasionally or permanently, by auroral streamers, similar to
those which at times shoot out many hundreds of miles into
space from the upper atmosphere of the earth.
    4. If  the luminous radiations of the corona are in fact
auroral streamers, we must expect that they will not be per
 manent in their extent and position.       Now it is well known
 that such is the fact ; for the aspect of the corona has been
'very different in different eclipses    g. eclipses of 1842, 1851,
                                            (c.
 1858,   and  1860).
                          It
                           has even been maintained             by
                                                           some ob
 servers that the rays of the corona had      flickering lustre, and
                                                  a
 varied  in extent and position during the short period of      single  a
eclipse.
    5. Admitting, as we must, the actual radiated ^structure of
 the corona, its individual streamers, or luminous radiations,
 may be conceived either to be permanently connected with the
 sun, or to be composed of luminous matter actually streaming
 away from the sun, to an indefinite distance, into space.       If we
 adopt the former idea, we virtually admit that           permanent
                                                               a
 vaporous atmosphere of sensible density extends from the body
 of the sun to distance greater than the sun's diameter — posi

 tion that cannot with any plausibility be maintained         In sup-
                                                                   *.
  *
      According   to the recent spectroscopic determinations   of Lockyer and

                       tn Total Eclipses     of the Sun.   •             22f
   port of the other hypothesis we have the well-established fact
   that some form of luminous matter, belonging to cometary
   bodies, when it comes under a certain degree of influence from
   the sun, is projected or in some manner detached from the
   nuclei of these bodies, and repelled from the sun, and under
  the operation of the solar repulsion urged away from them to
  an' indefinite distance, forming the luminous trains by which
  they are attended.        (See the author's papers on Donati's Comet
  published in Sillimau's Journal, Jan. and May, 1860, and July,
   1861 ; and the discussion of the Dynamical Condition of the
  Head of a Comet in the Number for Jan. 1859). To suppose
  that the rays of the corona are actual radiations of luminous
  matter, is only to suppose that a portion of the photospheric
  matter of the sun becomes subject to the operation of the same
  forces that we perceive the sun to exert upon a portion of the
  matter of comets.        The luminosity of such radiations may be
  ascribed either to a reflection of the sun's light, or to electric
  discharges.    Upon this question, we shall see, important evidence
  was obtained at the total eclipse of August 7, 1869.
      6. If we adopt the auroral theory of the corona, and at the
 same time admit that the auroral streamers are actual emana
  tions of luminous matter, the following consequences may be
 expected to follow.
      (1) A portion of the auroral matter emitted from the sun
  should fall upon the earth's atmosphere, and may furnish the
  substance of terrestrial auroras, for which no terrestrial origin
 has yet been detected.
      (2) Upon this view of the possible origin of terrestrial
 auroras, the close correspondence that has been detected be
 tween the periods of the sun's spots and of auroras should sub
 sist, if we allow that the spots are merely the natural result of           •
 the supposed discharges of the solar matter, prevailing for a
 time at certain points of the photosphere — or, indeed, if we grant
 that they are in any way the result of these discharges visible in
 the corona.
     (3) In the wave-propagation of the impulsive actions on the
 ether of space of the electric discharges to which we may ascribe
 the material emanations from the photosphere, and in the elec
tric and magnetic phenomena attendant upon the reception and
accumulation of the solar auroral matter in our atmosphere, we
have a plausible general explanation of the periodic and irregu
lar disturbances of the magnetic condition of the earth, and of
Frankland, the solar atmosphere must be of exceeding tenuity in the
region of the rose-coloiireil protuberances, just above the general surface
  of the chromosphere.
                                      Q2

228               Prof. W. A. Norton     on the Corona      seen
their known physical relations to the sun's spots. This theory
of the origin of the diverse perturbations of terrestrial mag
netism     I
           have elaborated, and followed out into a detailed
discussion of the variations of the" different magnetic elements,
in former Numbers of Sillimau's Journal (viz. for March and
July, 1855).
   We may add that it derives additional support from the
general result arrived at by Professor Chambers, in his discussion
of the " Nature of the Sun's Magnetic Action," viz. that " the
mode in which forces originating in the sun influence the mag
netic condition of the earth is not analogous to the action of a
magnet upon a mass of soft iron placed at a great distance from
it, but that these forces proceed from the sun in form different
                                                             a
from that of magnetic force, and are converted into this latter
form of force probably           by
                                 their action upon the matter of the
earth or its atmosphere."         If this be admitted, then we must
conclude that the perturbations          of the earth's magnetic con
dition, as evinced by the variations of the position and
 directive force of the magnetic needle, must result either from
 some action, direct or indirect, on the earth or its atmosphere, of
 some form of matter emitted from the sun, or from                wave-  a
 action propagated from the sun, or from both of these operative
 causes combined.
     (4) The streamers of the corona should have at different
 points of the sun's photosphcric surface different directions,
 parallel to the diverse directions of the magnetic force of the
 sun at this surface.          These directions   should be variously
 inclined, in different heliographic latitudes, to the horizontal
 lines at the points of the surface, and also to the plane of the
 sun's equator; like the dipping-needle on the earth and the
 streamers of      terrestrial aurora.
                    a                     In low latitudes the angles of

  streamers proceeding        from corresponding     points in the two
  hemispheres should converge and intersect in the plane of the
  equator.     In proportion as these corresponding streamers
  proceed from points more remote from the sun's equator, they
  will intersect under smaller angle, and their point of inter
                             a
  section will be more distant from the sun's surface, until at the
  heliographic latitude of 30° to 35° they will become parallel to
  the plane of the equator.        Those emanating from still higher
  latitudes will diverge from the plane of the equator and from
  each other*.
  .   If these facts be attentively considered,        will be seen that
                                                       it

   The same fundamental conception which accounts for the
solar corona and the physical relations known to subsist be
tween the sun's spots and terrestrial auroras, as well as between
these spots and the varied magnetic disturbances occurring on
the earth, furnishes, then, an adequate explanation of the extent,
form, and position of the Zodiacal Lie/fit.     In fact we see that
the zodiacal light is but the indefinite extension of the corona. •
    We have here tacitly supposed that the solar emanations
 consist of magnetic matter projected with great velocity into
space in the directions of the prolongations of the auroral
columns, and proceeding on indefinitely in these directions;
 but if,  like the cometic matter, they are exposed to continual
                                                               a
 repulsion from the sun, the paths described              by
                                                       the receding
 particles   would  be hyperbolas  convex  towards   the  sun.  The
 point of intersection of any two streamers proceeding from
 corresponding     low latitudes in the two hemispheres, would
 in consequence be thrown to       greater distance from the sun
                                    a                                 ;
 but the general result, as to the form and position of the
 luminous appearance produced (the zodiacal light), would be
the same.
  In support of this    view of the origin of the zodiacal light, we
may state that Cassini drew from his observations on the sun's
spots and the zodiacal light, made during the interval from
1665 to 1688, the conclusion that         a physical connexion sub
sisted  between   these  two phenomena,    and that the substance of
the zodiacal light was, in fact, some emanation from the sun's
spots.    Again, according to Arago,      itappears, from the entire
series of observations at Paris and Geneva, that the zodiacal
light varies considerably from one year to another, and that the
observed variations cannot result entirely from changes in the
transparency of the atmosphere.        We shall soon see that the
form   of  the corona,  as seen in the eclipse of 1869 and previous
 eclipses, presented certain prominent features that accord with
the theoretical conclusion that the zodiacal light           but the
                                                               is
indefiniteextension of the corona.
   It proper to state here that in what precedes we have really
      is
been contemplating but different sides of one comprehensive
theory, which embraces      connected series of solar phenomena,
                                a
of which the corona        but one term.

theory    given in the author's 'Treatise on Astronomy,' revised
           is

                          is

columns     ; that by electric discharges along these columns- their
 substance becomes dispersed and in part projected into space,
 and that this process, wherever occurring, may, by a continued
 dissipation of a portion of the photospheric          matter at that
 locality, eventuate in the formation of a visible spot on the disk ;
 that the photospheric matter thus discharged into space is in
 that peculiar condition recognized in cometic matter in which it
 becomes subject to a repulsive action from the sun (or else to a
 diminished attractive action, as occurred to a certain extent in
the case of Donati's comet, and in that of 1861), and in the act
 of flowing away is visible in solar eclipses as the streamers of the
 corona, and at more remote distances as the zodiacal light ; that
 these solar emanations furnish the matter of terrestrial auroras,
 and, when descending in copious showers into the earth's atmo
 sphere and developing electric currents and disturbing the
 magnetic condition of the earth, are the determining cause of
                          "
 all the phenomena of magnetic storms." The apparent struc
 ture and variability of the corona, and, as we shall soon see, the
 most characteristic features of its form, the form, position, and
 variability of the zodiacal light, the coincidence of the periods of
 the sun's spots with the periods of terrestrial auroras and with
 those of the perturbations       of the magnetic needle, all accord
 with this general theory.       I have also endeavoured to show, in
 my papers on the variations of the magnetic elements, that these
 variations are such as should naturally result from the electric
 currents in the upper atmosphere (or what may be called the
 photosphere of the earth) that would ensue from the reception
 of the supposed impulsive waves and material emanations pro
 ceeding from the sun.         (See Silliman's Journal,   II. vol. xix.
 March and July, 1855).
    If it indeed be true that, from the fundamental conception of
 material emanations from the sun, similar to those which we
know to take place from the head of a comet under the influence
of the sun, a connected series of phenomena may be theoretically
deduced which have their actual counterparts in nature, it must
be conceded that there is a high probability that this conception
is founded in truth, and furnishes the true explanation of the
varied phenomena observed.
Results   of Observations on the Corona made at      the Total Eclipse
                           of August 7, 186D.
    The observations made on the Corona on the occasion of the
eclipse of 1869, have furnished several striking confirmations of
the theory that it is an auroral phenomenon.
                                                            I
    1. The observed form and structure of the corona. — will first
   duce the results of my own observations.         These were made

                      in Total Eclipses of the Sun:                  231
•at  Des Moines, Iowa, with the naked eye and a good opera-
 glass, and were chiefly confined to the corona.              When the
 totality commenced, and the beautiful corona stood revealed,
 like a new creation, against the dark background of the sky,
 almost the first striking feature that caught my attention was
 the great inequality in the extent of its outstreaming in different
 directions, and its consequent irregularity of outline.           This
outstreaming     or luminous  radiation was   particularly conspicuous
from the eastern limb, nearly in the direction of the plane of the
 ecliptic or the sun's equator.    It could be distinctly traced in
 that direction to a distance from the sun equal to his own
 diameter.     For an extent of some 15° on either side of the
 ecliptic, individual hair-like streamers, seemingly nearly parallel
 to the ecliptic, extended out a large fraction of this distance.
From the opposite limb, and in the opposite direction, the
 coronal streamers were conspicuous, hut or less extent than in
the direction of the ecliptic toward the east.         From the polar
 regions other pointed masses of light extended out to con
 siderable distances, but not so far as those just noticed.        They
seemed to be composed, like the others, of rays or hair-like
luminous radiations, more or less distinct. The separate lumi
nous lines appeared to Professor Eastman, from the United
'States Naval Observatory (who observed the corona at the same
station through a small telescope), to converge more or less.
This convergence I failed to detect ; but          I  distinctly noticed
that the outstreaming mass from near the north pole of the sun
had approximately       the form of a triangle with curved sides,
convex outward; but the triangular outline appeared as if
resulting from the intersections of individual radiations, rather
 than as being the definite boundary of a stationary luminous
mass.
    The corona had a white silvery lustre, and appeared at times
suffused with a delicate rosy tinge; but this was probably a
subjective effect.    No flickering or variation of the lustre of the
corona was observable during the totality.          Nor was there any
noticeable change in its general form, or in the extent of its lu
minous radiations, though      I carefully watched for such changes.
Dr. B. A. Gould, who was stationed at Burlington, Iowa, and
other observers, thought that both the lustre and extent of the
radiating masses, or "star-points," underwent material Varia
tions. A similar difference of opinion is found in the reports
of observations on previous eclipses.      If variations in the bright
ness and extent of the coronal radiations do actually occur, it
is favourable rather than opposed to the auroral theory of the
corona; but it is probable that the apparent changes are due
to inequalities in the intcrceptive Action of the earth's atmo

382             Prof. W. A. Norton       on the Corona seen
sphere on the light of the corona, and especially on the faint light
at its outer boundary.
    Professor Harkness, of the U. S. Naval Observatory, in his
able report of observations on the eclipse, states that the four
angles of the trapezoidal outline of the corona were in the middle
heliographic latitudes — relying upon the report of another ob
server ; but on a direct examination of the question of the loca
                                            "
tion of these angles, or " star-points of the corona, made since
the publication of the report, he has satisfied himself that their
actual position was such as         I have above reported it from my
own observations*.
    In the delineations of the corona given by the observers of
previous eclipses, two or more conspicuous outward extensions
arc generally shown, but the positions of these more projecting
parts are seldom given with respect to the equator or poles of
the sun.       The figure of the eclipse accompanying the report
of P. Prof. Capellotti, of observations on the eclipse of April 15,
 1865, made at Chili, is an exception.          It shows three principal
points of outstreamiug of the corona         —  two lying very nearly in
the plane of the sun's equator, and nearly diametrically opposite
to each other, and a third near one of the poles of the sun.
 In the eclipses of 1858, 1860, and 1868, four such points were
 seen, distributed at about a quadrant's distance from each other.
In the eclipse of 1842 but two were noticed, which were diame
 trically opposite to each other.        In that of 1851 there appears
 to have been no marked deviation from a general uniformity of
radiation.
    Relying, then, upon the only definite knowledge we have of
 the location of the more conspicuous portions of the corona,
 viz. that obtained in the eclipses of 1865 and 1869, we may
 say that the corona is brighter and more extended in about the
 direction of the plane of the sun's equator than in any other
 direction. This striking fact lends a powerful support to the
 auroral theory of the corona ; for, as we have already seen, the
 streamers proceeding from the lower latitudes on the sun, on
 opposite sides of the equator, should converge and intersect in.
 the plane of the equator, and for a certain distance on either
 side of this plane, and in consequence the corona should appear
 to extend further in the plane of the equator than in other direc
 tions. The convergence of individual rays or lines of emanation,
    * Professor Winlock, in his report of observations on the
                                                              eclipse, says,
 " The  photograph of the corona taken at Shelbyville shows a flattening at
 the extremities of the sun's axis, and an elevation about the equatorial
 region." The photographic impressions obtained of the eclipse at the dif
 ferent stations show, however, but a small portion of the outward extent
 of the corona visible to the naked eye.

we have already seen, was actually noticed by Professor Eastman.
It, of course, may happen that inequalities in the amount of
outstreaming on opposite sides of the equator may throw the
more prominent and conspicuous parts of the corona to the one
side or the other of the plane of the equator.         It will be ob
served that, from our present point of view, the extension of the
corona in the plane of the sun's equator is a phenomenon kindred
to the much greater luminous extension seen in the zodiacal
light — the only difference between them being that in the former
the auroral emanations proceed from lower heliographic latitudes,
and intersect nearer the sun.
    But it may be asked, how are we to explain, on the present
theory, the
               " star-points " of the corona over the polar regions
of the sun ? For these, two reasons may be assigned : — (1)             If
we admit a distribution of magnetism on the sun similar to that
which prevails on the earth, the auroral streamers should diverge
from each other less rapidly in the high than in the low latitudes.
 (2) Upon opposite sides of a line of no declination traversing
I he sun's surface, analogous to that which traverses Russia, the
natural directions of the streamers prolonged upward would be
such as to occasion the convergence and intersections of those
proceeding from the opposite sides of this line.
    We may say, then, that the more extended portions of the
corona, in the eclipse of 1869, were over those regions of the
sun's surface, and those only, where upon the present theory the
intersections of streamers might be expected to occur.
    In some eclipses distinct luminous curves having the appear
ance of luminous jets issuing tangentially to the sun's limb, or
obliquely inclined to      it,and pursuing     acourse either couvex
or concave to the limb, have been seen.        According to M. Liais
 these peculiarities were conspicuously observable in the eclipse
of Sept.      1858.
             7,        While     it possible that such curves may be
                                      is
the result of the intersections of        mass of straight streamers,
                                           a
        not improbable that they may be actual luminous jets; for
        is
if itfrom any cause any portion of the auroral matter should be
 projected from the sun in        direction oblique to the surface,
                                  a                                     it
 would proceed in      a convex hyperbolic curve         if
                                                       repelled    bythe
 sun, and    in  concave curve
                  a                attracted.
                                  if            Now     have shown, in
                                                        I
a  former number of Silliman's Journal (July 1861), that the por
 tion of cometary matter posited on the convex side of the tail
 of Donati's Comet was actually repelled           by
                                                  the sun, while that
 on the concave side had become detached from the head of the
 comet, because of diminished gravitation toward the sun. Upon
                      a
 our fundamental conception that the coronal matter          essentially
                                                              is
 in the same physical condition as such comctic matter, and sub-
j ect to the action of the same solar forces,        may well happen
                                                        it

 834            Prof. W. A. Norton      on the Corona seen
 that some individual jets will proceed in convex, and others in
 concave curves, accordingly as the escaping matter is repelled or
 attracted by the sun.
     2. Observations on the physical constitution of the corona with
 the spectroscope and polariscope. —The results of the observations
 made at the late eclipse, with the spectroscope and polariscope,
 are strongly confirmatory of the truth of the theory of the corona
 under discussion.         Professor Pickering, in the report of his
 observations with a polariscope, says, " The form of polariscope
 used was that adopted by Arago in his experiments on sky
 polarization.    It consists of a tube about 20 inches long and
 2 inches in diameter, one end of which is closed by a double
 image-prism of Iceland spar, and the other by a plate of quartz.
 Looking through the former we see two images of the latter,
 which, when the light is polarized, assumes complementary tints.
 If, now, the corona was polarized in planes passing through
 the centre of the sun (as is generally admitted) — when viewed
 through the polariscope, in one image the upper and lower parts
 should have appeared blue, and those on the right and left
yellow; while in the second image these colours would have been
reversed, the yellow being above and below, and the blue on the
 sides.    In reality the two images were precisely alike, and both
 pure white ; but one was on a blue, and the other on a yellow
background. From this we infer that the corona was unpo-
larized, or, at least, that the polarization was too slight to be
perceptible."
     We may infer from this that the corona is either self-luminous
or shines by diffuse reflection, since specular reflection produces
polarization*.
     The testimony of the spectroscope is still more decisive. Profs.
Pickering, Harkness, and Young agree that the spectrum from
the light of the corona was a continuous one, or free from dark
lines, but containing one or more bright lines.               The absence
of dark lines indicates that the corona did not shine by the light
of the photosphere, reflected either diffusely or specularly from
 its substance ; since such light, after reflection, should, like the
 direct solar light, have given a spectrum with the Fraunhofer
lines.    The presence of bright lines, on the other hand, is a
direct indication that the corona was self-luminous, and there
fore that its light was the result either of combustion or of
electric discharges.       As it is hardly supposable that an actual
Combustion could prevail at the distance of tens and hundreds
    * The question whether the light from the corona is in
                                                            any degree polar
ized or not cannot be regarded as definitively settled.    It is to be hoped
that the observations to be made on the eclipse of December will temove
all deubt on this point. -

lock of Cambridge, in the spectrum of the aurora borealis.          He
also saw two other, fainter lines in the spectrum of the corona
which coincided quite closely with other lines reported           Prof.by
Winlock as visible        the spectrum of the aurora.
                         in                                 In view of
these results of spectroscopic observation he remarks as follows —
" At present seems pretty likely that the spectra of the corona
                                                                             :
                   it
and the aurora borealis are identical, with only such differences
in the intensity of their lines as we might naturally expect, and
that very probably the identity extends to the essential nature
of the phenomena themselves."
   The detection of the same iron line in the aurora and corona,
taken in connexion with the well-established fact that the vapour
of iron     present in the photosphere and chromosphere of the
             is
sun, and that the magnetic features of the aurora lead to the
natural conclusion that some form of ferruginous matter consti
tutes the substance of auroras, for which no terrestrial origin
can reasonably be assigned, conducts to the inference that the
terrestrial auroral matter        derived from the sun, and adds to
                                    is
the weight of accumulative evidence in support of the theory                     I
have advocated, that the corona         made up of material emana
                                          is
tions from the sun.
   NOTE. — Some persons have conjectured that the corona might be
produced by the passage of the sun's rays through the earth's atmo
sphere   ;but    may readily be shown that this
                  it                                 is
                                                    impossible.   When
one reflects that the half width of the moon's shadow, in the larger
eclipses,    as great as the estimated height of the atmosphere,
             is                                                      will   it
be seeu that, to an observer on the central line of the eclipse, the
line of sight will not fall upon the illuminated portion of the atmo
sphere exterior to the shadow, unless inclined under      large angle to
                                                              a
the line of direction of the centres of the sun and moon.    The corona,
therefore,     of terrestrial atmospheric origin, ought to present, to
              if
ward the middle of the eclipse, the appearance of halo entirely de

tached from the dark body of the moon, and many degrees distant
from it. It ought also to increase in brightness from its inner border
for a considerable distance outward.
   Others have imagined that the corona might be attributable to the
passage of the sun's light through a lunar atmosphere ; but since
some of the streamers, or rays of the corona, have been seen to ex
tend to a distance greater than the sun's diameter, this would require
the lunar atmosphere to be of vast extent ; whereas no decisive evi
dence has vet been obtained of the existence of any lunar atmosphere
capable of producing a sensible refraction, or reflecting a perceptible
amount of the sun's light to an observer on the earth.
   Perhaps the more prevalent idea, at the present day, is that the
corona, with its rays and tufts of light, is a phenomenon of diffraction
produced by the passage of the sun's rays along the denticulated
edge of the moon.        This theory has an air of plausibility, but it is
entirely inadequate     to  account for the great extent of the coronal
rays. The fringes produced by the diffraction of light in its passage
near the edge of a body appear to the eye of the observer to extend
but a small angular distance from the edge.                 This would be more
strikingly  true  in the   case of  a  distant  body,   like  the moon.
   The only remaining supposition           is,  that  the   corona   is either an
 envelope  of  some    kind   permanently      connected     with  the  sun,  oris
 made up    of  material    emanations     proceeding immediately        from   the
 sun.   To the   large body    of  indirect   evidence    that has  been  obtained
 that the corona is wholly a solar phenomenon, we may now add
 that of direct observation, since     it   appears that "an examination of
 the photographs     of  totality,"   obtained    at the eclipse of 1869, shows
 that as the moon     advanced    the   corona was progressively covered.

         distinction between motion considered merely as change of
THEplace,     and motion as produced by force, was often noticed by
the earlier writers on mechanics, e. g. by Euler and the possibility
                                                         ;
of establishing    adistinct science of pure motion was pointed out by
more than one writer, and particularly by Ampere, who denominated
it Cin^matique or Kinematics.         It  is, however, worthy of remark that
there are  two  points   of  view    from  which such    a science may be re
garded,  viz. either, first,  in its  most  general aspect, as science which
                                                                  a

tion to any other position, and discusses the formulae which define
the positions of these points after and during transference with re
spect to their initial place or, secondly, as a science which enumerates
                              ;
and classifies the means by which we change the direction and vtio

city of a given motion. If we adopt the nomenclature that Dynamics
is the general doctrine of Force, and Mechanics the applications of
that doctrine to Machines, then Kinematics stands related to the
former of these in the same manner as Mechanism to the latter. The
fundamental distinction implied in the word kinematics or pure me
chanism is now so familiar to students of mechanical science, that
we are apt to forget how few years have passed since that distinction
was actually effected : —
     "The science of pure motion," says the late Dr.Whewell*, writing,
•we believe, in A.D. 1840,
                               " has not generally been separated from
the science of motion viewed with reference to its causes.        Recently,
indeed, the necessity of such a separation has been seen by those who
have taken a philosophical view of the science."         It was mainly by
 the labours of Mr. Willis that this separation was actually effected,
 and the theory of pure mechanism established as an independent
 science.    This was done in his well-known treatise ' The Principles
 of Mechanism,' the first edition of which was published in the year
 A.D. 1841.     In noticing the appearance of the second edition of a
 work which long ago took its place as the standard work on the
 subject, it is quite unnecessary to speak in its praise. Nor are the
 changes introduced into the new edition of a kind to call for a long
 notice.    Perhaps the most important is the rearrangement of the
 first and principal part of the volume. This change is as follows : —
 One piece of a machine may communicate motion to a second piece
 either (A) by rolling contact, (B) by sliding contact, (C) by wrap
 ping connexion, (D) by link-work, (E) by reduplication.             Under
 each of these divisions there are three classes : — (1) Directional rela
 tions of the motions constant, and velocity-ratio of the pieces constant.
 (2) Directional relation constant and velocity-ratio varying. (3) Di
 rectional relation changing periodically and the velocity- ratio con
 stant or varying.     In the first edition the classes were treated sepa
 rately in the five divisions.   In the new edition the divisions are given
  separately, and each, except (E), subdivided into the three classes.
 Mr. Willis states that, in his experience as a lecturer, he found the
  very great convenience of thus classing the elements of machines
  with reference to the mode in which velocity is communicated.
 The same arrangement, it may be mentioned, is adopted by Dr.
  Rankine in part iv. of his treatise ' On^Applied Mechanics ;' and there
 can be no doubt that it constitutes a great improvement in the form
  of the work.
     Most of the changes in the substance of the book are such as are
  sure to occur to an author who re-edits a book after a lapse of nearly
  thirty years : new articles are inserted here and there ; additional
  notes relating to the history of the subject are of frequent occurrence ;
  and besides these there arc two parts wholly new, viz. on "Combina
  tions for the action of which properties of friction are employed," and
  on " Universal Joints."      The effect of all this has been to increase
  the book by about one third part of its original size.       The revision

 seems to have been made as thoroughly as such a work deserved;
 and no pains have been spared in making it perfect down to the most
 minute particular.    It had, we believe, been long out of print; and
 we congratulate students of Mechanical Science on being able to
procure what will long be the standard work on this subject.
A   Laboratory Text-book of Practical Chemistry ; or, Introduction to
   Qualitative Analysis.     A Guide to the Course of Practical Instruc
   tion given in the Laboratories of the Royal College of Chemistry.
    With ninety engravings. By WM. G. VALENTIN, F.C.S. London;
   Churchill, 1871.     Pp. x and 380.
   When the preliminary stages in the growth of an idea or an opi
nion have been passed, it invariably happens that a literary embodi
ment is found necessary.       The great and increasing estimation in
which physical science is now held as at once a means and object of
education, furnishes many an illustration of this ; and, in its turn,
physical science has to embody successive opinions and ideas as
they arise. Thus a perfect scientific literature would be a diffused
history.
   Mr. Valentin's text-book is very remarkable (indeed, novel) in one
respect. It puts prominently forward, as an element in the teach
ing of analysis, the most advanced form of the atomic method of
symbolization ; and it does so expressly on the ground that the study
of chemical analysis is thereby simplified in a marked degree.          It
has hitherto been the custom for writers of analytical works to keep
formal chemistry very much in the background, and to regard even
equations rather as impedimenta than active aids. But some change
has long been expected, and was clearly inevitable.         When the re
sults of chemical research are almost uniformly expressed, not only
in atomic language, but in atomic symbols, and almost every me
moir concludes with or contains a graphic formula, it is clearly the
duty of some practical teacher of recognized ability to answer by
actual trial the important question, Can such formula be used as of
real assistance to the analytical instructor ? Mr. Valentin has made
the experiment, and responds in the affirmative.
   The first part of the work (128 pages) is taken up with a varied
series of one hundred operations, which become successively more
complex in their meaning as we proceed. On each occasion the
teacher stands, as it were, at the student's side, points out what is
to be observed and what is extraneous, and then exhausts the phe
nomena of their inferences.     The entire book is singularly and admi
rably argumentative in this manner.       Much of its first portion would
furnish, and no doubt will be made to furnish, material of a high
class for the earlier lectures of a chemical course, more especially
when we hear in mind the numerous and well-executed engravings
by which it is illustrated.     Where not original, these have been
taken from the best sources.       By the time the student has reached
Part II. he may fairly be supposed to understand all the ordinary
operations of analysis, the management of apparatus and reagents,
the transference and manipulation of gases ; but he will have, in

                          Royal Society.                             289
addition, as a necessary part of that knowledge, an acquaintance
with the laws of the results of chemical action, which he will know
how to express intelligently either in simple or structural symbols.
He will also possess a cultivated observation, and he will not fail to
have become at once more logical and critical.    Thus armed, he may
undertake the study of qualitative analysis with confidence.
   The second Part commences with an account of reagents and group
reagents. Of these, the former are given in detail under the respective
elements ; the latter precede them in their proper deductive order. In
the separation of mixtures, every effort appears to have been madeto
adhere in the main to quantitative methods ; in this way the time of
both teacher and student is economized, and the latter is assured of
the precision of his operations.    Basylous bodies are considered in
the first six chapters of the eight of which this division of the book
consists ; acid substances (organic and inorganic) are treated of in,
the remainder.     A scheme for the analysis of simple and complex
substances, both in the dry and wet way, forms a fitting sequel to
the whole : the Tables of which it consists are those of the Royal
College of Chemistry, where the author is chief laboratory instruc
tor. These have been repeatedly revised and corrected, having been
made the basis of special inquiries during the course of several years ;
they are now published for the first time, and will be warmly wel
comed by old collegians.     The special feature of this book is, as we
have said, the introduction of the graphic method and its principles
into analytical training — not, therefore, as an end, but a means to an
end.    Upon the atomic notions which underlie that method, the
author justly refuses to dogmatize.      " Indeed," he says (p. 31),
" matter itself being as yet unknown to us, need we wonder that
the very existence, size, shape, &c. of the smallest particles of
matter should not be capable of experimental demonstration ? Where
experiment fails to throw light upon the absolute nature of the con
 stant chemical combining proportions, and can at best only supply
 us with relative data, hypothesis steps in." We may agree or dis
 agree with the atomic hypothesis ; but in either case we must admit
 the indebtedness of chemical literature to the writer.   Mr. Valentin
 teaches his student to reason — thereby enabling him to acquire, in
 time, a power of independent judgment, both as to facts, to theories,
 and the nature of theory.

    As a particular case, it appears that the correction to the length
of   an organ-pipe, supposed, as in Helmholtz's paper, to be sur

    Approximate formulae are          investigated for the resistance of tubes
 which are not exact circular        cylinders.    It will be sufficient to par

 shown to lie between the two       limits

 where y denotes the radius of the tube at the point x.
    When there is more than one vessel in the vibrating system,
 there are several independent periods of vibration corresponding to
 the degrees of freedom.         The theory of these vibrations is also con
 sidered.
     In the experimental part of the investigation the object is to de
 termine with sufficient precision the pitch of the resonant note.
 This is generally done by causing the resonator to speak. For several
 reasons, which are detailed, I Consider this course unsatisfactory, and
 have availed myself of other indications to fix the pitch, which are
 not, indeed, capable of so great an apparent precision, but yet are
  more to be depended on.

    ON SOME ANALOGOUS            PRINCIPLES OF PHOTOMETRY, AND THE
               LAW OP ATTRACTION.             BY W. VON BEZOLD.
        what follows I shall communicate a few principles of photo
  IN metry     which are perfectly analogous to well-known theorems in
  the law of attraction.       The consideration of these analogies leads, on
  the one hand, to simple solutions of many photometric problems,
  and, on the other, to a very manifest illustration of some principles
  of the doctrine of the potential.         As the proofs for the photometric
  principles are given in just the same manner as those for the law

 of attraction, we may in the sequel dispense with any strict de
 monstration.     Hence I will briefly state the more important of these
 principles, adding now and then a short observation.
    In reference to the measure chosen, it must be premised that the
 intensity of that source of light is taken as unit which at the unit
 distance imparts to a perfectly white element of surface at right
 angles to the line of junction the unit of brightness.      Hence a lu
 minous point of the intensity i emits the quantity of light 4ni.     The
 surface is always to be supposed perfectly white.        In the case of
actual surfaces (which are never quite white — that is, whose white
 ness, a, is always less than 1), the formula has simply to be mul
 tiplied by a.
    This being premised, the following principles hold good.
    (1) A luminous point of intensity i at a distance r imparts to an
 element of surface, whose normal makes the angle a with the line
joining the element and the source of light, a luminosity
                              H= 4 coa a.
                                    r
    (2) If a, b, c are the rectangular coordinates of the luminous
point, x, y, z those of the element of the surface, and if this is at
 right angles to the axis of X, its brightness is
                          „    ,.-.         ^
                               r    r        dx
    (3)  If the element of surface in the point x, y, z, at right angles
 to the X axis, is simultaneously illuminated by several sources of
light, all of which are on the same side of the element, its brightness
 is
                                   *~  •i
                                        ~dirt
The brightness H of any element (presupposing that all         sources  of
light are on the same side of the element) is
meaning by dn the element of the perpendicular to the element of
 surface.
    From these principles the following result is obtained : —
    Given any number of luminous points, the brightness of any
 surface illuminated by them at any given place is obtained by re
garding the luminous points as material, and their masses as propor
 tional to the intensities of the sources of light, next seeking the
 potential function of these masses, and then forming the differential
 quotients of the normals according to the element of surface.
    This principle holds, of course, only under the above-made limi

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                      243
tation.    If the brightness at any place the tangent-plane of which
prolonged passes between the luminous points is to be sought, it
is sufficient to form the potential for those points which lie upon
one side of this plane.
    Hence the principle is quite general for surfaces which surround
all the sources of light in such a manner that from each of their points
all the luminous points can be seen.
    (4) Given a number of luminous points, all of which are within
an enclosed surface, if H is the brightness of an element of surface
da, then

                     dn
when the integral is extended over the whole surface.                Here i is the
intensity of a source     of light  which   is within,   i'  that of  a source of
light which lies in the    surface  at a place where   it is  uniformly curved ;
i" is the intensity of a luminous point at an angle or edge of the
surface ; while ia is the piece of the surface which is cut out by the
tangent cone laid through such a point from the surface of the sphere
of radius unity described about the point.'
    This is the analogue of one of the fundamental principles of attrac
tion. But while in that case its accuracy can only be recognized after
proof, from the point of view of photometry it is at once clear, \ Hdf is
nothing more than the whole quantity of light falling upon the inner
side of the surface ; and that this is represented by the expression on
the right-hand side requires no further demonstration.
    Given now a number of luminous points, all of which are external
to an enclosed surface, the two sides of which are affected by oppo
site signs, if then the brightness at all points of the surface be
sought, assuming that the parts causing the shadow are withdrawn
from before the parts shaded by the surface itself, then
                                   JHrf<r=0
when the integral is extended over the entire surface ; and the bright
ness H gives the sign of the illuminated side of the surface.
    In other words, after removing the shading parts, as much light
falls upon the originally shaded places as formerly fell upon the
shading parts.
    (5) If V is the potential of acting masses, V=C is the equation
of a surface upon which the total force is everywhere at right angles.
In like manner in photometry, if V=S—             , then    V=C      is a surface
which has the property that each of its elements is more brightly
illuminated than any other element laid through the same point *.
    Such a surface may therefore be conveniently called a surface of
greatest brightness, and corresponds to a level-surface.
    (6) If a series of surfaces of greatest brightness are laid in space
which correspond to the values V=A, V=A                 f  rfA to V=A+»rfA,
the brightness with which any element of a surface laid through a
point of such a surface is illuminated is inversely proportional to the

length which is cut off on the normal to the surface by the adjacent
level-surface.
     (7) If on a surface of greatest brightness which encloses the
 whole of the sources of light electricity is so distributed that its
density is everywhere proportional to the brightness prevalent there,
the electricity on this surface would be in equilibrium if it were the
 surface of a conductor. — Poggendorff's Annalen, No. 9, 1870.

               A SOLAR FOB-BOW.         BY B. C. CARRINGTON.
     On the morning of November 27, at five minutes to ten, I saw a
 curious bow formed in a mist which was just rising ; the sun was
 shining brightly ; and on the principle of our motto, " Quicquid nitet
 notandum," I took immediate note of it.         It- was the smallest bow I
 have seen, not more than twenty-five paces from where I stood, and
 it measured thirty-five paces from bow to bow. I stept a yard at a
 pace very nearly.        The colour was white, like a lunar bow. But
 what was more remarkable was the appearance of a centre in which
 I  could see the reflection of my head, which moved as I moved.           I
 remember having seen a centre before in a rainbow, which I witnessed
 near Cader Idris, in Wales, in July 1847, in a splendid bow of two
 arches, but which I never mentioned before, having never heard of
 the like. — Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society, January 13,

     Permit me to inform you that I have been for some time occupied
 with investigations on the refractive power of red concentrated ani
 line (Fuchsine), and have obtained very curious results.          Reserving
 for a future communication further details, I give here the ratios of
 refraction for an alcoholic solution containing 18'8 per cent, of
 aniline : —

      The refraction-ratio    increases from B to D and a little beyond,
  sinks then very rapidly to G, and then again increases.
      This is readily observed by filling a very acute prism with the
  liquid ; if a luminous slit be looked at through it, the colours are
  seen in the following order, — violet, red, yellow, in which the devia
  tion of the latter is the greatest.    The consequences are most easily
  and beautifully seen when the hypotenuse of a rectangular prism
  containing the solution is illuminated and the reflected light observed.
  Then, instead of the colours at the limit of total reflection, coloured
  light, rose-red, violet, blue, green, are observed under all incidences.

XXXIII.       On the  Capillary Phenomena of the common Surface of

CONSIDERATIONS
        to the free surface   of a liquid (that is to say, bounded by
space or by air) are applicable to the common surface of two
liquids.

in my former communications on Capillary Phenomenaf, and
shall distinguish the magnitudes whicli relate to a point P, or
P8 of the free surface of the liquid 1 or 2 by means of the suffix
1 or 2, the magnitudes which relate to a point P]2 of the com
mon surface of two liquids 1 and 2 by means of the double
suffix  1  2.
    Let R and R' denote the smallest and greatest radius of curva
ture of the common surface of two liquids 1 and 2 at the point
P14, then considerations analogous to those concerning free liquid
surfaces show that in the direction of the surface-perpendiculars

    The magnitudes K12 and H12 do not depend solely on the re
ciprocal action of two particles of the same liquid on one an
other, but also on the action which the particles of liquid 1
exert at a very small distance on the particles of liquid 2, and
conversely.
    It may be seen from the form of equation (1) that the com
mon surface of two liquids, like the free surface of one liquid,
will be as small as possible — that at the common surface of two
liquids there will be a certain tension, as in a stretched mem
brane, which is the same at all points and is measured by the
            TT
constant —^ or        «12, which   will be adopted instead of it in what
              Al
follows.
    The angle «I2, at which the last element of the common sur
face   of two liquids 1 and 2 cuts a side of the containing vessel,
will only depend on the nature of the two liquids and of the side,
and will be independent           of the form of the common surface
of the liquids and the form of the side.
    The magnitude K12, the perpendicular pressure on the planet
common surface of two liquids 1 and 2, can just as little as the
perpendicular pressure K, or K9 on the free plane surface of the
liquid 1 or 2 be determined when there subsists the relation
                           K, — K2=K12=        —

    The weight on a unit of length of the line of section of              a solid
vertical side and the common surface of two liquids is

a constant magnitude,         which only depends on the nature of the
two liquids and the side.
    «la is the tension, measured in milligrammes, which is exerted
on a space of the common surface of the breadth of a millimetre.
    The propositions advanced in the foregoing, like those which
hold good for free liquid surfaces, may either be deduced from
the assumption of molecular forces, after the manner of Laplace's
views, or the assumption of a surface-tension, after the manner
of the views of Thomas Young.
    2. The phenomena at the common limit of two liquids, apart
from the well-known experiments of Plateau* on the figures of
equilibrium of drops of oil on aqueous alcohol of the same spe

lary tube when water, or alcohol containing water, was poured on
it. Bede* observed the height to which water or sulphuric acid
ascended in capillary tubes when, above one of these liquids, pe
troleum was poured into the tube, and that to which chloroform
ascended when water was poured over the latter.
    Thomas Youngf found that a small quantity of oil poured on
the surface of water in a capillary tube diminished the total
height.
    In these experiments, however, we have two unknown mag
nitudes : —the superficial cohesion, «J2, of the common surface
of the two liquids; and the marginal angle &>12, which, as            I shall
afterwards show (§ 10), is not always either 0° or 180°.                 The
product «,9 cos to}i only is determined by observing the height.
   I  myself    J  have measured the height of drops of mercury in
water and hydrochloric acid, without ever being able to draw
further conclusions regarding the cohesion of the common sur
face of those liquids.
    Guthrie§, lastly, dropped into different liquids other liquids,
and measured the magnitude of the drops.
    Even in the few cases on which experiments are given, theory
has not been proved to agree with experience — partly because,
beside the propositions mentioned above, and w,9=0° or 180°,
relations also were assumed between the magnitudes «,, «9, and
a )2, which, as     I  shall presently show, do not altogether agree
with experiment.
    The error of the usually assumed relation «j— «? = «12 sug
gests, moreover; the simple idea that for two liquids which mix
in all proportions the capillary constant of the common surface
«12 is =0, whilst for water and absolute alcohol it should be
8— 2'5 = 5'5 milligrammes.
    Hence the proposition adduced by PoisBOn||, that the weight
raised in a capillary tube will depend only on the lower liquid,
is not in agreement with experience.
    Thomas Young supposed the capillary constant of the common
surface of two liquids to be proportional to the difference^ or
to the square** of the difference of their densities.              Even this
does not agree with the experiments which will be presently
described     (§ 10).

wetted with water has the same form as a drop of water in oil on

   It is obvious that equations (2) to (9) arc transformed into
those for free liquid surfaces when <r,: or cr1 is put equal to zero.
In the first case the drops are exposed to the air or a vacuum ;
in the second case they are air-bubbles which rest against either
a horizontal or a slightly curved side.    Of course, in the second
case, the magnitudes     K,   /•,   and    are always negative.

250          M. G. Quincke    on the  Capillary Phenomena
    An air-bubble in water under      a moistened    horizontal plane
glass has the same form as a drop of water on a horizontal base
which it does not wet at all — for example, on a woollen cloth or
a glass plate sprinkled with lycopodium-powder.
    If the vertical distance — (K — k) of the lowest point of an
air-bubble from the vertical meridional element of its surface be
measured, aa is obtained ; if the distance — K of the extremity
of the air-bubble from the horizontal glass plate perfectly wetted
with liquid 2, then «ra\/2 is obtained.
   This gives a method by which the capillary-constants of transpa
rent liquids may be determined which has this great advantage —
that the liquid in question only comes into contact with air, and
the free liquid-surface is protected as much as possible from im
purities, which even in small quantities, as I shall afterwards
show, may cause the tension of the surface or capillary-constant
to appear considerably too small.
    4. In order to compare the capillary-constants of liquids
examined according to other methods with those derived from
the observation of capillary heights h, the following method was
adopted.
    By means of a glass-blower's lamp threads of suitable thick
ness were drawn out of a thicker glass tube purified as much as
possible; the upper ends were melted together, aud passed
through two caoutchouc rings, by which the capillary tube which
was formed by the threads was held fast to a strip of plate glass
10 millims. broad and from 100 to 300 millims. in length.            A
scale of millimetres was etched on    the  strip of plate glass, which
simultaneously     with the lower end of the capillary tube was
immersed in the liquid under examination.        The height h to which
the latter rose above the horizontal level of the liquid after the
 closed top of the capillary tube was cut off, was read on the
 scale by means of a horizontal telescope ; the capillary tube was
 cut with a glass knife at the place of the meniscus fluid surface,
 and the greatest and least diameters of the sectional surface were
 determined by means of a microscope with an eye-glass micro
 meter.    The latter had a scale of 100 divisions, of which tenths
 could be estimated.      One division of the scale corresponded to a
 magnitude of from 0'007 to O'OOl millim., according to the
 maguifying-power used.        The means of the estimated values
 of the diameters of the tubes arc given in the following Tables
 under 2r. The last column contains the product

    I have neglected to apply a correction to the observed heights
 on account of the meniscus, as other unavoidable sources of error
 have a much greater influence than this correction.

    As a matter of precaution, the meniscus was brought to a well-
moistened place of the capillary tube by inclining or raising the
latter in the caoutchouc rings.
    By the methods described, glass tubes were obtained which
were always easily wetted by the liquids applied, so that the
angle <a could be put equal to zero, and hr gave directly the spe
cific cohesion a2, from which, by multiplication with half the
specific gravity     =,  the capillary-constant « was obtained               in mil-

    The specific gravities were determined with an hydrometer
suspended by a thin platinum wire and a delicate balance.

      5. Some rectangular troughs, 25 millims. in height and from 50
 to 70 millims. in length and breadth, were made of plates of very
 pure plate glass stuck together with sealing-wax.                         The glass
 trough was filled with the liquid to be examined and placed on
 a horizontal glass plate before a cathetometer, whose horizontal
 microscope or telescope was provided with cross-wires or a glass
 divided as a micrometer, and whose horizontal and vertical dis
 placement could be measured to O'OOl of a millimetre.                       The ho
 rizontal glass plate was cemented on a wooden stand provided
 with three adjusting-screws.              A narrower plate-glass cover was
 laid on the glass trough filled with the liquid under examination,
  and was placed horizontally by means of a level.                      With a clean
  glass thread just      drawn   out before    the   lamp,    of from 0'5 to 2 mil
  lims. diameter, it is easy, after a little practice, to blow an air-
  bubble of suitable magnitude (about 20 or 30 millims. in dia
  meter) under the glass cover. The glass trough was so shifted
  that the contour of the air-bubble, which was suitably illumi
  nated from behind, appeared sharp in the range of the micro
  scope, and then the heights K and k were measured as quickly
  as possible.        The objective of the microscope had a diameter
  of 16 millims., and was about 120 millims. from the object.
  The whole arrangement was similar to that which                       I had before
  used for the measurement of drops of mercury*.
       The glass trough and plates must be as clean as possible, and
  well wetted with the liquid under examination.

  series of air-bubbles in an aqueous solution of hyposulphite of

bubbles in Table     III.  be compared with the values of the same
constant of Table II. derived from the capillary heights, the
former will be found greater than the latter. For the sake of easy
inspection these values are placed side by side in the following
Table,   IV.
   This difference partly results from the assumption           that the
air-bubble has a plane top and an infinitely        large radius R' at
all points of its surface.     Now R' = r for the   vertical meridian-
elements, and is less than at the top of the         air-bubble, where
the principal radii of the curves are equal and     very large.     Thus
the magnitude     ^    for the vertical meridian-element         may be
                                2«
greater than the magnitude -^ for the surface-element of the
top of the air-bubble, or the capillary pressure in the vertical
meridian-element of the air-bubble greater than was assumed in
the approximative calculation in § 2.       In this case K — k must
be found greater than the actual value of the constant a.
    After the production of the capillary surface the constant a
gradually diminishes with the time, and a. must be found just
so much the greater the quicker it can be observed.           Generally
a drop gains its equilibrium much quicker than a column of
liquid which rises in a capillary tube ; and for this reason the
value of the capillary constant must also be found greater in a
drop or an air-bubble than from the heights in tubes.            For this
reason also the diameters of the capillary tube should not be
chosen too small.
    If the angle w were really 180°, then would

    It may be observed with regard to this and the following ex
periments, that the liquids show the greatest cohesion at the
moment they come together; they then intermingle*; conse
quently they become similar to one another in the neighbourhood
of the limiting layer; and by these means the tension «18 of the
 common surface must diminish, which would certainly be 0
as soon as liquids 1 and 2 were the same.                 This decrease is evi
dent from the experiments.
    If bisulphide of carbon and water remain a long time in
 contact, an air- bubble is formed on the top of the drop of bi
 sulphide of carbon, which gradually increases in size.
    Analogous observations were made on drops of olive-oil, oil
 of turpentine, and petroleum, the production of which was similar
 to that of air-bubbles (compare § 5) under a horizontal glass
 plate in water.           The observed values of K, k, and K— k are ne
 gative ;   for  the     sake of brevity, however, the negative signs are
 omitted in the following collection of observations.
    *
       According to Duprd (Thforie M&anique de la Chaleur, Paris 1869,
 8vo, p. 373), the diffusion of two liquids will always take place as soon
 as «l+a3<2F', where 2F'=«, + a3—«1j (foe. cit. p. 3/0).             According to
 these data, then, two liquids would diffuse as soon as «i2, the surface-ten
 sion of the common limiting' surface, became negative; but according to
 my experience, not only do they diffuse for «19=0, but also when «u has
 a very appreciable, of course positive, value.

   It also follows from these observations that the liquids inter
mingle, and the capillary constant «ls becomes smaller the longer
the liquids remain in contact.
   The numbers in column K v/^ are less than those in column
K— k, from which it would follow that the angle #19 was not 0.
The values of this angle, calculated by means of equations (8)
and (9), § 3, are given in the last column of Table X. § 10.

260         M. G. Quincke    on the Capillary Ptienomena
    8. I  have further measured the capillary constants of the com
mon surface of mercury with other liquids.
    The observations collected in Table VIII. were made on flat
drops of mercury in an aqueous solution of hyposulphite of
soda, water, and olive-oil, like those on flat drops of bisulphide of
carbon or chloroform in water (§ 7).        For the observations on
flat drops of mercury      and  petroleum a trough was made of
plates of plate glass cemented with common glue ; for observa
tions in absolute alcohol they were cemented with pure paraffin.
    In order to measure the vertical distance of the horizontal from
the vertical surface-element in flat drops of mercury on a hori
zontal glass plate in a liquid placed in a glass beaker, a flexible
thick copper wire with a vertical thin sewing-needle at the end,
was fastened to the cathetometer.        The needle-point was then
moved so as to touch the top of the drop or the horizontal glass
plate (where the needle-point and its. image must have touched
one another), or was placed at an equal height with the vertical
meridian-element of the drop.       The latter adjustment, however,
is difficult and inexact.
    The determinations from Nos. 3 to 7, for mercury and bisul
phide of carbon, were made in this manner : for Nos. 3 to 5 the
values of a,9 were obtained from K — k; for Nos. 6 and 7 from
Kv'l, by which the marginal angle was put =180°.
    Another part of the observations were conducted in the follow
ing manner.      A horizontal glass tube 18'3 millims. in length
and 25-8 millims. in diameter was closed at the ends by vertical
glass disks, which were pressed by screws against the evenly cut
thick wall of the glass tube. The latter was half filled with mer
cury through an opening in the upper part of the tube; and upon
this the liquid was poured, for whose common limit with mer
cury the capillary constant was to be determined. The depression
of the mercury at the vertical glass plane moistened by the spe
cifically lighter liquid was measured with the cathetometer ; and
this was then, assuming the angle to be 180°, the constant de
noted above (equation 6, § 3) by <z,2.     Observations 1 and 2 for
 bisulphide of carbon, 1 and 2 for petroleum, and 1 to 3 for
 chloroform and mercury were made in this manner.
    By inclining the vessel and immediately observing the capil
                                              I
lary depression on the vertical glass side, endeavoured to make
 the marginal angle =180°.       If the liquids are left long in con
tact with the glass side, then in general the acute angle 012 >- 0°,
as follows, for example, from the observations on turpentine and
 mercury (see Table VIII.), where the angle 0,2 was found, from
 the determinations of the height of the drop K, to be 47° 2', and
 from the depression on a glass plate to be 11° 54'.

   The capillary constant of the common surface of olive-oil and
aqueous alcohol of nearly equal specific gravity is also interesting
on account of Plateau's experiments.
   I determined, in a glass which with the liquids had not been
disturbed for a year or more, and in which the aqueous alcohol
had obtained a greater specific gravity than the olive-oil, the

    10. The experimental results of the three foregoing sections
are collected in Table X.      For the sake of conmparison the ca
pillary constants etl and «2 of the free surface of liquids 1 and
2 are placed next to the capillary constant «12 of the common
surface of both liquids.
    It is at once seen that the relation «,,, = «, — «2is not fulfilled
(comp'are § 2), that a,2 is always smaller than the greater capillary
constant of theTree surface of a liquid, but may also be less than
the smaller of the constants «, or «2.       The last, for example, is
the case for oil of turpentine, olive-oil, or petroleum and water.
    An influence of the specific gravity on the value of «12 is not
perceptible from these observations, although the common sur
face of mercury with other liquids shows a greater capillary
constant than the common surface of other, specifically lighter
liquids, as was to be expected from the great specific weight of
mercury and the great mass of mutually attracting particles.
   The constant «12 shown for mercury and hydrochloric acid
was calculated from earlier* observations of the height of the drop
K=3f514 millims., by assuming —l-= — ?=6'22, and the angle
«12 =180°.
   The considerations of § 5, as well as equations (11) and (12),
are directly applicable to the present observations as soon as the
half difference of the specific gravity, or                —     — -,   is   introduced

Permit me through the same medium to make some criticisms

   A very simple and easy way of making the experiments, I
Lave found, is as follows.    Make a pinhole (a) in one e:iJ of u
card-paper  box (fig. 2).   Through the            Fig. 2.
bottom at the other end thrust the pin
(p) until the head stands a little above
the margin of the box.     Now with the
eye at E work through the pinhole a
at the sky or any strongly illuminated
surface.  The head of the pin will be seen in the pinhole inverted
thus
       (/).
   Mr. Tupper's explanation of this illusion is substantially as
follows. In ordinary vision, as is well known, the retinal im.
pression is made by conical bundles of rays from radiant points
 of the object converged to corresponding focal points in the image ;
 while in this experiment " the rays of light pass from the radiant
point E (fig. 1) and proceed to the lens, whence, after refraction,
 they slightly converge and end on the retina in a circle of light
 containing a dark space corresponding to a section of the pin."
 Now the impress in this case differs from that of natural vision
 in two respects : 1st, it is produced by single rays passing by the
 margin of the pin instead of bundles of rays converged to focal
 points ; 2ndly, the impress in this case is erect, while in natural
 vision it is inverted.
                           " Now it is manifest that two
                                                          diametrically
 opposed positions of the pin on the sensitive retina will produce
perceptions of diametrically opposite positions of the object."
 Pictures formed on the retina in the manner of this experiment,
 to distinguish them from ordinary retinal pictures, Mr. Tupper
 calls "single-ray delineations."
    1. Now there is no doubt that this explanation is substantially
 correct ; but it would have been much clearer if Mr. Tupper had
 distinctly expressed the fact that the retinal impression in his
 experiment is not an image, as in ordinary vision, but a shadow,
 Mr. Tupper seems to have perceived the distinction, but has not
 kept it clearly in his mind ; and hence some confusion in his de
 ductions.     The extreme nearness of the pin is unfavourable for
making an image and therefore for vision, but very favourable
for making a strong shadow.           The truth is we can hardly be
said to   SEE  the pin  at all.  The   shadow on the retina, by a well-
known law, is projected outward into the field of vision and seen
there inverted.      The phenomenon is precisely similar to musci
volitantes, which are also retinal shadows projected into the field
of view and seen inverted.       What proves incontestably-that the
retinal impress in Mr. Tupper's experiment is a shadow and not
an image      is,
                that, like shadows,       may be multiplied (as Mr.
                                          it
Tupper    himself  recognizes)  to  any  extent      by
                                                  multiplying, not the
pins, but the radiant points.      In the experiment with the card

paper box (fig. 2), this may be easily shown by making
of pinholes at  a.   In  each an  inverted  piuhead will   be seen
                                                              in their true positions,
thus   :   /^r~\> But ike pinholes arc                seen
though ttiepins are inverted.                The reason is plain.           The radiant
cones from the se-                                    fig.   3.
veral piuholes cross
each other (fig. 3),
as all radiant cones
do, and their posi-
tions on the retina
are therefore inver- \
ted; while the rays
of each cone do not
cross, as rays of ra
diant cones never
 do unless the retina is beyond the focal point ; and the retinal
 shadows (A, A') of the pin are therefore erect.
     2. Mr. Tupper seems to think that his experiment overthrows
 the law of visible direction, and draws the arrow B (fig. 1) to
 show the direction in which, according to this law, the pinhead
                                                 I
 ought to be seen. But in this think he is mistaken.                 The ex
 periment confirms the law, as indeed docs every phenomenon of
 vision. The law of visible direction                  is,
                                                   that every point of the
 retinal impression         referred to the field of vision along
                               is                                       line         a
 passing through that point and through the optic centre.               The
 visible direction        not represented
                              is                      by
                                                 the line        but   A   B,
                                                                         the         by
 dotted line      A which have added.
                       C           I            This gives the pin inverted
 as we actually find it. How Mr. Tupper was led into this mistake
I    know not—unless he supposes that the ray A, followed back
 along its last course, gives the visible direction.           In ordinary
'vision,    it  true, the visible direction for each point
                 is                                                the axial    is
  ray of the   cone  followed   back    but this
                                             ;       only because this ray
                                                             is
  passes through the optic centre.           But Mr. Tupper says "the
  object     seen where
            is                   not."
                                   it
                                   is      Musci volitantcs are also seen
  where they    are not,   not  only as  to distance but also as to direc
  tion.   Those above the optic axis are seen below the line of sight,
  and those below are seen above. The law of visible direction
  gives us the true position of objects seen             images, but not of
                                                                  by
  objects  seen         by
                     retinal  shadows      but, properly understood, this
                                                 ;
 is  one of those apparent exceptions which prove the law.
      3. The last paragraph of Mr. Tupper's letter             do not quite
                                                                       I
  understand; but          certainly
                              it       contains   an  erroneous  statement.
 "It    may be noticed," he says, "that this analysisdeuionstrates the
  peculiar effect of what call single-ray delineation on the retina,
                                    I

              Prof. J. LeConte   on an  Optical Illusion.          269
which will happen not only when the radiant point is behind
the object, showing it as a shadow, but also when an object, itself
reflecting rays, is seen through a pinhole.    The effect in both cases
is faint vision and an uninverted image on the retina, which would
result in both cases in inverted vision, save that in the latter
there has been a previous inversion which sets things right."
Now in this sentence there is an association, under the term
single-ray delineation, of things which are entirely distinct.
Nothing can be more certain than that vision through pinholes,
in all essential respects, is precisely similar to ordinary vision.
It is vision by retinal image, and not vision by retinal shadow.
The image on the retina in this case, as in all cases of true vision,
is formed by cones of rays from radiant points of the object con
centrated to corresponding focal points in the image — the only
difference being that the radiant cones in pinhole vision are very
small, and the light therefore feeble.      The axial rays of the ra
diant cones cross each other as in ordinary vision (though per
haps not exactly at the same point as in ordinary vision), and
produce therefore an inverted image on the retina.            In other
words, a pinhole acts much as a very small pupil.          The retinal
impression formed by pinhole vision is therefore entirely different
from that in Mr. Tupper's experiment.         The one is a true image,
the other a shadow ; the one is inverted, the other erect.
    What Mr. Tupper means by the last part of the sentence
quoted above    I cannot tell.
    I fear I weary your patience with this long letter.      Only one
word more. Whether the seeing of objects in their true position
be, in man, a primary or an acquired faculty may perhaps always
be a vexed question.     My own belief is that it is partly the one
and partly the other   — that a capacity is innate by virtue of which
the very complex knowledge involved in vision is rapidly, almost
immediately acquired.      The actions of all animals are determined
partly by experience and partly by instinct. But instinct itself
is probaoly but an inherited capacity, improved by the experience
of thousands of generations — a sort of inherited experience.        In
insects the wealth of inherited experience is great, and of indi
vidual experience is small ; while in man the reverse is true.        I
think no one can doubt that a newborn chick or a newborn ru
minant sees objects in their true position. Is it improbable,
then, that in man also erect vision is partly the result of inhe
 rited experience, though confirmed and strengthened by indivi
dual experience — the former inherited through all human gene
rations, or even perhaps (Darwinians would say) through all
 vertebrate generations ?
                  Very truly and respectfully yours,

 VI.    Winkworthite,      a   New Mineral from           the Gypsum     of Hants
                                       County.
             I  first showed the existence of borates in the gypsum
SINCE
   and      anhydrite of this district, in addition to the specimens
collected by myself, some very good ones have been obtained by
others.     Mr. Selwyn, Director of the Geological Survey of the
Dominion of Canada, to whom I had the pleasure of exhibiting
my cabinet while on an official visit to this province during the
past summer, was surprised at the considerable dimensions of
some of the specimens I had secured, as he himself, on inspect
ing the gypsum quarries in company with Professor Hind, had
only seen small nodules.        My success was due, to some extent,
to the good services of the quarrymen ; for, having pointed out
the different borates to some of these and to the manager of some
of the quarries at Winkworth, the locality of the finest specimens
                                                     I
of silicoborocalcite (Howlite of Dana), was fortunate enough to
bring about the preservation of a number of specimens fresh
from the newly blasted rock.         The quantity of gypsuin raised
at those   of the   Wiukworth    quarries now spoken of amounts on
the average to about 22,000 tons a year ; so that there is a good
deal of material for examination.       I may mention that the total
export   of "plaster"       e.

    During the past year, since the publication of the latest paper
of this series (Phil. Mag. April 1870), very good specimens of
the borates have been collected       quarrymen at Winkworth
                                            by                                      :
some of these came directly to myself    for others
                                                 ;    am indebted
                                                               I
to my friend Mr.      Brown, of this county, in whose cabinet
                      J.                                                        I
saw, last summer, the two largest specimens of crystalline How-
lite yet observed, so 1'ar as know. They consisted of rounded
                                  I

              Prof. How     on the    Mineralogy of Nova Scotia.           271
masses      composed of white pearly scales : the largest was made
up    almost    exclusively of Howlite ; there was a little overlying
fibrous silky Ulexite, and a partial covering of the former by
some grey earthy carbonated gypsum, of which the quantity was
small ; the weight of the whole was about seven ounces avoir
dupois : the second specimen was not much smaller ; the largest
previously known to me weighed only about two ounces.                   Along
with these fine and interesting specimens was one which at
once struck me as different from any            I  had seen ; this   I did not
hesitate to beg, and        I   was kindly allowed to have it for exami
nation.       On looking over some nodules subsequently received
from the same place,          I  found two which resembled Mr. Brown's
 so closely that      I  proceeded to analyze them.             The results of
 my investigation showed that the "unfamiliar nodules consisted
 of a new mineral containing much sulphuric acid in addition
 to the elements of silicoborocalcite.
     The nodule first examined (that from Mr. Brown's cabinet)
 weighed about 470 grains ; it had nearly the size and outline of
 a walnut, and small colourless crystals of considerable lustre co
 vered the greater part of its exterior ; a small portion consisted
 of earthy gypsum ; the rest of the mass was colourless and trans
 lucent.      The fracture was nearly flat, and the new surfaces were
 covered with glistening irregular facets.            Under the microscope,
 scrapings      were   seen    to   be transparent    oblique-angled plates.
 The hardness of the interior was about 3, that of the exterior
 about 2.       In the closed tube, fragments gave water and became
 opaque ; before the blowpipe, decrepitated and fused readily to
 a clear bead, giving from the first a bright green flame ; on con
 tinued blowing, frothing took place, the head became opaque,
 and the flame was no longer coloured green.                 Hence the blow
 pipe   reactions   partake      of  those*  which   are  so  characteristic of
  Howlite,    as  pointed out in my original description (Phil. Mag.
 January 1868), and those of selenite.                 The following results
 were obtained from the air-dry mineral ; the old nomenclature
 and notation, still commonly used in mineralogy, are retained: —

which brings out the fact that there is close accordance between
the theoretical and the experimental percentages.
    The second nodule analyzed was sent to me from Winkworth.
It had not so crystalline an exterior as that just described : the
upper part consisted of selenite, the lower of a layer of earthy
gypsum about an eighth of an inch in thickness ; the intervening
portion, forming the greater part of the whole nodule, which
was about the size of the foregoing and weighed nearly 500
grains, had characters agreeing closely with those just described.
The hardness was a little above 3 ; before the blowpipe the flame
 was coloured green, and a bead clear at the edges was obtained
 at first ; on blowing for some time, continuous bubbling, with
 the gradual shrinking of the bead to an opaque coating on the
wire, took place.        Scrapings had just the appearance of those of
No. 1     under  the  microscope.      In the analysis a little carbonate
of calcium was found; this was deducted, the amount (4-47 per
cent.) being calculated from the quantity of carbonic acid obtained.
 The percentages on the air-dried mineral were these : — A

      The agreement here, though not quite so close as in the pre
   ceding case, is sufficient to show that the formula chosen most
  probably represents the composition of the substance analyzed ;
   and the resemblance of the results to those from No. 1 proves
  that we have to do with closely related minerals.                    I

  the second as theoretically derived from the first by the inter
  change of one atom of boracic acid and a little silica for one of
   sulphuric acid, and as being a variety of the species for which           I
   propose the name Winkworthite.
      This new species is intermediate between selenite and silico-

  and it may originate      from the reaction of their elements during
  or after deposition.        The nodular form, which is the charac
  teristic of Howlite as contradistinguished from the crystalline
  habitude of selenite, seems to show that the former was the ori
  ginal deposit, in which case Winkworthite would be a pro
  duct of its alteration by selenite.         Nodules of selenite occasion
  ally occur  in the   gypsum-beds      here  resembling exactly the amor
  phous forms of the borates, of which they are probably the
  pseudomorphs.         I have examined several specimens of Howlite
  for sulphuric acid : in some cases mere traces were present, both
  in the hard crystalline and the soft opaque conditions of the mi
  neral ; while in other specimens, respectively similar, the quan
  tity has been decided and sometimes considerable, even after
  every precaution had been taken to exclude selenite, which, as
  mentioned in my original description (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1868), is
  often present in bands traversing the borate.
     In describing the distinct acicular prisms as a new form of
  natroborocalcite (Ulexite, Dana), I named the locality Newport
  (Phil. Mag. April 1870); but it should have been called Newport

wave-length of light, and have applied the results to explain the
phenomena presented by the sky.                   Another theory has been
given by      Clausius,     who  attributes   the light of the sky to reflec
tion from      water-bubbles,      and  has   developed his views at length
in a series of papers in Poggendorff's Annalen and Crelle'a
Journal*.
     Starting from the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction,
he has no difficulty in showing that, were the atmosphere charged
with globes of water in sufficient quantity to send us the light
which we actually receive, a star instead of appearing as a point
would be dilated into a disk of considerable magnitude.                 But the
requirements of the case are satisfied if we suppose the spheres
hollow, like bubbles ; for then, on account of the parallelism of
the surfaces, but little effect is produced by refraction on a wave
of light.       At the same time, if the film be sufficiently thin, the
light reflected from it will be the blue of the first order, and so
the colour of the sky is apparently accounted for.
     Apart from the difficulty of seeing how such bubbles could be
 formed, there is a formidable objection to this theory, mentioned
 by Brvicke (Pogg. Ann. vol. Ixxxviii. p. 363) — that the blue of
 the sky is a much better colour than the blue of the first order.
 That it is so appears clearly from the measurements quoted in
 the February Number, and from the theoretical composition of
 the blue of the first order f.          Nor can we escape from this diffi
 culty by supposing,         with   Briicke,   that the greater part of the
 light from the sky has been reflected more than once.
      Briicke also brings forward an experiment of great importance
 when he shows that mastic precipitated from an alcoholic solu
 tion scatters light of a blue tint.            He remarks that it is impos
 sible to suppose that the particles of mastic are in the form of
 bubbles.
      In his   last utterance on this subject J, Clausius replies to the
 objections urged by Briicke and others against his theory, and
 shows that, if the illumination of the sky is due to thin plates at
 all, those thin plates must be in the form of bubbles. While ad-
     * Pogg. Ann. vols. Ixxii. Ixxvi. Ixxxviii. Crellc, vols. xxxiv. xxxvi.
     t I  find that I omitted to explain why it is that the light dispersed from
  small particles is of so much richer a hue than that reflected from very thin
  films.    In the latter case the reflected wave may be regarded as the sum
 of the disturbances originating in the elementary parts of the film, and
 these elementary parts may be assimilated to the small particles of the
 former supposition.       The integration is best effected by dividing the sur
 face into the zones of Huyghens ; and it is proved in works on physical op
 tics that the total effect is just half of that due to the first zone.  Now the
 zones of Huy ghens vary as the wave-length ; and thus it appears that in the
 integration the long waves gain an advantage which diminishes the original
 preponderance of their quicker-timed rivals.

 276       The Hon.    J. W.  Strutt  on the Light from   the Sky,
 mitting that if the particles arc very small the ordinary laws of
 reflection and refraction no longer apply*, and that therefore
 this case is not excluded by his argument, he still holds to his
 original view as to the nature of the reflecting matter in the sky,
 considering that the polarization of the light indicates that it
 has undergone regular reflection.        His concluding paragraph so
 well sums up the case that         I cannot  do better than quote it.
 " Das Resultat der vorstehendcn jBetrachtungen kann ich hier-
 nach kurz so znsammenfassen.            Soweit man die gewohnlichen
 Brechungs-     und   Reflexionsgesetze als giiltig anerkennt, glaube
 ich auch meine friiheren Schliisse festhalten zu miissen, namlich,
 dass in der Atmosphare Dampfblaschen vorhanden seyen, und
 dass sie die Hauptursache der in ihr stattfindenden Lichtreflexion
 und ihrer Farben bilden.            Nimrat man aber an, die in der
Atmosphare wirksamen Korperchen seyen so klein, dass jene
 Gesetze auf sie keine Anwendung mehr linden, dann sind auch
 diese Schliisse ungiiltig. Auf diesen Fall ist aber auch die Theorie
 der Farben diinner Blattchen nicht mehr anwendbar, und er
bedarf vielmehr einer neuen Entwickelung, bei welcher noch be-
 sonders beriicksichtigt werden muss, in wiefern diese Annahme
 mit der Polarisation des vom Himmel kommenden Lichtes und
mit der angenahert bekannten Grosse der in den Wolken vor-
handenen Wassertheilchen vereinbar ist."
    Clausius does not seem to have followed up the line of research
here indicated.       My investigation (written, it so happens, be
fore seeing Clausius's papers) shows in the clearest manner the
connexion between the smallness of the particles and the polari
zation of the light scattered from them.          Indeed I must remark
that in this respect there is an advantage over the theory of thin
plates, according to which the direction of complete polarization
would be about 76° from the sun.           It would be a singular coin
cidence if the action     of secondary causes were to augment this
angle to 90°    —  its observed magnitude.       It seems, therefore, not
too much to say that, if the illumination of the sky were due to
 suspended water-bubbles,        neither its colour nor its polarization
would agree with what is actually observed.
    In his celebrated paper on Fluorescencef, Professor Stokes
makes the following significant remark: — "Now this result ap
pears to me to have no remote bearing on the question of the
direction of the vibrations in polarized light.          So long as the
   * In many
               deportments of science a tendency may be observed to extend
the field of familiar laws beyond their proper limits.  Thus the properties
of gross matter are often assumed to hold equally good for molecules. An
example more analogous to that which suggests this remark is to be found
in the common explanation of the mode of action of the speaking-trumpet,

suspended particles are large compared with the waves of light,
reflection takes place as it would from a portion of the sur
face of a large solid immersed in the fluid, and no conclusion
can be drawn either way.         But if the diameter of the particles
be small compared with the length of a wave of light, it seems
plain that the vibrations in a reflected ray cannot be perpendi
cular to the vibrations in the incident ray."          This is the only
passage that I have met with in which the theory of the reflec
tion of light from very small particles is touched upon.
    If it be assumed, as in the theories of Green and Cauchy of
reflection at plane surfaces, that the effect of dense matter is
merely to load the ether, it follows rigorously that the direction
of vibration cannot be turned through a right angle when light
is scattered from small particles.       But all we know in the first
instance is that the velocity of propagation of luminous waves is
less in ordinary transparent matter than iu vacuum ; and this
may be accounted for as well by a diminished rigidity as by an
increased density.       In the first case a scattered ray might be
composed     of vibrations    perpendicular to those of the incident
beam ; so that the matter is not quite so clear as it would seem
from the argument of Professor Stokes.              I believe, however,
that good reasons may be given for rejecting the view that the
difference between media of varying refrangibility is one of rigi
dity. The point is an important one, and            Ipropose to recur to
it later.
     The experiments of Professor Tyndall* with precipitated
clouds exhibit more clearly than had been done by Briicke the
relation between the size of the particles and the nature of the
dispersed light. The observation that the polarization is complete
perpendicular to the track of the incident light is in itself sufficient
to disprove the theory of bubbles.          As the particles increase in
magnitude, the azure and polarization are gradually lost. During
the transition a different and more complicated set of phenomena
present themselves, which will furnisli a test for the theory when
it is extended so as to include the consideration of particles which
are no longer very small in comparison with the waves of light.
    All who have written on this subject seem to have taken for
granted that the foreign matter in the atmosphere is water or
ice.    Even Tyndall, who expressly says that any particles, if
small enough, will do, still believes in the presence of water-par
ticles.    But this view is encumbered with considerable difficulty ;
for even  if, in virtue of its transparency to radiant heat, the air
in the higher regions of our atmosphere          isat   very low tempe

smaller than the wave-length endowed with any stability. These
difficulties might perhaps be got over if there were any strong
argument in favour of the water-particles ; but of the existence
of such   I  am not aware.           Every one knows that a blue haze
evidently    akin   to  the  azure   of the sky obliterates the details and
modifies the colour         of  a distant mountain ; and this, when it
occurs on a hot day, cannot possibly be attributed to aqueous
particles.     On the face of            it,

the optical phenomena can give us no clue.
     The apparatus        bymeans of which the comparison was made
between sky light and that of the sun diffused through white
paper, was originally arranged for measurements of the absolute
absorption of coloured fluids for the various rays of the spectrum,
and had been applied rather extensively in experiments having
that object.       In the shutter of darkened room were placed two
                                               a
 slits in the same vertical line, each about three inches long, and
a   foot apart.     At the other end of the room was an arrangement
of prisms and lenses for producing                pure spectrum on
                                                    a                      screen

in the ordinary way. At first only one prism was used but                   ;        I
 soon introduced another; and the number might probably be
further increased with advantage.              It even more important to

 one over the other, but            by

 situated in front of the dispersion-prisms                 they are brought
 together    so   as  exactly   to  overlap.     The    double   spectrum thus
 formed passes through         a  horizontal    slit  in the   screen  placed so
 as to receive it.         Close behind         an opaque card carrying
                                                   is                                 a
 small vertical slit, which can be slid along so as to allow any
 desired part of the spectrum to pass through.                At the beginning
 and    end  of    aset  of  experiments     the   card      removed, and the
                                                                  is

     When the experimenter looks through the eye-slit in the                         di

 adjustments are properly made, belonging to the same part of the
 spectrum.      By varying the breadths of the original slits, the two
 parts   of the  field may be made equally bright; and when the
 match    is attained, the breadths are inversely proportional to the

consideration.       But if the object be to make a complete com
parison between two lights, it is often more convenient to leave
the widths of the slits arbitrary, and then, by sliding the card, to
seek that part of the spectrum which allows a match.            It was in
this way that the observations on the light of the sky were made.
To give an idea of the degree of accuracy to which the compa
risons may be made,         I may mention that in my experiments on
absorption, the means of six observations were usually correct
to about one in 50 or 60.          In the less-luminous parts of the
spectrum the error might be somewhat greater.
    The difficulty, however, of getting a satisfactory result with
the blue of the sky does not lie in the inaccuracy of the measure
ments, but in the arbitrary character of the light with which it
is compared.        In order to test the theory in a strict manner, the
second light ought to be similar in composition to that which
lights up the sky.         Now the sky is lit not only by the direct
rays   of  the sun, but also by itself and by the bright surface of
the earth.      It is evident, therefore, that the requirements of the
case are very imperfectly met by taking as the second light that
of the sun as received by us, even if the translucent material
through which we diffuse it effects no change in the quality. A
nearer approximation to what we want would probably be found
 in the diffused light of a thoroughly cloudy day.          But here we
 meet with an experimental difficulty ; for the method described
is only available to compare two lights both given at once.             A
 suitable artificial light might no doubt be used as a middle term
to be afterwards eliminated ; but a candle or a lamp would hardly
 be available, on account of the yellowness of their light.        On the
other hand, the bluer radiation from burning magnesium would
 probably be inconvenient, and difficult to keep constant in quality
 from day to day.        I  am, however, in hopes that, by a method
founded on a different principle,       I  may be able to compare the
blue of one day's clear sky with the white light from the clouds
on another.

 Hence we obtain the exact equation
 consequently,          by     expanding         to terms of the second order,                    and

The finding of such terms requires, therefore,                                       a   previous        deter
mination of the values of                    V     and -~.         I      proceed to do this in                   a
simple instance.
  It  will be supposed that the vibrations propagated in the fluid
are functions of the distance from       fixed point, being continu
                                                              a
ously impressed at      given small distance from the point equally
                               a
in all directions.   Although these circumstances differ greatly
from those of the vibrations in Mr. Guthrie's experiments, which
were excited         by
                    tuning-fork, the discussion of this case, which
                          a
has been selected on account of the simplicity of the requisite
analytical calculation, may serve to indicate how the "approach"
was caused in the instances of those experiments, and generally
how     motion of translation can result from the action of aerial
        a
vibrations.
   The distance from the fixed point being called                                          r,   the solution

284                Prof,* Challis on Attraction   caused
considered to express the attractive action, is
From this formula it follows that the attraction is greater as the
impressed velocity /* is greater, and that it decreases rapidly with
an increase of the distance r.         These inferences agree with the
results of the experiments.         It appears also from- the mathema
tical theory that cteteris paribus the attraction is greater as X is
greater.    In the description of the apparatus used in making the
experiments the author states that the fork made 128 complete
 vibrations in a second; whence I infer that the value of         \ was
 8£  feet.  The    distance   b at  which, as  measured   from a centre,
the disturbance might be considered to be made, was very much
less than this ; so that the amount of attraction was little influ
enced by the value of \.
    In those experiments in which a fixed card or a fixed vibrating
 fork was placed near a moveable vibrating fork, the approach
 of the latter was still caused by the diminution of density in
 the intervening space due to the non-periodic part of the velo
city. The explanation of the motion in these instances is analo
 gous to the theoretical account I have given of magnetic attrac
 tion in the Philosophical Magazine for January 18G1 (art. 7,
                          '                                              '
 p. 68), and in the         Principles of Mathematics and Physics
 (art. (4), p. 607).
    In concluding this communication I wish to call attention to
 the circumstance that I have employed above the integral of the
 equation
                               dP          dr*
 in a manner inconsistent with views I have repeatedly advocated
 in this Magazine, and more recently in pp. 251-254 of the above-
 cited work.     I have argued, on grounds that admit of no dis
 pute, that  if the  equation
 be true, there cannot be a solitary wave of condensation, for in
 that case the condensation must vary inversely as the square of r;
 or, if the solitary wave be possible, that equation cannot be true.
 None of my mathematical contemporaries, as far as I am aware,
 have recognized the necessity of deciding between these two
 views, although, till this be done, Hydrodynamics is hardly en

                     by Vibrations   of the Air.                       285
titled to be called a science.    For a long thne I admitted the
possibility of the propagation of a solitary wave, and consistently
therewith maintained that the condensation varied inversely as
the square of the distance.          I
                                 But have recently become aware
that that admission    is contradicted by results of my hydrody-
namical researches which,   I   have reason to say, are well esta
blished.                        I
            The contradiction refer to will be understood from
the following explanation.
    A general law of free vibratory motion parallel and transverse
to an axis, and of uniform propagation of such motion in the
direction of the axis, having been arrived at antecedently to the
consideration of any cause of disturbance of the fluid, it seems
 necessary to conclude that motions produced by given arbitrary
disturbances are actually composed of such spontaneous motions
due exclusively to properties of the fluid.       (I need not here
refer more particularly to these views, further than to say that
the arguments by which they are maintained were fully given in
 the pages of this Journal.)      Now a solitary wave of condensa
 tion or rarefaction cannot be composed in this manner, because
the result of such composition must be both condensation and
rarefaction.    It seems, therefore, that on these principles, when
 a disturbance tends to produce condensation only, the conden
 sation is resolved into a series of alternate condensations and
 rarefactions, arranged in a manner depending on the disturbance
 on each side of a maximum condensation, and diminishing by
 gradations in both directions from this, in such manner that the
 excess of condensation is equal to that impressed by the disturb
 ance. A solitary wave of rarefaction would be similarly resolved.
 Also like resolutions would take place at an abrupt beginning,
 and at an abrupt ending, of a regular series of plane-waves.
 Similar considerations may be applied to account for resolutions
 into series of transverse vibrations caused by abrupt lateral dis
 turbances.
    According to these views, the condensation in waves propa
 gated from a centre, however they may have originated, will vary
 inversely as the distance.      For, as I have elsewhere proved,
 and in fact may easily be shown, by reason of the part of the
velocity expressed by the terra —            j     '-,   the rate of dimi
nution of the condensation or rarefaction with distance from the
centre will be continually changed from the law of the inverse
square of the distance to that of the simple inverse of the dis
tance, provided there be alternate condensations and rarefactions.
For in that case the above-mentioned velocity gives rise to con    a
tinual Qowfrom the rarefied into the condensed parts, and just in
the proportion required for altering the law of diminution with

the distance from the inverse square to the simple inverse.      I
forbear going further into this subject at present, and shall only
remark further that these views bear in an important manner
on the explanation by theory of certain phenomena of light, and
on other parts of theoretical physics.

  XXXVIII.       On the Plane Representation of a Solid Figure.
                  By Professor CAYLEY, F.R.S.*
WE         represent in piano the position of a point P whose co
          ordinates in space are (x, y, z] , by drawing these coordi
nates, on the same scale or on different scales, and in given
directions from a fixed origin in the plane; 0 M = #, MF=y,
WH=z. But observe that the point P" alone does not com
pletely represent the point P ; in fact P" represents a whole
series of points lying iu a line ; any one such point is the point
whose coordinates are 0 m, mp', p1 P".        For the complete repre
sentation of P we require the two points P', P" : these might be
distinguished as the projection P", and the foot-point P'. The
two points P', P" are obviously such that the line joining them
is in a given direction.
   The preceding       is,
                       of course, the ordinary method of orthogonal
projection,  or  geometrical delineation of      solid figure
                                                     a              may
                                                                    :   it
be used under various forms       for example,
                                         ;      the  coordinates x, y, z
may be taken on the same scale and in directions inclined to
each other at angles of 120° (isometrical projection)            or the
                                                                    ;
coordinates x,  y   may  he drawn   on  the same     scale and  at their
actual inclination, 90°, to each other    and  the
                                               ;   coordinate    on zthe
same or an altered scale in any given direction the points 1" ;

                           of a  Solid Figure.                     287
of the lines P' P" give the altitudes of the several points P : this
is also a method in ordinary use.
     But it is to be observed that the points P', P" are both of them
                                                    or
projections, and that the general theory is as follows : we repre
 sent the position of the point P by means of its projections P', P",
 from two fixed points £V, fl" respectively ; the line joining these
 points passes, it is clear, through a fixed point     fi  which is the
 intersection of the plane      of projection by the line which joins
 the two points O', fi".
      Hence we say that a point P in space is represented in piano
 by any two points P', P" which are such that the line joining
 them passes through a fixed point fl.           And we have thus a
  system of constructive geometry which is the more simple on ac
  count of the generality of its basis, and which is at once appli
  cable to any of the special projections above referred to.     I esta
  blish  the  fundamental   notions   of such  a geometry,  and by way
  of illustration apply it to the solution of the well-known problem
  of finding the lines which meet four given lines in space.
      A point P (as already mentioned) is given by its projections
  P', P", which are points such that the line joining them passes
  through the fixed point fl.
      A line L is given by its projections L', L", which are any two
  lines in the plane.     We speak of the point (P', P"), meaning
  the point P whose projections are P', P"; and similarly of the
  line (L', L"), meaning the line whose projections are L', L".
      If P', P" coincide, then the point P is in the plane of projec
   tion ; and so if L', L" coincide, then the line L is in the plane
   of projection.
      If through   fi we draw a line meeting L', L" in the points
   P', P" respectively, these are the projections of a point P on the
   line L. In particular the intersection of L', L" (considered as

288                      Prof. Cayley on            the   Plane Representation
 two coincident points) represents the intersection of the line                                          L
 with the plane of projection.
     The line through the points (P', P") and (Q", Q") has for
its projections the lines                   P
                                 Q' and P" Q".
    Two lines (L', L") and (M', M") intersect each other if only
 the intersections              I/
                         M' and L" M" are the projections of a point
 P — that          the line through the points L'M' and L"M"
                   is,   if
passes through il.        And then clearly           the intersection of the
                                                                   P    is
two lines.
     A plane TI            is
                     conveniently given            means of its trace
                                                                   by         on                    0
 the plane of projection, and of the projections (P', P") of point                                 a
on the plane      or, say,
                       ;        means of the trace @, and of

on the plane.
    Suppose, however, that          plane      given
                                                a           means of
                                                              is         line by                a       L
and   a  point     on  the
                         P   plane.    The    trace      passes through the  @
point of intersection of the line           with the plane of projection —
                                                      L
that      through the point of intersection of the projections L', L".
         is,
To find another point on the trace, we have only to imagine on
the line       point Q, and, joining this with
               L   a                                      to suppose the lineP,
      produced to meet the plane of projection.              The construction
P

                                                               I      Throughit

               ;
    draw    line meeting L', L" in Q', Q" respectively (then these
               a
are the projections of        point     aon the line Q         the lines P'      L);                     Q'
and   P"  Q" are the projections      of  the   line    Q,   and  the intersec
                                                                         P
tion of P'      and P" Q"
                    Q'            therefore the required point on the
                                            is
trace 0.
   The line of intersection of two planes passes through the point
of intersection of their traces ®,, 0a; whence,               the planes have     if
in common        point
                     a               P,
                            the line of intersection          the line joining     is
P  with the intersection of the traces ®,, @a.
    In what precedes we have the solution of the following pro
blem — " Given
      :                point    a           P,

through       meeting the two lines L,, L3."
               P                                       The required line                                 is
in fact the line of intersection of the planes (P, L,) and (P, La);
we have seen how to construct the traces ®j and ®a of these
planes respectively       and the required line
                                    ;                      the line joining   is                        P
with the intersection of ®, and <9a.
I     proceed now to the problem to find the two lines, each of
them meeting four given lines, L,, La, L3,                    (these being, of    L4
course, given        means by of their projections (L',, L"J &c.). The
question      in effect to find on the line
               is                                        point      such that,
                                                                        Lt   a             P
drawing from          line to meet La, L8, and also line to meet L,,

L4, these shall be one and the same line.
   Now, considering in the first instance              as an arbitrary point
                                                                        P

ever meeting the lines                    Llt La,     L3  :   say   it   is   a    generating       line of

                          of a Solid Figure.                         280
the hyperboloid    whose directrices are L,, L2, L3, or of the hyper-
boloid I^LjLj.      Hence projecting from any point H' whatever,
the generating lines and directrices are projected into tangents
of one and the same conic. We know the projections 11 v L'2, 1/8
of the directrices ; to find two other tangents of the conic, we
take two arbitrary positions of P on the line Lx, and construct
as above the projections M', N' of the lines from these to meet
the lines L2, L9.    The conic is then given as the conic touching
the five lines, L',, L/, L'3, M', N' : say this is the conic 2'. Simi
larly, instead of Q!, considering the point SI", we have the lines
L",, L"2, L"3 and the lines M", N", which are the other projec
tions of the lines through the two positions of P ; and touching
these five lines we have a conic 2". Each tangent T' of 2', com
bined with the corresponding tangent T" of 2", represents a line
T meeting Lt, L2, L3 ; to establish the correspondence, observe
that, inasmuch as the line T meets L,, the intersections of T', L',
and of T", L", must lie in a line with Q,; if T' be given, the
point T" L", is thus uniquely determined, and therefore also T"
(since L", is a tangent of 2") ; and similarly if T" be given, T' is
uniquely determined ; the correspondence T', T" is thus, as it
should be, a (1, 1) correspondence.
   Considering in like manner the lines which           meet  Lt, L2, L4,
we have    toucbingJL',, L',,, L'4, M', N' a conic 2' ; and touching
L"lf U'v L"t, M", N" a conic 2" ; each tangent T» of 2', com
bined with the corresponding tangent T" of 2", represents aline
meeting L,, L2, L4, the correspondence            being  a (1,1) corre
spondence such as in the former case.
   The conies 2'j 2' both touch          L',, L'a ; hence they have in
common two tangents.         Say   one  of  these is T'= T', the corre
sponding tangents T"      and T" will coincide with each other and
be a common tangent      of 2", 2"    (these conies both touch  L",, L"2)
and have thus in common two tangents). We have thus              T' = T',
and   T"=T"    as the projections    of  a line meeting L,, La, L3, L4;
and taking the other common tangents of 2', 2' and of 2", 2",
we have the projections of the other line meeting Llf L,, L8, L4.
   The whole process is : — Construct M', M" and N', N", each of
them the projections of a line through a point P of L,, which
meets L2, Ls ; and M', M" and N', N", each of them the projec
tions of a line through a point P of LI} which meets L2, L4 ; we
have then the conies
   2', 2" touching L',, L'2, L's, M', N', and L",, L"s, L"3, M", N"
                       respectively,
   2', 2"      „      L\,lJt,Vt,¥V,W,         „ L'^L^L'^M".^''
                       respectively  ;

290         On the Plane Representation   of a Solid Figure.
and then the projections_of each of the required lines are T'=T',
a common tangent of2', 2', and T"= T", the corresponding com

    It is material to remark how the construction is simplified
when there is given one of the lines, say, M, which meets L,, La,
L3, L4.     Here M is a common directrix of the two hyperboloids ;
we may for the hyperbolas 2' and 2" consider, instead of L,, La,L3
and two new generating lines, the lines L,, L2, L3, M, and a
single new generating line N ; and similarly for the hyperbolas
2', 2" the lines L,, L2, L4) M and a single new generating line N.
2', 2' have thus in common the three tangents L't, L'a, M', and
therefore only a single other common tangent, T'=T'; and simi
larly 2", 2" have in common the three tangents L",, L"2, M",
and therefore only a single other common tangent, T"=         T"; and
we have thus the other line cutting the four given lines.
     I take the opportunity of mentioning the following theorem :
 " If  in a given triangle we inscribe a variable triangle of given
 form, the envelope of each side of the variable triangle is a conic
 touching the two sides (of the given triangle) which contain the
 extremities of the variable side in question."
     We have thence a solution of the problem (Principia, Book I.
 Sect. V. Lemma XXVII.), in a given quadrilateral to inscribe a
 quadrangle of given form.       The question in effect is in the tri
 angle    A B C  to inscribe a triangle a. ft y of given form ; and in
  the triangle  ADE    a triangle «'/8'7'of given form such that the
                                 B
  sides ay, a' </ may be coincident.     The envelope of a y is a cfonic
  touching A D, A E, and the envelope of «' 7' a conic also touch
  ing AD, A E : there are thus two other common tangents, either
  of which may be taken for the position of the side ay=a.1'/;
  and the problem thus admits of two solutions.

    XXXIX.      On the Cause of the Interrupted Spectra of Gases.
            By G. JOHNSTONE STONEY, M.A., F.R.S., %c.*
       the Philosophical Magazine for August 1868, there is a
IN paper    " On the Internal Motions of Gases" t, by the author
of the following communication, in which a comparison is insti
tuted between these motions and the phenomena of light, from
which the conclusion is drawn that the lines in the spectra of
gases are to be referred to periodic motions within the individual
molecules, and not to the irregular journeys of the molecules
amongst one another.
   Mr. Stoney thinks it possible now to advance another step in
this inquiry, and has given to the Royal Irish Academy an ac
count, of which the following is an abstract, of the grounds upon
 which he founds this hope.
   A pendulous vibration, according to the meaning which has
been given to that phrase by Ilelmholtz, is such a vibration as
is executed by the simple cycloidal pendulum.        It     accord                      is,
ingly, one in which the relation between the displacement of each
particle and the time                                            by

            one of the periodic motions within     molecule of    gas         a               a
are of this simple character. We must expect them to be usually
much more involved.        And whatever may happen to be the in
tricacy  of  their form  near to their origin, they will retain sub
stantially  the  same   complex character so long as they advance
through the open undispersing {ether, in which waves of all
lengths travel at the same rate.     But    would seem that     very it                       a
different state of things must arise when the undulation enters                                   a
dispersing medium, such as glass.

of which has the full periodic time T, while the others are har
monics of this vibration.

     Moreover these vibrations will coexist in a state of mechanical
 independence of one another, if the disturbance be not too violent
 for the legitimate employment of the principle of the superposi
 tion of small motions.        So long as the light traverses undisper-
 sing space these constituent vibrations will strictly accompany
 one another, since in open space waves of all periods travel at
 the same velocity.        The general resulting undulation will there
 fore here retain whatever complicated form it may have had at
 first. But when the undulation enters such a medium as glass,
 in which waves of different periods travel at different rates, the
 constituent vibrations are no longer able to keep together, each
 being forced to advance through the glass at a speed depending
 on its periodic time.         Thus there arises a physical resolution
 within the glass of series (4) into its constituent terms*.            And
 if the glass be in the form of a prism, the pendulous undulations
 corresponding to the successive terms of series (4) will emerge
 in different directions, so that each will give rise to a separate
 line in the spectrum of the gas.
    We thus find that one periodic motion in the molecules of the
 incandescent gas may be the source of a whole series of lines in
 the spectrum of the gas.          The nth of these lines is represented
 by the term
in which Ca is the amplitude of the vibration \ and consequently
 C;j represents the brightness of the line.          If some of the coeffi
 cients of series (4) vanish, the corresponding lines are absent
from the spectrum.          This is analogous to the familiar case of the
 suppression of some of the harmonics in music, and appears to
be what usually occurs in those spectra which are called by
PlUcker spectra of the Second Order.
    * Other
              expansions similar to Fourier's series can be conceived, in
which the terms, instead of representing pendulous vibrations, would re
present vibrations of any other prescribed form ; and hence a doubt may
arise whether the physical resolution effected by the prism is into the
terms of the simpler series.      That it is so may, perhaps, not be sus
ceptible of demonstration ; but the following considerations seem to
show it to be probable in so high a degree that it is the hypothesis which
we ought provisionally to accept. For, first, the form of the emerging
vibrations is independent of the material of the prism, since the lines cor
respond to the same wave-lengths as seen in all prisms ; and, secondly, it is
independent of the amplitude of the vibration within very wide limits, since
the positions of the lines remain fixed through great ranges of temperature,
and, in many cases, when the temperature falls so low that the lines fade
out through excessive faintncss.     The first consideration shows the series
to be the same under varying circumstances ; and the second consideration
suggests, as in the theory of the superposition of small motions, that this
series is a series of pendulous vibrations.

294              Mr. G.   J.  Stoney on the Cause   of  the
     In  spectra of this kind the lines which fall within the limits
of the visible spectrum appear at first sight to be scattered at
irregular intervals.     This may arise, and probably does in most
cases arise in part, from the circumstance that there may be
several distinct motions in each molecule of the gas, each of
which produces its own series of harmonics in the spectrum,
which by their being presented together to the eye give the
appearance of a confused maze of lines.           But it appears also to
arise   in part from the absence of most of the harmonics, so that
it is not easy to trace the relationship between the few that re
main.      To do so without the assistance of spectra of the First
Order, requires that we should have at our disposal determina
tions of the wave-lengths of the lines made with extraordinary
accuracy ; and perhaps in a few cases, as, for example, in the
case of hydrogen, the marvellous determinations which have been
             O
made by Angstrom may have the requisite precision.
    The ordinary spectrum of hydrogen consists of four lines, cor
responding to C in the solar spectrum, F, a line near G, and A.
 To these it is possible that we ought to add a conspicuous line
 in the solar prominences which lies near D, but which has not
yet been found in the artificial spectrum of hydrogen.            Of these
lines, three, viz. C, F, and h, are to be referred to the same mo
tion in the molecules of the gas.
  0 In fact the wave-lengths        of these lines, as determined by
Angstrom*, are !
                         h =4101-2 tenth-metres.

    These are their wave-lengths in air of standard pressure and
 14° temperature, determined with extraordinary precision.              We
 must correct these for the dispersion of the air,       so as to arrive at
 the wave-lengths in vacua which are proportionate to the periodic
 times.     Now, by interpolating between Ketteler's observations         t
 on the dispersion of air, we find

 Thus the outstanding differences are all fractions of an0eleventh-
 metre, an eleventh-metre being the limit within which Angstrom
 thinks that his measures may be depended on.
     The wave-length 0-13127714 of a millimetre corresponds to
 the periodic time 4-4 fourteenth-seconds, if we assume the velo
 city of light to be 298,000,000 metres per second.
     Hence we may conclude, with a good deal of confidence, that
 4-4 XlVth-seconds is very nearly the periodic time of one of the
 motions within the molecules of hydrogen.
     The other harmonics of this fundamental motion in the mo
 lecules of hydrogen, viz. the 19th, 21st, 22nd, Sic. harmonics,
 are not found in this spectrum of hydrogen.                         But two other
 spectra    of  hydrogen        are   known     to    exist   in  which    there are a
 great number of lines; and possibly the missing harmonics will
  be found amongst them when their positions shall have been
  sufficiently accurately mapped down.                   A far more moderate de
 gree   of  accuracy      will  suffice  in this  case   than was required by the
 foregoing investigation.
    But it is from the examination of spectra of the First Order that
 the most copious results may be expected.                       These spectra con

 gregate   the appearance of patterns which often resemble the
 Hillings on a pillar.     When these spectra are more carefully ex
amined, it is probable that the whole series of lines occasioning
 one of the fluted patterns will be found to be the successive har
monics of a single motion in the molecules of the gas.             It may
readily be shown that such patterns as are met with in nature
may in this way arise.       For this purpose it is only necessary to
make some suitable hypothesis as to the original undulation im
pressed by the gas upon the aether.           Thus, if the law of this
undulation were the same as that of the motion of a point near
the end of a violin-string, and of a periodic time sufficiently
long (as, for example, two million-millionths of a second), this
undulation, when analyzed by the prism, would give a spectrum
covered with lines ruled at intervals about the same as that be
tween the two D lines, and of intensities varying so as to become
gradually brighter and then gradually fainter several times in
succession in passing from line to line along the spectrum.
These alternations     would   give a fluted appearance to the spec
trum ; and from appropriate hypotheses as to the original vibra
tion, all the patterns met with in nature would result. Possibly
it may prove to be practicable to trace back from the appearances
presented within the limits of the visible spectrum to the cha
racter of the original motion to which they are all to be referred.
But, however this may be, it will be easy in a spectrum of this
kind, in which we have a long series of consecutive harmonica,
to determine at least the period of this motion ; and it is in the
examination of these spectra that the most easily obtained results
may be expected.       But the necessary observations are at present
almost altogether wanting.         The only case in which the author
had been able to arrive at any result was that of the nitrogen
spectrum of the First Order, observed by Pliicker.              It would
appear   from  his  observations*     that the  more   refrangible  of the
two fluted patterns observed by him is due to a motion in the

about the 1960th to the 1995th.

the preceding determination of one of the periodic times in hy

  tion of the same force implies its renewal from some other source.
     That a  magnet, in the continued exertion of its force without
  apparent diminution (as, for instance, when suspended                    its            by

 such an apparent expenditure of power as would account for the

 obtains its renewal of expended power             as yet is  matter for ex  a
 perimental investigation.
     To the writer's mind the modes of magnetization suggest, to
a   certain extent, the direction in which such an investigation
 might be profitably pursued.           The voltaic current, magneto-
 electric current, currents of static electricity, or simple vibration
 of  a  magnetic in       adiamagnetic medium in             magnetic field,
                                                                         a
 alike give rise to the magnetic force.
     Now in each of these cases magnetism              the resultant, not of
                                                               is
 the force acting primarily, but of that which           evokes there

 magnetism in the magnetic meridian, but diamagnetic polarity.
 The static, magneto-electric, or voltaic currents do not transmit  '
 any of the force      by which they exist per se, but expend them
 selves in exciting   a state of diamagnetic tension in the surround
ing media, which in its turn creates the magnetic current, the
amount and intensity of which at the time must be the measure
of the forces which excited it. Each of the forces quoted, so far
as its active power        concerned,
                           is              finite and dependent on the

298            Mr. C. W. Vincent      on the Relations     of
the primary magnet loses nothing of its own power; therefore
the only apparent force to which we can look for the production
of the newborn magnetism is that exerted in moving the piece
of steel through the lines of magnetic force of the parent mag
net.    To the writer it seems impossible to believe that the tem
porary exertion of muscular or other energy is thus converted
into a force which is capable of indefinite multiplication by its
own exertion through time.          He feels that such a conclusion
could not be accepted in the case of other phenomena.        The force
used to squeeze out the air from between two perfectly straight
polished surfaces is not now accepted as the cause of their con
tinued adhesion, as the muscular exertion used to invert the
barometer-tube is not the measure of the force which holds so
many ounces or pounds of mercury apparently against the gra
vitating force. We know* that the very force which appears
to be militated against is the maintaining power; and the
analogy which to the mind of the writer is presented in some
of the phenomena of magnetism leads him to expect that, when
its sustaining-power is fully understood, it will be found to be
the same force as that which it exerts, and by which it is created,
viz. diamagnetism.      In putting forth these hypotheses, the writer
 does not so much intend to direct the minds of scientific supe
riors as to the definite end of a research into magnetic and dia-
 magnetic action as to give a sort of explanation of the drift of the
 following experiments, which might otherwise not be understood
from his point of view.
    Diamagnetism is polar and dual/ Static electricity gives the
 opportunity of splitting this duality and separating the polarity,
 by the electrification of matter in the positive and negative states
 respectively.    He trusts he is not too bold in making these asser
 tions ; but philosophers have so long been accustomed to take up
 the argument from the other end, that, although not dealing with
 this hypothesis in the present paper, he is compelled to risk
 agreement with the thoughts of others.
    A magnet is a circuit of power, the lines of expression of force
 equal in amount within and without; those within have a re
 lation in direction to those without, and in fact are continua
 tions of them absolutely unchanged in their nature, so far as the
 experimental test can be applied to them.         Every line of force,
 therefore, at whatever distance it may be taken from the uiag-
 net, must be considered as a closed circuit, passing in some part
 of its course through the magnet, and having an equal amount
 of force in every part of its course*.      If,
                                               then, we can cut off the
 lines of force exterior to the magnet, or any part of them, the
 total magnetic force exerted should be disturbed to the extent

of the interference.        In other words, if magnetism be dependent
on the diamagnetic polarity of the medium surrounding                  any   it,
alteration of, or interference with that polarity should likewise be
shown in      a corresponding alteration of the magnetic force itself.

to swing horizontally, was the test-needle used in the following
experiments.         The suspended needle being come to rest, when
either the north or south pole was approached                   by
                                                            an electrified

the tube round and round; or                the tube were laid down at
such      a convenient distance as prevented actual contact, but in
the same direction as the magnetic meridian, the needle then set
itself perpendicular to the electrified tube, gradually returning
to its normal position as the tube's electricity became dissipated
through the air or otherwise.
  A      stick of sealing-wax or other negative dielectric gave the
like result   ;   or   byapproaching both cautiously at the same time,
the needle was maintained without alteration of position.
     The needle was then itself electrified             by
                                                  contact    and whether

positive or negative electricity were employed, its behaviour was
apparently identical with that of piece of copper wire suspended
                                               a
by by
    a    torsion-thread under similar circumstances, being repelled
      like, and attracted        unlike or neutral electrics — returning,
                                 by
however, to the magnetic meridian as the electricity became
dispersed.

                                      a
and which had not been remagnetized for some years, so that its
magnetic force might be reckoned as constant, was placed on                          a
level with the suspended test-needle, and at just such            distance
                                                                         a
 that actual contact could not take place betwixt the opposing
poles.       Of course the needle immediately took up its position
 with its north pole opposite the south, and the south opposite
 the north pole of the magnet, the sharp suddenness of its vibra
 tions in coming to rest testifying to the inductive power mutu
 ally exerted.     A   body electrically excited being then presented
 to     it,
          attraction was immediately manifested;       the needle could
 be drawn bodily away from the magnetic field              or   the sepa
                                                                ;       if
 rate ends were acted on, the north or south pole could be drawn
 completely round till       it was opposite the pole of the magnet of
 the same name     ;   or   ifthe needle was itself positively electrified,
 then repulsion was manifested for positively, and attraction for
 negatively electrified bodies; and the opposite behaviour            elec   if
 trified negatively.
     Similar results were likewise obtained when very small quan
 tities of static electricity were employed;        piece of sealing-wax
                                                         a

300             Mr. C. W. Vincent    on the Relations of
 half an inch in length sufficed to give an amount of electricity
 energetic enough to modify materially the forces exerted by the
 magnets in their mutual relations, though not sufficient to ab
 solutely neutralize for the time their respective polarity.
    The experiment was then reversed : an electrified glass tube
 was presented to the north end of the test-needle in such a man
 ner that it was drawn across the magnetic meridian ; and whilst
so held a small bar-magnet, held horizontally and parallel to the
tube, was gradually brought near.        Under these circumstances
the needle, when the bar-magnet was close enough, could be
brought to a state of equilibrium between the two, attracted and
repelled by neither, but quite easily affected by an electrified
 body, another magnet, or a piece of soft iron being approached
to it.   The same state of equilibrium was obtained by presenting
to either pole of the needle the pole of the magnet of the same
name — in the one case placing it in juxtaposition with the tube,
iu the other opposite to it.
    When the test-needle is electrified either positively or nega
tively, it is attracted by neutral conductors ; but if conductors
round about it be at something like equal distances, its direction
is then assimilated to the magnetic north and south.
    The magnetic needle, in an apparently neutral state between
the opposing magnet and electrified body, was examined and
found to have the opposite static electricity to that acting induc
tively on it ; so that it would appear capable of holding the two
forces at the same time.
    The foregoing experiments appear to the writer to demonstrate
that  :
    If the one or the other or both poles of a magnet are subject
to the inductive influence of another magnet, the effect of bring
ing static electricity into the magnetic field, whether it be in the
positive or negative state of separation, is to weaken their mutual
inductive power.
    A piece of soft iron wire suspended by the middle behaved in
the magnetic field as if it were a magnet when acted on by the
opposing forces, the mutual reaction being very clearly seen
when the magnetic or electric force was in preponderance or
closer approximation ; and if the two were made to unite in di
rection, the iron was capable of being drawn to either the elec-
trifier or the magnet from a greater distance than it could have
by either per se. A strongly electrified glass tube placed at
right angles to the poles of the horseshoe-magnet before men
tioned, whilst the soft iron was suspended in front, charged the
end of the iron nearest to itself with positive, the further end
with negative electricity ; and the electric attraction for a neutral
mass, added to the magnetic attraction, enabled the magnet to

attract it at a greater distance than it previously did.     The wire
was pointed.
   The writer next insulated the horseshoe-magnet, and endea
voured to make evident a reduction of magnetic attractive power
when it was itself charged with electricity.
    Pieces of soft iron wire one and a half inch in length were
attached by attraction successively to one pole till the point at
which the magnet ceased to attract was nearly reached.          Elec
tricity was then passed into the magnet ; and during the charging
process the last piece of wire in the magnetic chain first vibrated
strongly, and finally fell off. When two pieces of iron wire were
hung side by side at the end of the chain, their divergence wasv
great whilst the magnet was receiving electricity ; and if the at
tracting force was feeble, one or the other of the pieces dropped off.
   Another mode in which the experiment was performed was by
elongating either pole with a piece of soft iron two inches long
and held by magnetic attraction, to the end of this, again, pieces
of soft iron wire about one inch in length, and then partially
closing the magnetic circuit by a stout nail laid across the limbs
of the magnet : by moving the latter nearer to or further from
the poles the force holding the wires at the end of the elongated
pole could be brought within limits that enabled the feeble elec
tricity employed to contend with it. Under these circumstances,
whenever the magnet was charged with electricity, one or more
wires immediately fell off.
   After repeating the experiment a few times with the same
wires, the same ends being attached to the same pole each time,
it was found that they had become to a slight extent magnetic,
the magnetism according in polarity with the law of magnetiza
tion by contact; so that the electricity had to overcome an ad
ditional attraction, which it probably itself assisted to create, in
addition to that previously existing.      A powerful electrical ma
chine would probably enable an experimenter to demonstrate
these effects more fully.
    He then placed the magnet on the upper side of a glass plate,
the lower side of which, except for about two inches round the
edges, was coated with tinfoil, and had a good earth connexion,
and, throwing some fine iron-filings on the poles, charged the
system.     Whilst doing this a number of tilings were thrown off
from the poles and dispersed, the filaments of adhering particles
first rapidly vibrating and oscillating, each filament exercising a
greater degree of repulsion on its neighbour than it previously
did, and finally jumping off in small masses, which instantly dis
sipated as soon as they got beyond the scope of the magnet's
greatest intensity.    On making contact between the tinfoil and
magnet,    the filaments  returned to their original degree of diver

gence.      On again charging the magnet another portion of filings
was thrown off j and the writer in this way succeeded in collecting
iu front of the magnet about one-twentieth part of the filings
employed, after which he was unable further to separate them
than by increasing the divergence of the iron filaments on the
magnetic poles each time the arrangement was charged.
     The filings were removed, and the test-needle brought over
the magnet so that the point was drawn downwards to an
angle of 60° in its endeavour to attain contact with the opposing
pole, but was not allowed quite to reach it.         The magnet was
then charged as before ; and at once the needle began to with
 draw itself, the point becoming charged with positive, the head
 with negative electricity ; a conductor was presented to it ; it
 discharged itself and returned towards the magnet, and could
 have been kept in this state of oscillation indefinitely.      When
 the magnet was discharged, the needle at once flew back to its
                                                                        •
 former position ; left to itself, the point by degrees discharged
 itself into the air and returned to the magnet.
     Two needles just touching the poles of the magnet, in the
 arrangement above described, could not be repelled ; but when
 the magnet was charged, their free ends took a much greater
 degree of divergence than they previously had.

  rpHE     Messrs. Longmans are issuing a series of elementary works
   •*•
         on various branches of mechanical and physical science. These
  are intended for general use in schools, and for the self-instruction
  of working men ; to both of which purposes their uniformly low
  price and moderate amount of matter are decidedly appropriate. The
  late Ur. Miller, having undertaken the authorship of a chemical text
  book for this series, had completed his task and was engaged in read
  ing the proof-sheets, \vhcn he was seized with an illness which un
  happily proved fatal. His friend Mr. C. Tomlinson, F.R.S., to whom

the book had already owed certain changes in style and arrangement,
undertook to see it through the press, and has discharged his trust
with the very great care and pains which distinguish his contribu
tions to scientific literature.
     Self-instruction in any subject is generally unsystematic in its
course and vague in its results ; few have recourse to it, unless to
find that they have lost time and made habitual mistakes in the
 absence of a teacher.        Yet, if we were asked to name the most satis
 factory chemical handbook for a self-instructing student, the one
 now before us would naturally occur to our mind.                    It is so simple
 and straightforward.         These were characteristics of the author him
 self; and they would have rendered it easy to recognize the work as
 his, even had no name been prefixed to its pages.
     Dr. Miller's book is divided into seventeen chapters. The first
 relates to preliminary matters, such as the Scope and Aim of Che
 mistry, Chemical Notation, Mixture and Combination.                       The next
 nine chapters relate to the Non-Metals ; the remainder to the Metals.
 Short explanations of theoretical points are scattered throughout the
 book ; and very clear directions are given for the performance of a
 large number of experiments, which for the most part only require
 very little outlay for their execution.            The metric system, the cen
 tigrade    scale   of  temperature,    and     the  Berzelian nomenclature are
 adopted throughout.           Dr. Miller's    text-book   is altogether one of the
  most   useful   elementary    manuals     we   have met   with for a long time.

 of making quantitative         chemical     methods     more    accessible in their
  literary aspect    than   heretofore.      Hence    he  prefers an alphabetical
  arrangement.         Moreover,   after   he  has  named     any substance that is
  intended     to  undergo     determination,      he  prominently specifies the
  " principle " upon which the estimation is based, the " applications "
  of the principle, and then the
                                         " methods " of the estimation itself.

  reading many paragraphs (as in other analytical treatises), the me
  thod .that suits his particular problem for the time being.                     The

   and copiousness of detail.        We regret, however, the intentional ab
   sence of figures from Professor Storer's work, and hope he will re
   consider his decision upon this point. Without some pictorial aid it
   is impossible to describe satisfactorily such apparatus as a combus

  Throughout the dreary desert of description, oases of poetry are cun

  natural theology, apparently of his own accord. Here, however, he
  will find thicket after thicket of Scripture texts somewhat incon
  gruously flourishing;    and may not improbably interpret them as
  evidence of design, though not very honest design. Recurring to the
  poetry, he will remember that it consists of a few solemn pieces from
  really great masters, and many pieces that are mere rubbish (some
  of the latter are significantly anonymous) ; Eulalia Gurson rhymes
  eloquently about the action of potassium upon ice, but unhappily has
  no respect for the laws of accent.     And he will probably agree with
 us that our ideas are not to be enlarged after such a fashion, nor our
  minds exalted.

 Text-Books of Science.      The Elements of Algebra and Trigonometry.
     By W. N. GRIFFIN, B.D., some time Fellow of St. John's College,
     Cambridge.    Longmans and Co. 1871.        Pp. 312.
     This book consists of three parts. The first contains the usual
 course of algebra up to and including quadratic equations; the
 second contains a rather full account of the properties and uses of
 the logarithms of numbers ; the third contains the solution of plane
 triangles, the ordinary questions of heights and distances, a few
 questions of mensuration, with just so much of the theory of trigo
 nometry as is necessary as a foundation for these applications.        It
 follows, of course, that the treatment of the subject of trigonometry
 is far from complete ; e. g. the whole subject of the relations between
 the goniometrical functions of angles is omitted.         On the other
 hand, within the prescribed limits, the subjects are treated very fully ;
 and while the explanations and expositions are amply sufficient for
the learner, they are not excessive.      The book contains a very large
number of well-chosen examples ; this, in such a book, is a capital
point ; and there is no doubt that the student who works conscien
tiously through the book will obtain a thorough knowledge of the
subjects which it professes to teach.
     We should like to know what is Mr. Griffin's authority for the

 is called the French division of the circle is given in most English
 text-books, but had always thought it appeared in them mainly on
 grounds of conservatism, or because examiners sometimes ask for an
 account of it. The history of the matter is thus stated (and, we

 and so on ; and this division was adopted in the Mecanique Celeste of
 Laplace and other contemporary scientific works. The change, how
 ever, from the nonagesimal to the centesimal degree was attended
 with no advantage sufficient to compensate for the great sacrifice of
 tables and records which its adoption rendered necessary, and its

Algebraical Exercises and Problems ; with Elliptical Solutions,                By
          HUGH McCoLL.            Pp.100.    Longmans and Co. 1870.
    This may be fairly called a remarkable book : in the well-worked
field of elementary algebra the author has hit on some things which
 (so far as our knowledge goes) are new. The value of the novelties is,
 to be sure, a different question. In the first place the " elliptical
             "
 solution       is a novelty. We shall best give a notion of what is meant
 by an elliptical solution by producing a specimen.              The question is
 this : — " A plays at chess with B, winning 3 games out of 4 ; and
 afterwards with C, winning 2 games out of 3 ; at the end of 21
 games he has won 15. How many did he play with each ?" (p. 34).
 And this is the elliptical solution : — " He played x games, suppose,
 with B, out of which he won              ....  games ; and he played        ....
 games with C, out of which he won            ....   games.     And since we are
told that he won altogether          ....  games, we have the equation
from which we getx=12" (p. 69). The elliptical solutions give
just    the kind of information which a teacher commonly gives vivd
vote to the learner who has not yet acquired the art of expressing
questions in an algebraical form, and there can be no doubt as to
their value.
    The second novelty is this : — A considerable number of examples
are set    in  a form such as the following.        " If 1 —  —     „ ounces  cost
                                                              l+*

                                                 (p. 27).    This is, of course,

We very much question whether in practical teaching the new form
has any advantage over the old.          In an appendix Mr. McColl pro
poses    a uniform method of resolving algebraical expressions into
factors which can frequently be employed with advantage.            On the
whole this is a book from which any one engaged in teaching algebra
may get useful hints, though we do not suppose it will displace any
of the many excellent elementary works on Algebra at present in
common use.

 •*•   "  On the Extension of the Coal-fields beneath the Newer For
mations of England ; and the Succession of Physical Changes whereby
the Coal-measures have been reduced to their present dimensions."
By Edward Hull, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S., Director of the Geological
Survey of Ireland.
    In this paper the author, embodying with his own the observa
tions of previous writers on the physical geology of Great Britain,
especially those of Murchison, Godwin-Austen, Ramsay, Phillips,
and the late Professor Jukes, showed that the Coal-measures were
originally distributed over large tracts of England, to the north and
to the south of a central ridge or barrier of Old Silurian and Cambrian
rocks, which stretched across the country from North Wales and
Shropshire into the Eastern Counties, skirting the southern margin
of the South Staffordshire Coal-field.        This barrier, or ridge, was a
land-surface till the close of the Carboniferous period.
    To the north of the central barrier, the highlands of Wales, the
mountains of the Lake-district, and probably small tracts of the south
ern uplands of Scotland formed land-surfaces skirting portions of
the Carboniferous area, while the Carboniferous tract to the south of
the central barrier was probably bounded by a land-surface trending
along the southern coast of England.          The distribution of the Coal-
measures at the close of the Carboniferous period was illustrated by
 a Map, No. 1 .
    It was then shown that the whole Carboniferous area was sub
jected to disturbances through the agency of lateral forces, whereby
the strata were thrown into folds along axes ranging (approximately)
in east and west directions ; and as denudation accompanied and
followed these disturbances, and acted chiefly over the arches (or an-
ticlinals), large tracts were divested of Upper Carboniferous strata,
and thus the first phase in the marking out of the limits of our pre
sent coal-fields was brought about.        The effects of these movements
and denudations were illustrated by Map No. 2.
    The disturbances which ensued after the deposition of the Permian

           Archdeacon       Pratt on   the  Solid Crust of the Earth.          307
strata, and which produced the discordances of stratification between
the newer Palaeozoic and Mesozoic formations, were shown to have
acted along lines ranging approximately north and south, parallel to
the axis of the Pennine Chain, and consequently in a direction trans
verse to those of the previous period.           These disturbances were also
accompanied by        the  denudation    of strata  from the anticlinal arches,
and the consequent disseverance of the Coal-measure tracts over
certain definite areas.        The results of these movements (the second
phase     in   defining   the  bounds of the coal-fields) were illustrated
by Map      No.   3.
     From a consideration of the foregoing observations, the author
came to the conclusion that the tendency of the British coal-fields to
arrange themselves into the form of "basins" (sometimes partially
concealed by newer strata), a tendency strongly insisted on by Prof.
Ramsay, was due to the intersection of the two systems of flex
ures above described, one anterior to the Permian period, the other
anterior to the Triassic period, and that the actual disseverance of the
 coal-fields into basins was due to denudation acting with greatest
 effect along the anticlinal arches of these flexures.
      The inference that the Yorkshire and Durham coal-fields ate
 really basins rising to the eastward under the Mesozoic strata was
 drawn, an inference supported by the easterly rise of the Coal-
 measures along the sea-coast from the Coquet to the Tyne.
     Guided by these principles, the author maintained that we are
 now in a position to determine with great accuracy the actual limits
of the Coal-measures under the Mesozoic formations over the area to
 the north of the central barrier ridge (as indicated on Map No. 3),
 and that to the south of the ridge the application of the same prin
ciples would assist towards the solution of the question, though in
 a less degree, owing to the fewer opportunities for observation of the
 Palaeozoic formations.
     The author, however, concurred in the views advanced by Sir
 R. I. Murchisou*, that, in consequence of the great amount of denu
 dation which the Carboniferous rocks had undergone over the area
of the south of England previous to the deposition of the Mesozoic
 formations, little coal was to be expected to remain under the Creta
 ceous rocks.
     " On the Constitution of the Solid Crust of the Earth."
                                                                            By the
 Ven. John Henry Pratt, Archdeacon of Calcutta, M.A., F.R.S.
     In this paper the author applies the data furnished by the pen
 dulum-observations recently made in India to                 test the truth of the
 following hypothesis regarding the Constitution             of  the Earth's Crust,
 which he propounded in 1804, viz.: — that the               variety we see in the
 elevation and depression of the earth's surface in          mountains and plains
 and ocean-beds has arisen from the mass having              contracted unequally
    *  In his Address at tha Meeting of the British Association at Nottingham,
 18(56.   On the other hand, the views of Mr. K. Godwin-Austen, which tend
 rather in an opposite direction, should be well weighed l>y all who are inter
 ested in this question,   (Quart. Journ. Gcol. Soc. vol. xii.)

 in becoming solid from     a fluid state ; and that below the sea-level,
 under mountains and plains, there is a deficiency of matter approxi
 mately equal in amount to the mass above the sea-level ; and that
 below ocean-beds there is an excess of matter approximately equal
 to the deficiency in the ocean when compared with rock ; so that the
"amount of matter in any vertical column drawn from the surface to
 a level surface below the crust is now, and ever has been, approxi
 mately the same in every part of the earth.
     In order to make this hypothesis the subject of calculation, the
 author takes the case of the attenuation of matter in the crust below
 mountains and plains, and the excess of matter below ocean-beds, to
 be uniform to a depth m times the height above the sea-level or the
 depth of the ocean, as the case may be.

   The author points out from this Table that Dr. Young's, or tne
usual method of correction for local attraction, so far from improving
matters, introduces very large residunl errors of the arc and ocenn
stations, and, at places on the arc of meridian, oil lying on the same
side with reference to Punnoe.             He observes that neither the usual
method nor his own much affects the coast stations ; and attributes
this to the want of more complete knowledge of the contour of the
surface, both above and below the sea-level, in these parts.                        But his
own method, in the case m= 50, remarkably reduces the effects of

local attraction at stations on the arc of meridian and out at sen (in
Minicoy, an island 250 miles west of Cape Comorin or Punnoe) ; for
the sensible negative quantity at Damargida and positive quantity at
Kalianpur indicate a deficiency of matter below the first and an
excess below the second, which exactly tally with the results inde
pendently brought out by relative deflections of the plumb-line as
obtained by the survey : and the two large and most important effects,
negative at Kaliana and positive at Minicoy, may be said to be almost
annihilated by this method of correction.      This last case of an excess
of gravity out at sea (where the surrounding ocean has a deficiency
of matter) being explained by his method he regards as a very strong
argument in its favour.     And he finishes by saying that if his me
thod is thus far successful in the particular supposition of the dis
tribution below, whether in excess or defect, being uniform, which
is most likely not strictly the case, there is every reason for con
cluding that pendulum-observations give support to the hypothesis
regarding the Constitution of the Earth's Crust, when viewed 0:1 a
large scale, admitting of local peculiarities, like the deficiency of
matter near Damargida and the excess near Kalianpur, and the
similar deficiency near Moscow.

    "On Fluoride of Silver."— Part II. By George Gore, F.R.S.
   This paper contains an exhaustive account of the behaviour of
argentic fluoride in vessels of platinum, carbon, and various fluo
rides in contact with chlorine, bromine, and iodine at various tempe
ratures. When argentic fluoride is completely decomposed by chlo
rine in platinum vessels at a red heat, the reaction agrees with the
following equation :
                    4AgF + 4Cl + Pt=4AgCl, PtF4.
   Vessels of cryolite and of fluor-spar were found incapable of re
taining argentic fluoride in a melted state.    Other vessels were also
made by melting and casting various mixtures of earthy fluorides at a
high temperature ; and although forming beautiful products, pro
bably capable of technical uses, they were not capable of retaining
silver fluoride in a state of fusion. Numerous vessels were also made
of seventeen different fluorides by moulding them in the state of clay
and baking them at suitable temperatures ; these also were found .
incapable of holding melted fluoride of silver.    Argentic fluoride was
only superficially decomposed by chlorine at 00° Fahr. during thirty-
eight days.     When heated to 230° Fahr. during fifteen days in a
 platinum vessel in chlorine, it was very little decomposed.      Chloride
of silver heated to fusion in a platinum vessel in chlorine corroded
the vessel and formed a platinum-salt, as wheu fluoride of silver was
 employed.
    An aqueous solution of argentic fluoride agitated with chlorine
 evolved heat and set free oxygen, in accordance with the following

or
          7   AgCl + AgClO3 + 8 HF + O.
Dry hydrochloric    acid gas completely decomposed argentic fluoride
in   amelted state, but only acted upon it superficially at 60° Fahr.
A saturated aqueous solution of argentic fluoride was not precipitated
by chloric acid.
   Perfectly anhydrous fluoride of silver was only superficially decom
posed by contact with bromine in a platinum vessel during thirty-six
days at 60° Fahr., or during two days at 200° Fahr.         At a low red
heat in vessels of platinum, argentic fluoride was completely decom
posed by a current of bromine vapour, a portion of its fluorine being
expelled and a portion corroding the platinum and forming an inso
luble compound of fluoride of platinum and bromide of silver.          In
carbon boats at the same temperature the whole of the silver-salt was
converted into bromide, the boat being corroded and the fluorine
escaping in chemical union with the carbon.       The action of bromine
on an aqueous solution of argentic fluoride was similar to the action
of chlorine. A solution of argentic fluoride yielded copious precipi
tates both with hydrobromic and bromic acids.
   Under the influence of a temperature of 200° to 600° Fahr. in
closed platinum vessels, iodine very slowly and incompletely decom
poses argentic fluoride without corroding the vessels, and produces a
feeble compound of argentic iodide, fluorine, and iodine, from which
the two latter substances are expelled at a red heat.     At a red heat
in platinum vessels, iodine produces argentic iodide, and in the pre
sence of free'argentic fluoride corrodes the vessels in consequence of
formation of platinic fluoride ; iodine and fluorine pass away together
during the reaction.      In vessels of carbon at the same temperature
argentic iodide is formed, the vessels are corroded, and a gaseous
compound of fluorine and carbon is produced.            By treating an
aqueous solution of argentic fluoride with iodine, similar results are
produced as with bromine and chlorine ; a similar solution yields
copious precipitates both with hydriodic and iodic acids.
   A mode of analysis of iodine is also fully described in the paper.
A known weight of iodine was dissolved in absolute alcohol, a strong
solution of argentic nitrate of known strength added to        it,
                                                              in portions
at   time, with stirring until the colour of iodine exactly disappeared.
     a
The mixture was evaporated, the free nitric acid expelled by careful
heat, and the residue weighed.        The residue was then heated to
fusion, to convert the iodate of silver into iodide, and again weighed.
Two experiments of this kind yielded accurate results; and the process
was easy and expeditious.
     " Polarization of MetallicSurfaces in Aqueous Solutions, new      a
Method of obtaining Electricity from Mechanical Force, and certain
relations between Electrostatic Induction and the Decomposition of
Water." By Cromwell Fleetwood Varley.
     Platinum plates immersed     in   sulphuric acid and water, as   in   a   de

               of Metallic Surfaces in Aqueous Solutions.             311
 composition-cell, require a potential of about 1'7 Daniell's cell to
 decompose the water ; with potentials of less amount the platinum
 plates can be charged and discharged like condensers.         They have
 enormous electrostatic capacity.     Mercurial surfaces equally admit
 of polarization with hydrogen. A surface of mercury in dilute sul
 phuric acid, when made negative to the water by means of a powerful
 battery, flattens out. If the mercury be replaced by an amalgam of
 proper consistency, the flattening out is increased ; the reversal of the
 current restores the amalgam to its original dimensions.       By rever
 sing the process, electric currents can be obtained from mechanical
 force.
    A large vessel on a board has within it two shallow funnels, which
 are connected by means of glass tubes with similar vessels outside of
 the large one.    Pure mercury is poured into the funnels until they
 and the outside vessels are one-third filled.      By tilting the board,
 mercury runs into the one funnel and out of the other, and thus
 the surface in the one is made to increase while that in the other
 decreases.    Dilute sulphuric acid is poured into the larger vessel so
 as to cover the two funnels ; the latter are connected           together
 through a galvanometer.
    If  the mercury is pure and free from polarization, the tilting of
 the board produces no electric current.       On polarizing one of the
 surfaces with hydrogen by a battery, it gives rise to a current through
 the galvanometer, and thus shares the polarization over the two sur
 faces. If the battery be removed, on augmenting the one surface and
 diminishing the other, a current of electricity is seen to pass through
 the galvanometer.
    A convenient method of showing this experiment on a large scale
is to procure a gutta-percha trough 4 inches deep and 4 by 2 inches
broad. A partition of the same material 2 inches high divides the
lower half into two separate chambers : these are partly filled with
mercury ; amalgamated platinum plates, hung from a balance-lever,
 dip into the mercury.      On depressing one set of plates the others
are elevated, and thus the mercurial surface exposed to the fluid is
alternately augmented and diminished to a large amount.            Twelve
of these arranged in series give a current of rather more potential
than one cell of Daniell's battery when the mercury is polarized with
hydrogen.      The addition of a minute fragment of zinc to the mer
cury maintains the polarization for a very long time, and the power
is considerably increased thereby. When a large surface of mercury
 (25 circular inches) has been polarized with a power of half a Da
niell's cell and is rapidly reduced to the diameter of -^ inch by
letting the mercury flow out of the funnel, some bubbles of hydrogen
gas appear just as the last of the mercury is running out, the decrease
of surface evidently augmenting the potential sufficiently to decom
pose the water : floating a small piece of platinum on the mercury
renders this phenomenon much more distinct.
    All attempts to polarize the mercury with oxygen have failed to
give a current.

current is generated by varying the dimensions of the exposed mercury
surface, a metallic surface neutral to the fluid is obtained.
    The second part of the paper refers to the electrostatic capacity of
platinum plates in dilute acid and water.
    In order to determine this point, it is necessary to use sensitive,
rapidly oscillating, reflecting galvanometers of very small resistance.
The author has succeeded in measuring the charge which a square
inch of platinum exposed to another square inch of platinum surface
receives from potentials varying from 0'02 of a Daniell's cell up to
 1-6 Daniell's cell.  From a potential of 0'02 to 0'08 the capacity
remains sensibly constant; that           is,
                                         the discharge from the plates
varies directly as the potential. When the potential increases beyond
 0'08, the charge which the plates receive increases in    greater ratio,
                                                                 a
the capacity being 3'3 (in one experiment) and 3'1 (in another
experiment) times as great with       potential of l-6 as

                                                                 it
potential of O'l.
   There     great difficulty attending accurate determination of the
             is
latter amounts    but the author expects that this increase of capacity
                   ;
will be found to vary as the square root of the potential.         The
capacity of the platinum plates with varying powers        shown in the
                                                                 is
accompanying Tables.
   The author thinks these experiments tend to show that the fluid
does not actually touch the platinum plate, but       separated from
                                                           is                   it

                                                                       l
part of an inch, when very small potentials are used.     This distance
decreases as the potential rises.    Inasmuch as two surfaces equally
electrified with the opposite electricities attract each other with             a
power varying inversely as the square of the distance, the experiment
would seem to indicate that at very small distances the platinum
repels the water with     power varying inversely as the cube of the
                              a
distance.
   The phenomena of electrification render accurate determinations
of the capacity extremely difficult.    The fact of the phenomena of
electrification being present leads the author to think that the se
parating film (if such    film exists)
                              a          not pure gas, but has five or

more times as much electrostatic capacity as pure gas.

       The     resistance    of each part of a circuit, such as that shown in
  fig.   1,  being known, the influence exercised by the shunt A B, as
  well     as the total resistance of the whole between x and y, can be

   Under certain circumstances a test might be taken without any
battery at all. In a submerged cable there is frequently sufficient
earth-current to supply the electromotive force in the branch L ; if
not, a small battery can be inserted to maintain a steady current, and
the internal resistance1 of the cells afterwards deducted.         The polari-

zation-current from a leakage of low resistance in a cable would
enable us to find the resistance from either side through the fault
without the application of a hattery.     And, lastly, this method may
be used to ascertain the internal resistance of a battery.
   The above method occurred to me about two years since, during
some experiments made to determine the resistance of the bridge-
circuit, and the exact proportion of current traversing each branch
of the Wheatstone balance, when the potentials at W and Z are
unequal.

    " Measurement      of the Internal Resistance of a Multiple Battery
 by adjusting the Galvanometer to Zero."              By Henry Mance.
    The following method of taking the         internal  resistance of a battery
.will be found to give excellent results when          several   cells are to be
 tested.
    Take one element from the rest of the cells, and arrange the circuit
 as in the annexed figure.         Connect the poles of the battery under
 observation by a shunt S, and adjust the resistance of the latter till
 zero is obtained on the galvanometer.
   Let E    be the number     of cells tested,
         e number of cells opposed,
         S  = resistance of shunt,
         11 — internal resistance    of £.
Then
    In practice    I usually returned the detached cell to the battery
.when S x E gave the internal resistance of the whole within a frac
 tion of a unit.
    It is assumed that the electromotive force in e equals that of the
 whole battery multiplied by TT        ; the chance    of error on accouut of
 thia not being exactly the case would be lessened by detaching a
 larger number of cells than one, when the internal resistance of the
 remaining portion would be given by the first formula.

    1. " On tho Carboniferous Flora of Boar Island (lat. 74° 30' N.).
 By Professor Oswald Hcer, F.M.G.S.
    Tho author described tho sequence of tho strata supposed to
 belong to the Carboniferous and Devonian scries in Bear Island, and
 indicated that the plant-bearing beds occurred immediately below
 those which, from their fossil contents, were to bo referred to the
 Mountain-limestone.          Ho enumerated eighteen species of plants,
 and stated that these indicated a close approximation of tho flora to

Mr. S.V.Wood         on the Denudation    of the Valley of the Weald. 319
those of Tallowbridge and Kiltorkan in Ireland, the greywacke of
the Vosges and the southern Black Forest, and the FerneuiUi-shtiles
of A iit and St. John's, New Brunswick.         These concordant floras he
considered to mark a peculiar set of beds, •which he proposed to
denominate the " Ursa-stage."          The author remarked that the flora
of Bear Island has nothing to do with any Devonian flora, and that
consequently it and the other floras, which he regards as contempo
raneous, must be referred to the Lower Carboniferous.            Hence he
argued     that  the line of  separation  between   the Carboniferous   and
Devonian formations must bo drawn below the yellow sandstones.
The presence of fishes of Old-Red-Sandstone type in the overlying
slates he regarded as furnishing no argument to invalidate this con
clusion.      The sandstones of Parry Island and Melville Island are
also regarded by the author as belonging to the "Ursa-stage,"
which, by these additions, presents us with a flora of seventy-seven
species of plants.       The author remarked upon the singularity of
 plants   of the  same  species having lived in regions so widely separated
 as to give them a range of 26g° of latitude, and indicated the rela
 tions of such a luxuriant and abundant vegetation in high northern
 latitudes to necessary changes in climate and in the distribution of
land and water.

 mode and date of the Denudation of that Valley."           By S. V. Wood,
 Jnn., Esq., F.G.S.
      The author commenced by discussing the various hypotheses that
 have been proposed to explain the denudation of the Weald Valley.
  In his opinion the upheaval of the district took place in Postglacial
  times, and subsequently to the deposition of the gravels of the
  Thames Valley, of East Essex, and of the Canterbury heights ; and
  the denudation was effected chiefly by tidal erosion during gra
  dual upheaval in an inlet of the sea, aided by the action of fresh
  water flowing into this inlet from the north by streams draining
  the land which now constitutes the counties of Middlesex and
  Essex.     The chief evidence in favour of his views is as follows : — •
   1. The absence from the glacial beds of Essex of any debris repre
  senting a considerable denudation of the Weald during the glacial
  period, and the probability that the Wealden area was beneath the
   sea during the deposition of the Boulder Clay.       2. The comparative
   absence of Lower Cretaceous or Hastings-sand materials from tho
   Postglacial gravel-sheets outside the north of the Weald.         3. Tho
  impossibility of reconciling the presence of Tertiary pebbles in cer
   tain Weald-gravels with an origin by means of streams flowing in
   the direction of the present rivers.     4. The antagonism between the
   character of the major valley of the Weald and that of any excava-:
   tion producible by the agency of rivers.       5. The persistence of the
   old coast contour with the river-drainage entering it from the north.
   6. The existence of a cause, in the shape of an isthmus at Dover,
   sufficient to induce a strong tidal scour.

    1. " On some points of South-African Geology." — Part I. By
G. "VV. Stow, Esq.
   In this paper, which was illustrated by numerous sketches, sec
tions, tables, and specimens, observations were made on the stratifi
cation of the Jurassic beds of Sunday's and Zwartkop's rivers, re
sulting from researches made by Mr. Stow, with the view of deter
mining the exact position of the several species of fossils found at
the exposures on the cliffs of these rivers, and from this the se
quence of the various beds.       He indicated the existence of at least
nine separate fossiliferous bands, pointing out the relative positions
of the several Tru/ow'a-beds, Hamitc-bcds, Ammonite-beds, &c.
   He next treated of the so-called Salifcrous beds of the district,
and gives his reasons for regarding them as later in age than the
JVir/owa-sandstones above alluded to, and therefore not equivalent
to that part of the series named " "Wood-beds

    Other researches of the author related to the Tertiary beds both
inland and on the coast.      He distinguished three zones on the coast
later in date than the high-level shell limestones (Pliocene ?) of the
Grass Eidge and other parts of the interior.          One of the coast-
zones he named the Akera-bed, from the prevalence of a delicate
species of that genus.     Another zone was described as following the
river-valleys in the form of raised terraces, characterized by the
presence of a large Panopcfd.       The latest shell-banks have been
thought to be Kitchen-middens ; but the author regarded them as
shore-deposits   in place.   The author concluded by tracing the pro
bable climatal and geographical changes in this region during geo
logical times, and indicated, as far as his material allows, the pro
bable migrations of the Mollusca, especially of the Venericardia
characterizing the Pliocene Limestone.

Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.8.
    The author described the remains of two reptiles said to have
been brought from Gozo by the late Captain Strickland.            One of
them was a fragment of the symphysial part of the slender mandible
of an Ichthyosaurus, having teeth of precisely the same character as
those of the form from the Kimmeridgc Clay described              by the
author under the name of Enthekiodon.         For this species the name
of IchtJiyosaurus gaudensis was proposed.        The other was the skull
of a species of Crocodile, for which the author proposed the name
 G. gaudensis.

' Lynton Grey Beds,' North Devon." By F. Eoyston Fairbank, M.D.
    In this paper the author called attention to the occurrence of a
thin bed of rock to the west of the harbour of Lynmouth, containing
an immense number of fragments of bone, some of them of largo

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous         Articles.              321
size, and associated with massive bodies which he regards as copro-
lites.    The author proposed to call this the " Lynton Bone-bed ; "
and he thought that its discovery might throw some light on tho
relative age of the whole series of rocks of North Devon.

   ON THE CURVE OF A           RIVERA BED.          BY SAMUEL SHARPE, ESQ.
       To the Editors      of the Philosophical Magazine       and    Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
            friend Mr. Alfred Tylor, F.G.S., having by careful mea
 MY         surement found that the beds of many rivers approach
 more or less to the parabola, I was led to inquire whether under
 any, and what, .assumed conditions that curve would be the line
 formed by water falling from a hard rock and flowing over a bed of
 alluvial soil.
     In this case V, the velocity of the water on the bed of the river,
 and R, the resistance of a grain of sand, vary at every different part
 of the curve.      But the conditions of the proposition require that the
 difficulty with which a grain of sand is moved should be everywhere
 the same when the river's bed has been cut into the form which it
 afterwards keeps ; that is,
                             — =a,     a fixed quantity.
                              K
     Let C  be the point from which
 the curve starts, being the harder
 soil, which the water does not
 wear away, and       AB    a  portion of
 the curve =V.
        Let y  be the ordinate,
             x be the abscissa.
 Then     AB    is  the diagonal of a
 parallelogram of which        djt and dy are the two sides.
     The  ease   with which      a grain is moved forward will be        as &  ;  and
                                                                            dx
 its resistance                 in which    4 is a fixed quantity.      Then
                   U=b-j?.,
                           becomes            =«, andV=«4—
                 »                     o dx                     dij

 Then let the velocity of water falling down a perpendicular at B be

  A NEW EXPERIMENT, AND SOME REMARKS ON THE THEORY OP
            LEIDENFROST'S'PHENOMENON.             BY E. BUDDE.
    " Leidenfrost'a drop is   suspended when the vapour below it can
 support the pressure of the atmosphere plus the weight of the drop.
 If the former be removed, a far smaller tension must be sufficient to
 produce the phenomenon."        This conclusion incited me to make the
 experiment of producing, by means of the air-pump, a Leidenfrost's
 drop with water upon a support at less than 100° C. With this view
 the following apparatus was constructed.         Upon a copper dish (a)
 a glass bell-jar (g) about 8
 centims. in diameter 'was ce
 mented.      Through a cork at
 the top of the bell-jar passed
 two glass tubes (/ and m) ;
                                                           m
the end of one of these (/),
bent at right angles, just pro
jected below the cork, while
the other end was connected
with the air-pump by means
of an india-rubber tube. One
end of the second tube (m)
reached inside the bell-jar to
near the dish (a); the other
end, outside the cork, was bent
somewhat in the shape of the
letter N and was sealed.       This
bent part, which may be called
N, was filled with water, of
which it held about one third of a gramme.
   The dish was placed in a water-bath, which kept it at a tempera
ture of 80° to 100°.       Suppose now the apparatus evacuated.          By
adequate   exhaustion    the water  in N will liberate   bubbles of air and
vapour, which will partially collect in the upper closed part, and cause
the water to flow down through the other end of the tube. This
will fall either quite boiling, or very nearly so, on the dish, which is

                Intelligence   and Miscellaneous Articles'.            323
heated considerably above its temporary boiling-point ; the conditions
are therefore favourable to the occurrence of a Leidenfrost's drop.
    The experiment was made, and succeeded with the greatest ease.
When the evacuation extended to a pressure of less thau 10 centims.,
and the water-bath was raised to 90° C. or more, spheroids were
obtained which moved briskly about. I was not concerned to as
certain what was the magnitude of the greatest spheroids which
could thus be obtained ; approximately the lowest temperature at
which the drops maintained themselves was 83° C., while the mano
meter oscillated about 2 or 3 centims.            Of course the tension
increases when the evaporation commences upon the hot dish, and
must again be diminished by pumping, which can scarcely be effected
without the mercury oscillating.        Sudden and violent formation of
vapour, which might have endangered the manometer, has not oc
curred in my experiments, of which, to be sure, there were only three,
and the quantities of water but small.
    In repeating the experiment, it will always be advisable to keep
the dish so far horizontal that the drop in its movement cannot touch
 the glass of the bell-jar.    The bell-jar ultimately becomes dim from
 deposition of moisture, but at the lower and therefore warmer part
remains long enough transparent to enable several drops to be suc
cessively observed.      I think this experiment is decisive for the expla
nation of Leidenfrost's phenomenon ; for it shows that the force-
which supports the drop obeys the laws of the pressure of vapours.
    I may be here permitted to bring before a wider scientific public
some observations on the shapes of Leidenfrost's drop which in March
 1869 1 communicated to the Niederrheinische Gesellschaft f iir Natur-
und Heilkunde. As regards the formation of the star-shapes I adhere
to Berger's explanation, with the addition, however, that the forma
tion of the star is a phenomenon of vibration, and one accompanied
by a remarkable formation of nodes.           The motion in question ia
alternate extensions and contractions, usually occasioned by the col
lection of vapour under the centre (which causes the drop to spread
out), brought into regular course and maintained by causes which
Berger has described.        The simplest vibration is that in which the
drop extends and contracts as a whole ; it then represents alternately
a more flattened and an elongated spheroid.           This modification is
most easily witnessed with very small quantities of liquid.
    If the drop has a larger area it behaves like any other vibrating
body, and divides into aliquot parts, forming nodes and loops. The
simplest division is that into quarters. It therein extends first in one
direction so that its section is almost an ellipse.      In the following
period the larger axis contracts, and the former smaller axis extends,
so that the section forms an ellipse at right angles to the first.       It
therefore oscillates between two crossed ellipses; and when the motion
is rapid enough it is observed as a cross. When the amplitude of the
oscillation is sufficient, the contraction in the middle extends so far
that the section is biscuit-shaped ; with greater amplitude the drop
breaks up each time into two parts, which sometimes again flow to
gether with surprising regularity, then extending in a direction at

right angles to the first, and again being broken up. If it forms 2 . 3,
2  4, and so forth nodes, it will be seen that on each elongation it
    .
forms a star with 3 or 4 rays and 3, 4, &c. indentations ;       then,                     if,
the time between two elongations            small enough, star of .
                                                    is                    a       .    2     3,
                                                                                             2    4,
&c. rays will be formed.
    The force which opposes the disruption of the drop is, beside
molecular attraction, the pressure of the vapour which escapes at the
side of the drop.         Vapour will keep the drop so much the more
together the more       it    compelled by the form of the dish to press
                             is
against its sides, therefore the more the dish                curved.is    The for
mation of nodes will be the more abundant the greater the resistance
offered to expansion, and therefore the greater the curvature.                      It
will thus be seen that the shape of the drop mainly depends upon
the shape of the dish and the following connexion
                             ;                                      observed. is
    1. Very flat, almost plane dishes furnish with about              cub. centim.
                                                                               1

crossed ellipses.      If the curvature very uniform, the shape remains
                                                    is
constant as the drop diminishes.            With large drops of water the
motion   is so slow that all the individual phases can be easily followed,
especially the first rise of oscillations from           bubble of steam seek
                                                             a
ing   to burst  through.      Alcohol   and  ether  move   more quickly.
    2. More highly curved dishes give shapes with more than four
nodes, the number of nodes increasing with the decrease of the radius
of curvature, until at about 1^''. owing to the diminution of the con
tents of the dish, there         again
                                  is      decrease.

vibrations with fewer nodes.          The above statements refer primarily
 to the largest forms, and in my experiments have been found to
hold for these with such certainty that, by choosing the dishes,                                  I
 could produce definite stars (to as many as 16-rayed ones) with
 a probability of more than -fa. Dishes not too smooth (copper for
 instance) are advantageous, since small roughnesses promote the                                  vi
 brations.    Very steady drops are obtained with small quantities of
 water (diameter of the spheroid OS to              centira.) in
                                                         1            very smooth

 silver dish heated as gently as possible.
    The formation of the smaller waves which almost always ruffle the
 surface of the drop,   I   should ascribe to the vapour, which in esca

 PART    I.  The Influence of Temperature and Humidity on Baro
                           metric Pressure.
             within the last few years meteorologists invariably
TILLcommenced         any inquiry into the movements of the air by
the statement, however differently worded, that all movement is
caused by the unequal distribution of heat at the surface of the
earth.     This unequal distribution of heat was supposed to act by
the unequal expansion and rarefaction of contiguous masses of
air, by the consequent difference of their density, and the dis
turbance of equilibrium.       From a hydrostatic point of view such
a statement seemed theoretically perfect ; and it was therefore
laid down with the most absolute confidence as a meteorological
axiom.      Later and more exact observations, extending over a
wider geographical field, have established its incorrectness, and
have shown veiy conclusively that the mere expansion of air by
heat, and its increase of density by comparative cold, do not
account for the anemological phenomena which really take place,
and in many instances seem to be in direct opposition to them.
No one can doubt that heat, acting on the air, does produce very
important results ; but it is now equally impossible to doubt
that, whatever its effects may be, they are so mixed up with the
effects produced by other agencies (such, for instance, as evapo
ration or condensation), that no class of phenomena can be attri-

326         Mr.     J.   K. Laughton   on Barometric          Differences
buted    solely to this property of expansion and contraction.
That, according to this theory, wind blows, necessarily and in
variably, from the place of less towards the place of greater heat,
is contrary both to our geographical knowledge and to our com
mon experience; and whilst loth to admit in plain language
that the effect due to heat, in this manner, has been overstated,
the leading meteorologists of the present day have virtually sub
stituted for the old axiom a modification of it which may be
shortly stated thus : —
    The movements of the air are cansed by differences of baro
metric pressure : air necessarily moves from the place of high
pressure to the place of low.
    And on this axiom, the system of all modern writers, more
especially of Mr. Buchan of Edinburgh, and Professor Mohn of
 Christiania, is explicitly founded.
    Before, however, we can unreservedly accept such an axiom,
we must have a clear idea of its exact meaning ; before we can
 admit that differences of barometric pressure are the causes of
 the atmospheric movements, we must have some insight into the
 cause of these barometric differences themselves; and it is this
 point which meteorologists, without exception, have slurred over :
 however lucid their writings may be in other respects, here their
 clearness fails them ; and frequently the only inference that can
 be drawn     is,
                that barometric differences are    first cause, beyond
                                                          a
 which  it   isnot necessary to inquire.      This, of course,      not     is
 what they mean but, admitting that

 difficulty, they have rather avoided than grappled with it. With
 the various explanations, or partial explanations, that have been
 offered, no one can feel satisfied    and yet, till some satisfactory

 explanation      arrived at, meteorological research tends to become
                  is
 merely  a   dry repetition of the observations of phenomena which
 we can dimly see are connected in some way with each other,
 without being able in the least to trace that connexion to its
 source.     Until the phenomena of barometric fluctuations and
 differences are understood, we are not at liberty to assume that
 they are the causes of atmospheric movements. We know that
a   barometric difference between two adjacent masses of air will,
  Under certain conditions, establish     movement between the two

 experimentally, we know that air will rush, even with great force,
  out of vessel in which
        a                        has been compressed
                                 it                        but we also
                                                                   ;
  know that under certain conditions        movement of air may raise
                                                a

                                   a
  by driving     current of air,

  which contains an aneroid.
     When, of two observed phenomena, either one can produce the
 other, very great caution       necessary before we decide which
                                  is                                             is

the cause, which is the effect ; and when, as in this instance, two
classes of phenomena (atmospheric movements and variations in
barometric pressure) are so closely connected, and stand so ma
nifestly towards each other in the nearest relationship, in the
absence of further information we have no means of deciding
whether the changes in barometric pressure cause the atmo
spheric movements, whether the atmospheric movements cause
the changes in the barometric pressure, or whether some third
and extraneous agency does not cause both the movements of
the atmosphere and the fluctuations in its pressure.           These con
clusions seem, at first sight, equally to merit our acceptance ;
and notwithstanding the prescriptive right to our belief claimed
for the first mentioned (by reason of old traditions and scientific
conservatism), an examination into the grounds of this belief is
at least necessary before we can yield an entire and rational
assent.
    It is therefore the causes of barometric fluctuations that pro     I
pose to inquire into; and since in meteorology, more almost than
in any other science, incorrect statements have been frequently put
forward, resting on some plausible theory, the fallacy of which
it is difficult to point out,      I
                                  propose submitting each step in our
inquiry    to the  test of experimental and geographical fact : if it
cannot stand this, it is good for nothing ; if it can, we may con
sider it a certain, however slight advance towards establishing
our conclusions on a satisfactory basis.
    At the very outset it is necessary to call attention to the fact
that the barometer does not measure weight : the name unfortu
nately implies that it does; but we all know             we can only bear
                                                                (if
it  in mind) that   it  does not.   What the barometer measures             is
elastic force  ;  with weight or density          concerned only so far
                                                     it   is
as they are functions of elastic force.        The distinction between
weight and elastic force cannot be too strongly insisted on and        ;
the want of observing         has led to great confusion.
                              it                              It has thus
been almost universally assumed that heat lowers the barometric
pressure, and that cold increases             find this repeatedly stated
                                                it

 Heat, while   it  tends to increase the volume, does certainly tend
to decrease the density       ;but while exercising this tendency,          it
actually increases the elastic force of the air.            Cold (under

 crease the density, but does meanwhile lower the elastic force.
 If, then, the increase or decrease of volume does not keep pace
 with the increase or decrease of temperature, the barometric
 pressure is   raised    by heat and lowered       cold.    This

328       Mr.   J.   K. Laughton       on Barometric         Differences
enough shown by putting an aneroid barometer, with thermo
meter attached, under a glass receiver : the barometer, which at
first will show the pressure of the air in the room, will rise if hot
water, fall if iced water is poured freely over the receiver; the
difference of pressure corresponding to a difference of tempera
ture can be exactly calculated by the well-known formula ; but
independent of any such careful experiments or calculations, it is
within the familiar knowledge of all of us that if a blown bladder
be held to the fire it will burst, if it is taken out into the cold it
will shrink and become limp and flabby ; the elastic force of the air
inside is increased or diminished by the change of temperature.
    From a meteorological point of view, the question then pre
sents itself, whether, in the free atmosphere, expansion takes place
in such a way as to cause the increase of volume to exceed the
proportionate increase of elasticity, so as, in fact, to lower the
elastic force.   The view apparently taken by meteorologists is
that it does ; it is only by such a view that the statement laid
down by Mohn, Buchan, and others can be supported* ; but
considering the subject as, in the first place, a branch of prac
tical geography and not of abstract theory, I find no satisfactory
basis for such an opinion ; or rather, I should say,        find many  I
instances which stand diametrically opposed to it.
    Foremost amongst these,        I
                                  may name the Hot Wind of New
 South Wales and of Victoria.       This wind, which bursts out at
intervals from the deserts and burning plains of Central Australia,
itself dry and burning almost beyond conception, can be attri
buted only to a great and sudden increase of elastic force.          It
would be foreign to my present subject to speak of the peculiar
properties of this wind ; its sudden outburst as a hot wind is all
that I have now to do with ; and this sudden outburst seems to
me incapable of any other explanation than as the effect of a re
markable barometric rise in the interior of the continent.         The
mass of air, heated to an extreme degree, and having such aqueous
 vapour as it contains similarly superheated, has its elastic force
enormously increased; it tends to expand with violence,and bursts
out towards the place of least resistance ; and it seems to bear
stronglyon the question      I
                             have proposed, that it finds that place of
least resistance always, or almost always towards the south — that             is,
towards the place of greatest relative cold. There     not, believe,
                                                                  is       I

  Wind breaks out over South-eastern Australia, it is invariably and
 immediately followed by a strong cold gale from the south.                    It
 is impossible to avoid comparing this with what takes place on
 opening an oven door : there                is,
                                        first,    strong outward rush of
                                                         a
 heated air, then an inward rush of cold air — an alternation
 which   isrepeated two or three times with continually diminishing
 force before equilibrium        established.
                                      is          The same alternation of
 air-currents was shown very exactly                by
                                              the late Professor Daniellf.
 He connected two receivers              glass tube in which was
                                           by   a                          stop          a
cock.     From one (B) he partially exhausted the air; into the
other (A) he compressed an additional quantity, — thus making
a   very marked difference in the elastic force of the two volumes.
 On opening the stopcock, the air rushed violently from                  to
                                                                                       B A

this rush was immediately followed                       by

the alternation in the glass tube being distinctly visible.                                  It   is
evident, therefore, that air putting itself in motion                 the ex       by
ercise of its elastic force, generates in itself such            momentum    a

ment.    I  see no reason to doubt that the Hot Wind of Australia
and the cold southerly gale immediately following                are natural it
 instances of the same thing on very large scale — that the Hot

                                 extraordinary accession of heat, drags
in its volume so much air that, as the impetus dies away,               leaves         it
behind   it   comparative vacuum, into which the cold air from the
               a
south rushes with great violence. We have absolutely no baro
metric observations from the interior of Australia                even       ;we             if
had, they would be of little value, from our ignorance of the level                               ;

the average, nearly an inch lower than in other parts of the
world. But over an area so vast as the Antarctic, and so cold
even in the summer months, the air must be contracted to an
extreme density ; and though the temperature is probably much
greater than that of Siberia or the eastern steppes of Asia during
the winter, it is still very far below that of any other portion of
the southern hemisphere ; so that if increase of density neces
 sarily led to a corresponding increase of elastic force, the observed
 barometric pressure in the Antarctic would be markedly higher
 than in any other part of the southern hemisphere, not lower.
     The more exact our observations become, the greater and more
 persistent is the difficulty which opposes the idea that cold in
 creases barometric pressure.       Mr. Buchan, in his isobaric charts,
 shows a large patch of high pressure during the winter in Eastern
  Siberia, and at the same season a patch of low pressure in the
 neighbourhood of Iceland. These differences he considers due
 to the extreme cold of Siberia and the relative warmth of Iceland*.
  But by what principle of selection, according to such a view, does
  the barometer choose Iceland as its centre of minimum pressure ?
  for the south-west corner of Ireland, at no very great distance,
  has a very much higher average winter temperature than the
  western side of Iceland ; and still further to the south-west,
  towards the Azores, the temperature is still higher; so that even
 if,  leaving other considerations momentarily on one side, we were
   disposed partially to admit that the extreme long-continued and
   unbroken cold of Siberia does permit an accumulation of air
   there, and produce this remarkable increase of barometric pres
   sure through the winter, we cannot admit that the relative
   warmth of Iceland (relative only to Siberia) can so reduce the
   barometric pressure in that neighbourhood as to render           feebleit
   relatively to that of much warmer districts neither remote nor
   separated   by  geographical barriers.
      Many other instances might be brought forward           but those
                                                                  ;             I
   have mentioned afford sufficient proof that heat, even long con
   tinued over wide area, does not necessarily establish relatively
                   a                                                  a

   higher in cold weather than in hot, and that its mean height in
   England   is  very much the same in winter as in summer.         There
  is,  as
        I     have shown, reason to believe that     rise of temperature

    Another error due to the confusion between the ideas of den
sity and elastic force is the opinion, widely put forward, that the
presence of aqueous vapour in air reduces the barometric pres
sure, and that this becomes lower accordingly as the quantity of
vapour becomes greater.        It is said that aqueous vapour is lighter
than air, and that, since a volume of air saturated with vapour
has less weight than an equal volume of relatively dry air sub
ject to the same pressure, the barometric pressure of the moist
air is therefore necessarily less than that of the dry— as if be
tween volumes of air balancing the same pressure there could be
any difference at all !     In fact the very important clause, subject
to the same pressure, is overlooked ; so that it is carelessly but
very commonly maintained that the mere presence of vapour in
the air accounts for a low barometer, or even that the introduc
tion of vapour into the air causes a fall.        How utterly opposed
this last idea is to fact can at once be shown by putting an ane
roid under a glass receiver containing comparatively dry air, and
introducing water : the vapour thrown off raises the barometric
reading by the amount due to the vapour at the existing tempe
rature, gradually increasing it till the air inside the receiver
becomes saturated.        If in a wider field we refer the question to
 geography,    and  inquire whether those regions of the earth where
 the air is permanently saturated with moisture are the regions
 where the barometer is also permanently low, we obtain answers
 of the most widely differing purport. Great stress is usually laid
 on the low barometer in the Doldrums of the Atlantic, or in India
 during the season of the south-west monsoon ; but, on the other
 hand, in the valley of the Amazon and some of its principal tri
 butaries, where, according to Mr. Bates,
                                                 " one lives as in a per
 manent vapour-bath," we find travellers repeatedly noticing that
  the barometric observations give a level scarcely above that of
  Para*.     Comparing these opposite instances with those already
  mentioned, of air almost entirely free from moisture showing a
 very high pressure, as in Siberia, or a very low pressure, as in
  the Antarctic, we can scarcely form any other conclusion than
  that neither the permanent presence of moisture in the air nor its
  permanent absence produces any effect on the barometric mean.
  This conclusion corresponds with that at which we have pre
  viously arrived with regard to long-continued high or low tem
  perature ; and though both rest entirely on geographical obser
  vation, it will be not uninteresting to examine into the cause of
  results so contrary to the general, or rather to the popular belief.
      In the reasoning which has been adopted, there is clearly a

fallacy which has escaped detection, until a rigorous application
of the test I have proposed (that of geographical comparison)
compels us to recognize its existence.    It appears to me to lie
in the unauthorized assumption that any increase or decrease of
temperature or humidity which affects the lower strata of the
atmosphere extends upwards to its very furthest limits.       This
assumption may probably, to a great extent, be attributed to the
incorrect way of speaking now so general, and which indirectly
teaches us to think that a mass of air being made specifically
lighter than it was, whether by expansion from heat or by ex
pansion consequent on the intermixture of aqueous vapour, has
a tendency to rise, and does rise. We know that this is not the
case : we know that a piece of cork at the bottom of a basin has
no tendency to rise, and does not rise ; but if water is in the
basin, the cork is raised by the pressure of the water underneath
it. But popular usage says that the cork rises ; and it would now
almost savour of pedantry to insist on the more correct expres
sion.   Still we may and must insist on a clear understanding of
the sense in which the word is used : custom may modify the
laws of grammar ; but the laws of gravitation are beyond its
power.
   It is thus, however, that a mass of air heated or rendered
more humid has been supposed to rise, as though by virtue of
some quality imparted to it which causes the earth to repel it ;
yielding to this, it rises and continues to rise to the very top of
the atmosphere, where its power of rising suddenly ceases ; the
repellant force is changed into one of attraction ; and the mass
of heated air, finding itself above the air immediately near                  it,
flows over       it,
                and increases the height and therefore the weight
of the adjoining atmospheric column.        Put into plain and un
mistakable language, this statement would shock the common
sense of any one with the smallest pretension to scientific know
ledge  :   it  none the less the statement which
                 is                                       repeated in

for we  know   that   massaof air, whether hot or cold, moist  or dry,
has absolutely no tendency to rise, but, on the contrary,      drawn     is
down      all the force of gravity. We know that

Glaisher have, at any rate, established this beyond the possibility
of further doubt*; but they have also established the fact that
above all, beyond the reach of these alternations,                is a region
where the air is intensely      cold  and    intensely dry.      I  have else-
wheret discussed at great length the peculiar unwillingness with
which two masses of air, or any fluid, mix when their thermome-
tric, hygrometric, or other conditions are different.            The distinct
outline very commonly        offered   by  a  stench  or  a  perfume affords
a clear and familiar illustration of my meaning: we do not, as a
rule, find the smell gradually grow on us ; it comes with such a
sharpness that its rate of progress could easily be timed.                It is
the same with masses of air lifted into the upper regions of the
atmosphere.        A mass of hot air or a mass of moist air retains as
much of its heat or moisture as is not by the forcible expansion
withdrawn from it ; and refuses, by virtue of this property, to
mix with the cold or dry air which lies above                      it,
                                                            or which     drags

up after it.
    It must therefore be borne in mind that when                 certain mass

334           Mr.       J.   K. Laugh ton     on Barometric          Differences
head is to some extent lifted ; the air all around, or principally
in one direction, is to some extent driven back ; and equilibrium
of elastic force being maintained, equilibrium of density is also
maintained by a slow and for the most part imperceptible change
between the hotter and colder masses ; for geographically,         and
more especially at sea, the large areas of hot and cold air are not
separated from each other by any sharp outline; the differences
of temperature, and therefore the differences of density, are very
gradual, and any motion that differences of density may cause
must be of an extremely gentle nature.
    This statement is very contrary to the common idea and the
generally received theory; but it is easy to show that any velo
city which can possibly be generated by such differences of den
sity is altogether inappreciable.       The most familiar illustration
of  this may be    taken  from  the trade-winds.   Premising that the
account given of these winds in every book on meteorology with
 which I am acquainted is more or less incorrect in its geographical
details,  I will, so far as the data on which my calculation is based,
follow   Mr.  Buchan, the clearest and latest exponent of the influ
ence of density.      He says that in the Atlantic the north trades
prevail between latitudes 9° and 30°*.         According to his charts,
the mean pressures on these parallels may be taken as 29'95
and 30' 15, and the mean temperatures as about 80° and 72° F.
 He gives no hygrometrical estimate ; but wet-bulb temperatures
 of 79° and 6S° will probably not be very far wrong.         These ele
 ments give us, from Mr. Glaisher's Tables, the weights of a cubic
 foot of air on each parallel as 509'5 and 522'7 grains respectively,
 showing a difference between the two of 13'2 grains.          Bearing
 in mind that a cubic foot of air on the parallel of 30° presses on
 the cubic foot of air immediately south of         and not on   it,
                                                                  cubic               a

the much greater difference of temperature, but of the immediate
contact of the two bodies of air.     In a coal-mine, for instance,
between the air that, passing through or over an enormous fire, is
driven up the upcast shaft and the air that drives it up, there is
a difference in temperature of perhaps not less than 200° F.
 The difference in the weight of a cubic foot of air corresponding
 to such a difference of temperature is about 1 84 grains ; and the
 weight of a cubic foot of the hotter air would be something less
 than 400 grains.     Thus we have the acceleration produced as
 about 15 feet per second.    Such a calculation has, of course, no
 pretensions to accuracy ; my object here              is,
                                                 not to arrive at the
 velocity with which air issues from the mouth of       coal-pit, but
                                                                    a
 to show that, between the pressure which causes the current of
 air in
      a   coal-pit and the pressure which has been supposed to
 cause the trade-winds, there    practically no comparison, and that
                                    is
the latter force  is    utterly inadequate to produce any appreciable
effect.
 I     have been obliged to dwell on this point in order to establish
the fact that there can be no perceptible barometric difference
due to the lifting effect of the interchange resulting from differ
ences of density.        A low barometer caused            by
                                                           high temperature

the withdrawal of        a pressure from above,          the overflowing of

 the strata of equal pressure.           Amethod of calculation similar to
 that already adopted enables us to form some idea of the nume
 rical value of this overflow.           cubic foot of moist air at 72° F.

 sion of from   1    foot at 72° to 1-0027 at       80°.   If, therefore, we
 suppose this expansion to extend through                  height of 10,000

 feet (a    very exaggerated estimate), the superior strata on the
  parallel of 9° are raised 27 feet higher than the strata of equal
 pressure on the parallel of 30°.            The incline down which the
 overflow pours     is  therefore one of 27 feet in 21 x 60 X 6000, or
 1   foot in 280,000.        The motion generated            by

it   as clearly established that there        no necessary relation between

  the mean reading of the barometer and the mean readings of the

 336       Mr.   J. K. Laugh ton  on Barometric  Differences
 thermometer or hygrometer : the calculations       I have just made
 show with equal certainty that the forces called into action by
 the differences of expansion or of density due to mean thermo-
 metric or hygrometric conditions are quite inadequate to produce
 any sensible motion ; we are therefore fully warranted in the
 conclusion that permanent high temperature, permanent humi
dity, or the conditions most opposite to these, are not the causes
of local differences of barometric pressure.
      PART   II.  The Geographical Distribution   of Barometric
                              Pressure.
   It is not, however, to be doubted that mean barometric pres
sures have a very marked geographical distribution ; and though
concerning these our information is very incomplete, and, even
where it might seem complete, is frequently incorrect, we are
still able to determine some of the principal features of this
distribution with tolerable accuracy.     The best-known instances
of it are perhaps the low barometer in the Doldrums of the
Atlantic, in India during the summer months, in the Antarctic
and in parts of the Arctic ; and, on the other hand, the high
barometer in the upper valley of the Amazon and its tributa
ries, in a patch of the North Atlantic between the Azores and
Bermuda, in a corresponding patch of the South Atlantic to the
north and north-west of Tristan d'Acunha, and in Eastern
Siberia during the winter. There are other districts, perhaps
equally important ; but these I have named may be considered,
to a certain extent, representative areas, offering, at any rate,
very many of the most noticeable barometric phenomena.
   A consideration of the climatic characteristics of the Dol
drums or of India seems to point to the heavy rains of these lo
calities as affording some explanation of their low barometer.
 Remembering the extent and absolute, as well as relative,
amount of the precipitation which, during the wet season, takes
place in India along the southern foot of the Himalayas, along
the whole of the west coast, and further east in the province of
Khasia, and thence southwards to the sea, it is difficult to over
estimate the sudden disturbance to which the atmosphere is
subjected, whether merely by the removal of the vapour and the
consequent reduction of elastic force, or by the expansion follow
ing the enormous development of heat by condensation.            The
observations of this great  rainfall  are neither sufficiently nume
rous nor consecutive to admit of our assigning to it any exact
measure ; but we are certainly far within the mark when we say
that it does not average less than one inch in the day during the
summer mouths.        Now 1 cubic inch of water weighs 253 grs. ;
so that an inch of rain falling on an area of 1 square inch im

4200 pounds of air, one degree in temperature.                 The pound of

to raise the temperature of 150 pounds of air 1° F.                  Now the
whole column, to its highest limit, weighs 15 pounds; so that
the liberated heat,        applied to the whole column,
                              if                                     sufficient  is
to raise its temperature 10° F.           But there        no reason to sup

                    is              We know familiarly that rain cools
the air near the surface, which comes within the reach of our
daily experience       and we know that frequently, when rain

falling on low-lying land, we find snow falling on land                   little          a
higher  ; so  that  we   are  justified   in  saying  that   the heat  of  con
densation does not strike downwards                 towards the surface of
the earth.     It would therefore appear probable that the greater
part of this heat             absorbed
                                  is            the air in the, immediate

neighbourhood       in   which     the   condensation      takes place; and
supposing that         acts principally on that part of the column
                         it
which lies between 5000 and 10,000 feet from the ground,                                        it
acts on  a  weight of air which may be considered as one-sixth
of the whole, or as 2'5 pounds, and                   sufficient to raise its
                                                              is
temperature    60°   F.    It  would be useless      to  carry    calculationa
such as this any further.         The results obtained from data ne
cessarily extremely inexact, are of little numerical value; but
they serve to show dimly the extraordinary amount of the force
suddenly let loose high overhead.             Heat so applied to       column         a
of air 5000 feet high cannot be compared in its effects with that
which causes arise of temperature, even through the same num
ber of degrees, near the surface of the earth, where                        acts          it
only   on the   very   lowest    strata, and        diffused isupwards                         by   a
process comparatively slow — so slow, in fact, that the mean

33&        Mr.  J. K. Laughton on Barometric Differences
temperature of the air diminishes as we ascend at the nearly uni
form rate of 1° in 300 feet, whilst the noontide temperature di
minishes much more rapidly.         I have already shown that differ
ences of temperature, such as we ordinarily find near the surface
of the earth, shading into each other through almost infinitesi
mal gradations through very great distances, are insufficient to
                                         I
produce any appreciable effect ; but am none the less ready to
admit that the sudden expansion, equivalent to a rise in tempe
rature of 60° F., of a column of air 5000 feet high and covering
a base of hundreds of thousands of square miles, partaking, as
it must do, almost of the nature of explosion, is capable of pro
ducing an effect the vastness of which may be conceived without
entering into any detailed and not very exact calculations.
    Whether, therefore, we consider merely the withdrawal of the
 elastic force, or the disturbance caused by this expansion, or, as
in fact we must do, both combined, it would seem conclusively
 established that tropical rain is a cause sufficient to produce a
 low atmospheric pressure in any given locality during the wet
 season : but we are met by the very startling contradiction
 offered by observations in the valley of the Amazon, where the
 volume of water that rolls down the river swelled to 50 feet
 above its level, whilst the whole country for many miles on each
 side of the principal tributaries is inundated, tells of the extra
 ordinary precipitation, to which a total want of meteorological
 registers prevents our assigning any numerical estimate.          Mr.
 Buchan, indeed, runs his mean isobar of 29'9 up the whole length
 of the valley, across the Andes, and down to the Pacific on the
 western side ; but admitting this as the mean height of the
 barometer at Para, we cannot allow that it is also that of the in
 terior, unless we reject the observations of Chandless and several
 other careful travellers.    Wallace, in attempting to form an es
 timate of the height of various stations on the Rio Negro, says
 that " the mean of five observations at, Barra, some with river-,
  some with rain-water, gave 2120-5 as the temperature of boiling
  water," which is equivalent to a barometric height of 30-2 inches.
  Chandless, again, says that on the Purus,
                                                 " at Canotama, three
  feet above the high-water line, the barometer (mean of sixteen
  days at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M.) stood higher than in Manaos at
  about 10 feet above the high-level of the River Negro at the
  homologous hours."
     Mr. Chandless's observations were taken in July, Mr. Wal
  lace's in August, and compel us, in the absence of others with
  superior claims to exactness, to believe that the barometer does
  stand very high at that season of the year.       But that season is
  not  the  rainy season ;  the rains on   the Purus   end in the early
  part of June, when the whole country is under water, forming

telnau's maps of this country are in this respect quite in accord
with Chandless's description ; they both show that the land                                 is,
for the time, virtually turned into an inland sea. Mr. Wallace's

ration.    The temperature         uniformly high, and the quantity

                                              very great.    Its elastic
force, indeed, tends to disperse         but aqueous vapour does not

 must rest on probability) that the barometer         high only during is
 this season of evaporation, that           even low during the rainy

that the wind at that season blows strong up the river* — blows
towards the place of high pressure, not from it. One direct and
unmistakable contradiction is sufficient to overthrow any axiom;
and an instance such as this deals a most severe blow on the
particular axiom which has been proposed for the guidance of
meteorologists.     If wind does not always blow from the place of
high pressure,   but  in some instances blows straight on end to                      it,

which cannot possibly produce such very opposite effects, and
examining into the points of difference between these places
which resemble each other in their extreme cold, we find that to

moving from the west. Much of the elastic force due to this
compression is lost by some outward movement, whether up
wards, or eastwards through the mountain-passes, or in occa
sional bursts to the westward, when for a time it drives back the
advancing current; but the prevailing motion continues, or
speedily resumes its course ; and the barometer is kept at this
very remarkable height throughout the season of strong westerly
winds. Mr. Buchan has endeavoured to account for our east
erly winds of spring by a reference to this high pressure*; but
he has overlooked the difference of seasons.        The easterly winds
of this country are the marked feature of April and May ; the
high barometer of Siberia is almost peculiar to January.              In
January we do certainly sometimes get strong easterly              winds
bringing hard frost; but they are exceptional, and westerly
gales (such as the 'London' foundered in in 1866) or soft west
erly winds (such as put almost half England under water in 1869)
are the more recognized type of January weather.               In April
and May the barometer in Siberia has fallen to the compara
tively low mean of 29'96 inches ; but it is then that the air,
warmed and expanded by the advancing sun, and no longer
forced back by the full strength of the winter west wind, breaks
out over the whole of Europe, reaching even to us in the most
distant corner of it.   I    will not at present stop to argue that the
strong   west  wind  is  really the cause of this high pressure in Ja
nuary;    but  whether    it is or is not, it is equally certain that at
that season the winds, not the local, diurnal, and irregular va
riations, but the prevailing winds of Northern Europe and Asia
blow towards the place of high pressuref, not from it.
    During the summer months the case is almost entirely re
versed.    The west winds of Europe are, as compared with those
in winter, both irregular and of very moderate force ; but the
barometer in Siberia has at that season a remarkably low mean.
The feeble pressure, far from causing a rush of air towards              it,
permits the previously existing rush to die away;       it is  as unable
to increase the force of the summer breezes as the high pressure
is to control the fury of the winter gales.        Relative high tempe
rature     again said to be the cause of this area of low pressure

continuous range of mountains on the south, there seems abso
lutely no reason, so far as temperature is concerned, why the area
of low pressure should not be in Germany or Russia instead of
in Siberia*.       But in other respects there is a wide difference
between the summer climate of Central Europe and Eastern
Asia. The rainfall, which throughout Russia is trifling, and on
the plains of Siberia is scanty, is very great on the mountain-
slopes to the south and east.
                                    " In the neighbourhood of Rid-
dersk in the Altai Mountains, the dew falls so heavily that the
dress of the horseman is completely saturated when riding
through the high grass, while in the sombre forests of the north
western Altai, called locally Taigi, the atmosphere is still more
humid, and rain during some summers falls incessantly "f. Such
rain acts here in the same way as the still heavier rain acts south
of the Himalayas. Wherever aqueous vapour is largely with
drawn from the air, the elastic force must be reduced, even
though the reduction may not always be so great as to affect the
barometer; and in this instance, since we know that in July the
aqueous vapour at Barnaul has a mean tension of '43 of an inch,
that the air in Thibet is excessively dry, and that on the Thian
 Shan Mountains dew and rain arc almost unknown even during
summers which on the Altai are unusually wet J, we must ad mil
that the northerly and north-westerly wind which brings the
vapour into Siberia is entirely deprived of it as it passes out.
    But whilst the low barometer of Hindostan, of the Doldrums,
 or of Siberia may thus be explained by the free and excessive
 condensation of aqueous vapour, it is impossible in any similar
 manner to explain the low barometer of the Antarctic, a district
.which offers a decisive contradiction to every law which meteo
 rologists have proposed : it is an area of extreme cold, yet the
 barometer is not high ; it is an area of low pressure, but the pre
 vailing winds do uot blow towards it. What the actual height
 of the barometer or thermometer may be within the icy region
 we have no means of knowing ; but it may fairly be supposed
 that they are both very low ; and it is quite certain that the
 pressure diminishes steadily from the parallel of 50° southwards,
 until barriers of ice hitherto impassable put an end to our ob
 servations.
    The enormous quantity of snow which overlies the ice and
land attests the occasional presence and condensation of aqueous
 vapour in the air ; but the temperature in the higher latitudes
 diminishes very gradually, and the tension of the vapour in such
 air as is swept from warmer seas into the icy regions must bu so

feeble that the withdrawal of even the whole of it could not pro
duce any marked effect.       But northerly winds are themselves
rare, winds from the south, from the east, or from the west
alternating irregularly south of the parallel of 65° ; and it must
be remembered that the immense snow fields are the accumula
tions of years, perhaps of centuries, and that the actual increase
each year is probably small.
   It has often been suggested that the centrifugal tendency due
to the rotation of the earth may possibly be the cause of this
singular depression of the barometer ; but the suggestion has
met with but little favour, because, if the centrifugal tendency
occasioned a low barometer in the neighbourhood of the south
pole, it might fairly be expected to occasion it also near the
north pole, and it has been very positively said that in this last-
named region the barometer is not low.         This statement is in
correct.   In most places within the Arctic circle where we have
observations, the barometer does stand very low ; and although
the depression does not seem to be either so great or so regular
as in the Antarctic, it is none the less a very well-established fact.
I have therefore no hesitation in agreeing in great measure with
those who would refer it to a centrifugal tendency, believing
that the irregularities which occur in both regions, but more
especially in the Arctic, are in most instances capable of satisfac
tory explanation.
    The attempt to calculate accurately the amount of depression
at the poles which this centrifugal tendency should occasion
seems at present quite hopeless ; the results which have been
obtained have, for want of satisfactory data, been so utterly erro
neous that they have no value whatever.         But leaving abstract
science on one side, and being guided by observation only, it
would appear that the depression which can be attributed to the
centrifugal tendency does not exceed, and is perhaps rather less
than one inch ; for though there is reason to believe, that the
extreme depression is considerably more, we cannot overlook the
fact that there are other forces in operation which must modify
and in some instances increase the effect due to the rotation of
the earth.    Of these forces, one of the most important is that
called into action by the winds which prevail in the southern
 hemisphere north of the antarctic circle.      From the parallel of
 60° northwards to the parallel of 40° these winds blow almost
 constantly from the west ; they are not, as has been frequently
 said, north-west winds ; neither are they south-west ; but though
 found occasionally, or in some special locality generally, inclined
 the one way or the other, their prevailing direction right round
the world is due west.      These winds have a strength far beyond
 that of any other prevailing winds on the face of the earth ; in,

  fact between the parallels of 45° and 55° it blows a gale of greater
  or less severity almost tbe whole year through.              South of the
  parallel of 60° these winds appear to lose both their force and
  their regularity ; and inside the antarctic circle the winds are
  very variable, and by no means excessive in strength.
     It is thus quite impossible to admit that these winds are in
  any way caused by the low barometer to the southward of them.
  They do not blow towards it either directly or in a vorticose
  manner, but preserve their due westerly direction as long as they
 preserve their distinctive force, and even after they have in a
 great measure lost it.       There is not a particle of evidence in
 support    of any  idea of a vorticose movement ; and however the
 winds may be caused, and, so far as the present question is con
 cerned, whether they are rightly named counter-trades or not,
 we may consider it clearly established that they are not caused
 by the low barometer of the Antarctic.          And, indeed, if that low
 barometer is itself due to such a centrifugal tendency, it is im
 possible that it should cause any inward movement of the air.
 The spheroidal form which the atmospheric strata have been
 compelled to assume is the form of equilibrium ; and that once
 taken, the centrifugal tendency is powerless to cause motion,
 save only when it ejects, and sometimes with violence, any excess
of air which by some meteorological change has been driven
southwards.
     The condition of the atmosphere in high southern latitudes is
therefore that of a large body of air in a state of comparative
rest, past which a large and strong current is ceaselessly rush
 ing. According to the nature of fluids under such a condition,
 the mass in motion tears away particles from the mass at rest,
and establishes a constant tendency to rarefaction.             This is the
property of fluids first set forth by Daniel Bernoulli in his Hy-
drudynamica, where he shows by a series of experiments that, if
one end of a pipe be fitted as a branch into another somewhat
larger and opening freely, water running through the larger pipe
will draw water up from a vessel into which the lower end of the
smaller pipe has been inserted*.             The friction of the water
rushing through the main pipe against the end of the column of
air in the smaller tears away the air bit by bit ; and as water
from the vessel below is forced up into the vacuum so formed,
it too is torn off and carried away.         If instead of leading into a
closed vessel of water the branch lead into a closed vessel contain
ing air, this air may in exactly the same manner be drawn out till
its elastic force is exhausted; and in this way, by keeping a con
tinuous stream of mercury running through the main pipe, the

nearest approach to a perfect vacuum may be obtained, as is in
fact done by Sprengel's air-pump.
   But though this principle of fluids has long beeu known and
admitted, it seems to have been regarded rather as a scientific
curiosity than as affecting the everyday relations of life. One
familiar instance will show that such a view is very erroneous.
Certain gratings in the streets cover shafts which lead directly
to the main drains, and it might be supposed that through these
foul smells would be very apt to escape into the open air; but
the flow of the water and the air which it drags with it through
the drain prevents this ; it continually rasps off the bottom of
the atmospheric column and causes a descending current of
air through the shaft, so that no vapours from below can come
up. The force of this descending current can easily be seen
by holding a lighted torch near the grating of such a shaft
 and watching how the flame is sucked in — quite as strongly
sometimes as it would be near the bottom of a doorway opening
into a heated room; and indeed the power of friction, acting
in a similar way, was tried a few years ago in the ventilation of
coal-mines.     A number of jets of steam were driven forcibly into
the upcast shaft, and these, dragging the air with them, gave
rise to a corresponding descending current in the downcast shaft,
In practice, however, the method was found expensive, and has
been gradually given up even by those who were at first very
much in favour of it*.
   From a meteorological point of view, the importance of this
principle was, I believe, first brought forward by Sir Henry
James t, who established the fact that in the heavy squalls of a
gale of wind a barometer on the lee side of a wall had a lower
reading, and one on the weather side a higher reading, than a
third barometer placed without obstruction in open ground.
More recently Professor Wild, of Bern, has shown that a south
erly gale blowing over the Alps and passing as an upper current
over the valleys of the north-eastern part of Switzerland,    more
especially of the cantons Uri, Glarus, and Schwytz, draws the
air of the confined valleys away with              it,

    Although very much larger, and having boundaries of a very
different nature, the Antarctic is as confined as the valleys of
Switzerland ; and the friction which is continually going on at
its exterior limits between the strong westerly winds and the still
air inside must produce, or tend to produce, the same effect. It
is impossible to form any reliable estimate of the effect which is
really produced, because we know neither the absolute depres
sion of the barometer, nor how much of it is due to the centri
fugal tendency established by the rotation of the earth ; but
since the Swiss observations in the localities    I  have referred to
give 5 to 6 millimetres as the barometric depression which pre
cedes and accompanies the setting in of the Fohn, we may con
sider that two-tenths of an inch is the most that can be attributed
to a similar cause in the Antarctic.
    Into the comparative vacuum thus formed we might expect a
certain portion of the air from outside to flow ; and some does
seem to do so, and to form a series of curling eddies on the inner
or southern margin of the west winds ; but the influence which
these exercise on the west winds themselves is exceedingly small
and altogether imperceptible.       As, then, the west winds blow
incessantly, and incessantly abstract air from the Antarctic, and
yet the pressure of air in the Antarctic remains nearly constant,
it is clear that air must be continually, or at least frequently
poured in to take the place of that which is carried away.        We
have no evidence as to where or how this supply is given ; that
offered by the northerly winds does not appear sufficient; and if
on such a point, in the utter absence of any positive knowledge,
conjecture may be permitted, I would say that it seems not im
possible that, in consequence of the continual removal of air from
the Antarctic, the atmospheric strata outside, at some unknown
 distance from the surface of the earth, are left so much above the
 strata of equal density inside that the eastward force is overcome
 by the pressure southwards, and that they flow over.        A supply
 so given at the top of the column would clearly be regulated by
 the quantity of air previously withdrawn from the bottom ; and
 when the great current of westerly wind has been blowing stronger
 and tearing away more air than usual, more air than usual will
 be poured in above; so that, after the strength of the westerly
 gale has abated, there will be an excess of air within the confined
 circle, which being compelled by the centrifugal tendency to move
 outwards, may show itself in some locality as a southerly gale.
    The arctic regions differ from the antarctic in many ways, and
 essentially in this ; that whilst the Antarctic is open, bounded
 only by the westerly winds sweeping over an unbroken sea, the
 Arctic is shut in by the continental shores which extend round
 almost its entire circumference.     The westerly winds, again, of

the northern hemisphere are neither so strong nor so regular as
those of the southern, so that probably but little air is drawn
out by their friction ; but, on the other hand, the formation of
the land, the trend of the coast and of the mountain-ranges,
forces a very great deal of air from the south into the arctic
circle.   This is notably the case on the west coast of Norway,
along   which the atmospheric current flows into the polar regions
in exactly the same way as the great current of the ocean (the
Gulf-stream) does.      Consequent on the centrifugal tendency,
this would naturally be ejected ; and a great part of it is ejected
in a succession of gales, rather than in a constant wind, which
find a vent on the east coast of Greenland or through Kennedy
Channel ; but the openings for escape are small ; and it would
appear that the resistance offered by the sluggish air resting
over the continents of Asia and America resists even a consider
able pressure induced by the centrifugal tendency.        The elastic
force of the air in the Arctic is thus kept permanently greater
than itwould Lie if the area was open; and the barometer, although
low, has not so great a depression as would seem due to the cen
trifugal tendency in such a high latitude.
    There is,  however, in the neighbourhood of Iceland        small    a
area in which, especially in winter, the barometer stands
markedly lower than    it  does on its southern, eastern, or western
side.   After what have said as to the effect on the barometer
                  I
of the westerly winds circling round the antarctic regions,                  it
would be unnecessary to dwell on the depression in this very
small area further than to point out that the westerly winds of
the North Atlantic, the south-westerly and southerly winds of
the coast of Norway, veering, before we lose sight of them, to
south-east and reappearing on the coast of Greenland as north
easterly gales, form   a circuit round Iceland which would suffi
 ciently account for the existence of even lower pressure in that
                                                 a
neighbourhood.       But Professor Mohn, Mr. Bucban, and several
others consider that this circuit of winds      due to the low pres
                                                 is
 sure in the centre, round which they blow in     vorticose manner,

 rative vacuum.   If  this  isthe case, what causes the low pres

    ?   I   have already referred at length to Mr. Buchan's opi
 nion that the low pressure       due to the relative heat.
                                 is                             haveI
shown that Iceland cannot be considered an area of relatively
 high temperature, that areas of relatively high temperature do
 not necessarily become areas of relatively low pressure, and tLat
the low pressure in the neighbourhood of Iceland cannot be due
 to any such cause.     On the other hand, the westerly winds of
 temperate latitudes are incontrovertible facts.    There    here no
                                                                   is
question of their origin   ;   for, extending,   as they do,   right round

348         Mr.  J. K.  Laugbton    on Barometric Differences
the world, they certainly cannot be referred to the small patch
of low pressure near Iceland. Whatever their cause, it is inde-
peadent of this.       But by the ordinary laws which regulate the
motion of fluids, a current of air, such as that of the west winds
which rage in the Atlantic through the winter, must, on striking
against a barrier across its path, be thrown back on itself in a
circling eddy ; and it seems to me a necessary consequence of
the coast-line and mountains of Scotland and Norway that a
large eddy should be formed just where we find the circuit round
Iceland. It is therefore to the westerly winds of the Atlantic
that I refer this circuit ; and it is to the circuit that     I  refer the
low barometer near its centre.
     But if winds circling round any area tend to constitute it an
 area of low pressure (and      I  have shown that by the laws of the
 friction of fluids they must do so), a very remarkable anomaly
 is observed in each of the large oceanic basins, where, in the
 centre of the circuit formed by the gradual veering of the trade-
 winds on one side and of the west winds on the other, there is
 an area of distinctly high pressure.        In the North Atlantic this
 area has from the earliest times borne the name of the Horse
 Latitudes ; but it differs in no material point from the similar
  areas in the other oceans.          The point of difference between
  these and the other areas in which a low pressure results from
 the circling of the wind suggests itself at once.         The areas of
  high pressure     are areas  of  warm,   almost  tropical ocean ; and
  without referring      to any hygrometric observations, we know
  that in these areas calms are frequent, and that during the calms
  the air at a high temperature must be tending towards satura
  tion. Since, then, a great part of the air supplied to these re
  gions from the polar or colder side enters with a mean tempera
  ture of 50° or 55° F., and containing vapour of an elastic force
  of '3 of an inch at the most, and remains warming itself, ex
  panding itself, and drawing moisture from the ocean at a mean
  temperature of 65° F. till the elastic force of its vapour is not
  less than -6 of an inch, we may fairly attribute the high pressure
  in these areas in a great measure to the increase in the elastic
  force of the vapour.
      These several instances of barometric variation are in a great
   measure typical or representative;         and considering them as
   such, I  would sum up the analysis of them which            I  have at
   tempted   in a  statement  of  the conclusions  at which  I  arrive.
      By reason of the centrifugal tendency caused by the rotation
   of the earth, the height of the atmospheric column varies with
   the latitude ; and with it the height of the barometer, if not
   controlled by other agencies, also varies, changing gradually
   fr-un about 29 inches near the poles to about 30' 1 inches near

the equator.      High and low pressure are therefore terms to be
applied relatively rather than absolutely ; and the Arctic, with a
mean pressure of 29'6, is in reality an area of high pressure ;
the Doldrums, with a mean pressure of 29 '9, an area of low.

  temperature,    on  the   contrary, tends   to  make  the  barometer fall
  and the air move inwards.
      The permanent presence of aqueous vapour in the air has no
   sensible effect on the barometer      but in confined districts where

    Where the prevailing winds blow strongly into corner barred         a
  by mountains, as in Siberia, or bifurcate against     line of coast,  a
 as against the coast of the Spanish peninsula or California, the
 barometer stands high in consequence of the mechanical com
 pression of the air and where the prevailing winds circle round
                                 ;

 barometer stands low          consequence of the abstraction of the

air    by
        friction.
    According to these conclusions, the mean barometric pressure
 at any place, or for any season, depends principally on geogra
 phical conditions, on latitude, on the relation between land and
 sea, on the trend of the coast-line, on the direction and height
 of mountain-ranges, and on the nature and characteristics of the
 prevailing winds.      Since, however, these geographical condi
 tions remain constant, or vary only with the season, they do not
 appear to account for the deviations from the mean pressure
 which the barometer                    is
                              every day showing.     But the conclu
 sions which      have referred to these conditions are founded, not

sion or the rarefaction of gases, and hold true wherever they
may be properly applied ; so that, descending from great to

agencies which we can show regularly produce certain results on
the largest scales are capable also of producing similar effects,
even when the scale is limited or their mode of action constrained

riMHE      dioptrical apparatus of the human eye consists mainly
 A      of two transparent media : — •(!) the aqueous and vitreous
humours with nearly the same index of refraction, which differs •
inappreciably      from that of water; (2) the crystalline lens,
the mean index of refraction of which is variously stated to be
from 1'383 to 1'455.          We may leave out of consideration the
cornea and the capsule of the crystalline lens, as, though the in
dices of refraction of these membranes differ from those of the
other dioptrical parts of the eye, their respective surfaces being
parallel prevents them having any material influence on the
passage of rays of light to the retina.
   The radius of curvature of the cornea, which bounds the ante
rior surface of the aqueous humour, is (according to Donders,

of the crystalline lens (which forms the posterior concave surface
of the aqueous humour)          is,according to the same authority, 10

as 1-383 to 1-336; and its focus in this situation will therefore
be 24 millions, (nearly 1 inch) .        As, however, it receives the
rays   of  light already   deflected   by the more convex anterior
aqueous meniscus,      its actual   focus  in the eye is 18 millims.
( = •7 inch), or precisely the distance of the posterior surface of
the crystalline lens from the retina in the axis of vision.
    Listing (Dioptrik des Auges in Wagner's Handworterbuch der
Physiologie, quoted by Donders loc. cit.) makes the mean index
of refraction of the crystalline 1 '455 ; and this index Donders ac
cepts as the true one ; but a simple measurement according to Sir
D. Brewster's rule will show this to be too high an estimate ;
and Donders himself (p. 62) admits that it may be too high.
    In the foregoing calculations     I have assumed the surfaces of
the cornea and crystalline lens to be spherical ; but their actual
shapes, as determined by Chossat by careful measurements of
the eyes of oxen (Annales de Chimie et de Physique, vol. x.), are
not quite spherical.      That of the cornea is an ellipsoid of revo
lution round the major axis, whilst those of the crystalline lens
are ellipsoids of revolution round the minor axis of the ellipse.
The effect of these shapes will be to make the central portion
of the cornea more convex, and the central parts of the surfaces
of the crystalline less convex than if they were segments of
spheres.      But for all practical purposes they may be regarded
as spherical.
    When the eye is immersed in fresh water, which has the
same index of refraction as the aqueous humour, the latter ceases
to refract the rays of light transmitted to it through the water, and
the crystalline becomes the only refracting medium in the dioptric
system of the eye.      But, as has been stated, the crystalline sus
pended in a watery medium has a focus of 24 millims. (nearly
 1 inch), consequently 6 millims. (='24
                                              inch) beyond the retina,
and distinct vision is destroyed.
    Obviously the restoration of distinct vision below water can
only be effected by supplying the loss of the anterior aqueous
 meniscus of the eye by means of a lens of equal power.            We
have found the aqueous humour to be a lens whose principal
focus is 46 millims. ( = 1*8 inch) ; so all we have to do is to
place before our immersed eye a lens having a similar focus in
water.     A glass lens which has such a focus in air has a focus
of upwards of 7 inches in water, because the sine of the angle
of incidence of rays of light on a glass lens in water is to the
sine of the angle of refraction as 1-500 to 1'336, in place of being
as in air 1-500 to 1.      So if we use glass we must take a lens
whose focus is only -45 inch in air, which will have a focus of
1*8 inch in water, and thus supply the place of the lost lens of
the aqueous humour.         Practically we find this is so j and with

352           Dr. R. E. Dudgeou     on Subaqueous  Vision.
a  pair of spectacles fitted with lenses of that power     we can see
near and distant objects when we are below the water (provided
it is perfectly clear) as distinctly as we can with the naked eye in
the air.
    But such spectacles are attended with the obvious defect that,
though they give perfect vision below the water, they completely
destroy vision except for objects within half an inch distance
above water ; and the swimmer would find it extremely
awkward to have to adjust his spectacles to his eyes every time
he dived, and remove them whenever he came to the surface.
Therefore, for practical purposes, it would be desirable to pos
sess spectacles which, while giving perfect vision below water,
would offer no impediment to vision in the air.
    A consideration of the media (air and water) engaged in the
case of the anterior lens of the eye lost by immersion led me to
the solution of this problem.
    By causing the rays of light to pass through the water com
pelled to assume a convex shape and transmitted through air
before reaching the eye, a lens of almost any required power
may be constructed.      Our object would be attained by a reversed
air-meniscus (concavo-convex lens) formed by segments of thin
 glass globes with radii of curvature corresponding to those of the
aqueous humour.        But such a lens would be troublesome to
construct and too small for use ; and the same object can be
attained by employing air-lenses of larger dimensions.        I found
that two segments of a glass globe of somewhat less than 2 inches
 diameter, arranged with their concavities outwards and united
 round their edges by a ring so as to form a double concave air-
lens, when immersed in water, forced the water into the convexity
required for refracting the light to a focus of 1'8 inch. The con
vergence of the rays thus produced is equal to that caused by
the aqueous-humour lens in air, and suffices to effect the short
 ening of the focus of the crystalline required to briug the image
to the retina, thus supplying the place of the extinguished lens
of the aqueous humour and restoring perfect vision below water.
    A pair of spectacles fitted with lenses of this description does
 not materially interfere with vision in the air, and gives perfect
 vision when we plunge below the water.           I have constructed
air-lenses of similar power by arranging together segments of glass
globes of different diameters, as 1^ inch with 2^ inches diameter,
 If  inch with 2 inches, and so on.      I likewise found that good
vision below water is obtained by lenses of various powers ranging
 between 1£ inch and 2 inches focal length, though probably the
best vision for both near and distant objects below water is ob
tained by lenses of the power indicated above.           With these,
 small type may be read easily and distant objects distinctly per

     On the Determination   of the Height  of the Atmosphere.    353
ceived.   The faculty of accommodation possessed by the eye ac
counts for this power of seeing distinctly through lenses differ
ing slightly in focal length.
   The principle of a concave air-lens in an aqueous medium
can be applied to the construction of object-glasses of micro
scopes for examining objects in water.        For this purpose it is
best to imitate the construction of the object-glasses of ordinary
microscopes, and make the lower surface of the air-lens plane
while the upper is concave.      There is hardly a limit to the mag-
nifying-power of such glasses ; but I do not suppose that a lens
of greater power than    | of an inch focus will be required ; and
probably   one of £ an  inch focus, or even lower power, will suf
fice for what I believe they will chiefly be used for, namely the
observation of the operations and organs of minute aquatic or
ganisms.

                    the Height of  the Atmosphere.                  355
    To consider the effect of temperature and moisture upon this
result, suppose that the force of gravity is constant; then, since
a=0'003665 when t is expressed in the Centigrade scale, we
may safely neglect any terms whose coefficients are the second
or higher powers of a ; and therefore from (1) and (2) we get,
by eliminating p,
                    f
therefore
                                           Cz
                    a\ogtp = C—z + K\ tdz,
where C is some constant introduced by integration.
    Now there is no fixed relation between t and z, so that we
                                       Cz
cannot integrate any further ; but     1    tdz=-ztm, if tm be the mean

temperature    of the column of air whose height is z, and hence
we get
and thus the temperature may be supposed to combine with the
moisture in making a variable ; for Professor Airy (On Sound
 and Atmospheric Vibrations) has shown that if the tension of the
 vapour be equal to mp, then the height of the homogeneous
atmosphere will be a( ,   —— ?    I.
                        M+jJ/n/
     Thus our result will be corrected for temperature and moisture
 if in equation (7) for a we write
                                            8
     Now since  tm can never be accurately determined for any time
 and place, it follows that h cannot be accurately determined, and
 a more rigorous investigation would be practically useless ; we
 proceed to obtain a probable value of tm for these latitudes, or
 for the whole earth.
     Sir J. Herschel has shown (Meteorology) that an equation,
 exists between the temperature and pressure at any point in the
 atmosphere out of reach of local disturbing causes, in which TO,
 T,,and T2 are constants for only a short space of time, and which
 must therefore be determined by balloon -ascents when required.
 Their mean values for these latitudes, the temperature being
 measured in the Centigrade scale, and the pressure in inches of

 356             Mr. M. Hall     on the Determination    of
 mercury,   are approximately
                            TO=    -66-111,
                            T,= + 5-037,
                            Ta=-       0-074,
the temperature being 18° C. at the surface of the earth*, and
 —66° C. at the confines of the atmosphere.
    Now if we put t = <f>(p), the mean value of t for a column of
air extending from the surface up to a point where the pressure
is /', is
                               •o
                        1
and therefore tm=      —  1    <f>(p)dp; and taking  p0 to be 30 inches,
    Again, if the mean tension of the vapour be taken as 0'3 inch
for the whole atmosphere, m will be O'Ol ; and the effect of
temperature and moisture is to diminish the height of the homo
geneous atmosphere by 0'22 mile.           Substituting this corrected
value of a in equation (7), we get, finally,
                             h = 32-1 miles.
    With regard to the free surface of the atmosphere, it is not
necessary to suppose that the elasticity of the air there is de
stroyed by intense cold; it is sufficient to say that at the surface
the elastic force is counterbalanced by the force of gravity.
    We shall now compare this result with that obtained by ob
servations on the twilight arc, which give the depression of the
sun below the horizon when the last gleam of daylight disappears.
   But this depression varies with the latitude and with the time
of the year, and can never be accurately determined in conse
quence of the dispersion or scattering of the light due to the
presence of vapour, or rather of particles of water suspended in
the air, during its passage through the lower strata of the atmo
sphere.
    The angle of depression is said to be from 16° to 17° in the
tropics, and from 17° to 21° in higher latitudes (Chambers,
'Astronomy'); and since the presence of vapour dissolved in
the atmosphere will tend to increase the refractive index of the
air, and since vapour in the form of particles of water will scatter
   * The mean temperature of the earth's surface is not the mean of the
equatorial and polar temperatures. Brewster's formula, t F.=81°'5 cos lat.,
gives as the mean temperature 64° F., or 18° C.

the light, both these causes of irregularity will tend to increase
the angle of depression, and it is obvious that we must employ
the lowest value observed if we base our calculations upon the
properties of dry air. We shall therefore suppose that the angle
of depression is a little greater than 16°, with a probable error of
about ±3(y.
   Let a ray of light from the sun, S F, be refracted so as to
touch the circular section of the earth at D, and, refracted again
to the same extent, cut the exterior circular section of the atmo
sphere at L. By reflection at L and by refraction this ray again
touches the earth at A, causing the last gleam of twilight at A.
   Let A H and B      DG    be tangents    both to the ray and to the
earth at the points   A   and D respectively;     produce SF to K,

which are unchanged, be called, after the conditions of such
evanescence are satisfied, critical functions.          When all the cor
responding       critical  functions  of  two  quotics are  equal, each to
each, then,     if  the quotics are of the same degree, one quotic                 isa
transformation of the other. If they are not of the same degree,
then  a     transformation will render them uniform.
    2. When there         isonly one variable, critical functions have, in
the differential calculus, analogues discussed in my paper " On
 Criticoids" in the last March (1870) Number of this Journal*.
 These Criticoids are obtained       in  consequence of the analogy be
 tween the linear transformation of quotic in one variable and
                                                 a
 the factorial transformation of quotoid in one dependent and
                                         a
 one independent variable.            Quotics with more than one vari
able correspond to linear partial quotoids with one dependent
 variable and as many independent variables as there are variables
 in the quotics, and whereof the orders are the same as the de
 grees of the quotics.          In pursuing the analogy between the
linear transformation of quotics and the factorial transformation
 of quotoids,   I    shall confine this paper to quotics of the second
 degree in two variables, and to the corresponding quotoid of the
 second order with one dependent and two independent variables.

 Then, as we see by (8), the form of £ will, in general, be = /9 + B,
 wherein /8 is a definite function of // and x, and B is an arbitrary
 function of A.         Moreover DA=0, and therefore in general
 DB=0       and (D+ «)Bz=B(D+«)z.               Consequently the trans
 formed and divided quotoid becomes successively

                   that it is only the definite portion /3 of that acts
 effectively   in the  transformation. It may be noticed in passing,
 that since, if (D + ti)r=0, then also (D + u)B*=Bp + «)*=0,
 therefore the solution of the partial linear and homogeneous
 differential equation of the first order may be written in the form
 /3B + /9aB, whenever it admits of the form /S + $8Ba. When the
 condition (9) is fulfilled, then, equating the quotoid to a function
 of x and //, we have a soluble differential equation.        When (9)
 does not hold, arbitrary functions enter into the criticoid, and
 give a wide range of transformations of the quotoid last discussed.

 stant, and the quotoid wherein the coefficients are variable

then (11) is satisfied, and the critical functions and the criticoids
have the same forms and values.           In other cases they, in general,
are of different forms and values.            When the group (3) holds
both for quotic and quotoid, and the coefficients of the latter are
constant, the critical and criticoidal functions are substantially
identical. When such coefficients are variable, and a, b, and e

the criticoid is definite.       When (9) is not satisfied, the criticoid
contains an arbitrary function, which should be so assigned as
to give the simplest or most useful transformations.             The name
fractional criticoids sufficiently marks the criticoids discussed in

XLIX.      On a Theory of the Mutual Action between Electrified and
    Magnetized Bodies.          By Professor CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S.,
    F.R.A.S.*
 I   HAVE      given a theory of Electric Force in the Number of
       the Philosophical Magazine for October 1860, a theory of
Galvanic Force in that for December 1860, and a theory of Mag
netic Force in the Numbers for January and February 1861.
The same theories are reproduced, with corrections and amplifi
                            ' On the
cations, in my work                     Principles of Mathematics and
Physics.'     It  is known    from   experiment    that these three kinds
of physical   force   are distinctly separated     from  each other in re
spect to the conditions under which they are generated.                 For
the generation of electric force it is necessary to employ friction ;
galvanic force has its origin in the chemical action between two
dissimilar substances in contact, or in a tendency to such action ;
and magnetic force is due either to the natural condition of sub
stances like the loadstone, or to artificial magnetization.             The
experimental      evidence   of  the  reality  of these  forces is derived,
as in the case of the force of gravity, from the motions, and ac
celerations of motion, which they are observed to impress on
visible or tangible substances.
    Now, according to the above-mentioned theories, the three
                     *  Communicated    by the Author.

              between       Electrified and Magnetized Bodies.                  369
kinds of force, although originating in such different circum
stances, are all modes of action of steady currents of the atherial
medium.       This general result gives the means of accounting at
once, on hydrodynamical principles, for the mutual action, ob
served by Oersted, between the rheophore of a galvanic circuit and
                                                       " Theory of Galvanic
a magnetized needle.          (See art. 18 of the
Force" in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1860, and
'Principles of Physics/ pp. 611 & 612.)                  But the same result
points   to  a  mutual   action    between   an electrified   body and a mag
netized body.       I have, fact,
                               in       indicated    in  art.  18 of the com
munication in the Philosophical Magazine for October 1860, that
the setherial currents which account for electric force and those
 which account for magnetic force are generated under like cir
cumstances ; that           is,
                             in both cases        gradation of the interior
                                                          a
density of the substance gives rise, in consequence of the earth's
motion through the sether, to secondary aetherial streams. There
is is,
    however, the difference that whereas the gradation of density
    maintained in the electrified body                    by
                                                   interior molecular action
due to the abnormal state into which its superficial atoms are
 put either       by
                   friction or         by
                                      induction, in the magnetized body
the gradation of density results from interior molecular action
which    is independent of the state of the superficial atoms.
    From the above statements                will appear that
                                                it                 had reason

 from theory to expect that,                by
                                          the intervention of the electric
 and magnetic currents, there would be, between an electrified
 body and     a magnetized body,        mutual action which might be ex
                                            a
 perimentally recognized.           Now, although        do not undertake to
                                                               I
 assert that no experimental evidence of such action existed,                    I
 may say that     I did not succeed in finding any, and that             failed
                                                                            1

11.    TF on    a flat drop of a liquid 1 of large diameter 2r, which
       J-  is on a horizontal glass plane in a liquid 2, a small drop
of another liquid, 3, is placed, and this small drop of liquid 3
spreads itself out on the common surface of liquids 1 and 2*,
then it coats this with a thin layer or film of extremely small
thickness.      It may then be assumed that the form of the
common surface of liquids 1 and 3 is the same as that of the
common surface of liquids 2 and 3.
    The equations of § 3 will still hold good under this supposi
tion, if «jg -f «38 be introduced instead of the constant «,s.           We
have

In   the following Tables, analogously to the earlier notation (§ 8),

    In this calculation the thickness of the layer of the liquid 3 is
assumed to be less than the length (which can still be deter
mined at K or k), consequently somewhat less than O'Ol millim.
But, on the other hand, this thickness is also presupposed
>• 21, greater    than twice the distance at which the molecular
forces of capillarity are still effective.
    12. In the first place, air may be taken as liquid 1, an air-
bubble being blown in a liquid 2 under a horizontal glass
plane in the manner described in § 5.              A small drop of sub
stance 3 is introduced, by means of a tube bent at right angles,
on the surface of the air-bubble in liquid 2, where ic spreads
itself out.

     The calculated values of a3 4. ax show an agreement with the
observed values of a. and a which may be called a perfect con
firmation of the theoretical considerations.                 The small deviation
in a for oil of turpentine shows that the angle to was not 180°.
     In the experiments on air-bubbles in olive-oil the alcohol very
soon drove away the oil from the horizontal glass plane, the air-
bubbles changed their form very considerably, the vertical meri
dional element k disappeared, the air-bubbles spread themselves
to the edge of the horizontal glass plane (compare § 5) and va
nished into the air.
   'It may here be observed that very thin layers of liquid 3,
which showed Newton's rings on the air-bubbles, were quite
sufficient to produce the change of form of the air-bubbles.
When the traces of liquid 3 were even still less, so that they
could hardly have been recognized in any other way, a very re

 took place.     The thickness of the layer of liquid 3 is in the last
 case less than 21, or double the distance at which the molecular
 forces of capillarity are still effective *.

therefore with oil of turpentine arid olive-oil.

glass plate sprinkled       with  lycopodium-powder, they have the
same form (inverted) as an air-bubble of equal volume in these
liquids, and «2 could be determined from K— in the same way  k
as for air-bubbles.        The same holds good for large drops of
water which dew forms in the folds of certain leaves — cabbages
for instance.

    The observed values of a. agree with the values calculated from
aa and ais according to Table X. § 10, and thus confirm the
theory.
    It is to be observed, however, that all observations do not give
this result, and that in water which is placed on mercury, a. is
often less, in oil of turpentine on mercury a. is often found
to be greater, than the theory would lead us to expect.
    The reason of this deviation is chiefly to be sought in the ad
sorption of moisture, which is condensed from the atmosphere
on the surface of the mercury as soon as the latter is formed.
Since, for the liquids examined by me which could be present in
the form of vapour in the atmosphere,
whilst the adsorption was going on                I  observed a change in the
form of the drop, K and K—k became smaller.
                                                                 I
    This condensation of vapour also takes place, as have already*
attempted to prove, on the surface of metallic solids and solid
bodies generally, and in other physical phenomena (as, for ex
ample, in experiments on radiation) is an important source of error
under circumstances in which Magnus                 f has designated it by the
name of Vaporh&sion.
    A layer of condensed air on the surface of the mercury may
have a similar influence to that of a thin layer of liquid.
    The decrease of the capillary constant is to be attributed to
this condensation on the surface, which               I have myself observed
to take place on flat drops of mercury in vacua, since even this

874           M. G. Quincke     on the  Capillary Phenomena
vacuum, as     I  expressly observed at the time, contains vapours
of grease*.
    The condensation of vapour on the surface of mercury appears
to go on with tolerable rapidity; and in spaces containing vapour
of oil of turpentine, K and K— k are found to be unusually small.
In like manner the vapour of petroleum and even the grease
from the hair and body have considerable influence on the form of
the drops of mercury.
    Thus it may easily happen that liquid 3 may be placed on a
drop of mercury which is already coated with an extremely thin
layer of a liquid 4; then a will be
 Now, accordingly as this value is greater or less than aj
may be found by observation greater or less than the theory of
 § 11 requires.      As the value a13 + ag for mercury and water as
 substances 1 and 3 of Table X. § 10 is very great, but for mer
 cury and oil of turpentine is very small, for water placed as sub
 stance 3 on _the apparently pure surface of mercury a, must be
 found too small, and for oil of turpentine as substance 3 too
 large.    Besides, «14 and a^ depend on the greater or less thick
 nesses of the films of substance 4, which is often less than twice
 the radius of the sphere of action, and is completely beyond ex
 amination, so that the difference between the observed and the
 calculated values must turn out sometimes greater and sometimes
 less (compare § 27).
     Experiment confirms all these conclusions, often in an unde
 sirable manner, as the form of a drop of mercury in air is often
 changed by a trace of liquid which was by no means supposed
 to be in the atmosphere.
     On placing petroleum upon flat drops of mercury        I likewise
  found in four experiments « always greater than the theory (ac
 cording to the determinations of Table X. for <r13 + a3) had led
 me to expect.
     The influence of the vapour adsorbed or condensed on the free
  surface of the drops naturally manifests itself more plainly in air
  than in the air-bubbles described in the experiments of § 12,
  which are protected from impurities by the surrounding liquids.
     14. Instead of placing a liquid 3 on the free surface of a liquid
  1 or 2 bounded by air, it may be placed on the common surface
  of two liquids 1 and 2, which was presupposed as the most ge
  neral case in the theoretical considerations of § 11.

  which were obtained according to the method described in § 7,

   The foregoing collection of experiments do not show at first
sight satisfactory agreement of theory and experiment.
                    a
    This want of agreement depends on the difficulty of properly
taking into account the masses present at the point of section                                                          P

son       at the common surface of liquids         and     only particles           2            3,
of those liquids  were  considered     the influence    of the particles

is greater  the greater the  mass   of  these  particles  of  liquid and
the greater the density of the liquid             In like manner with          1.

   This difficulty     so much the greater, since the density of the

   With olive-oil and oil of turpentine the mixture goes on more
slowly, so that in this case the form of the drop of olive-oil                            is
at first much more strongly changed, and      behaves as     itwere             if

influence of the same on the magnitude of the capillary constants
or tension of the surface, no mathematical expression for the
form of the drops of liquid in the experiments now described
can be constructed.
     Iwill, however, expressly observe that the liquids are not per
fectly moveable, as was presupposed in the theoretical considera
tions, consequently the motion of the particles of liquid against
one another is prevented by a certain friction.     Hence it is pos
sible that liquid 3 spread itself out on a very thin adsorbed layer
of liquid 2 on the surface of liquid 1, and thereby occasioned the
difference between theory and experience (compare §§18 and 27).

      16. The experiments on water and oil of turpentine were
 made thus   :   into glass cylinder 40 millims. in diameter and 250
                          a
 millims. in height some water was poured as liquid               and upon
                                                                   1,
 this oil of turpentine was very carefully allowed to trickle down
 the side of the glass cylinder as liquid 2.        As an elevation of the
 capillary   meniscus   was   to  be  expected, the height chosen for the
 column of oil of turpentine was considerably greater than that of
 the layer of water.
     By means of the blowpipe-lamp, glass threads of suitable thick-,
 ness were made from thicker glass tubing purified as much as
 possible.     In  a  capillary tube so prepared, open at both ends,          I
 allowed a    column of water to rise and then closed the upper end
 by  melting it,  so that the tube was nearly filled with water.        The
 glass   thread  was  passed through      two caoutchouc    rings and  thus
 fastened to a    strip of pure plate glass 300 millims. long and 10
 millims. broad, which had scale of millimetres engraved upon it.
                                       a
 Towards the upper end of the glass thread and beneath the upper
 end of the column of water              mark was made with
                                             a                    file

 strip of plate glass and capillary tube were immersed in the glass
 cylinder, so that the file-mark was in the oil of turpentine and
the lower end of the glass thread stood in the water. When the
point of the glass thread was broken off at the file-mark under
oil of turpentine, the water in the capillary tube sank, the oil
of turpentine pressed upon                 it,
                                        and the meniscus concave above
sank to  a   height A12 above the horizontal limiting layer of water
and oil of turpentine, which was read off on the vertical milli
metre-scale      by   horizontal telescope. The glass tube was cut
                      a

inner diameter 2r of the section measured with microscope and
ocular micrometer in the manner described in             4.§

the upper end was broken off under oil of turpentine, the water

last column contains the angle <a,a as it results from the num
bers in the last column but one together with the known value of
the constant (Table X. § 10),

obtained from observation of the drops.     For experiments Nos. 1
and 2 the angle <»,9=0, and the agreement of the numbers ob
tained according to the two methods is satisfactory.        In No. 3
the angle was different and approached 47°            which       had   2',                  I

   The difference of the angle            is
                                  explained                    by

   17. Similar experiments were made with bisulphide           carbon                        of
as liquid 1, and water as liquid 2.    In this case, however,     de                              a
pression of the capillary meniscus occurs; the convex side                                             is
turned up towards the water.      Hence the thickness of the layer
of bisulphide of carbon in the wide glass cylinder       correspond           is
ingly greater as that of the layer of water above      increases.          it

   The mean value of tlie numbers of the fifth column agrees very
nearly with the constant at 12=4'256 milligrammes, derived from
observation of the drops (compare Table X. § 10).                       Thus the
angle <a,2 in the experiments on capillary tubes was nearly 180°,
whilst according to the earlier method, from observation of drops
on a glass plane, it was found to be 167°.
   These experiments, as well as those of the foregoing para
graph, may be looked upon as a confirmation of the theoretical
considerations.
    18. If  we observe the elevation in vertical capillary tubes,
whose upper end opens into olive-oil, and lower end into water,
then a depression or an elevation of the capillary meniscus below
or above the common plane limiting surface of the two liquids
will take place, according to whether the capillary tube before the
submersion was filled with olive-oil or water, and consequently
according to whether the sides of the tube were moistened with
olive-oil or water.       This circumstance appears to me worthy of
notice, as it shows with what difficulty an adsorbed layer of
liquid is expelled from a solid body. Water which only now
comes into contact with the solid sides behaves quite differently
from water which is already in contact with them; it is the
same with regard to olive-oil.

   The last column of the above Table contains the values of the
angle o>12, calculated on the assumption that a14=2'096 milli
grammes, as was found from observation of the drops.
   With drops of olive-oil, which were placed under a glass plane
moistened with water, I found the angle o)12 = 17° (§ 10), a value
which, considering the uncertainty of the method used, does not
strikingly differ from 35° 57',found in the present analogous case.
  IV. Elevations in capillary        tubes   of several liquids    superposed.
   19. A fourth method of observing capillary phenomena at the
common limit of two liquids consists in placing on a liquid u in
a capillary tube a second liquid o, and observing the common
elevation of the two liquids.
   This method, as has been already mentioned (§ 2), was used
by Th. Young, Gay-Lussac, and Bede.

                 of the common Surface       of two Liquids.              381
     If the length of the upper column of liquid in the capillary
  tube be h, and if ha denote the elevation of the common meniscus
  above the horizontal plane level or the surface of the lower liquid
 u outside the capillary tube, ra the radius of the capillary tube at
  the place of the meniscus of the open surface (bounded by air)
  of the upper liquid, rotl the radius for the meniscus of the com
  mon surface of the two liquids within the capillary tube, and the
 notation already adopted be retained, the weight of liquid raised
  above the horizontal level of liquid u is borne by the two menis-
  cuses, and, according to equation (1), § 1, we have: —
                           1

 For the special   case  in which     r0=r<Mi  this equation becomes

    It follows from this    that the capillary constant of the common
 surface is determined       when SrAcr, as well as a.a (the capillary
 constant of the surface    of the upper liquid o) and the two angles
 to0 and coou are known.       The first is in many cases =0°, or at least
may be assumed to be         known, since the magnitude «„ cos <»„ is
 determined from the        elevation of liquid o in capillary tubes
 (compare § 4) ; but coou is not known, and can only be supposed
 =0° or 180° in a few cases, as we shall afterwards see.
    Hence this method is not to be generally recommended for the
determination of the capillary constant of the common surface
of liquids.     However, it has the advantage of being easily carried
out, requires only small quantities of liquid, and admits of liquid 1
being above and liquid 2 below, or conversely, and <r, may be
greater or less than <ra.
    By means of this method it is immediately seen that the ca
pillary constant ctu of the lower liquid (upon which alone, accord
ing to the theory of Poisson*, the weight of liquid borne by the
capillarity depends) has no influence whatever, and that a,M
cos coou and «„ cos u>0 alone determine it.
    It may also be observed that ha may be very small, provided it
is > 2/ (than twice the radius of the sphere of action) .           Equation
 (17) then holds good completely, as the free surface of liquid o

 same as with     the elevation of a liquid in a capillary tube, if the
 capillary constant a of the one liquid were replaced by

 A   very thin layer of liquid 2 upon a meniscus may considerably
 modify and diminish the elevation of liquid 1 when
     If oil be placed on water, then, according       to Table X. § 10,
      «2=8'253 milligrammes,           «J2 + «2=5'856 milligrammes;
 thus a great depression of the liquid in the capillary tube must
 take place when the oil is poured on, as Thomas Young* was the
 first to observe.
    20. I made the experiments in a manner similar to that de
 scribed in §§ 4 and 16.         Out of the purest thick glass tubing
 glass threads of a suitable thickness were drawn by help of a
 blowpipe-lamp. In the capillary tube thus prepared, open at
 both ends, I allowed a column of liquid o to rise somewhat
 higher than h was intended to be. The capillary tube with the
 upper end closed was passed through two caoutchouc rings and
 thus fastened to a strip of pure plate-glass from 100 to 200
 millims. in length and 10 millinis. in breadth, which had a scale
 of millimetres etched upon it. The glass thread forming the ca
pillary tube was scratched by a knife at its lower end and broken
off so that the bottom opening coincided with the zero-point
 of the scale, and thus the height ha could be determined in the
 non-immersed part of the tube.            This precaution was necessary
 in those cases in which the meniscus of the common surface of
liquids o and u could not be observed by optical means.
    When the lower end of the glass thread, together with the scale,
was immersed in the liquid u, without the caoutchouc rings
coming into contact with the liquid, and the upper closed end of
the capillary tube broken off, then the liquid o rose in the tube,
the liquid u followed, and h0 and hu could be read off with a ho
rizontal telescope on the vertical scale.
    After that the fine glass tube was cut through in the place of
the upper meniscus, and the inner diameter 2r0 of the sectional
surface determined (in the way described in § 4) with a micro
scope and an ocular micrometer.             I did not determine the dia-

error, such as the different widths of the capillary tubes, and
particularly the variableness of the angle a> in these experiments,
have a much greater influence, and my chief object was to prove
the dependence of the common mean elevation on the capillary
constant a.a of the surface of the upper liquid.
   For the same reason, in the observed magnitudes h0 and hu,
which always refer to the summit of the meniscus, the correc
tion   •=,  or a corresponding value, has been omitted.                       In the
       o
calculation of the constants aoucoscoou according to equation
 (16), the magnitudes of the capillary constant aa were used in
stead of a0 cos os0, as      I   had found them from the elevations in
capillary tubes (Table II. § 4).
    In the following Table the observations on bisulphide of car
 bon and water are collected.                In the first series of experiments
 the specifically lighter water was above ; the meniscus of the com
 mon surface turned its convex side upwards.                         In the second
 series the specifically heavier bisulphide of carbon was above ; the
 meniscus of the common surface had its concave side turned up
 wards.      In the first series of experiments the meniscus of the
 common surface rose in a tube which was moistened inside with
 water, and in the second series in one moistened with bisulphide
 of carbon.

   The column headed etm cos coou shows that the angle vtm was
very small or 0° only in experiments 3 and 4 of the second
series when based on the value 4'256 milligrammes for am formed
from observation of the drops (Table X. § 10).                 Since the liquids
become mixed in the course of time, and the angle a> changes
with the time, as was evident from observations with flat drops,
the different values of the angle &>„„ in the various experiments
are not surprising, since, both in this case and in the experi
ments of Section       III.    (§§ 16 to 18), the, friction of the liquid
and capillary meniscus in the capillary tube materially influence
the elevation hu, to which the lower liquid rises above the com
mon level, and make it too small.
   The form of the meniscus and of the angle wou of the common
capillary surface appeared to me also to depend on the rapidity
with which the liquids rose in the capillary tubes.                 This rapidity
is itself dependent on the length and breadth of the submerged
capillary tube, and on that part of it which is filled with air.
   By shifting the capillary tube in the caoutchouc rings the me
niscus was brought into other places of the tube, but without
producing any material influence on the magnitude of hu.
   21 . A series of similar experiments was made on water and
olive-oil, oil of turpentine, or petroleum, all of which liquids have
smaller capillary constants and lower specific gravities than water.
   The meniscus of the common surface turns the concave side
upward when oil is above and water below, and the convex side
upward in the converse case.
   Above each series of experiments is given that value of «„„
for the common surface of the liquids o and u, which was ob
tained from the observations on flat drops (Table X. § 10), and by
means of which the angle in the last column above (0OM = 180°
—                               the numbers in the penultimate column.

   The observations show that the angle coou was not constant in
the different experiments, with the exception of the series water
above, oil of turpentine below — in which a value a.ou is found for
Nos. 4 to 7, which very nearly agrees with the determination
from observations of drops (Table X. § 10) when the angle wuu
is put =180°. For the measurements 1 to 3 of the same series,
the too small value of SrA<7 or am cos <om is owing to the very
thin layer of water which covers the oil of turpentine.                The oil of
turpentine at the capillary meniscus of the common surface, freed
from the water, being specifically lighter, rose in the column of
water, spread itself out (compare § 26), and rendered impure the
upper meniscus of the open surface of the water, which no longer
possessed the constant for water, but that of a mixture of water
and oil of turpentine.          In observation No. 1 the water above the
oil of turpentine was removed by a piece of blotting-paper.
   In the series of experiments with olive-oil above and water
below, the common surface was decidedly concave upward, whilst
in contradiction herewith «»„, > 90° would follow from the observed
elevations.        Hence the cause that too small a value of hu was
observed must very likely be sought in the friction of the liquids
against the sides of the tube, which very considerably retarded
the condition of equilibrium.
   The same also holds good for the experiments with alcohol and
olive-oil given at the end of Table XVIII., where, on account of
the smallness of «„„, the fluctuations are perhaps still more
striking.
    22.    I  have also made a series of experiments with some
liquids which mix in all proportions, in which therefore aOK=0,

    In  fact the foregoing collection of experiments show a value
for  2rA<r  which (with few exceptions, to which I shall presently
return) very nearly agrees with the value of the constant 2a.0 de
rived from the elevations in capillary tubes (§ 4), as results from
equation (16) when a.m is put equal to zero.
    In the series with olive-oil above and oil of turpentine below,
after breaking off the point of the capillary tube        I observed no
movement for a long time ; then a movement occurred suddenly,
and the liquid certainly moved as quickly as if the oil of tur
pentine alone had ascended.       The oil of turpentine, for instance,
drove away the olive-oil from the glass side ; and as soon as it
had covered the meniscus of the olive-oil, it ascended, taking the
column of olive-oil along with it.          By this it is proved that
2rA<r in this case is found considerably less than 2«0 for olive-
oil, but, on the other hand, as nearly agrees with 2a0 for oil
of turpentine as might be expected generally in these expe
riments.
    For "water above and alcohol below," only the mean of the
last two experiments is taken, as, in Nos. 1 and 2, at the small
height h0 the water diffused along the side of the tube had in
creased the quantity of water contained in the alcohol and with
it 2«0.
    For " water above and alcohol below," the upper meniscus of
the water in all the experiments is rendered impure by the rapid
diffusion or solution of the specifically lighter alcohol and its
ascent in the specifically heavy column of water, and possesses
then naturally a smaller capillary constant than 2«0 = 14'47 milli
grammes for water.        According to the varying rapidity with
which this contamination took place, the numbers of column
2rA<r vary in magnitude ; the greatest is that in the last expe
 riment, in which a small air-bubble between the columns of water
and alcohol had retarded the diffusion of the alcohol in the
water.
    23. Results similar to those here described were obtained by
 Bede* in the experiments which he made by a similar method,
 and which here follow, with the notation which I have adopted
 in this memoir.     The capillary constants, as determined by him,
of the free surfaces of the liquids stand at the head of each
 aeries of experiments.

     At page 300 and at page 302, he describes a pointed iron wire
  and a pointed magnetic .needle as becoming inductively charged,
  at the point with positive, at the thick end with negative elec
  tricity ; that (as he need hardly tell electricians) is not so. The

idea the writer should have conveyed was that the pointed wir*
and needle behaved as if they had polarity at their opposite end*
as regarded the electrifying body, and as if the polarity were so
distributed. During the time a pointed needle is being charged
the head is attracted, the point repelled from the electrifierj
but so soon as the tension of the electricity of the wire or needle
approaches that of the electrifying body the thick end is like-
wise repelled.
    The following experiment, which is the converse of the one
narrated, page 302, affords an additional illustration of this kind
of polarity ; at least that is the construction which the writer
puts on the phenomena presented.
.   The magnet was arranged precisely as in the previous expe
riment ; but the test-needle was brought over the other pole, so
that the head instead of the point of the needle was the attracted
end.    Under these circumstances, when the system was charged,
the needle endeavoured to get still closer to the magnet, the
free end being at the same time thrown more from the pole to
which it was before inclining.    The needle was then placed at a
greater  distance  from  the magnet : on charging the apparatus,
the attraction was very visible, the head being drawn towards
the magnet from a distance of an inch, and being so held whilst
the arrangement continued to be electrified.     So soon, however,
as the positive and negative sides of the condenser were united,
the needle took up its former position in relation to the magnet.
    Touching the needle with a piece of copper wire during the
process of charging, or after the condensing arrangement was
charged, perceptibly increased the existing attraction of the
needle for the electrified magnet.
    The foregoing experiments were repeated with the horseshoe-
magnet as the negative side of the condensing system, the tin
foil-covered glass being superposed as the positive side, the
whole being so arranged that the charged tinfoil should be be
tween the poles of the magnet and the test-needle.
    Matters being thus arranged, on charging the apparatus as in
the previous experiments, the results afforded were in every way
precisely the same as when the magnet was the positively elec
trified body in the system and had no dielectric between it and
the needles other than the air.
    Both repulsion and attraction of magnetized needles, under
the circumstances above described, are accompanied by a marked
•divergence from the lines of magnetic force in which they would
have set if unbiased by static electricity.   The distance of one
end of a magnetic needle from a magnet being made the same
under the influence of the magnetic force and the combined
forces, in the latter case the needle tends to put itself in a vcr

tical position as regards that line of magnetic force which, if left
to itself, it would accord with.
   The writer desires to express a hope that, in those respects in
which his opinions may appear heterodox to commonly received
theories, it may be remembered that he. puts them forth only
as forming a possible basis on which his experiments might
be built up.       The conclusions at which the investigator may
ultimately arrive may be diametrically opposed to those on which
his present assumptions rest.      Priestley, whose opinion all will
recognize   as of some value on such matters, gives great encourage
ment to those who do not fear to find their hypotheses fail and
their conclusions reversed if by their boldness        may be auda           (it
city) they have nevertheless forwarded the knowledge of the truth.
   He says, "It                by
                         no means necessary to have just views and
                          is
a   true hypothesis,            a    priori,     in    order to make real discoveries.
Very lame and imperfect theories are sufficient to suggest useful
experiments, which serve to correct those theories and give
birth to others more perfect.    These, then, occasion further ex
periments, which bring us still nearer to the truth   and in this                ;

     The reason that I was not aware of Herschel's investigation,
 and therefore did not mention it in my memoir, will probably be
 understood when I state that it appeared in an appendix to au
 astronomical work published in 1847, which not only escaped
my attention, but even appears not to have come into the hands
of physicists themselves ; at any rate, as far as I can learn, no
one who has been engaged on calorimetrical investigations during
the quarter of a century which has elapsed since the publication
of Herschel's volume has ever mentioned the proposal of the
illustrious astronomer, much less either tried or used the method ;
otherwise I certainly should not have omitted most distinctly to
state that the idea of measuring the amount of melted ice by the
diminution of volume which thereby occurs is due to Herschel.
On the other hand, I may be allowed to take advantage of my
friend Andrews's remark to point out, perhaps more precisely
than   I have done in my memoir, one at least of the most impor
tant respects in which the instrument proposed by Herschel
differs from that which I have described.
    Herschel absorbs the heat which is to be measured by the
alteration of volume produced by the ice melting, in a vessel
filled with water and floating ice. In my arrangement the
same purpose is effected in a vessel made out of a solid mass of
artificially congealed ice. The medium employed by Herschel,
under the circumstances of the experiment, allows heat to pass
                          I
through it; that which use, on the contrary, cannot transmit
any of the heat.     In regard to the quantity of heat to be mea
sured, my instrument bears to that of Herschel the same relation
as a water-tight vessel does to a sieve as regards the measure
ment of a volume of liquid. We should, however, hardly call
two methods the same, one of which measured a liquid with a
water-tight vessel and the other with a sieve.     The loss of heat
occurring in a measurement made with a vessel filled with ice
and water is great enough to throw doubt upon any exact calo
rimetrical determination, as may be seen by reference to expe
riments detailed in my memoir, and as everyone knows who has
tried to determine the freezing-point of thermometers in a mix
ture of water and ice instead of in snow. The warmed water
which fills the spaces between the pieces of ice in Herschel's ap
paratus, and which, according to its temperature, either rises or
sinks, comes in a few seconds, and without having completely
equalized its difference of temperature, into contact with the sur
face of the glass vessel surrounding the medium, and gives up
this heat, which is thus withdrawn from measurement.
    The extent of uncertainty which is introduced by such a mode
of measurement may be estimated when we remember that, ac
cording to experiments given in my paper, more than 30 minutes

                                                                "

ig required in order completely to reduce the temperature of half
a gramme of water from 100° to 0°. This source of error, which
has been the cbief cause of the dismissal of Laplace's calorimeter
from among the ranks of exact physical instruments, and which
is in no way diminished in Herschel's improved form, is entirely
removed by the principle which I adopt.       According to my me
thod, the bodies whose loss of heat is to be measured by the
contraction of the melting of the ice are contained in a vessel
perfectly impenetrable for heat ; whilst at the same time any error
from transference of heat to the air is avoided, as the bodies are

     The resistance of every molecule of a liquid at rest which a solid
 (by moving through it) disturbs, contributes its share to the resist
 ance which the solid experiences ; so that the inertia of each molecule
 so disturbed and its shear must be taken into account in the aggre
 gate which represents the resistance the liquid offers to the motion
 of the solid.        The motions communicated to the molecules of a
 liquid by a solid passing through           it,
                                            and the resistances opposed to
 them, however, are so various, and so difficult to be represented ma
thematically, that in the present state of our knowledge of hydrody
namics the problem of the resistance of              liquid at rest to
                                                        a                    solid        a

of different films with velocities varying from the axis of the pipe to
its internal surface.     The direction of the motions of the molecules
of such a liquid being known, and all in the same film moving with
the same velocity, which velocity is a function of the radius of the
film, and the law of the resistance of each film to the slipping over it
of the contiguous film being assumed to be known, as also the head
of water, it is possible to express mathematically
   (1st) the work done per unit of time by the force which gives mo
tion to the liquid, and
   (2nd) the work per unit of time of the several resistances to which
the liquid in moving through the pipe is subjected, and
   (3rd) the work accumulated per unit of time in the liquid which
escapes — and thus to constitute an equation in which the dependent
variables are the radius of any given film, and the velocity of that
film.    This equation being differentiated and the variables separated,
and the resulting differential equation being integrated, there is ob
tained the formula                      _250r

                                  P=U0£
where v is the velocity of the film whose radius is r, and »0 that of
the central filament, and I the length of the pipe — the unit of length
being one metre, and of time one second.
   The method by which the author has arrived at this formula is
substantially the same as that which he before used in a paper read
before the Society on the " Mechanical Impossibility of the Descent
of Glaciers by their weight only," and which he believes to be a
method new to mechanical science.          It was indeed to verify it in its
application  to  liquids that  he  undertook the investigations which he
now submits to the Society, which, however, he has pursued beyond
their original object.
   The recent experiments of MM. Darcy and Bazin* have supplied
him with the means of this verification.         These experiments, made
with admirable skill and precision, on pipes upwards of 100 metres
in length, and varying in diameter from Om-0122to Om-5, under
beads of water varying in height from Om-027 to 30m'714, include
(together with numerous experiments on the quantity of water which
flows per second from such pipes under different conditions) expe
riments on the velocities of the films of water at different distances
from the axes of the pipes, made by means of an improved form and
adaptation of the well-known tube of Pilot.          These last-mentioned
experiments afford the means of verifying the above-mentioned for
mulae.    With a view to this verification, the author has compared the
formula with sixty of the experiments of M. Darcy, and stated the
results in the first two Tables of his paper.
   The discharge per 1" from a pipe of a given radius may be cal
culated from the above formula in terms of the velocity of the cen
tral filament.     This calculation the author has made, and compared
it with the results of eleven of M. Darcy's experiments.

     Where in the formula -which thus represents the discharge from
 a   pipe of given radius, in terms of the velocity of the central filament,
 the radius is made infinite, an expression is obtained for the volume
 of liquid of a cylindrical form, but of infinite dimensions (laterally),
 which would be put in motion by a single filament of liquid which
 traversed its axis ; and, conversely, it gives the volume of such a
 liquid in motion which would be held back by a filament of liquid
 kept at rest along its axis.      Thus it explains the well-known retard
 ing effect of filaments of grass and roots in retarding the velocities of
 streams.
     It is the relation of the velocity of any film to that of the central
 filament which the author establishes in the above formula. To the
 complete solution of the problem it is necessary that he should further
 determine the actual velocity r0 of the central filament.        This is the
 object     of  the second part of his  paper.   This  velocity being known,
 the actual discharge per 1" is known.          The following is the formula
 finally arrived at : —

     6tb, for glass pipes.
     The author compares this formula with sixty-two of M. Darcy's
 experiments, and records the results of this comparison in the last
three Tables of his paper.
     The paper concludes with an investigation of the rise in the tem
perature of a liquid flowing through a pipe caused by the resist
ances which its coaxial films oppose to their motions on one another
(or, as it is termed, their frictions on one another) and on the in
ternal surface of the pipe. The pipe is in this investigation supposed
to be of a perfectly non-conducting substance.

    "Observations of the Eclipse at Oxford, December 22, 1870" " By
John Phillips, M.A., D.C.L., F.R.S.
    At my observatory, situated about one third of a mile eastward from
the great establishment founded in the name of Dr. Radcliffe, the

 Prof.     J.  Phillips on    the  Eclipse at Oxford, Dec. 22, 1870.             397
beginning of the eclipse was obscured              by a passing cloud : the end
was recorded        at 13" 38'   38"=    1" 35'  0"'9 Oxford mean time.
    The progress of the obscuration was observed at unclouded inter
vals in the first half of the period, continuously during a clear sky
in the latter half.         Finding it impracticable to observe and measure
with ordinary micrometers in the early part of the phenomenon,                         I
arranged to throw the image on a screen, and make my measures on it.
    The driving-clock was affected by the extreme cold, so as to make
it difficult to keep the sun's image to one place, and it was conve
nient for other reasons sometimes to shift the image vertically ; the
method which I employed, however, was independent of these dis
placements, and allowed of as many measurements of the cusps as
might be desired.
    It consisted simply in marking at any moment with pencil the
situation of the cusps on the screen, and appending to each dot
the time by the sidereal clock.              Joining, after the eclipse, these dots
by a straight line, and then transferring a parallel line of equal length
to meet internally a circle representing the limb of the sun, of the
same diameter as the solar image, the chord of the cusps at the given
time was obtained, from which, by an easy method, the place of the
moon's centre at the moment was derived. The apparent diameters
of the sun and moon were obtained by measure of arcs on the screen.
    The diagrams exhibit the whole process.               In diagram fig. 1, four
of the lines are drawn from the dots on the screen, AA, BB, CC, DD.
    In fig. 2, equal and parallel lines are transferred to the solar circle,
whose centre is S, so as to touch it internally at A' A', B' B', C' C',
D'D'. For each of these lines the centre of the moon's place is
marked (A", B", C", D") ; thus the line of the motion of the moon's
centre is given, and the phase of greatest obscuration determined.
  Fig.  1.  A A, B   B, C C, D D, are lines joining the dots marking the cusps at

    The line of motion of the moon's centre is obtained by ruling
through the mid points between A" and B", B" and C", C" and D".
The point on this line reached by the moon's centre at the moment
of greatest obscuration is found by bisection in M. Drawing through
M and S the bisecting line of greatest obscuration, the length of the
sagitta m s is determined.

          That of the moon is                                     540
          The length of the sagitta m s is                        100

Almanac for the Radcliffe Observatory, would have been : —

   The agreement is quite close enough to justify the belief that, in
skilful hands, the method described may be in some cases very useful,
it being by no means limited to eclipses.         It is so simple that one
can hardly suppose it not to have been already employed ; but        I have
met with no notice of such being the case.
    During the progress of the eclipse three thermometers were ob
served.     One north of the house, screened from the sun and sky,
sank from 2G° at 11" 40m to 24°'4 at lh 25m.              One south of the
house, indirectly influenced by solar radiation on neighbouring ob
jects, rose from 26°'75 at 11" to 27°'8 at noon, then sank to 26° at
 12h40m, and rose to 27°'3 at 1" 35m.        A third, on grass open to the
sky, sank from 27°'8 at 11" 40m to 23°-5 at 1" 25m, and remained
at this point till lh 35™.     Though on a limited scale, the influence
both of solar and    skv radiation  is traceable in these observations.

   Friday, February 3, 1871. — "On. some Experiments on Succes
sive Polarization of Light made by Sir C. Wheatstone."               By W.
Spottiswoode,    Esq.,  Trees.  R.S.  and  R.I.
   The experiments which formed the subject of this discourse were
made by Sir Charles Wheatstone some years ago, but the pressure
of other avocations delayed their publication.          The term " Succes
                   " was
sive polarization         applied by Biot to denote the effects produced
when a ray of polarized light is transmitted through a plate of rock
crystal cut perpendicularly to the axis.        The plane of polarization
is found to be changed on emergence and through a different angle
for each homogeneous ray. The introduction of instrumental means
for converting the plane polarization of the ordinary apparatus into
successive, or, as it is more commonly called, circular polarization,
and the explanation of the phenomena thence arising, constitute the
main purpose of the communication.
   Polarized light is distinguished from common light by the pre
sence of certain peculiarities not ordinarily found ; but the peculi
arities in question cannot be discerned by the unassisted eye, and
require special instrumental appliances for detection. A simple mode

   Mr. W.    Spottiswoode    on Successive Polarization of Light.      899
of bringing light into the condition in question is by allowing it to
pass through a plate of the crystal called tourmalin, cut parallel to
the axis ; and if the light be then examined by causing it to pass
through a second similar plate, held parallel to the former and caused
to revolve like a wheel in its own plane, it will be found that the in
tensity alternately diminishes and revives, being zero for two posi
tions 180° from one another, and a maximum for two positions at
90° from each of the former.        This combination of tourmalins con
stitutes in fact a polariscope, which in general consists of two parts,
counterparts of each other' — the first for bringing common light into
the condition in question (in other words, (or polarizing), the second
 for examining or analyzing the light.
     The explanation of this fundamental phenomenon is as follows : —
The vibrations upon which the sensation of light depends, may in
ordinary light take place in any direction in a plane perpendicular
to the ray.     By the process of polarization they are all brought into
one direction, still, however, perpendicular to the ray ; so that
 throughout the entire ray they lie in one plane. On this account
 the polarization here considered is called plane polarization.     There,
 are other kinds of polarization, such as circular and elliptic, whose
 names are derived from the curves, or orbits, described by the vibra
 ting particles.
     There are also other methods for producing plane polarization
 beside that above described (e. g. reflection at particular angles from
 the surfaces of transparent media, transmission through parallel plates
 of glass, &c.); but as they all agree in reducing common light to the
 same condition, it is unnecessary for the present purpose to allude
 to them more in detail.
     If a ray of polarized light fall upon a plate of doubly-refracting
 crystal, it is divided into two, whose vibrations lie in planes perpen
 dicular to one another. These rays traverse the crystal with different
 yelocities, and therefore emerge with a difference of phase.           On
 Entering the analyzer, the vibrations of both rays are resolved into
 one plane.     If the plane of vibration of the analyzer be parallel to
 one of those of the crystal, one ray will be cut off, the other will be
 transmitted without change.        In any other position of the analyzer
 the transmitted portions of the two rays will interfere so as to pro
 duce colour ; and if the analyzer be then turned through 90°, the>
 portion of the original light cut off in the first position will be trans
  mitted, and rice versd.
     Of this theory the following are the experimental results : — If a
 plate of doubly-refracting crystal, e. g. selenite, be placed between
 the polarizer and analyzer, and turned round in its own plane, it
 will be found that in certain positions at right angles to one another
  no effect is produced.     These may be called neutral positions.      In
  all other positions the field is tinted with colour, which is most
 brilliant when the plate has been turned through 45° from a neutral
  position.   If the analyzer be turned, the crystal remaining still, the
 colour will fade, and entirely vanish when the angle of turning
 amounts to 45°.       From this position the complementary colour will

400                          Royal Institution.
 begin to appear, and will be brightest when the angle of turning
 amounts to 90°.        The colour depends upon the thickness of the
 crystal  ;  so that by a suitable preparation any arrangement of colours
may    be   produced.
    So far for plane polarization.      The principal of circular or succes
 sive polarization, as regards the present purpose, is as follows : —
    If two sets of rectilinear vibrations lying in planes perpendicular
to one another meet and combine, the resulting vibration will be
curvilinear, whose form and position depends upon the difference of
phase of the components.          If the second set be in advance or in rear
 of the first by a quarter of a wave-length, the resulting vibration
 will be circular ; but the motion will in one case be direct (like the
 hands of a watch), in the other it will be reverse.
    If two sets of circular vibrations in opposite directions meet and
combine, the resulting vibrations will be rectilinear, and the position
 of their plane will depend upon the difference of phase of the compo
nents. If the second set advance upon the first, the plane of resultant
vibration will undergo direct rotation ; if it recede, it will undergo
reverse rotation.
    If in such an experiment white light be used, the vibrations of the
different component prismatic colours will (on account of their dif
ferent wave-lengths) undergo different retardation ; and consequently
the resultant vibrations will lie in different planes, arranged in pris
matic order. The order will be from red to violet, or vice versd, in
accordance with the law stated above.
    If a ray of plane-polarized light fall upon a metallic reflector, it
 is divided into two, whose vibrations are respectively parallel and
 perpendicular to the reflector ; and the latter is retarded behind the
former by a difference of phase depending upon the angle of inci
dence. If the plane of vibration of the incident ray be inclined at
an angle of 45° to the plane of incidence, the two rays into which it
is divided have nearly the same intensity.         At an angle, nearly 45°,
which varies with the metal employed, but which is perfectly definite,
the intensities become accurately equal. And, further, if the angle
of incidence have a particular value, dependent upon the nature of
the metal (for silver 72°), the retardation will amount to a quarter
of a wave-length.       These two rays, on leaving the reflector, will re-
combine, and, in accordance with the laws above given, will in the
last-mentioned circumstances become a circularly polarized ray.
Lastly, the direction of motion in this circular ray will depend upon
the side on which the original plane of vibration is inclined to the
plane of incidence ;   if,  when it   is  inclined on one side, the circular
ray becomes right-handed, then, when         it   is inclined on the other,
it  becomes left-handed.
    Reverting then to the phenomena of double refraction, produced
by   a plate of crystal cut parallel to the axis on    aplane-polarized ray,
let the crystal be placed in such     a  position that the planes of vibra
tion of the two resulting rays are inclined at angles of 45° on the
two sides respectively of the plane of incidence and let there be
                                                           ;

               Intelligence      and Miscellaneous         Articles.            401
angle of 72° to the direction of these emergent rays. Each of these
rays will, in virtue of the principles enunciated above, be converted
by reflection into a circularly polarized ray ; but one will be a right-
handed, and the other a left-handed ray ; and the difference of phase
produced by the duubly-refracting plate will be undisturbed by the
reflection. This difference of phase depends, as is well known, upon
the wave-length — in other words, upon the colour of the light ; so
that the two circular rays will combine to form a plane-polarized ray,
•whose plane of vibration depends upon the difference of phase, i . e.
upon its colour.     And   if,finally, the light be then examined by an
analyzer in the usual manner, we shall have all the phenomena of cir
cular or successive polarization.
    From what has been stated above,       it   appears that the direction of
motion in the two circular rays, and consequently the order of colours
produced, depends upon the position (to the right or left of the plane
of incidence) of the ray which has been most retarded in its passage
 through the crystal plate.        If, therefore, the plate being in given  a
 position, the colours appear in an ascending order, then on turning
 the plate through 90° in its own plane, or on turning             over about
                                                                       it
 an axis in the plane of incidence, the swifter and the slower raya will
 change position, and the order of colours will be reversed.
     The reversal of the order of colour may be exhibited in another
 way. Uniaxial crystals are divided into two classes — one, called  :
 positive (e. y. quartz), in which the extraordinary ray moves more
 slowly than the ordinary     ;   the other, called negative (e. g. Iceland
 spar), in which the ordinary ray the slowest.
                                      is                      If,
                                                            therefore, a plate
 of quartz placed with its axis at 45° on one side of the plane of in
 cidence give the colours in one order, similar plate of Iceland spar
                                            a
 similarly placed will give them in the reverse order.
    The same principles apply to the case of biaxial crystals cut parallel
 to a plane containing the two optic axes.            Aray of plane-polarized
 light transmitted through such a plate          is divided into two, whose
 vibrations respectively bisect the angles formed by the two axes                 ;
  the line which bisects the smallest angle           called the intermediate
                                                      is
 section, and the line perpendicular to     it   the supplementary section        ;
 and the order of the colours depends upon the relative velocity of the
 two rays.     In selenite the ray whose vibrations lie in the supple
 mentary section   is  the slowest   ;   in mica  it    the swiftest.
                                                       is               Hence
 these two crystals     will, all    other  circumstances being alike, give
 opposite orders of colour, and may be regarded as positive and ne
  gative respectively, like quartz and Iceland spar.
     The phenomena by which these principles may be illustrated are
 very numerous and varied, but are better seen than described.

 gravity of the air, and calculating therefrom the expansion at the'
 time. The former method is in universal application in the mer-1
 cury barometer ; the latter one has not hitherto been used in barome
 tric measurements.
     The apparatus which I have prepared and employed, and by which
 the atmospheric pressure can at all times be determined, consists of
 a scale-beam, to the ends of which are screwed two bodies nearly
 equal in weight but greatly differing in volume, — a hollow sphere
 and a solid cylinder*.         On one end of the beam is a mirror which
 is approximately at right angles to the axis of the beam.          At some
 distance from the apparatus is a telescope with a vertical scale,
 the image of which in the mirror is observed by means of the tele-;
 scope.       It is clear that when there is any change in the expansion
 of the     air in the vicinity of the apparatus, the beam will indicate va
 rying angles with the horizon, which angles may easily be read off
  in the mirror by means of the telescope.
     The variations of the scale-beam in consequence of alterations in
  the pressure will not amount to much, if the dimensions of the appa
 ratus are moderate ; but the use of Poggendorff and Gauss's method
 of reading affords such a degree of accuracy that, as a brief calcula
 tion shows, under assumptions which are easily realized, the changes'
 in the position of the beam can be measured with far greater cer
  tainty and accuracy than the height of the mercurial column in the'
  ordinary barometer, provided the whole construction is light, and
  that its centre of gravity is at a short distance from the knife-edge
   of the beam.

gives us the measure of the delicacy of the instrument, which therefore
reaches the maximum about the horizontal position of the beam.
As, moreover, the greatest deflection only amounts to a few degrees,
the delicacy can be regarded as constant.      On a certain assumption,
calculation gives for an increase in the pressure of 1 millim. a deflec
tion of a few millimetres (4 to 5) of the scale.
    But the present apparatus not merely gives a determination of the
pressure of the atmosphere with at least as great a degree of accu
racy as the mercury barometer, but appears also to have several
material advantages over this, as it is liable to far smaller errors.
    In every instrument which serves for the measurement of a vari
able force it is essential that it require the movement of as small
masses as possible, and the more so the quicker the changes which
 it is to indicate ; for under certain circumstances results greatly
varying from actual fact would be obtained.
    In the mercury barometer the movement of a column of liquid of
 considerable weight is essential in indicating changes in the atmo
 spheric pressure ; this heavy column of mercury will only be set in
 motion if the impulses are accumulated in such a manner that they
 can overcome the resistance along the entire surface of the tube and
 acquire a certain velocity.    If the change in the pressure take place
 with great velocity, the mercury barometer, in virtue of its inertia,
 will never indicate the actual pressure, and never its highest or lowest
 value.
     From its small size, as well as from the small resistance to its
 motion, the above apparatus is far less exposed to this objection ;
 and we shall probably be enabled by its means to follow such rapid
 changes in the pressure of the atmosphere as in the ordinary baro
  meter can only be expressed by mean values.
     A further disadvantage of the ordinary barometer is that, as a
 matter of fact, the Torricellian vacuum always contains mercury
 vapour of small tension and also atmospheric air, and the more of
  this the longer the instrument has been in use.        And although a
  correction may be introduced for the vapour of mercury, its action
  upon the capillary depression, as well as the air in the Torricellian
  vacuum, cannot be accurately allowed for.
     Finally, the use of the mercury barometer presupposes filling it
  with mercury of a precisely definite specific gravity, which also pre
  sumes an impossible condition ; for chemically pure mercury cannot
  be obtained without difficulty, and does not keep, but partially
  oxidizes after a time. Now experiments have shown that the smallest
  impurity in the barometric liquid has a material influence on the
  capillary depression.
     Defects analogous to these the new instrument does not seem to
  have, provided the beam be constructed with that _care which is
  usually bestowed upon delicate balances.

       INVERSION OF THE SODIUM-LINE.              BY A. WEINHOLD.
   The usual mode of inverting the sodium-line (in which feebly lu
minous sodium vapour is interposed between an ignited body and
the slit of the spectroscope) requires great brightness in the white
light, in order that the quantity of light absorbed by the sodium
vapour may be considerably greater than that radiated by it, and
thus the sodium-line be considerably feebler than the adjacent parts
of the spectrum.
   It was to be expected that the inversion would take place more
readily if the brightness of the parts of the spectrum adjacent to
the sodium-line could be as much increased as the brightness of the
sodium-line is increased by the luminosity of the sodium vapour.
   This can be very easily effected.          A small petroleum lamp is
placed   in front  of the slit of a small  spectroscope   consisting merely
of a tube (without lens) and a powerfully dispersing prism ; and a
spirit-flame intensely coloured by common salt is so placed between
the spectrum and the eye that it covers the entire spectrum ; there at
once appears a very distinct dark sodium-line, while the same spirit-
flame placed between the petroleum lamp and the slit brings out
the sodium-line bright and luminous.
   In the first position the entire spectrum seems illuminated by the
yellow light indicated by         it,
                                and therefore the sodium-line     less bright  is
than the adjacent parts of the spectrum                   by
                                                  the entire amount of the
absorption ;   while in the second position these parts are not at all
altered or the sodium-line enfeebled by the absorption of sodium
vapour, but strengthened by its own radiation.
   If the lamp- wick be only rubbed with salt,             only in the first
                                                                it   is
few seconds after lighting that             intense enough to produce

distinct inversion  ;   it   better before filling the lamp with alcohol
                             is
to dilute this with water and then saturate           with salt occasional

   There  isa   slight difficulty which very short-sighted people expe
rience in finding the right accommodation for the slit, and not for the
alcohol-flame. This difficulty       lessened by placing

 currents of hot air.     From the construction of my "apparatus an ad

   PART III. Approach caused by Vibration, being five Letters

   Dr. Guyot's paper was first brought to my notice        on   read
ing Herr Shellback's second paper.           On turning to the ori
ginal I found that Dr. Guyot had anticipated so many of Herr
Shellbach's and my own experimental results, that it became
an obvious duty on my part to bring Dr. Guyot's claim to be
the experimental discoverer of this highly interesting class of
phenomena before your readers, to most of whom Dr. Guyot's
experiments may be as unfamiliar as they were a short time ago
to myself.
   Your readers will also certainly be interested in Herr Shell
bach's experiments on acoustic repulsion and attraction.           It
appears from Herr Shellbach's paper No. 1 that his experiments
therein described were performed independently of, and nearly at
the same time as mine.       Herr Schellbach's papers 2 and 3 are
specially interesting, as they bear upon the conclusions drawn
by Sir \V. Thomson concerning the same subject.

 and which     I  give with permission on pp. 423-429, in the be
 lief that they are of too great interest and importance to remain

       I. Synthetical   View   of the Forms and Forces of Matter.
                              By Dr. GUYOT*.
     All who occupy themselves with general physics have doubt
 less read Mr. Grove's ' Correlation of the Physical Forces,' either
 in the original or in the French translation of M. 1'Abbe Moigno,
 published in Paris in 1856 with notes byM. Seguin, sen. Mr.
 Grove published the first edition of his work in 1848, and he
himself dates its commencement from 1842.
     M. Seguin, sen., while admiring Mr. Grove's synthetical
train of thought, claims, so to say, the priority thereof for his
 uncle, the celebrated Mongolfier, or rather for himself as his
uncle's intellectual legatee.          Nevertheless he declares that it
was only in 1848, after Mr. Grove's publication, that he thought
of disinterring from its crypt the scientific treasure of which he
was heir.      Soon afterwards (in 1852) he founded the Cosmos
under the editorship of the learned Abbe Moigno, and pub
lished a great number of articles, which, together with the notes
added by him to the translation of Mr. Grove's work, complete a
synthetical theory which has only, as a real and certain date, the
date of its publication.
     M. Love, a most distinguished engineer and, imagine, one I
of our colleagues, has just published this year an extremely in
teresting work in the same direction, or which is at least in
spired by the same synthetical idea of the correlation of the
physical forces.       This work is entitled Essai sur I'ldentit6 des
agents qui produisent le Son, la Chaleur, la Lumiere, et I'Elec-
tricite (Paris, 1861).        Mr. Grove still remains at present the
founder    of the school, the first popularizer of the idea.
     He would indeed remain so did not the dead arise from their

and have not yet given it that character of simplicity and uni
versality demanded by a simple and prolific law of general
physics.
    It is not my purpose,     moreover,  to discuss a sterile question
of priority ; but I think I may be useful to science in proposing

 festations — the movement of translation or bodily (" du corps"),
and the movement of vibration or molecular ; (3) that move
 ment is essential to matter and proportional to mass ; (4) that
the movement of translation and the movement of vibration
are reciprocally complementary and change into one another ;
 (5) that attraction (? gravitation, P. G.), magnetism, and elec

because for thirty years my mind has not ceased to work, to ob
serve, and to reason in the same direction.        And I have been
thus led to valuable discoveries    —  discoveries which ought to
serve for the mechanical proof of the cause and effect of attrac
tion.    As starting-point (point d'appuf), and as base of the syn
thesis which  I  am about to develope,    I ought again to call the
attention of the readers of the Presse Scientifique to my work on
the movements of air and the pressure of air in movement
(Paris, 1835), a work which experimentally        demonstrates the
attractions  of bodies  suspended  in space by   sonorous bodies in
vibration.
   The subject which I am about to attack is so vast and diffi
cult to explain, that I cannot commence it without having pre
viously asked for the kind and patient attention of my readers.
I shall certainly announce a number of propositions which will
appear more than doubtful, and I cannot stop to discuss and
prove them one by one ; but, by the patience and kindness of
my readers, they will become evident as they are developed.         I
therefore ask for provisional faith ; and I think it is in harmony
with the spirit of my readers to grant me this preliminary faith
in regard to all matters advanced, with the reserved privilege of
judicially deciding after having heard.     In fact, knowledge ac
quired and established, bases its arguments on the principles
and facts which it has accepted.
   The spirit of discovery is chiefly supported by principles and
facts which are unknown or not received.
   Knowledge is therefore the born and legitimate adversary of
every truth which seeks other bases than its own.         It is often
observed that learned official bodies energetically and for a long
time reject truths and facts which afterwards take first rank
amongst those adopted by science.
    If1 am not mistaken,   the readers of the Presse Scientifique
are constituted so as to hasten all kinds of progress by avoiding
the principal and necessary fault of accepted science — namely,
that of judging without hearing, or of judging according to
ancient laws the novelties which are presented to       it,
                                                       and of pro
nouncing impossible every thing which        not derived from its
                                              is
codes, and still more so that which oversets them.      From this
point  of view  the Press Scientifique has   strong raison d'etre

and its foundation will render incalculable services for ever, be
cause, for ever, present knowledge will repel future knowledge
until the latter shall have become achieved science and then
                                                          ;
the latter, being received as orthodox science, will in its turn
become the enemy of that which       it docs not know.     Such   is
the continual and legitimate contest between the past and the
future, between tradition and the work of progress.       The rea

ders of the Presse Scientifique, by undertaking to entertain all
new scientific theories without denying and without rejecting
them a priori, perform a function of the highest importance.
Official science is conservative.  The readers of the Presse place
themselves at the head of scientific progress.
                            On Matter and its Forms.
    Before considering matter in the exercise of its forces (that              is,
 of its movements),         well to make, so to say, an inventory of
                            it   is
 the principal forms under which          presents itself directly to
                                                 it
 our senses, or indirectly to our sense of induction.
    The form of matter which falls the first under our senses
is  that of bodies considered isolated.    Bodies affect three forms,
 the solid, liquid, and gaseous.    In nature we usually see solids
 grouped together, liquids united in considerable expanses, and
 gases forming immense zones.         In these collective forms the
 solids constitute solid media, liquids liquid media, and gases
gaseous media.      The term medium           properly applicable to
                                                      is
solids, liquids, and gases when we consider        body contained in
                                                                 a
or surrounded          by
                     them.
    Media grouped in spheroidal masses present us matter in the
form of the heavenly bodies — the sun and stars          in the form  ;
of planets  —  Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, the new smaller
planets as well as the more ancient, Ceres, Juno, Pallas, Vesta,
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus and            ;the form of the earthly
                                                  in
satellites and those   of Jupiter, Saturn, and   Uranus.
   If we descend again to the earth we learn that solids, liquids,
and gases are formed of different substances, simple or compound,
called mineral.    We see there organized parasites generally fixed
in  the solid medium, and growing in the liquid or gaseous me
dium these are plants. Finally, we see other systems of
     :                                                                        in
dependent bodies which are also parasites of the earth, which
climb, walk, swim, or fly upon or in the solid, liquid, or gaseous
media :  these are animals.
   Science,       induction or experimental deduction, takes us
                  by
further  :    shows us all the bodies of the earth formed of infi
             it
nitely  small  molecules, simple or compound, remaining always
the same, whether they constitute minerals, vegetables, or
animals.
   Atomic elements are exceedingly few in number         twelve or        :
thirteen metalloids and forty or fifty metals, suffice to give rise
to the millions of varied forms of all the bodies which we know
on the earth     and chemical philosophy readily leads us to sup
                  ;
pose that these elements may be reduced to one or two.
   Such     the totality of the forms assumed
             is                                    pressible, pon    by

 all combination,      itinfinitely more subtle than any atom of

   The existence of this incoercible matter has always been ad
mitted          by
           the greatest philosophers and the greatest physicists
under the name of the subtle substance, or, more generally,
aether.
     ^Ether, in fact, constitutes the fourth state and the fourth
 medium of matter.           It   the most abundant of the states

 is the medium of media.           It contains all the stars, all the pla

 into all gaseous, liquid, and solid bodies, and fills up the inter

 an absolute vacuum in nature, but, on the contrary, ponderable
 and imponderable matter are in an absolute and relative condi
  tion of enormous tension.           The equilibrium and the phenomena
 of the world only exist under the condition of the constant
  pressure of the incoercible matter upon the coercible matter and
  the reaction of the coercible matter upon the incoercible.
                     On Movement, or the Forces                of   Matter.
    Matter has only one property               —namely,
                                              movement.  Movement
 can only exhibit itself to our senses and to our spirit of induc
 tion through matter and in matter.       And, reciprocally, matter
 is  only perceptible   to our senses  and  comprehensible       our                  by
 minds          by
             its movements.    Movement      inherent in and essen
                                                          is
 tial to the smallest atoms, as well as to the greatest material
 systems.     In the whole universe we cannot discover        single              a
 particle  of  matter which      absolute rest.

 ment are two creations of the same principle      they are consub- ;
 stantial, and accordingly proportional to one another.
    The first notion which we can have of motion cannot arise
 from the infinitely small molecules of bodies, because they es

bodies themselves.        Hence motion          begg^fined ag the
motion of a body from one^ point of^^S^o mother.              In order
that this detiRittCS-mig'nt tie "extCtffit would be necessary to say,
" motion is the passage of bodies and atoms from one point of
 space to another," because a particle, a molecule which we
can neither see nor touch, may also change place in the body of
which it forms part, and such is clearly a motion identical in
principle with the motion of bodies.        The difference of the two
motions is only relative ; the one is exterior to, the other is in
terior, in the body. But, wonderful to relate, observation of all
the phenomena of nature shows that they transform themselves
the one into the other, and are thus mutually connected and
complementary.        The more of exterior motion a body accom
plishes, the less is there of internal motion, and inversely.       In
other words, the same quantity of matter always possesses the
same amount of motion.
    The inertia of matter is therefore an error.       " What does it
 signify?" say the learned who are more mechanicians than phi
 losophers ;
               " if the hypothesis of inertia permits us to calculate
all the facts of equilibrium of motion and of force which
 occur on the surface of the earth, or rather in our physical and
 mechanical operations, that is all we want.         Whether an hy
 pothesis be true or false, if it be in accord with facts, if it be a
 sure guide for practical questions, we call it true."
    I grant that a mechanic or practical man may hold such lan
 guage ; but they who feel the importance of truth, they who
 understand that its quest is the most beautiful mission of the
 human mind, and that its discovery and enunciation infallibly
 guide humanity in the path of moral and material progress,'
 such,   I say, will never admit that a false hypothesis can have
 the same value as a true one, they will never allow that the at
 mospheric vacuum is as well explained by the horror of nature
 as by the weight of the atmospheric column ; and yet these two
 explanations express equally well the same fact.        Inertia is an
 hypothesis as little refined as that of the horror of a vacuum ;
 it explains nothing, and stereotypes error in face of the most
 brilliant truths. Does inertia explain the motion of the heavenly
 bodies ?    Does it explain the motions of animals ?       No.    But
 the sidereal systems comprehend all known matter; and animal
 organizations form the last term of material combinations.
 Inertia therefore remains impotent in regard to the spontaneous
 phenomena of the one or the other kind; between the alpha and
 omega of the world it only claims a puny territory, namely the
 relative movement and rest of bodies in equilibrium amongst
 themselves in a system full of life.

   To study these two great divisions of motion we shall desig
nate them by their most generally received names, translation
and vibration.
                               Motion of Translation.
     The motion of translation            is,
                                  as we have said, the passage of
a   body from  one  point of space  to another.  Is this apparent
and external motion engendered in the heavenly bodies              the           by
internal motion of their molecules as          with animals
                                                     it   is     Or          ?        is
it rather primitive and spontaneous         and do the molecules of
                                                     ?
the heavenly bodies only enter into vibration when their move
ment of translation cannot satisfy the sum total of motion essen
tial to their mass         ?
    This question solves itself after the study of vibration.      For
the present      itsufficient to say that the movement of transla
                      is
tion, be     the cause or the effect of the movement of vibration,
            it
always strives to take place in straight lines      and  bodies move
                                                                ;      if
in curved or broken lines, their change of direction           due to       is
some dominant influence.
    The motion of translation of all bodies tends to take place
with the same velocity and this velocity
                                ;                immense and indefi
                                                           is
nite. But bodies do not move with the same force, unless they
possess the same number of elementary atoms.             Velocity re
sides in the atom, and the force of motion in the number of
atoms   ; and this stands to reason.     Twenty men have only the
velocity of one man, but they have the strength of twenty.
 Nevertheless force only exists and only appears as the resistance
to velocity.    The smaller the velocity becomes, the greater                         is
the force, and inversely.      So that     the velocity were infinite
                                                    if
 (absolve) for each atom of      body, the force would be zero in
                                      a                                               a
body of one as in      body of thousand atoms.
                           a          a               And inversely,                  if
the velocity were completely stopped, the effort of the atom or
body would attain its maximum.            The forces of nature are
therefore only resistance to motion          direction or velocity, or
                                                     in
the production of motion with          velocity and direction which
                                                a
 overcome certain obstacles.      This oscillation between force and
velocity     nothing but the ceaseless transformation of motion of
            is
 translation into motion of vibration, and vice versd. And this,
I  hope, will appear from the study of the motion of vibration,
a  study the least advanced, but the most necessary for the un
derstanding of general physics.

           Dr. Guyot   on the   Forms and Forces of Matter.      413
   After the study of vibration we shall have to explain the
movement of translation of the heavenly bodies and of pla
nets, and satellites on their axes, the orbital motion of planets
and their satellites, the movement of atmospheres and oceans,
the motions of sidereal systems, the motions of animals and
the motions of mechanical and physical translation found on
the surface of the earth.
     On   the Motion of Vibration, its varieties and their effects.
    There is no single material molecule in the universe which
does not accomplish a motion of vibration more or less extended
and more or less rapid.      More rapid if it be less extended, more
extended if it be less rapid.       The simple atoms of aether, the
systematized atoms of media, gaseous, liquid, and solid, those
of each of the different bodies (elements) which form the three
latter media execute, each in the place it occupies, the move
ment of vibration proper to it.
    Is vibration a motion to and fro, or a motion of oscillation from
one molecule to another ?         Is it a simple orbit, or one accom
panied by axial rotation ? Is it an elliptic or a spiral motion ?
Genius will find this out ; science will ultimately determine it :
for the present it is sufficient to know that all the molecules of
bodies, both the densest and the rarest, of platinum as well
as of hydrogen, are at a distance from one another, isolated from
one another, free from one another, and that this distance,
this isolation, this liberty of association can only be due to their
permanent activity, to their vibration, greater or less, quicker or
slower.     Each molecule is a power or force in function, a move
ment of vibration which influences surrounding molecules in the
way of contact or cooperation ; and each body is the resultant
(resume), the total of these forms of which each molecule is the
unit.    The more dense and the larger a body         is,  the greater
is  the sum of the motions      ithas to perform.  Whatever of these
motions    it does not accomplish in translation,   it    accomplishes
in  vibration, and vice versa.
    Vibration includes three components — mode, number, and am
plitude. The minor mode constitutes electricity, the mean mode
heat, and the major mode light. Number constitutes the degrees
of electricity, of heat, and of light. Amplitude constitutes the ca
pacities, the dilatations, and the gaseous, liquid, and solid states.
The power of attraction   is common to all these modes of vibration.
    These three orders of vibratory movement of the molecules
of ponderable bodies (namely, electricity, heat, and light), in
passing from the one order to the other, conserve their intrin
sic characters, but they acquire others which are very different
and altogether individually characteristic.       These resemblances

and variations will be the subject of special subsequent study ;
for the present, and in the first place,         I
                                          ought to make known
how gravitation, attraction, weight, density, cohesion, fusibility,
solubility, and affinity are the immediate and necessary conse
quence of the state of vibration of the ponderable molecules of
bodies reacting upon the elastic pressure of the imponderable
medium which everywhere touches them.
    Here the subject becomes so grave, it is of so much import
ance to science that the theory of universal gravitation should
be understood, that I must prepare the minds of my readers by
submitting to them material and sensible analogies and palpably
verifiable facts.
    If in the atmosphere, an elastic medium possessing at the
same time expansibility and definite pressure, we conceive there
to be two hemispherical cups of solid matter fitting on to one
another exactly by friction, so as to form a sphere like that
formed by the Magdebourg hemispheres, we may seek in vain
to make them adhere to one another, that                  is,
                                                       to give them mu
tual cohesion,  if we do not have recourse to the well-known
means of rarefying the air within the touching hemispheres.
    As soon as we have,        bythe air-pump or some other means,
diminished the interior pressure on the hemispheres, the two
adhere.     Their adhesion         small
                                  is       if  but little air has been
withdrawn they have cohesion almost equal to the total pres
            ;              a
sure of the atmosphere     if  nearly all the interior air       removed.
                                                                     is
    Let us consider the case when the two hemispheres adhere                        by
reason of the withdrawal of, let us say,          hundredth of the air
                                                     a
which they contain.       They may     be  separated in three ways —            :
 (1) by applying to each hemisphere an opposite pulling-force
equal to 10 grammes per superficial centimetre              (2) ;    gentlyby
heating   the sphere  so  as  to restore to the  air       the
                                                           in   hundredth
                                                                it
of pressure which     itlacks  ; and (3)    byplacing the sphere under
the receiver of an air-pump and exhausting the air                 this rein
ceiver until the external pressure         isequal to or less than the
internal pressure.     In each of these three cases the hemispheres
               —
will separate in    the   first     by
                                    rending asunder (arrachement) or
overcoming the force of cohesion, in the second                      by
                                                                heat-fusion
(fusion calorifique) and in the third
                      ,                         by
                                                solution (dissolution) in
a fluid of equal pressure.
   That which we see take place with two hemispheres we may
obtain in the case of    cube formed of eight or twenty seven or
                           a
other number of little hollow spheres opening into one another
at their poles   by
                  holes whose edges are ground air-tight.      On
diminishing the interior pressure, which             by
                                             its equality with the
exterior pressure allows the spheres to move freely among one
another, and putting them into exact contact at the moment

             Dr. Guyot on     the Forms and Forces     of Matter.        415
when their interior pressure is diminished, they will adhere to
gether and present all the properties of a solid body.             Further,
if the little spheres were separated from one another by little
tubular washers of caoutchouc between their communicating ori
fices, and if half the air were taken out of the spheres either by
previous heating or by the air-pump, the imitation of the solid
body so resulting would present all the appearances of contrac
tion by cold, of expansion and fusion by heat ; all the phenomena
of extension by stretching or by rarefaction, of contraction by
external pressure, and all those of destruction by mechanical
 rending, or by solution in a rarefied medium.             Any instrument-
 maker could thus construct a solid body which would be elastic,
 expansible, dilatable, fusible, and soluble.
    The approximation of the atoms of bodies of ponderable
 matter may therefore be due to the rarefaction of the imponde
 rable fluid, and consequently to the diminution of its pressure
 in the space separating the atoms of the same body.                And this
 approximation will be greatest and strongest accordingly as the
 interior rarefaction is greater, the exterior pressure being in
 versely as the interior.        This hypothesis would be more than
 probable, it would be true, if it were shown that the vibration of
 the atoms of bodies may, and actually does, cause a rarefaction
 in the sphere of activity of each of the atoms.
     If this proof could be given, we should be obliged to admit
 that attraction is a mechanical force composed (1) of the rare
 faction of the sp.thcr in the interior of substances, of media, of
 heavenly bodies, brought about by the power of vibration of the
 atoms of ponderable matter ; (2) of the reaction of the pressure
 of the exterior sether upon substances, media and heavenly
 bodies — a reaction measured by the general tension of the im
 ponderable and incoercible fluid which constitutes the mother-
 liquor* of the world, the universal medium.
     To gain a rational idea of the phenomena which take place in
 the physical world inaccessible to our direct means of observa
 tion, we must have recourse to analogies, to examples found
 amongst the class of phenomena which are visible, which are
 appreciable.       I  therefore said to myself thirty-seven            years
 ago   : —
     If it be true that the atoms of ponderable matter on rapidly
  striking in their vibrations the setherial elastic medium in a
 state of tension in which they are plunged rarefy the aether
 around them and diminish its pressure in the spheres of their
 activity, and if this diminution of pressure results in the

attraction of other atoms, then it should also be true that a so
norous body acting on the air, on water, or other elastic medium
will rarefy the fluid which envelopes it and attract to its sur
face bodies suspended or floating within the sphere of its acti
vity. This question was neither proposed nor solved when                            I
published my Elements de Physique Generate. It was proposed
and solved in 1832 and 1835, at the date of publication of my
work on the movements of air and the pressure of moving air.
    In 1832, during more than six months of varied and conti
nuous experiments, the phenomenon refused to disclose itself
to me; but I was convinced of its existence, and I should never
have given up my search for it but with life.                     I
                                                           had vainly tried
the action of the tuning-fork upon all sorts of substances, when
a pharmacist drew my attention to the pith of the Sunflower
 (" grand soleil ") as a most light and bulky substance, and got me
some of it.     I made a little disk of this substance, which was
attracted by the fork. It was attracted in all directions, and by
all the faces of the vibrating instrument. It was even attracted
by a needle connected with and forming a continuation of one of
tbe prongs of the fork.         Once master of the fact at first nearly
imperceptible,    it was  not long before I reproduced it with ease and
made it as palpable as magnetic attraction.                       I
                                                          soon found that
in order to get a proper action it was sufficient to expose to the
vibrating surfaces a proportionally large surface in the pendulum
subject to the influence.          Rods, cups, cords, and plates in vi
bration attract, direct, or repel with the same appearances as
electrified bodies.      They act at a distance, and propagate their
action through space to all surrounding bodies like electricity,
heat, and light.
     Itake a tuning-fork and put it in vibration in the ordinary
manner, I bring it near to a disk of vegetable paper hung from
two silk threads without torsion.            The disk is then seen to ap
proach    the  surface    from   a  distance  of one or two centimetres,
to touch the surface and to vibrate with                   it,
                                                      and to detach itself
as soon as       contact the vibration of the instrument
                        by                                                is

If the vibrating surface be increased                    by

on to the external face of one of the prongs of the fork, the
effects are produced from            greater distance, the pendulum

moved and attracted                  by
                               the card, and remains in contact with
it for comparatively long time; and the distance of the attrac
tions         is a
           proportional to the squares of the attracting and attracted
surfaces*.
   On passing the bow across the edge of      cup or of    bell  a             a
of metal or glass, the same phenomena of attraction are shown
  *      It   is     to be regretted that this important point is stated with some am
biguity.       — F. G.

opposite to the centres of oscillation, as experiment proves.
But experiment also shows that no such attraction takes place
opposite the nodes.      There is therefore nothing in common be
tween the attractions of the segments of vibration and the nodal
lines traced out by light powders on plates, or exhibited by little
paper saddles on a stretched cord.       Electricity also has nothing
whatever to do with these attractions, because they occur in me
tallic vibrating bodies as well as in those of glass, in water as in
air. MM. Duloug and Savart, with whom I have repeated my
experiments, have, moreover, conclusively shown that neither
nodes of vibration nor electricity play any part in these attrac
tions by sonorous vibrations.
   In order better to fix the minds of my readers upon the true
action of solid vibrating bodies on the elastic fluids which touch
them,    I  pour some water into a bell-glass on a stem, and by
means of the bow     I extract the lowest sound which it can pro
duce, one sees distinctly four segments in vibration, and four
nodes which divide the liquid circle into four quarters.
   If  the bow be drawn gently along the edge of the vase without
the slightest deviation, the segments of vibration appear formed
of rays perpendicular to the surface of the glass, and which are
longer accordingly as they are nearer to the centre of this seg
ment.      They are also of a length proportional to the intensity
of the vibration.     If the bow varies in position, the rays cross
in all directions like the hatching of a drawing.          If the vibra
tion reach its maximum, the water is powdered and hovers in
the form of a mist above the liquid.         If the bell sounds the
higher octave, there are eight segments of vibration, smaller,
but presenting the same phenomena of radiation and projection
of the water. In both cases the water remains at rest at the nodes
and in the centre of the vase.
   This experiment proves that the vibrations of solid bodies
strike and forcibly disperse the elastic media in which they are
plunged, that they rarefy these media in their sphere of action,
and diminish their pressure more and more according to the
proximity to their surfaces.
    In order to show this fact still better,       I hang a gold coin
from two threads so that it cannot turn on its axis.           I plunge
it into the water opposite to a segment of vibration, at a
distance of one or two centimetres from the interior surface of
the vase, and on setting the vase in vibration by the bow, the
coin is brought into contact with the glass.         If the coin be op
posite to a node it is not attracted.
    I shall return later to these experiments, which I shall
complete by showing that vibrating cords attract at one end and
repel at the other, that a strip of paper hung in a bell always
 adjusts itself between two segments of vibration.         Any one can

repeat the experiments (which I indicate in my work on the
movements of air and the pressure of moving air), and will find
them correct.
                        I
    For the present content myself with having proved experi
mentally that a body vibrating in an elastic medium reacts upon
the medium in such a manner as to diminish its pressure at the
place of contact and at a distance, the consequence of which is
that bodies suspended in the medium and within the sphere of
activity of the vibrating body are brought to the surface of the
latter by exterior pressure, which overcomes the intermediate
pressure between the attracting and attracted body.
    That which occurs with vibrating bodies plunged in air ought
to, and really does, occur in the case of atoms of coercible and
ponderable matter plunged in sether, because no other explana
tion is possible of the phenomena of the formation of solid,
liquid, and gaseous bodies, and of their transformation one into
the other, of their elasticity, dilatability, solubility (affinities of
the tension of media and of heavenly bodies), of the weight of
bodies, of gravitation — in one word, of universal attraction, — and
because this explanation is in accordance with those phenomena
which we can see and measure.

    If the  action exerted upon one another by atoms at exceed
ingly small distances be admitted as comprehensible, we must
be prepared to admit the extension of the attractive or repulsive
force to masses at very great distances from one another.
The distant action of magnetism and electricity would then re
quire no special explanation, and is not necessarily a consequence
of the interposition of a connecting medium.               Nevertheless it
is possible that phenomena of attraction or repulsion at consi
derable distances might be occasioned by oscillations of asther
or air.
    Certain experiments which       I  performed last summer and first
communicated to Herr Professor Quincke appear to support
this supposition.         I brought the flame of a stearine candle
 almost into contact with a tuning-fork fastened horizontally.           As
soon as the fork was set in vibration, the flame was quite di
stinctly repelled as long as the fork vibrated.          When the flame
was placed beneath the fork, it was depressed and flattened out
into a disk.      Resonance-disks and organ-pipes in a vertical posi
tion exhibited similar phenomena.           A candle-flame at the mouth
of a sounding-box provided with a tuning-fork which made 512
single vibrations per second, was strongly and continuously re-

 pelled as long as the fork sounded.           When the fork sounded
loudly, the light was extinguished.            A gas-flame a centimetre
in length fed by a narrow glass tube, when placed at the open
 ing of the sounding-box, split up into two tongues.                 Smoke
rising from smoking candles was also repelled.
    My earliest experiments showed that pith-balls hung on
 threads were attracted both by sounding tuning-forks and by
 vertical resonant plates.      The above-mentioned sounding-box
 distinctly attracted and brought into contact with itself easily
 moveable    metallic sheets and balls, even such as weighed 120
 grammes and were at a distance of eight centimetres.
    I  communicated many of these experiments as early as the
 end of last Summer Session (zu Ende des vorigen Sommersemesters)
 to Herr Geheimrath Magnus, who made them known to the
 young physicists who were working with him. Herr Professor
 Poggendorff also saw some of these experiments at my house.
 It seems, however, that all tuning-forks have not equal power
 to produce these phenomena ; for when last autumn                I  wished
 to repeat the same experiments with other apparatus            I failed.
    Hitherto, in consequence of press of business,            I have been
 prevented   from   continuing my experiments.          Since, however,    I
 see, from No. 1 15 of the Proceedings of the Koyal Society of
London, that Mr. Guthrie has performed similar experiments,
I  feel induced to make this preliminary communication.

    1 ask permission    to communicate      the following experiments
to complete those described in a previous Number of these
Annals.     (See above.)
    Two glass flasks, each holding about 1 litre, were taken; a little
ammonia was poured into the one, and hydrochloric acid into the
other, so that their bottoms were covered to a depth of about two
centimetres.      Both flasks were provided with uoubly bored
corks.     Atmospheric air from a gasometer was led into the am
monia-flask through a tube passing through the cork and reach
ing nearly to the surface of the liquid.         Hence, through a con
necting-tube, the ammonia entered the second flask, formed a
cloud of sal-ammoniac which passed up a vertical tube having
an upper orifice of about 2 millimetres, and rose into the air in
a tine stream, 2 or 3 decimetres in height.            Near to the open
ing of the exit-tube was placed the mouth of the sounding-box
before described (see 1), the fork of which gave 512 single vi
brations per second.      When the rising gas-stream had a mode
rate (mittlere) velocity, it became divided as soon as the fork

  sounded, into two almost straight currents which diverged from
 one another at an angle of about 30°, and which lay in a ver
 tical plane perpendicular to the plane of the box's mouth. When
 the velocity is greater, the influence of the sonorous vibrations
 is still very perceptible, but the gas-stream does not appear so
 perfectly divided ; but when the sal-ammoniac rises very slowly,
 there is produced either only a very weak repulsion, or else the
 effect of the sonorous pulsations is not to be distinctly de
 tected at all.   If hydrogen, coal-gas, or carbonic acid instead of
 atmospheric air, be led into the ammonia, the appearance is not
 essentially modified.
   If   the sal-ammoniac be made to pass through a heated glass
 bulb before it rises, no effect of the heating is seen at first. If
 the bulb be heated too strongly, the air-current becomes invi
 sible on account of the sublimation of the sal-ammoniac.
    In order to be able to examine the effect of heat, I led a cur
 rent of atmospheric air over fuming nitric acid and allowed the
 gas to issue from a tube, upon the horizontal limb of which a
 bulb had been blown.       The rising stream of nitrous acid, like
that of sal-ammoniac, was also split into two parts, which were,
however, not so distinctly separated as in the latter case.          On
heating the glass bulb, the effect of     the  sound-vibrations   was no
 longer distinctly exhibited.      All these phenomena could be re
 cognized in the immediate neighbourhood of the sounding-box,
and also when the gas-stream rose at a distance of one or two
 decimetres, or even further from it.
    Besides the above-mentioned fork       I also made use of a second
 one, which gave 1024 single vibrations per second, and could be
 screwed on to a resonance-box.         A glass tube, 64 centims. long
 (that  is,about as long as    sonorous wave produced
                               a                         by   the fork),
was fastened horizontally.        If now the tuning-fork was set in
vibration at one end of the tube,      a light glass bulb (Glaskugel)
or disk was strongly attracted at the other end, and
   a                                                          a  candle-
flame as distinctly repelled.
    All these experiments, however, succeeded much better when
the larger fork was used, which made 512 vibrations per second.
    These and the previously mentioned phenomena were also
produced, although to      a less degree, when the tuning-fork was
 set in vibration  by   means of   a second fork in unison with it.
The actions were still visible when the distance between the
forks was metre.

experiments.        An ordinary small magnetic needle, carrying on
the one pole a paper disk of 4 centimetres diameter and on the
other a small wax ball as counterpoise, is distinctly attracted by
a vibrating tuning-fork from a distance of more than 1 deci
metre.
    The effect of sound-vibrations may be also detected on light
and even somewhat heavy pendula.                 A ball weighing 3 kilo
grammes hanging from a thread 2 metres in length could be
set in visible vibration when the fork was stroked with the bow
always isochronously         with the pendulum's vibration.            It was
even possible in this manner to set in vibration an iron disk
weighing 10 kilogrammes which could swing on a string 3 metres
long fastened to an iron beam in the wall.
    Quite recent experiments of mine have thrown somewhat
more light on these phenomena.            Two sheets of thin plate glass,
2 centims. long and 15 centims. broad, were fastened on to two
stands and brought into the same vertical plane, so that a ver
tical slit 15 millims. wide was left between them.              At a distance
of 1 decimetre from the sheets of glass was placed the above-
mentioned sounding-box with the plane of its mouth parallel to
the sheets.      If now a candle-flame was placed very near to the
slit, between    the  slit and the box, it was as strongly attracted
(drawn away from the slit) as it would otherwise have been re
pelled.     If, however, the flame was placed on the other side of
the box* rather near to the slit, it was repelled so as to be
driven away again from the slit.            This experiment explains at
once the phenomenon presented by the current of sal-ammoniac.
The rising column of vapour represents the slit, and the sur
rounding air corresponds with the rigid glass plate.               Hence the
stream is divided into two divergent branches as above de
scribed.     It was to be expected that solid bodies might also in
the same way be repelled by the sonorous vibrations in place of
being attracted, as hitherto exclusively observed.              In fact strips
of stout cardboard, 15 millims. broad and 50 millims. long, are
strongly repelled when they are placed at a distance of 5 to 8
millims. from the slit, between the plates and the box. Placed
on the other side of the slit, they are attracted.            The cardboard
strips, therefore, approach the slit in both cases.
    By the help of such a slit, which may be made by employing
tinplate strips, the attractions and repulsions caused by sonorous
vibrations may be produced at distances far greater than those
hitherto noticed.        They depend chiefly on differences in the.

slit away from the box. — F. G.

densities and tensions of the masses of air upon which the vi
brations act.    When such differences exist only to a small de
 gree (as, for instance, is the case with a very slowly ascending
column of sal-ammoniac or of phosphorous acid rising from a
fragment of phosphorus), the action of the sound- vibration is not
 sensible; it is just possible to perceive that, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the phosphorus, a thicker mass of phosphorous
acid is developed at every beat of the tuning-fork.
      I
      am not at present able further to pursue these experiments,
 which may be extended greatly ; and I should be very glad if
they were taken up by those physicists who have chiefly occu
pied themselves with acoustic investigations.
    In conclusion,    I  must mention that as early as 1834 M.
Guyot noticed the attraction which light bodies suffer from a
vibrating tuning-fork.        He adds that this action extends to a
distance of 9 lines.      These observations are quite similar to
those subsequently made by Mr. Guthrie*.          Although a short
notice of M. Guyot's experiments is to be found in Fogg. Ann.
vol. xxxi. p. 640, 1 was not aware that such was the case till my at
tention was directed to it by othersf.      M. Guyot, in the Presse
Scientifique, 1861,   torn. iii. pp. 246-257, attaches very general
theoretical reflections to his experiments, without, however, addu
cing new experiments upon which to base them.
    My readers are already aware that Mr. Tyndall has already
made use of ammonia gas in his beautiful experiments on sen

   In order to establish this theorem experimentally, a small bal

atmospheric air and bung on a thread.      A second similar bal
loon filled with hydrogen was fastened by means of a thread to
a table so as to hinder it from rising.   As soon as the above-

over, be performed with a glass bell-jar such as is commonly
used for domestic purposes, and with an ordinary easily move-

going by an electric current, shows the attraction of a strip of
paper in a very regular manner ; so that when the machine has

 with the bell.

   DEAR SIR, — I have to-day received the ' Proceedings of the
                 '
Royal Society containing your paper
                                         " On Approach caused by
Vibration," which I have read with great interest.      The expe
riments you describe constitute very beautiful illustrations of the
established theorem for fluid pressure in abstract hydrokinetics,
                I
 with which have been much occupied in mathematical investi
gations connected with vortex-motion.
   According to this theorem, the average pressure at any point
of an incompressible frictionless fluid originally at rest, but set
in motion and kept in motion by solids moving to and fro, or
 whirling round in any manner, through a finite space of
                                                                            it,

 equal to  a constant diminished              by
                                       the product of the density
into half the square of  the velocity.   This immediately explains
 the attractions demonstrated in your experiments       for in each

 obviously the card must be attracted         the fork as you have

that the square of the average velocity must be greater on the
surfaces of the tuning-fork next to the card than on the remote
portions of the vibrating surface. Your theoretical observa
tion, however, that the attraction must be mutual, is beyond
doubt valid, as we may convince ourselves by imagining the
stand which bears the tuning-fork and the card to be perfectly
free to move through the fluid.        If the card were attracted to
wards the tuning-fork, and there were not an equal and oppo
site force on the remainder of the whole surface of the tuning-
fork and support, the whole system would commence moving,
 and continue moving with an accelerated velocity in the direc
tion of the force acting on the card — an impossible result.       It
might, indeed, be argued that this result is not impossible, as it
might be said that the kinetic energy of the vibrations could
gradually transform itself into kinetic energy of the solid mass
 moving through the fluid, and of the fluid escaping before and
                                        "
 closing up behind the solid. But common sense" almost suf
 fices to put down such an argument, and elementary mathema
 tical theory, especially the theory of momentum in hydro-
 kinetics explained in my article on "Vortex-motion,"           nega
tives it.
      The law of the attraction which you observed agrees perfectly
 with the law of magnetic attraction in a certain ideal case which
 may be fully specified by the application of a principle explained
 in a short article communicated to the Royal Society of Edin
 burgh in February last, as an abstract of an intended continua
  tion of my paper on " Vortex-motion."        Thus, if we take as an
  ideal tuning-fork two globes or disks moving rapidly to and fro
  in the line joining their centres, the corresponding magnet will
  be a bar with poles of the same name as its two ends and a
  double opposite pole in its middle.        Again, the analogue of
  your paper    disk is an  equal and similar diamagnetic of infinite
  diamagnetic inductive capacity.      The mutual force between the
  magnet and the diamagnetic will be equal and opposite to the
  corresponding hydrokinetic force at each instant. To apply the
  analogy, we must suppose the magnet to gradually vary from
  maximum magnetization to zero, then through an equal and op
  posite magnetization      back through zero to the primitive mag
  netization, and so on periodically.     The resultant of fluid pres
   sure on the disk is not at each instant equal and opposite to the
   magnetic force at the corresponding instant, but the average re
   sultant of the fluid pressure is equal to the average resultant of
   the magnetic force.     Inasmuch as the force on the diamagnetic
   is generally repulsion'ifrom the magnet, however the magnet be
   held, and is unaltered in amount by the reversal of the magnet
  ization, it follows that the average resultant of the fluid pressure

       Sir W. Thomson          on   Approach     caused by    Vibration.            425
is an attraction on the whole towards the tuning-fork, into what
ever position the tuning-fork be turned relatively to it.
    Your seventh experiment* has interested me even more than
 any of the others.     It illustrates the elementary law of pres
sure in hydrokinetics, not by showing effects of fluid pressure
on portions of a solid bounding surface, as all other illustrative
experiments hitherto known to me have done, but by showing
an effect of diminished fluid pressure throughout more rapidly
moving portions of the finite mass of the fluid itself.            This
effect consists of a slight degree of expansion, depending       on the
air not being perfectly incompressible.         The volume occupied
by the more rapidly moving portions becoming slightly aug
mented, the remainder of the fluid would be condensed were the
whole contained within an altogether fixed boundary.          A move-
able portion of this boundary (that          is,
                                             the surface of the liquid
in your tube) yields and shows to the eye the effect of the dimi
nished pressure through the rapidly moving portions.

      DEAR    SIR, —The   repulsion of a hydrogen balloon observed by
 Shellbach, of which you tell me in your letter of the 16th inst.,
 is temptingly suggestive of the conclusion you tell me he has
 drawn, that there is attraction or repulsion accordingly as the
 density of the interior gas is greater or less than that of the
  surrounding air. There are, no doubt, curiously close analo
 gies between some of the circumstances of motion in contiguous
  fluids of different densities and the distribution of magnetic
  force in a field occupied by substances of different inductive ca
  pacities.     Thus, if in a great space occupied by frictionless in
  compressible liquid denser in some portions than in others, a
  solid be suddenly set in motion, the lines of the fluid motion
  first generated agree perfectly with the permanent lines of mag
  netic force in a correspondingly heterogeneous medium under
  the influence of a bar-magnet, to be substituted for the move-
  able solid and placed with its magnetic axis in the line of the
  solid's motion.      As to amounts, the fluid velocity multiplied
  into the density is simply equal to the resultant magnetic
  force at each point, if the particular definition of resultant
   magnetic force in a medium of heterogeneous inductive capa
   city, given in the footnote to § 48 of my paper on the
                                                                      " Ma
   thematical Theory of Magnetism"*, be adopted.               But here the
   analogy    ends ; the  rigidity  in  virtue of which  a  solid moveable
   in a fluid medium differing from it in magnetic inductive capa
   city keeps its form, does not exist in the hydrokinetic analogue.
   If  a quasi-rigidity be given to a globe of lighter fluid, as a hy
   drogen soap-bubble, by the tension of a containing film, or to a
   hydrogen balloon by the stiffness and tension of the containing
   membrane, the circumstances become so complex that no general
   dictum can be readily pronounced regarding the resulting force
   from the abstract dynamical theory.            It is certain that if the
   tension of the containing film were sufficiently great even with
   out rigidity, or if the containing membrane were sufficiently
   stiff by rigidity, as a thin shell of solid, the balloon would be
   attracted as a perfectly rigid globe quite irrespectively of the
   density of its contents.
       But it seems, from Shellbach's results, that the membrane of
   the hydrogen balloon may have stiffness enough to keep the
   figure very approximately spherical, but yet not too much to
   allow the smaller density within to exercise its influence and to
  give attf action instead of repulsion f.         The question is highly

     DEAR SIR, — My letter to you of yesterday requires some limi
tation.
    Even a perfectly rigid solid less dense than the surrounding
medium must, if small enough, exhibit the repulsion which you
tell me Shellbach has observed for balloons of hydrogen.         On
the other hand, if large enough, it is clear that, as I said yester
day, a rigid solid must exhibit attraction ; for if very large
relatively to the vibration, it cannot move sensibly as a whole to
and fro with each vibration. Now, if the rigid body is held ab
solutely fixed, it follows from your own experiments and reason
ing, as well as from the mathematical theory, that the vibrator
will experience attraction, irrespectively of the density of the
fixed rigid solid ; and therefore when the vibrator is attached to
a fixed stand and the rigid solid left free to move, the latter, if
large enough, must experience repulsion.          Consider, first, any
very   small portion   of the fluid  moving    to and fro in virtue of
the periodic motion sustained throughout the fluid by the vi
brator.    Let it be so small in all its dimensions that it experi
ences no sensible change of shape during its period of motion.
If  this portion becomes rigid its rigidity will but infinitesimally
affect its own motion and that of the fluid surrounding it.         If,
now, by a proper application of force varying periodically ac
cording to the simple harmonic law, the little solid be caused to
move to and fro faster than the neighbouring fluid or slower
than the neighbouring fluid, it will require a certain constant
average force to prevent its mean position from yielding in a
certain direction from or towards regions of greater fluid motion.
When the superimposed vibration augments the natural vibra
tion of the solid, the direction in which it tends to move is from
regions of greater towards regions of less fluid vibration; in
 the other case the contrary.       Lastly, the imagined differential
vibration becomes a reality if the density of the little solid is
either greater or less than that of the fluid.        When it is less
than that of the fluid, the differential motion augments the vi
bration j when the density is greater, the differential motion
diminishes the vibration. Hence an infinitesimal solid of dif
ferent density from the surrounding fluid tends towards the re-

 small that there   is  no sensible disturbance of the fluid in the
 neighbourhood of the free sphere due to the influence of this
body itself reflected back to the vibrator.        When the density of
 the free sphere differs from that of the liquid,       suppose there to

of thread properly applied to support the body or to prevent
     a
it  from rising, as the case may be, in general without sensibly
interfering* with the to-and-fro motion of the sphere.                   The
range of the vibration may be of any magnitude relatively to its
own diameter, but must be small relatively to the distance of the
nearest point of the free globe.             very simple application of

less than that of the fluid,          repelled or attracted, according
                                       it   is

               PART    III.   The Barometric Depression in Storms.
               years ago Admiral Fitzroy pointed out that storms
 MANY

 ordinary   and  regular   movements    of the atmosphere, and that,

 430        Mr.   J. K. Laugh ton  on Barometric Differences
 can alone make us satisfactorily acquainted with.       Independent
 of the great weight due to Admiral Fitzroy's opinion, there are
 many considerations which appear to sanction this view to the
 fullest extent, and to render it imperative that a correct know
 ledge of the seasons, the directions, and the characteristics of the
 prevailing winds in the different parts of the world should form
 the basis of any inquiry into the origin of storms : it is their ex
ceptional nature which has to be inquired into ; and the regular
course to which they are exceptions must first be clearly under
stood.     Meteorologists have, as a body, ignored this necessity,
 and, in treating of storms, have affected to consider the air as in
a state of rest, and disturbed from that state by the sudden de
velopment of some agency which destroys the hydrostatic equi
librium.      But, in point of fact, the normal condition of the air
is not one of hydrostatic      equilibrium : in almost every part of
the world, and at every season, some particular wind has a de
cided predominance        over every other; and wherever storms
occur, they follow the course of the prevailing wind of the loca
lity and season. The exceptions to this rule are extremely rare ;
and admitting that storms are most commonly of the nature of
cyclones,   I  can see in the law which directs their track no dif
ference from that which directs the onward motion of the angry
eddies which form in a rapid stream.        And in the same way as
such whirls generally form in particular places, where we can
often point out the cause of the irregularity (as, for instance,
where another stream shoots in its waters across the course of
the main current, or where a boulder or some partial obstruction
breaks the evenness of the flow), so also do storms form most
frequently in special localities, in almost every one of which we
can point distinctly to the near approach of intrusive currents,
or to the headlands, islands, and opposing shores round and
against which the wind fumes and rages. Whether we consider
the tropical Hurricanes (taking their rise on the equatorial mar
gin of the Trade- Winds or in the conflict of changing Monsoons),
the storms of the North Atlantic (where the northerly gales from
the coasts of Greenland are driven into the body of the west
wind), the storms off Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope
(the Cape of Storms), or even those off Cape deGata, or Cape Ma-
tapan (famous in story), off Bermuda with its countless number
of islands, or the Abrolhos, or the Low Archipelago, or in any
other locality where storms are notoriously frequent and violent,
— we find everywhere, or with very few exceptions, some marked
feature, either of the prevailing wind in the stormy season, or in
the geographical peculiarities of the land, which seems directly to
associate itself with the irregularities in the aerial current.
    It is this geographical distribution which leads me forcibly to

                                 and Fluctuations.                                       431
the conclusion that storms are due in great measure to the geo
graphical conditions under which they occur, and that, though
possibly originated by meteorological              disturbances,      the part
played by these must         be   comparatively trifling,     since   in other
localities, where similar disturbances must frequently occur,
they do not give rise to similar storms.
   If,   then, storms of     acyclonic nature (and              to these only
                                                                     it   is
that  I   here refer) are caused        the mechanical clashing of atmo
                                           by
 spheric currents either against each other or against more mate
 rial obstacles,   it   isevident that the remarkable barometric de
                                                                                     by by

                                   in the first instance, occasioned         the
 force of the whirl, and that the whirl              not occasioned          the
 barometric depression.        This, however,          is is
                                                     contrary to the opinion
 now in favour with many meteorologists, who maintain that the
 barometric depression       isfirst formed, and that the 'storm, or the
 rush of air towards the area of minimum pressure,                     more or  is
 less violent according to the extent to which the pressure has
 been reduced.       That there          very intimate connexion between
                                        is   a
 the violence of the storm and the depression of the barometer
  would seem to be certainly established              but they are so mixed

  up one with the other, each operating on and increasing the
  other, that it   isdifficult to assign to each its exact value as agent
  and as patient.     But this not what
                                      is          meant

              Mr.     J. K.        Laughton on Barometric Differences
it is asserted that, by reason of the comparative vacuum formed
high overhead, the air rushing in forms an ascending current,
the centre of depression becomes a species of chimney up which
the air is carried with great velocity, and that this ascensional
motion accounts for the full extent of the loss of pressure.   But
any ascending    current  so formed is due directly to the conden
 sation, and must occur wherever condensation is excessive ; any
 depression of the barometer caused by it is essentially a compo
 nent part of the depression caused by heavy rain, and cannot be
 separated from it in any observations.     Since, however, consider
 able stress has been laid on the influence of this ascensional
 motion, it is worth while to inquire into how far it really exists,
 and what effect it is really capable of producing on the barometer.
    It has always been a favourite opinion amongst meteorologists
 that the ventilation of coal-mines by means of furnaces offers a
 convenient and apt illustration of the movements, and the causes
 and effects of the movements, of the atmosphere.       The correct
 ness of this opinion               is,
                                think,Imore   than  doubtful      have               :I
 already called attention to the fact that the differences of tempe
rature produced in the furnace method of ventilation are, beyond
 all legitimate comparison, greater than any that occur in nature;
 and not only these excessive differences of temperature, but also
the friction of the currents of air driven at          high velocity     a
through narrow and winding passages, or what              technically          is
 called " the drag of the air," produce        very marked   effect on

be eliminated before we can tell how much of any registered
difference between the air of the upcast and downcast shafts                                    is
due to the ascending or descending motion of the current. Cap

    Of these, Lady pit shows a difference of '025 ; when the Foul-
ford observations are reduced by the correction for 9 feet, they
show a difference of '026; and at pit No. 21, where the top of
the upcast shaft is 36 feet higher than that of the downcast, so
that a correction for 42 feet has to be applied, there is a differ
ence of -014.
    These observations are quite in accord with those of Captain
Toynbee, and show beyond question a certain small relative de
pression in the upcast shaft which might at first sight be attri
buted to the upward motion, as opposed to the downward.                  But
we must not forget that between the columns of air in the two
shafts there is a very great difference of temperature and of
weight ; the elastic force derived from the pressure of this weight
 is therefore less in the upcast than in the downcast ; and before
 we can properly assign the observed barometric difference to the
 difference of motion, we must show that it is independent of the
 difference of weight.                                              I

     Killingworth pit, in which these observations were made, had
  the upcast and downcast in the same shaft, separated from each
  other by an air-tight wooden partition or brattice ; in this, at
  the several heights, holes were bored, through which one leg of
  the water-gauge (a U-shaped glass tube) could be passed.                 So
  taken, and with an instrument so delicate, they show very clearly
  that the force of the currents has very little, if any thing, to do

434         Mr.   J. K.     Laughton   on Barometric          Differences
with the difference in pressure which is registered.  If a certain
number of cubic feet of air are each minute driven up one shaft
or down another, the velocity of the ascending or descending
current must be approximately the same throughout the shaft at
all depths, and the influence which the motion exercises on the
barometer or gauge must be constant.       That the observed dif
ference, far from being constant, increases as the depth increases,
shows at once that it is not to the motion that we must look for
its cause, but rather to the difference of the weight of the columns
of air.   But the difference shown by the gauge is much less
than what is due to the difference of weight at the several depths,
calculated for the mean temperatures: near the top this is partly
to be accounted for by the temperature of the upcast being lower
than the mean, and the remaining portion of the column being
thus heavier than is calculated ; but near the bottom, where the
temperature is higher than the mean, it would seem that expan
sion does not take place quickly enough to balance the increase
of elastic force caused by the heat. A large part of the pressure
due to the difference of weight is absorbed by the " drag of the
air;" it is the remainder only which forces the heated air up the
shaft ; and the velocity is thus much less than what is properly
due to the difference of temperature.       It          is,
                                                  however, impossible
to say how much of the relative increase of elasticity           due to     is
heat, how much to mechanical compression            but near the top of
                                                          ;
the shaft, where the weights of the columns become the same
and the compression ceases, though the velocity remains neces
sarily unchanged, the gauge no longer shows any difference.
      appears to me, therefore, that, so far as we can apply the
     It
circumstances of coal-pit ventilation, there         absolutely no evi
                                                              is
dence whatever that any diminution of barometric pressure
caused    byan ascending current, or, conversely, any increase                       by is
a  descending one.     The belief in such an effect appears, in fact,
to be due to the confusion between weight and elastic force,
already spoken of for where such
                        j                  confusion of idea exists,

is natural to suppose that an ascending weight will exert           less         a
pressure  than    stationary
                  a          or    descending
                                      a         one.
   But even we were to admit that barometric difference may

Buchan conceives that in cyclone the air rushing towards the

space along its entire circumference.      In violent cyclones the
maximum velocity of the wind is estimated as certainly not less
than 120 miles an hour, and is probably a good deal more. The
height to which the storm extends is absolutely unknown; Cap
tain Maury has estimated the height of the Trade- Winds as about
three miles ; I should be inclined to agree with Redfield, that
one mile is probably the extreme height of a cyclone.           then,           If,
the diameter of the central space be 12 miles, the quantity of air
thatis  poured in in the course of an hour      TT   12 x 120 cubic

miles, which, disappearing upwards from an area of w x 36 square
miles, gives us an ascensional velocity of 40 miles an hour —
that    is,
          of 66 feet    second.
                           a     Even then,     we were to suppose
                                                         if
that the greatest difference observed at Killingworth, which                            is
equivalent to     barometric depression of '06 of an inch, corre
                   a
sponds   to the aggregate velocity of 46 feet      second, and that
                                                             a
the depression increases      proportion to the velocity, we should
                                in
still have no more than *09 of an inch as the measure of that
component of the depression in the centre of           cyclone which

could be attributed to this cause.    But such supposition would

5  feet a  second, or even 10, may perhaps be admitted            and          ;        if,
for the sake of the argument, we were to allow that the upper
difference observed at Killingworth, or '10 of an inch of the
water-gauge, denotes the depression caused                velocity of 46
                                                                  by   a

the latus rectum of which is                  -~, and that, by the ordinary equa

point or vertex, below any other point whose distance from the
axis of rotation is r,
or   if   v be the linear velocity of the point                (r,   d),

to apply with correctness to the motion of the air in cyclones                              ;
for since the air rotates independently and grinds on all sides,
whether against the surface of the earth or non-rotating air, the
friction must effect very great changes; the linear velocity, in
stead of increasing as the point recedes from the centre, dimi
nishes    ;and the velocity at the surface, which we can observe,
is  very much less than          at some considerable height, though
                                    it   is
we have very scanty means of ascertaining what the difference
may be.       The balloon which landed near Christiania on the
25th of    last  November, travelled from Paris at the rate of from
40 to 45 miles an hour, whilst the wind below had           velocity of      a
not more than 20. The differences noted                          by

have been observed, not only in cyclones, but in comparatively
moderate storms — as, for instance, in that which will be so
sadly remembered as
                          " the Captain's gale," off Cape Finisterre,
on the 7th of last September, when, about lh 30m A.M., the
wind, having a force 9 on the Beaufort scale, corresponding to
a velocity of about 60 miles, suddenly shifted from S.S.W. to
N.N.W., the barometer at the time standing at 29-32, thus
showing a depression of '68 of an inch. But though such an
agreement is far closer than could have been anticipated, and
seems to leave little room for doubt that it indicates this centri
fugal tendency as the first cause of the depression,         I  would not
be understood to imply that the whole depression is due to it.
Twice the greatest observed velocity is probably an exaggerated
estimate : and a considerable reduction may readily be allowed,
since to whatever depression is produced by the centrifugal ino-

    It is very commonly objected to the view which have here                        I
formed of the effect of centrifugal motion, that if the depression
were so caused, the tendency of the air being to               outwards,            fly
the wind would necessarily tend outwards, whilst           careful  obser
vation shows that in such storms the wind, on the contrary,
tends inwards*.        That the wind does frequently tend inwards                                    is

 travelling (towards the W.N.W. or W.S.W.) at right angles, or
 nearly at right angles, to the course of the Trade- Winds, and
 have therefore insisted on the necessity of some cause for the
 progression    quite independent      of the prevailing wind and        ;
 though     no such   cause   has  been  suggested as accounting for
 this imaginary movement of tropical hurricanes athwart the

  storm, in the tropics as well as outside, the wind on the eastern
  side is equatorial, is warmer and more humid than the polar
  air on the western side; and the amount of rain in a storm
  within the tropics is almost beyond comparison greater than
  that in a storm of higher latitudes.       If the difference of tem
 perature   and  the  condensation   on  the  eastern side of the area
 of least pressure could occasion the movement towards the east
 in temperate or high latitudes, much more could they do so in
 low.    But Mr. Buchan conceives that if the progressive move
 ment of a storm were due to the direction of a ruling wind, the
 velocity of the storm-wind would be greatly modified in the
 different quarters of the revolution — and that whilst              the        (if
 storm were moving towards the east)           would be very much in
                                                 it
 creased on the south side of the centre of depression,           would,   it
 on the contrary, be very much diminished on the north side.
 To illustrate this, he supposes an extreme case of            storm ina
 which the velocity of the wind        twenty-five miles an hour, and
                                          is
 its rate of progression towards the east the same           and argues
                                                                   ;
 that there would be an absolute calm at any place on the north

 personally affect, to speak of         wind of twenty-five miles an

the rate of twenty or thirty miles an hour, may very well appear
on its northern side as     a wind of thirty or forty miles an hour,
and on its southern side as         storm of seventy, eighty, or even
                                    a

tions.    In both hemispheres the normal west wind blows in ac
cordance with this law ; and the low barometer to the left or
right, as the case may be, does not necessarily imply an inde
pendent rotatory motion of the air.       In the same way the Trade-
Winds of the Atlantic pass by the low pressure of the Doldrums
according to the law, but without inclining towards or circling
round it ; and though it would seem highly probable that this
low pressure adds strength to the Trades in some parts of the
ocean, it evidently does not produce any tendency to that cen
tripetal movement the theory of which is now so much in
favour.    As      I
                  believe that the whirls of air, when they do occur,
are due mainly to geographical peculiarities, in which          would            I
include the characteristics of the prevailing winds, so also I be
lieve that the direction in which the whirl turns is guided
entirely by the geographical conditions under which it is formed ;
but the discussion of this point is foreign to my present sub
ject. It     is,
               however, worth noticing that        in any part of the

must be borne in mind that        the place of relative low pressure
                                             if

ciples of fluids in motion,but that, when once formed, the as
cending current, supplied by the vorticose movement due to
the action of the centrifugal tendency in a confined space, gives
rise to such excessive condensation that the depression of the
barometer near the centre is very much increased, and most so
within the tropics, where the absolute quantity and elastic force
of vapour in the air are greatest.        This increase of depression
increases the force of the wind, which again increases the de
pression, the velocity of the ascending current, and the con
densation.     The various agencies thus continue to act and react
on each other, so that it is impossible to separate the effects
 of each ; but as the whirl is commenced and the centre of low
pressure first formed by mechanical action, it is to it that I at
tribute the origin of the storm.       Without the mechanical action
 such storms never occur, notwithstanding even excessive disturb
 ances in the thermometric or hygrometric conditions of the atmo-r
 sphere ; and, on the other hand, gentler whirls and barometric
 disturbances within considerable limits frequently do occur with-
 out any corresponding manifestation of meteorological changes.
    But this conclusion     is,in its essential points, the same as
 that at which we previously arrived (namely, that differences of
 barometric pressure are in many instances caused           by
                                                             the winds)   ,
 and justifies us .in saying that the meteorological axiom, that
 all winds are caused       by  differences of barometric pressure,
 although presumably true on hydrostatic principles,            not sup
                                                                 is
 ported,  and is frequently  contradicted,  by  positive evidence.
    The prevailing winds of different localities, which thus, regu
 larly or irregularly, produce many of the barometric variations,
 may be traced, more or less distinctly, to their geographical
 causes, as deflections of the great westerly wind which we find
 ruling at the surface of the earth in temperate latitudes, and
 which, from extreme north to extreme south, so far as our expe
 rience extends,   is permanent in the upper regions of the atmo
 sphere*.     But  the origin of this westerly wind    is obscure.   Re
  cent observations seem to point towards the conclusion that
 the sun's atmosphere has     a general movement from west to east,
 independent of, and additional to his proper movement of ro
 tation, and almost exactly similar to that which,          itappears to
 me, affects our own.      If this confirmed,
                                   is             it   is at least   stri

 king coincidence, and would seem to lend         a    very  strong sup
 port to the various other reasons for believing that this domi
 nant motion of our atmosphere       is  due to cosmical forces.

    the Density of Solids and Liquids by direct reading.    By Pro-

            degree of delicacy of a balance depends on the weight
THE      of the arm m, the distance d of its centre of gravity from
the axis of suspension, and finally on the length of the arm /.
If p is a weight on one scale and u is the angle of deflection, then
                                        pi
                              tan?*=    *-f

    If the  balance be so arranged that the constant
then
     The tangent of the angle of deflection is equal to the weight p.
 If  by means of a hook and a fine platinum wire there be sus
 pended to one arm of the balance a small glass rod which dips
 in a liquid, for instance the specifically lightest sulphuric ether
 (of O736 spec. grav. at 0°), and if to the other end of the beam
 a small brass weight be hung and so arranged that the index
                                                    .....
 stands at zero, we have as the equation for the angle of deflection,
                                               ,                   (1)
 where p is the weight of the brass weight, x the weight of the
 glass rod, y0 its loss of weight in the ether.
     As the angle will then be zero, it follows that
                             0=p— x + y0,
                             p=x—y0.
 Immersed in another liquid of greater specific gravity, the loss of
 weight y must be greater, and the index will give an angle u ;
                                                    .....

     The loss of weight may be supposed to consist of two parts
 namely, the loss of weight in ether, plus the excess of loss       of
 weight y, in the denser fluid — from which is obtained

   We obtain from this     .

and
Now    if
then
   But the losses of weight     are the weights of equal volumes v of
sulphuric  ether  and of  a  denser  liquid ; and therefore
                         tan«=t>(s— s0),
in which  s0 and s are the specific gravities of the two liquids.
   If the volume is equal to the unit of volume, we obtain
                         tanw=s— *0,
and finally
                         s=s0+ tanw;
for which, mating the above supposition,         and designating  the
densities by d0 and d, we may write
                             d=d0+ tana.
    The tangent-balance (PI. VI.) gives the density without using
sets of weights, by merely reading the angle at the index of the
balance, which plays on a circular limb 5 inches in length and
divided into half degrees, the centre of which is in the axis of
rotation of the beam.
    The beam is provided with an adjustment, by means of which
it may be raised and lowered so as to immerse the glass rod
suitably.
    The liquid is placed in    a small beaker, which need not hold
more than 2 or 3 cubic centims., so that a minimum of liquid
 can be used with entire certainty. The delicacy of the balance
is such that a deflection of 1° indicates a weight of 17 milli
 grammes ; and as the division extends to half degrees, and one
 tenth of a division may be estimated, it is possible to read
to the twentieth of a degree; so that the balance indicates
0-8 millignn.
    The density of a liquid, measured by the tangent-balance, is
 found by adding to the density of ether, or of any other liquid
 which corresponds to the zero of the division, the natural tan
 gent of the angle of deflection which the index gives when the

             Prof.   K. W.  Zenger on the Tangent-balance.         445
glass rod is immersed in a denser liquid than the normal        liquid
 (sulphuric ether) .
    If this liquid, for instance, is concentrated      sulphuric acid,
and the angle of deflection 48°, the density is
          d= 0-736+ tan 48° = 0-736 + 1-1106= 1-8466.
    For solids a double pan is provided ; the lower is immersed in
 water by depressing the beam ; the upper one is loaded with
 pieces of the solid until the index stands at zero; thereupon the
 solid is placed upon the lower pan under water.       If the angle of
deflection of the unloaded beam is u, while M, is the angle which
the index gives when the solid is on the lower pan under water,
then the density
                                 . tan M

                                   tan MJ
taking the density of water as unity.
     Unloaded, the tangent-balance gives an angle u=19°; gar
nets are added until the index shows zero ; and these are then
placed on the pan which is under water, when the index gives the
angle M[ = 10°; the density is therefore
                            tan 19°     0-3443
                                      ~
                            tan 10°     0-1 763'
 for which we may write
            d= tan 19° cot 100=0'3443 x 5-6713,
            d= 3-4697.
The pyknometer gave d= 3-470.
    For higher specific gravities this method becomes inaccurate ;
and therefore a load is placed upon one pan, which places the
index at 45° to 50° when the lower pan is dipped in water; a
 piece of the body is laid upon the upper pan and the angle M
 noted; the piece is next brought under the liquid and the angle ul
noted ; if u0 is the angle for the unloaded balance, we have
for the density
                                      —
                         ~_    tan M0   tanuj

                                      — tan u
    Thus, with an angle of 45° for the unloaded balance, three
garnets upon the upper pan gave w = 4C 107, and upon the
lower one 1^ = 41° 25'; hence the density is

LVIII.     On   the Scattering   of Light by small Particles. By       the
    Hon.  J.  W. STRUTT, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge*.
           investigation of the diffraction of light by small par
 THEticles,     contained in the February Number of this Maga
zine, proceeds throughout on the assumption that the difference
between two media which differ in refractive power is a difference
of density and not a difference of rigidity.          My object in the
present communication is to attack the problem more generally,
and to show that the more special hypothesis is in no degree
arbitrary, but forced upon us by the phenomena themselves.
The words " density," " rigidity
                                        "  need not be interpreted lite
rally, but are used in a generalized      sense analogous   to that given
to "velocity" and "force" in the higher mechanics.
   The first step is to find the equation of motion of an isotropic
elastic medium whose density and rigidity may vary from point
to point. If D denote the density and n the rigidity, a process
 similar to that used in Thomson and Tail's • Natural Philosophy,'
p. 530, leads us to the following : —

    These are the component rotations.              The resultant in the
general case would be rather complicated, and is not wanted for
our purpose.     It is easily seen to be about an axis perpendicular
to the scattered ray, inasmuch as

    Here we have reached       a   result of some importance and one
 which can be confronted with fact.            For from the value of w it
 appears that there is no direction in the plane perpendicular to
 an incident ray of polarized light in which the scattered light
 vanishes, if An and AD be both finite.             Now experiment tells
 us plainly that there is such a direction, and therefore we may
 infer with certainty that either An or AD vanishes.            So far we
 have a choice between two suppositions; either we may assume,
 as in my former paper, that there is no difference of rigidity be
 tween one medium and another, and that the vibrations of light
 are normal to the plane of polarization, or, on the other hand,
 that there is no difference of density between media, and then
 the vibrations must be supposed to be in the plane of polarization.
 The former view is the one adopted by Green and (virtually) by
 Cauchy in their theories of reflection ; while the latter is that of
  MacCullagh and Neumann, which I now proceed to show is
  untenable.
     Suppose then that AD = 0.          Reverting to the general values

are 1*5 and V33, and terms depending on the square of An
must be comparatively small.          Yet   could find no indication of

                            I
accordingly conclude that the hypothesis of constant density      a
and variable rigidity must be rejected.         The only alternative                is
to suppose, as in the February Number, that the aether preserves
its statical properties unchanged when associated with matter,
whose effect      therefore merely to increase the inertia of the
                        is                                                          vi
brating parts               in
                    greater or less degree.
    It may be worth notice that, according to the theory here
combated, there would be two polarizing-angles, of 22£° and 67£°
respectively, when light vibrating in the plane of incidence         re        is
flected from the boundary of two media which differ but little
in refrangibility, as may be seen from the reasoning of this paper
 by  remembering that the square of An may be neglected.                            I
need scarcely say that in such            case the polarising angle
                                                     a                              is
really   45°, and  that  the  reflected light does not tend to vanish
at the two first-mentioned incidences, whichever way the light
 may be polarized*.

 45° may be looked upon as correction depending on the square and higher

 powers of the difference of optical density.

  If  it  were desired to continue the approximation, some further
supposition would be necessary as to the shape of the disturbing

volume    ; but the same would not be true for those that follow.
However, little exception could be taken to the assumption of                             a
spherical form and in that case there

ing further ; but I have not arrived at any results of interest.
Without calculation, we may anticipate that, as the diameter of
the particles approaches in magnitude the quarter wave-length,
the amplitude of the diffracted vibration will begin to increase
less rapidly than T, and that about the time the half wave-length
is passed an absolute diminution will set in.             Of course, when
the incident light is compound, the more refrangible elements
will be the first to show a sensible deviation from the more
simple law.
     In his interesting      experiments with precipitated          vapours,
Professor Tyudall* found that when the particles of the cloud
illuminated by unpolarized light from the electric lamp had
attained such a size that the light discharged normally had lost
most of its power of affecting the naked eye with the sensation
of colour, even then by analyzing the light with a Nicol placed
in its position of minimum transmission the azure could be re
vived in increased splendour.         Professor Tyndall calls this the
" residual blue." Experimentally it is doubtless more conve
nient to analyze the light after diffraction from the cloud ; but in
theoretical explanation and deduction it is simpler, and comes to
the same thing in the end, to consider the original beam as po
larized before it falls on the cloud.          The residual blue is then
the light discharged from the cloud in a direction parallel to that
in which the incident light swings.            The complete explanation
of this and other allied phenomena is yet to be made out ; but
one thing we learn from our theory, if indeed it is at all to
be depended on.         However large the particles may be, the light
scattered   or  reflectedf parallel to the primary vibrations depends

verse power of X than X~2, and that if it stood alone it would cor

                                                              Still cannot
honestly say that the residual blue is predicted by theory : before
the light discharged in this unfavourable direction could become at
all sensible, the particles must have grown to such a size that their
diameter would bear no inconsiderable proportion to the waves of
light ; and then we have no right to suppose that the first term in
the expansion proceeding by powers of the diameter may be taken

 Indeed the residual blue appears to be rather capricious in its ap
 pearance, and to depend on conditions not yet fully known.          I
 may mention that I have not been able to detect any unusually
intense coloration in that part of the light from the sky which
vibrates in a plane passing through the sun.         This is the more
 remarkable, because it might be supposed that a part at least is
 light which has twice undergone diffraction, in which case the
intensity would vary as X~8 if otherwise undisturbed.          But we
 must not forget that, of the indirect light illuminating the higher
 strata of our atmosphere, a very considerable fraction must come
 from the earth itself; and this certainly is coloured any thing but
 blue.     It would be interesting to observe whether the residual
 light from parts of the sky 90° distant from the sun is in any way
 dependent on the character of the earth's surface — whether, for
 example, it is the same as usual over water or when the ground
 is covered with snow.        I presume that with the precipitated
 clouds there is no question of light diffracted more than once.
    Theory would lead us to anticipate that the optical density of
 the particles of foreign matter may have a large influence on the
 development of the residual blue.       If the particles and the me
dium in which they are suspended have nearly the same refran-
 gibility, the light emitted parallel to the original vibrations may
be expected to be very feeble, not only absolutely, but in compa
rison with that emitted in other directions.      Professor Tyndall's
method of precipitating organic vapours (some of which may
 have a high optical density) in air is then more favourable than
 the suspension of mastic or other moderately dense solids in
 water, as used by Briicke and other physicists.
    I   take this opportunity of referring to the observations of
 Roscoe on the photographic power of skylight, with which            I
have only lately become acquainted.         The comparison of photo
graphic with luminous intensities is well adapted to exhibit dif
 ferences of quality related in a simple manner to the wave-length.
 The very small chemical action of the direct solar rays, as com
pared with what might have been expected from their intense
action on the retina, is a striking verification of the theoretical
results developed in the February Number of this Magazine.

   It follows directly from this, that, along the curved line which
cuts the three liquids, the marginal angle within each liquid must
be constant, since the magnitudes « only depend on the nature
of the liquids in contact, and are constant within the same liquid
surface.
   The sectional curve of the three surfaces must be a circle.      In
fact experiment at once shows the correctness of these last two

  . According to what has been said in
                                          § 25, the flat drop must in
spreading become flatter, or, to express it more accurately, the
magnitude K — k must diminish.         The entire height of the drop
K will likewise diminish as soon as the angle 0 does not mate

45-66 milligrms. at 330°, and at 1200° or 1000° is consequently
considerably less, the height of the drop and K — k are im
 mediately seen to decrease considerably,               as theory requires.
The melted lead (with smaller capillary constant) at once coats
the whole drop, and the tension of the surface becomes consider
ably less than before.
    The magnitude K— A, which for pure gold and silver amounts
to 4 millions., decreases here 1 millim. or more.              There is pos
sibly superficial    oxidation of the   lead coating, although the surface
of the drops retains its metallic appearance.
    Flat drops of copper covered with a very thin layer of oxide
are much shallower than those with a pure surface, because the
oxide of copper which covers the surface has a much smaller ca
pillary constant than copper.           In this case «14 is assumed =0
for the limit of copper and oxide of copper, since, from Matthies-
sen's experiments J, the oxide appears to dissolve in the metal.
    The layer which induces this change in the form of the drop
is so remarkably thin that it is completely beyond all other me
thods of observation, spectral analysis perhaps excepted§.
    If a substance when placed on a liquid is very quickly dissolved
by the latter, it is easy to understand that the change in shape
of the capillary surface may not occur.             This is the case, for ex
ample,    when   oil  of             is
                         turpentine placed       on  flat drops of bisulphide
of carbon in water (compare § 14).
    Small quantities of tiu, copper, or silver placed on flat drops
of melted gold, or tin on flat drops of melted silver, do not ma
terially change the form of these drops.
    Thus these metals appear to be dissolved more quickly than
lead by melted gold and silver.               I   may perhaps have even
overlooked a trifling change of form, as 1 was obliged to make
this experiment on comparatively small drops from scarcity of
pure substance.
   27. From the magnitude of the capillary constants of the com
mon surface of mercury and the liquids adduced in the first sec
tion (Table X. § 10), it follows that «19 is always less than «, — «a,
that consequently, according to equation (3) § 25, all the liquids
named in that Table, especially water and an aqueous solution
of hyposulphite of soda, must spread themselves out on a free
surface of mercury.
   In apparent contradiction to this is the fact that lenticular

460          M. G. Quincke      on the Capillary Phenomena
drops of water can be placed on a surface of mercury, and that
they, as Draper* and Paalzowf have shown, contract and assume
smaller diameters if an electric current is caused to enter the
drop of water and pass out through the mercury.           The lenticular
drops, on the contrary, spread themselves out when the electric
current flows in the opposite direction.         Even very weak electric
            I
currents have found produce this effect. The contraction of
the drops increases with the duration and strength of the elec
 tric current.    It is seen from this that the nature of the bound
 ing surface has a real influence on the shape of the drop of water,
 that traces of a third substance brought to the separating sur
 face of mercury and water (as the small quantities of hydrogen
 and oxygen liberated here by electrolysis) influence the form of
 the drop, even if from their small quautity they can scarcely be
 perceived by other methods of observation.
     Paalzow has shown that contraction of the drop of water
 can be produced by the addition of hyposulphite of soda to
the water, and by the addition of chromic acid an expansion
 of the drop.     He assumes that even the purest mercury contains
 oxygen and a small quantity of oxide on its surface ; by means
 of hydrogen electrolytically separated, or the addition of hyposul
 phite of soda, this layer of oxide is reduced, the capillary relation
 of the mercury to water is altered, the repulsion between the two
 liquids is increased, and thus the contraction of the drop is
 brought about.
     If this explanation were correct, it would follow that the mer
 cury examined in § 8 must have been coated with a layer of
 oxide, and the numbers in Table X. § 10 for mercury and water
 must refer to mercury coated with a layer of oxide, for mercury
 and hyposulphite of soda to mercury with a pure surface ; and
 it would still be unexplained why drops of water and of hypo
 sulphite of soda do not spread on drops of mercury.
     But the contradiction     immediately disappears if pure mercury
 be applied, not containing a trace of a foreign substance, parti
 cularly of a fatty or etherial oil.      This is obtained in the follow
ing   manner.
     The mercury is digested for a long time under frequent agita
 tion with concentrated sulphuric acid, to which a couple of drops
 of nitric acid are added, in order to free it from an admixture of
oxide and foreign metals.          It is afterwards separated fVoui the
 sulphuric acid and the insoluble salts by being run repeatedly
through a funnel made of clean writing-paper whose aperture is
not too small, and which is stuck together on the outside with

sealing-wax.       The apparently pure mercury is then shaken for a
long    time  with   distilled water, or (and this is a better process)
it is allowed to run again and again through a paper funnel with
a very narrow opening into a porcelain               dish tilled with hot
distilled water.       The foreign liquids, acids, oils, &c. mixed with
the mercury dissolve in the water.           The water is separated from
 the mercury, as the sulphuric acid was, by means of a paper
 funnel, in which a funnel made of blotting-paper, with a larger
opening, can be placed.           In order to remove the last, trace of
 water, the mercury         is finally passed through a funnel made
 of writing-paper with a narrow opening into a warmed porcelain
 dish*, and in the same manner into a dry flask, in which, after
 the latter has been corked, it is allowed to cool.
     If the mercury thus purified be placed in a watch-glass which
 has been washed with alcohol, dried with a clean cloth, and
 warmed over a gas-jet, then water and an aqueous solution of
 hyposulphite of soda will spread themselves out upon it.
     If the mercury be allowed to run through a funnel of writing-
 paper with a narrow opening into a warmed clean flask and then
 cooled in the well-corked flask, water will then spread on the
 surface of the cold mercury.
    If the surface of the mercury be touched with a freshly drawn-
 out glass thread O'l millini. or smaller in diameter, on the
  surface of which there is a trace of olive-oil or oil of turpentine,
  water will contract upon it into a lens-shaped drop; at the same
  time the drop of water changes its position on the surface of the
  mercury, being driven from the place on which the oil was put.
      The diameter of the drop of water diminishes as the quantity
  of oil placed on the surface of the mercury is increased.                The
  superposed layer of oil spreads itself on the surface of the mer
  cury to a thin pellicle of uniform thickness, lessens, as was ex
  plained in § 13, the surface-tension of the mercury, and equation
  (2) § 25 gives a real value of angle ws.       The diameter of the drop
 of water diminishes as the thickness of the layer of oil on the
  surface of mercury increases.          If the layer of oil spreads itself
  out on one side of the drop of water and diminishes the surface-
  tension of the mercury in that place, then the whole drop will

  soluble in C1H, but easily so in NO' H2, and I am inclined to think it was
  oxide of mercury. Whether the electricity excited by the friction of mer
  cury and porcelain contributed to its formation, further experiments must
  teach.

 be drawn over to the other side, where the unchanged surface of
 the mercury has the greater tension.
     If hyposulphite of soda be placed on the lens-shaped drop of
 water, it contracts still more, since the capillary constant of the
 common surface of mercury and hyposulphite of sodu is greater
 than the capillary constant of the common surface of mercury
 and water.
     If the glass thread covered with oil is brought into contact with
 the free surface of a lens-shaped drop of water on mercury, the
 oil spreads on the water, diminishes the tension of its surface,
 and the diameter of the drop increases.       If at the same time the
 glass thread wetted with oil be also, through immersion in the
 water, brought into contact with the common bounding sur
face of mercury and water, the oil spreads itself out upon                  it,

    It   iswell to remark that small quantities of oil placed on the
surface of    a liquid x do not overstep the sharp edge of the lens-
shaped drop of water.       The edge acts as the sharp-cut edge of
a  vertical tube, in which the magnitude of the falling drop                is
independent of the substance of the tube, or of the angle which
the liquid forms with the substance of the tube.

shaped drop whose diameter quickly diminishes, since the ten
sion ol the surface of the mercury is more quickly changed than
that of the water, in consequence of this condensation.      The angle
between water and mercury changes        with the  quantity and nature
of the thin layer of liquid which has formed itself out of the con
densed moisture and has coated the mercury.              This also ex
plains  the  different form of the  lens-shaped drop   of  water which
is generally observed on the mercury, unless certain precaution-
a)-y measures have been taken.
    A flat lens-shaped water-drop frequently contracts on the (im
 pure) surface of mercury when the latter is breathed on.         If air
 be passed through Babo's pearl-tubes         wetted with water, this
 effect is considerably    weakened ; hence it proceeds from the
 foreign substances in the moisture of the air breathed.        After a
 short time they disappear, and the drop of water again assumes
 its original form.
   I  believe that the layer of a liquid, the thickness of which does
 not exceed one-millionth of a millimetre, can be perceived in this
 manner, and that this method under favourable circumstances
 even surpasses in sensitiveness the one depending on optical
phenomena.
   Drops of an aqueous solution of hyposulphite of soda always
assumed the shape of a lens on the cold surface of mercury in
the experiments which I made. It must remain doubtful whether
the non-appearance of the spreading is to be ascribed to the im
purity of the mercury or to small errors in the numbers of
Table X. § 10.      Owing to the great difficulty of these researches,
 I cannot assert that perfectly pure mercury was used; and the
question can only be decided by an expenditure of time and
means which, I regret to say, I cannot at present command. The
impurities of the mercury, in case such were actually present,
cannot have had a materinl influence on the remaining experi
 ments of this communication      or the conclusions derived from
them.
    If the common boundary of mercury and water be covered
 with electrolytically separated gaseous hydrogen, the capillary
 tension of this limiting surface will approach the sum of the capil
 lary tensions of a free surface of mercury and a free surface of
 water (that  is, the magnitudes 55-03    + 8-25 = 63'28milligrms.),
 and will be so much greater than the capillary tension 42'58 of
 the common contact- surface of water and mercury the greater
 the quantity of hydrogen liberated on this surface.        Hence the
 contraction of the drop of water must increase with the quantity
 of hydrogen liberated, as experiment also shows.
    The layer of oxide formed      by means of the liberated oxygen
 on the mercury surface diminishes the capillary tension of the

464          M. G; Quincke      on the   Capillary Phenomena
common surface of mercury and water, and the diameter of the
drop increases.
    The motion of the particle of liquid on the surface of mercury
is considerably diminished by a thin layer of liquid which covers
the surface of the mercury.
    Lens-shaped drops of water and hyposulphite of soda with
angles of different magnitudes can swim simultaneously         on a
surface (impure) of mercury.
    The thin layer of liquid with which an apparently pure surface
of mercury is covered may differ in thickness and in nature in
different places.    The lens-shaped drops of water have then dif
ferent angles on the different portions of the mercury surface.
   If by breathing on the surface of the mercury many such
lens-shaped drops of equal magnitude are produced, then the
places with equal and those with different angles are easily re
cognized.     A so-called Moserian figure (Hauchbild) is seen. To
the Moserian figures produced in a similar manner on solid sub
stances, such as glass or metal plates, amongst which are to be
included the images (Daguerreotypes)       generated on insolated
plates  of iodide of silver by drops  of mercury,      I
                                                     shall recur on
another occasion.
    Petroleum, alcohol, and ether produce phenomena similar to
fatty and volatile oils.     Instead of placing the easily vaporized
liquids directly   on the   surface of mercury, it is frequently suffi
cient to vaporize a drop of the liquid in question in the neigh
bourhood of the surface of mercury and to allow the vapour to
be condensed, which then spreads itself out on the surface of the
mercury as a coherent layer, and gives rise to the movements or
changes in form of the lens-shaped drops of water on the mercury
in the manner described.
   The effect of the thin layers of liquid on the surface of water
and of mercury reaches a maximum when the thickness exceeds
a magnitude 21,—that      is,   twice the distance at which the mole
cular forces of capillarity are still effective.      By observing the
maximum effect which     a     measured quantity of liquid produces
on a   surface of mercury of known magnitude, the magnitude 21
can therefore be determined.     I     shall take an opportunity of re
turning   to this.
    In the experiments described in       §   8 on drops of mercury in
different liquids,a   trifling impurity in the mercury has but little
disturbing influence, because the surrounding liquid       2   (for ex
ample, the water in which the drop of mercury lies) has             a
greater volume, and removes the impurity           dissolving it. The
                                                  by
determination of the capillary constant «12 refers, therefore, to
the surface of contact of, at all events, approximately pure mercury
and water.

    Instead of forming    a Ions-shaped     drop, the water may also
cover the mercury as a thin layer with a circular opening.        The
angle of the water with the surface of the mercury is the same
in both cases.
    28. If a drop of liquid 1 be placed on a liquid 2 so that
then liquid 2 will spread over the whole drop of liquid 1, and
this will assume a lens-shaped form.
   If a drop of water be placed on olive-oil, then its upper surface
will be coated with a thin layer of oil, so that a small drop of
oil, as Liidtge* has shown, will spread on it as on a free surface
of oil. The greatest diameter of the drop of water considerably
exceeds the diameter of the circular line of intersection of the
upper surface of the lens and of the free surface of the oil, which
in this place is conically depressed.         The drop has something
of the form shown in fig. 3. This is in perfect agreement with
                                Fig. 3.
theory, since on an element of the circular line of intersection
 the following tensions act (according to Table X. § 10),
                  «a=3-76,     «19=2'10 milligrms.,
                  «3=3-76 + 2-10=5-86              „
 in which «3 denotes the tension of the surface of the oil-layer on
 the upper surface of the lens.
    The diameter of the circular line of intersection increases or de
 creases when «3 is diminished by placing oil of turpentine on the
 upper surface of the lens, or when «2 is diminished by placing
 the same liquid on the free surface of the oil.       The increase or
 decrease, however, is far from being so striking as in the analo
 gous phenomena with lens-shaped drops of water on mercury.
     29. Just as the vapours of foreign liquids contained in the
 atmosphere condense and spread over free surfaces of mercury,
 so also do they on the free surfaces of other liquids, e. g. water.
 If these impurities are not dissolved by the condensing liquid
 1 with great facility, they form a thin coating, which may exer-

 466             M. G. Quincke     an the Capillary Phenomena
  cise some influence on the spreading-out of other liquids, 2, on
  the surface of liquid 1.
      The Moserian images on different liquid surfaces are also
 explained by the different angles which the condensed water-
 drops make with the surface of liquid 1, rendered impure from
 various causes.
      Of the various cases of spreading of a liquid 2 on a liquid 1,
 the spreading of fatty oils on water especially has been fre
  quently investigated, as is shown by the list given below*,
  although it is by no means complete.
      When a small quantity of fatty oil (for example, a drop of olive-
 oil hanging to the end of a glass rod) is placed on the free
 plane surface of water or mercury in a large vessel, it spreads
 itself out as if it were on a curved surface.-
      If the quantity of oil is not too small, so that it is not quickly
 dissolved by the liquid below, then the film of oil after a time
  contracts to lens-shaped drops.          In a similar manner a second
 drop of oil remains on the surface of water or mercury, upon
 which the first drop has already spread itself out.
      If a surface of water has stood a long time in the open air so
 that its open surface is rendered sufficiently impure by a con
 densed layer of liquid condensed from the atmosphere, then the
 drops of oil first placed on it assume the lens shape, as 6.
 Hagen was the first to observe.
     The explanation of these phenomena must, in my opinion, be
 sought in the change which the oil undergoes in contact with
 water or mercury, either through solution or a chemical combi
 nation (perhaps under the influence of atmospheric air).                  Oil
 thus modified in its properties possesses a greater capillary con
stant or tension of surface, which differs the more from that of
 the unmodified oil the further the change has proceeded.                 The
 slightly   modified   oil (liquid 2)  behaves towards    oil which  is either
 not at all modified or greatly so, as towards another liquid
 with another capillary constant.
     The lens-shaped oil-drop is formed of liquid 2, of oil not at all
 modified, or only slightly so (on account of the slow diffusion),
which at the boundary between it and the air and the much modi-

fied layer of oil which covers the water or mercury has relatively
a surface tension «g or asl, both of which are less than the sur
face-tension a, of the free surface of the water or mercury
covered with the much modified layer of oil.                Liquid 2 will re
main on the surface of liquid 1 as lens-shaped drops with various
angles, or spread itself out, according to the magnitude of the
constants a,, a^, and aal, as experiment also shows.
     Fig. 4 gives the cross-section of a drop of oil on a surface of

 water containing oil.          The form of the same changes with the
 quantity      of oil already   dissolved by the water and the nature of
 the film     of  oil which   covers  the water.      The drop generally be
 comes flatter the longer it remains on the water.
      Bj breathing on the oil-lenses swimming on water, there may
 be observed, when the surface is sufficiently mobile, a similar
 contraction of the oil-lenses and change of the angle to those              I
 have described in §27, when water lenses on mercury are breathed
 on.      The phenomenon is accounted for here, as there, by sub
  stances which are contained in the form of vapour in the air ex
  pired and are condensed on the surface of the water.
      As with water and mercury, so also with oil and water, thin
  layers of oil with circular holes occur whose angle is the same
  as that for a lens of oil on the same surface of water.
      By means of the foregoing, the interesting phenomenon is
  explained which is observed when a drop of oil spreads itself
  out on a large surface of water, for instance, on a pond.                 A
   portion of the oil spreads itself out as a layer on the surface
   of the water to the extent of several square feet, and forms
   the most splendid interference-colours.              The rest remains in
   the form of lens-shaped drops in the middle of the coloured
   oil-film.      The latter gradually becomes thinner, draws itself
   together in a few places as irregular spots, and is gradually
   absorbed by the water.            If the film of oil around the lens-
   shaped drop becomes infinitely narrow, then the latter sud
   denly spreads upon the free surface of the water ; I might say
   the oil-lens explodes and forms a new film of oil of uniform
   colour or thickness, and from 2 to 3 inches in diameter.              After
   this the process described above again repeats itself.                 This
   experiment       sometimes     succeeds     with  small  drops of oil on   a
   plate   filled  with   pure  water.
       30. Besides those described in the foregoing paragraphs, a

468           M. G. Quincke            on the        Capillary Phenomena
great number       of other experiments                   on outspreading       have been
made.
    The appearance which the spreading usually presents is that
 particles of dust on the free surface of liquid 1 are repelled by
it,  or that liquid     spread out to
                       2,                 thin layer, shows Newton's

to the particles of dust, however, the surface of the liquid                               is
easily rendered impure        and optical methods are insufficient, as
                                ;
soon as the superposed layer of liquid becomes too thin, or the
 two liquids have nearly the same refractive indices.
    As the substances brought into contact with one another, either
through reciprocal solution or chemical influence, change their
 capillary constant, or even form entirely new chemical combina

   31. The simplest case of the spreading of a liquid 2 on the
free surface of a liquid 1 is when the two liquids are miscible
in every proportion, and consequently in equation (4) a)2 must
be put =0.        Then the liquid 2 with smaller capillary constant
spreads   itself out  on the liquid with the greater capillary con
stant; or, more accurately expressed, the greater tension of the
surface of liquid 1 draws to itself, as it were, the particles of
the surface of liquid 2 of lower tension of surface.
   P. du Bois-Reymond|| observed that a hot drop of a liquid,
placed on the surface of the same liquid not warmed, likewise
spread itself out there.      As the capillary constant of a liquid
diminishes with increase of temperature, «,>a2, and the expe
riment can be predicted by the theory.
   The same observer^ has called attention to the currents pro
duced in the interior of liquid 1 by the spreading of liquid 2
when he placed a layer of oil upon a layer of water instead of
upon a solid base.      On the spreading of absolute alcohol on the
surface of the layer of oil, vortical movements take place in the
interior, and the water rises under the centre of the outspreading.
   These secondary phenomena may be explained, as P. du Bois-
Reymond** has already observed, in that the alcohol carries away
the layer of oil bordering on               it,

  face of liquid 1.    Hereby liquids comes into contact with liquid

  «31 whether   or not  liquid 3  drives liquid  2 from  the surface of
liquid 1.
   Moreover the more or less unknown friction of the particles of
liquid against one another plays a part in this complicated process.
   Hence it is entirely false to say that as soon as «4>«3, liquid
3 drives away liquid 2.     Thus, for example, olive-oil («3=3'76
milligrms.) drives the alcohol (a2 = 2'599 milligrms.) from a
surface of mercury upon which two drops of these liquids are
placed together, although «a>«2.      The reason       that for mer    is,
cury and olive-oil a(8=34'19 milligrm., for mercury and alcohol
«i2=40-71 milligrms., hence in the latter case          considerably   is
greater.   «23=0'226   milligrm.  for alcohol   and olive-oil has, on
account of its smalluess, only    slight  influence
                                          a          in  this pheno
menon.
   For the case in which the capillary constant of the common
surfaces can be neglected (that                  is,
                                       when the liquids brought
together  are miscible  in every proportion, or the a with double
index are small), the liquid with small capillary constant of the
free surface will certainly drive away the liquid with greater ca
pillary     constant.^
     Ifliquids miscible in all proportions be so arranged that each
one following spreads out on the free surface                of
                                                     the foregoing, then
the same series will be obtained us      the liquid's were arranged ac

cording to the magnitudes      their capillary constants*.
                                   of
    The foregoing consideration also holds good for the case in
which solid body

                                                           Although the
mobility of the particles of the liquid in contact with this solid
body   1     materially diminished, we must nevertheless, as shall

   More recently Liidtge (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxxvii. p. 377, subject       to      4   6)
has enunciated the general law for any liquids, that the series of liquids ar
ranged according to the magnitude of their capillary constants agrees with
the order in which the liquids spread — and has at the same time stated
" that the
            spreading takes place more distinctly the less the miscibility of
two liquids and the greater the difference of their cohesions."    But as «,a
appears to be less the more readily liquids    and mix together, this state

     On these grounds       I do not consider very trustworthy the me
  thod used by many observers, of placing thin layers of different
 liquids in contact with one another on glass, porcelain, or metal
 plates, and observing which liquid forces the other away.                     In
 many    cases  the  tension     of  the  free  surface   of  the   two   liquids
 placed together so considerably preponderates, that liquid 2
 spreads itself out on liquid 3 and forces liquid 3 away from the
 surface of the solid body 1, provided «2<«3.
     In this case, then, as the following summary shows, the order
 of the liquids arranged according to the magnitudes of their ca
 pillary constants, agrees with the order in which the lower liquid
 forces away a thin layer of the higher liquid from the surface of
 a glass plate.     Whether there is a perfect agreement between
 the two series can only be judged from a simultaneous determi
 nation of the capillary constants of the liquids with which the
 experiments on spreading were made.

472           M. G. Quincke    on the  Capillary Phenomena
    32. The beautiful experiment by Liidtge*, of making in Pla
teau's wire frame-work a film figure of water or oil (liquid 1)
and causing it to be forced away by oil or soapy water (liquid 2),
so that the films consist now of the latter liquid, may be ex
plained by the secondary currents above-mentioned and con
nected with the spreading of liquid 2 in the interior of liquid 1.
     Liquid 2 spreads upon one surface of liquid 1, provided
«12>-«, — «2 ; it rolls off the other surface of liquid 1, which, as
regards the nature of its surface, has been unaltered, breaks
 through this, and now forms a circular film, whose diameter gra
 dually increases, as the diameter of the lens-shaped drop of
 water on mercury increased when oil was placed upon the boun
 dary of mercury and water (§ 27).           In this latter experiment
 also may be observed, under favourable circumstances, a perfo
 ration of the very flat lens-shaped drop of water or the formation
 of a circular film of oil in the interior of a film of water ou the
 mercury.
     Similar phenomena are seen on the surface of water when
 a drop   of oil has been let fall upon it so as to be separated
 into many small drops in the water.             One portion of the oil
 spreads itself out quickly, as was described above (§ 29), to
 a thin skin of modified oil with a greater capillary constant or
 tension of the surface than the original unchanged oil.        If now
 the specifically lighter drops of still unmodified oil ascend in
 the specifically heavier water and break through the thin skin
 of oil, they form circular films on the surface of the water, whose
 diameters gradually increase until the influence of the water
 has also sufficiently modified the capillary constants of this oil.
 I  should seek the cause of this phenomenon chiefly in the differ
  ence of the capillary constant of the free surface of the modified
 from that of the unmodified oil.
     33. The decrease of the capillary constant or tension of surface
 when a liquid 2 spreads on the open surface of a liquid 1 can
 be proved by methods which differ from the above, and particu
 larly from those given in the first four Sections of this memoir.
     If water (liquid 1) be allowed to drop out of the end of a
 vertical sharply cut glass tube of r radius, then the weight of
 each drop will be =a.2r?r.           By placing a small quantity of
 olive-oil or oil of turpentine (liquid 2) on the surface of the glass
 tube, which will then spread itself out on the surface of the falling
 drop, « will no longer remain =at, but become =a,2 + a2 < *v
  and the magnitude of the drop of water will considerably
 diminish. As the oil is soon carried off by the falling drops
 of water, the thickness of the coating of oil diminishes with the
 time, becomes < 21 (than twice the radius of the sphere of action),
                  * Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxxvii. p. 465

and the magnitude of the drops again increases.     Owing to the
difficulty of estimating the thickness of the coating of oil cor
rectly, I have made no measurements with regard to it.
   The longer the drops are in falling, the more time have they
to condense substances on the surface which were contained in
the atmosphere in the form of vapour, and just so much less must
a or the capillary constant be found to be, as experiment also
teaches.      In the earlier* methods which    used with falling  I
drops for determining the capillary constant of fused substances,
this source of error had, on account of the high temperature of
the fused substances, only a slight influence.   The same holds
good for measurements of flat drops of fused substancesf-
   If a horizontal capillary tube of radius r be fastened perpen
dicularly to the axis of an ordinary reflecting goniometer, and

 garding the magnitude of the perpendicular pressure K in the

    Berlin, September 1869.
    The foregoing memoir was already written, when, by the kind
 ness of the author, I received the very interesting treatise of M.
 G. van der Mensbrugghe
                               " On the Surface-tension of Liquids"*.
 It treats of motions on the free surface of liquids exhibited by
other liquids, particles of camphor, or small solid bodies ; and,
from the same points of view as myself, he seeks the cause of
these phenomena in the different magnitudes of the capillary
tension of the surface of the liquid, which can be materially
modified through the solution of small quantities of foreign
substances.      The greater or less tension of the free surface of
the liquid is proved by a method discovered by the author, from
the change in shape of the closed curves which are formed of
thin threads swimming on the surface of the liquids.                   The
treatise also contains a complete literature of the earlier works
on the same subject.
    As we proceeded in quite different ways independently of one
another in the investigation of the same phenomena, I believed
it was unnecessary to alter any thing in my written statement, so
much the more so as, in my opinion, a complete understanding
of the process of outspreading cannot be obtained without a
knowledge of the magnitude of the capillary constant of the
common surface of two liquids.          Moreover all the experiments
described by M. van der Mensbrugghe are in harmony with the
foregoing theoretical considerations.
    The principal results of the foregoing investigation may be
recapitulated as follows : —
    1. At the common boundary of two liquids 1 and 2 a similar
tension of surface takes place to that on the free surface of a liquid
bounded by air.

common       bounding surface of       two  liquids, multiplied by the sum of
the inverse principal radii of curvature of a point of the bounding
plane, gives the capillary pressure in the direction of the perpendi
culars to the surface.
    3. The magnitude of this capillary constant «14 does not admit
of being directly determined from the capillary constants a l and oe,
of the free surface of the two liquids, but must be found by special
experiments.         It may have all possible values between 0 and
    4.   Ifal9=Q,        then   the liquids   1  and 2 are miscible in all pro
portions, and       no drop or bubble      of   one  liquid is formed in the in
terior of the other.              Moreover a,9 appears smaller the more
miscible the liquids are, and is always less than ctl—«l.
    5.   If  three capillary surfaces meet together in a point, then the
exterior angles of a triangle whose sides are proportional to the
capillary constants of the three capillary surfaces are the marginal
 angles of the surfaces of the liquids.
    6. A liquid 3 spreads out on the common bounding surface of
 two liquids 1 and 2 when «,,<*., — * ,,.
    7. A liquid 2 spreads out on the free surface of a liquid 1
     8.  If liquids     which are miscible in all proportions, for which
 therefore    »lt=0,be       arranged so that each following one spreads out
 on the free surface of the foregoing, the same series will be ob
 tained as    if the   liquids had been arranged according to the magni
 tude   of  the capillary     constant of their free surface.
     9.  If  a lens-shaped drop of a liquid 2 remains on the free sur
face of a liquid 1 without spreading itself out, then it is certain
 that in most, and probable that in all cases the free surface of
 liquid 1 is rendered impure by a thin layer of a foreign liquid 3.
  The effect of this foreign layer increases with its thickness up to a
 certain limit, which is equal to twice the radius of the sphere of
 action.
     in.//',/ liquid     2 spreads out in a thin layer upon a flat drop of a
 liquid   1  in air   or  upon aflat air-bubble in the interior of the same
 liquid 1, then the vertical distance K— k of the horizontal and ver
 tical parts of the capillary surface diminishes.              The new shape of
 the  flat drops and       bubbles  may   be  calculated when a,     , and a , are
 known.
     11.   If a  liquid 3 spreads out on the surface of a flat drop of a
 liquid 2 in    a  liquid 1, it can only be said that the height K— k of
 the   drop of   the   liquid 2 diminishes.         The change of form in this
 case cannot always be calculated beforehand.
     12.   The capillary constants of free liquid surfaces, determined
 on  flat   drops or bubbles, are greater than            if calculated from the

476            Dr. A. M. Mayer on        a Method of Fixing,
elevations in newly drawn-out capillary tubes.                 The angle of
liquids against pure glass surfaces is only in rare cases =0.
    13.  If  two liquids are placed one above the other in a capillary
tube, then the weight of liquid raised above the common level de
pends en the form of the free surface of the upper liquid o and
the common surface of the upper and lower liquids o and u.
    14. Tlie weight of liquid raised above the common level is never
determined by the lower liquid u alone, as Poisson says ; in many
cases, on the contrary, when the liquids o and u are miscible in
all proportions, by means of the upper liquid alone.
    15. The mean elevation of the liquids o and u admits of being
estimated from the values a0 and «ou measured on flat drops or
bubbles when l/te angle made by the free and that made by the
common surface of both liquids with the side of the tube are known.
 Only in a few cases is this angle 0° or 180°.
    16. The observations of elevations in capillary tubes and on fiat
drops of a liquid or drops falling out of vertical tubes in air may
easily give too small a value of the capillary constant, since foreign
substances diffused through the atmosphere in the form of vapour are
condensed on the curved capillary surface, and the thin layer of
liquid arising therefrom diminishes the tension of the free surface.
 This source of error is greater at ordinary than at high tempera
tures, is more considerable in liquids with great capillary con
stants than in those with small, and accounts for the too small
values of capillary constants found by earlier observers in some
liquids, as mercury and water.
    17. This condensation of moisture on the surface of liquids ex
plains the different forms of lens-shaped drops of water on mer
cury and the so-called Masurian figures.
 LX.    On a Method       of Fixing, Photographing, and exhibiting         the
        Magnetic Spectra.         By ALFRED M. MAYER, Ph.D.*

THEmomentary            vibration on a surface placed over a magnet,
have received considerable attention from natural philosophersf.
The geometrical discussion of these spectra made by Lambert,
Roget, and others have developed their symmetrical properties,
and thereby have evolved the law of that action which emanates
from the magnet.          De Haldat has used them as a means of ex
ploring the distribution and intensity of the effect of juxtaposed
magnets variously arranged.            But above all have the researches
of Faraday and W. Thomson on " the magnetic field," and on

" the   lines of magnetic force," given to these spectra, even when
merely regarded as conventional symbols, an importance which
has been fully shown (especially) by Faraday, who was guided
by their consideration to some of his most important discoveries.
They have thus risen to so high a theoretical importance that a
method which will fix them without danger of distortion, photo
graphically reproduce them and readily serve to exhibit them to
the largest audiences, will,        I  imagine, be acceptable to both in
vestigators and lecturers.
   The only process of fixing these spectra known to me is that
practiced by De Haldat and Faraday, which, however, is but an
application to the magnetic spectra of the method previously in
vented by Savart for preserving the Chladni figures of vibrating
plates.     In this process the spectra, produced in the usual man
ner either on glass or cardboard, have pressed upon them a sheet
of paper coated with mucilage, to which the filings adhere.               In
this operation of the transfer many particles are deranged from
their positions, and the figures are yet more distorted by the
shrinkage of the wet paper, and are therefore not fit to serve in
measures of precision ; while the impressions cannot be exhibited
with much more facility than the originals.
    My process is as follows : — A clean plate of thin glass is coated
with a firm film of shellac, by flowing over it a solution of this
substance in alcohol*, in the same manner as a photographic
plate is coated with collodion.            After the plate has remained a
day or two in a dry atmosphere, it is placed over the magnet, or
magnets, with its ends resting on slips of wood, so that the under
surface of the plate just touches the magnet.             Fine iron-filings,
produced by "draw-filing" Norway iron which has been repeat
edly annealed, are now sifted uniformly over the film of lac by
means of a fine sieve.          The spectrum is then produced on vibra
ting the plate by letting fall vertically upon it at different points
a light piece of copper wire.            The plate is now cautiously lifted
vertically   off  the  magnet    and    placed on the end of a cylinder of
pasteboard,     which    serves  as  a  support in bringing it quite close
to the under surface of a cast-iron plate (1 foot diameter, ^ inch
thick) which has been heated over a large Bunsen-flame. Thus
the shellac is uniformly heated, and the iron-filings, absorbing
the radiation, sink into the softened film and are " fixed."
    I generally allow the heat to act until the metallic lustre of
the filings has disappeared by sinking into the shellac, and the
film appears quite transparent.             This degree of action is neces
sary when photographic prints are to be made from the plate;
 but when they are to be used as lantern-slides           I do not carry the
   * The   shellac dissolved in strong alcohol is allowed to stand a week or
more, and the clear supernatant solution is then decanted.

 478           Dr. A. M. Mayer on       a Method of Fixing,
 heating so far.     After the plate has cooled, it is allowed to fall
 upon its ends on a table, so that any filings which have not ad
 hered may be removed.
    A short experience will give the proper strength of shellac
 solution to obtain a film so thick as just to be sufficient to hold
 the filings, and the requisite amount of heat to firmly cement
them, without injuring the transparency of the film.
    The plates can now serve (1) for the most accurate measures
upon the magnetic field, (2) for a photographic            positive, which
in the printing-frame will produce the lines in white upon a
 dark ground, giving most beautiful and distinct impressions*;
 or (3) if it is required to exhibit these figures to an audience, the
plates are provided with glass covers, kept from touching the
spectra by intervening slips of cardboard,              and there result
" slides " in every way fit for giving a fine exhibition when the
images are projected upon a screen.              I have thus obtained
images clear and sharp of over 12 feet diameter.
    By this process many plates have been produced t, showing
the action of single magnets of various forms, and of juxtaposed
bars, as well as the effects of electric currents led by wires through
holes drilled in the plates.      Those exhibiting the inductive action
of magnets on bars of soft iron and the interaction of magnets
and electric currents are peculiarly interesting.         An approximate
representation of the resultant lines of the terrestrial magnetic
action has been obtained by magnetizing equably tempered steel
disks of from 2 to 3 inches, and even more, in diameter.                The
magnetic axis or axes     of  these disks are predetermined by making
them the continuations of the axes of very powerful electro-mag
nets, terminated with cones of soft iron with slightly rounded
apices.     The arcs of the great circles including the terrestrial
magnetic poles having been calculated, the axes of the electro
magnets are inclined to that angle, while the steel disk is held
close to their poles.     On passing the current the disk is magne
tized, and we have an approximate representation of a section of
the earth's magnetic effect.       These results, when viewed as pho
tographic prints or as exhibited by the lantern, are so beautiful
and instructive as to appear to me to warrant this somewhat
formal description of the process of their production.

    This paper commenced with a detailed account of the Forest

sections in the Winterberg and Stormberg.                   The author particularly

South     Africa,  as  indicated   by  its  geology  and    fossils, particularly the
Karoo-beds, the Enon conglomerate, the TVijronia-beds, the several
Posttertiary shell-beds, and especially the present surface conditions,

bach, Esq., Corr. Memb. of the K. K. geologischen Reichsanstalt,
and of the K. K. geographischen Gesellschaft, Vienna.
    The author commenced by describing the physical geography of
Natal, and then indicated the characters and distribution of the
rocks which occur in that country.      He stated that the granitic and
gneissic rocks do not form the most prominent elevations, but they
appear chiefly in the lower parts of river-valleys, and sometimes in
small hills.     Mica-schists and slates are found associated with the
granites.    The great plateaux consist of an undisturbed sandstone,
which the author identifies with the Table-mountain Sandstone, and
which lies horizontally upon the granites and old slates.     The tops
of many of the table-mountains in Natal are crowned by beds of
dark basaltic greenstone.      The Karoo formation, which lies in part
upon the Table-mountain Sandstone, consists of a vast series of
sandstones and shales, some of the latter containing beds of coal.
The author agreed with Mr. Tate in regarding these beds as of
Triassic age. At the base of the Karoo formation the author de
 scribed a boulder-bed, which he was inclined to identify with the
rock described by Mr. Bain as " Claystone porphyry ; " and through
this greenstone has forced its way.       On and near the coast of the
southern part of Natal, some sandy marls and sandstones belonging
 to the Cretaceous series were said to occur ; the author gave lists of
 fossils obtained from these deposits, which he identified with the
 Trichinopoly series of India. Several of the fossils were described as
 new species.      The author considered    that the evidence adduced
 indicated that, after the development of the Table-mountain Sand
 stone, Africa and India formed parts of one continuous continent,
 afterwards covered by the Cretaceous sea. The area now covered
 by the Indian Ocean was the basin of a large series of lakes ; and
 this condition persisted through a long period of tranquillity, lasting
 through the Triassic to the Upper Jurassic age. The greater part
 of this continent was then depressed and covered by the shallow
 Cretaceous sea. The economic mineral products of Natal were men
 tioned by the author, who referred to the occurrence of graphite,
 coal, gold, and copper.

 and thence across the Orange River to Backhouse ; and then, after
 crossing the Vaal, up its right bank as far as Lekatlong.            He
 noticed such diamonds as he saw or heard of, and described the
 locality as being thickly coated with sand, diamond-bearing gravel,
  and tufa, hard blue shales occurring here and there in protruding
 hills.

  correcting the barometric inequality of the ordinary clock-pendulum,
 by affixing to the pendulum-rod, produced upwards, a body of the
  same volume as the pendulum-bob, but of very small weight.           This
 implies that the upper part of the pendulum-rod has the same length
 as the lower part ; if it be shorter, the volume of the light body must
 be larger.

    ON THE USE OF THE SPECTRAL APPARATUS              IN THE QUANTITA
        TIVE DETERMINATION           OF  COLOURING-MATTERS.          BY K.
        VIERORDT.
     In   the spectral apparatus hitherto in use the slit ia bounded by
 two plates, a fixed and a moveable one. For the present purpose
 the moveable plate is divided into two parts, an upper and a lower
 one.      Each of these plates is provided with a fine micrometer-screw,
 by    means  of the milled head of which the breadth of the slit may be
 accurately determined. If both the halves, the upper and the lower,
 are of exactly the same width, the upper and the lower half of the
spectral field of view is of exactly the same intensity in every part.
 But if a transparent coloured medium is brought in front of the
 upper slit (a coloured glass for instance, a thin lamina of a coloured
body, a coloured organic structure, or, finally, in a small glass trough
 with parallel sides a solution of any coloured substance or the co
lourless solution of a strongly fluorescent body), the spectrum is
 divided into two halves, one above the other, of different luminous
 intensities — into the pure spectrum of the source of light produced
by the part which remains free, and into the spectrum modified by
the interposed coloured body.
     I  may mention another accessory arrangement which I have intro
duced into the spectrum-apparatus, which I can also recommend for
other spectrum-analysis purposes than the present, namely an ar
rangement in the eyepiece of the observing-telescope which renders
it possible to stop all parts of the spectrum excepting that investi
gated.      By this arrangement very feeble coloured lines of the spec
trum of chemical elements may be observed with great accuracy.
For details I must refer to my work, which has just been published

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous       Articles.             483
                       '
(Laupp, Tubingen),         On the Application of Spectrum Analysis to
the   Measurement and Comparison of the Intensity of Coloured
Light,' in which the spectra of solar light and of various terrestrial
sources of light are photometrically examined, and moreover mea
surements of the luminous intensity of the bright lines of the spectra
of some chemical elements are communicated.
    The first problem in the quantitative determination of coloured
bodies by spectrum-analysis (a problem which has not hitherto been
put in chemical laboratories) consists in measuring the absorption of
light in any given region of the spectrum by a transparent body
brought before one half of the slit, the rest of the spectrum being
stopped off in the manner described.           This is very simply effected
by narrowing     the   fore part of the  slit by means of the correspond
ing micrometer-screw until the luminous intensity is the same in
the upper as in the lower half of the spectrum investigated.              If
the luminous intensity in the part investigated is very great, the free
half of the slit is first covered with a smoked glass of known darken-
ing-power, and then perfect equality of luminous intensity is pro
 duced by altering the width of the slit.
    Equality in luminous intensity in the two halves of the spectrum is
very quickly produced ; and thereupon the intensity of the light which
remains after traversing the coloured body brought before the slit is
directly found in a percentage.       In some investigations the measure
 ment of the photometric values of the region investigated is also
 desirable; this is effected by the method described in the above-
 mentioned paper.
    As the eye can discriminate very small differences in the intensity
 of monochromatic light, the method possesses all the guarantees of
 an accurate objective measurement.        It thus furnishes a simple means
 of measuring the absorption of light in all regions of the spectrum ;
 it is also suited to determine the contents of any given solution of
 a colouring-matter.
    To the definition of the coefficient of the absorption of light, as
 well as of the coefficient of extinction (E) of a solution, moreover
 of the coefficient of absorption (A) of the dissolved active ab
 sorbing body, the following is to be added : the first and third of
 these coefficients correspond to the definitions which have long been
 used, while the coefficient of extinction is taken in the well-known
 sense introduced by Bunsen (in his photochemical investigations).
    A definite relation between the coefficient of extinction E and the
 concentrations of variously concentrated solutions of one and the same
 coloured substance may be anticipated ;     -  Q is, in fact, nothing more
                                             Ei
than the coefficient of absorption    A of the dissolved substance, cor
responding   to the older definitions.
   If, then, for any given single place of the spectrum the coefficient
                                                                    f1

tion C of the same solution may be found by the formula C=AE, —
that is, by simply multiplying the coefficient of absorption of the
substance (which has once for all been determined) by the coefficient
of extinction of the solution (to be measured on the spectrum-appa
ratus). The coefficient of extinction is the negative logarithm of the
luminous intensity which remains after traversing a layer of the ab
sorbing medium a centimetre in thickness. — Berichte der Deutschen

   The conviction that     the accumulation and comparison of evidence
on a subject so interesting and yet so little understood as the zodiacal
light cannot but be useful, induces me to submit the following ob
servation to the notice of the Astronomical Society : —
    On the evening of the 1 9th of December last the detachment of
the Eclipse Expedition encamped at Agosta had an opportunity of
examining a particularly brilliant display of the zodiacal light,
stretching to some 80° from the sun's place : its contour was of a
somewhat conical form, blunted at the apex, the semi- vertical angle
of the cone being about 12°.       Its light was apparently white, and
was undistinguishable in point of colour from the light of the Milky
 Way, which also shone out with considerable distinctness upon the
night in question.      I was anxious to see if any polarization could be
detected, and for this purpose made use of a Savart, and at first
thought that faint lines were visible, indicating polarization in a
plane through the sun ; but not being at all sure of my observation,
I asked Mr. Burton, who was formerly assistant to Lord Rosse, and
has very keen eyesight, to look through the instrument : he at once
said that he distinctly saw bands brightest when the Savart was
turned so that the direction of the bands passed through the sun,
and that the centre band was black ; he also saw the bands perpen
dicular to the sun's direction, but could not determine the nature of
the centre one.     I should mention that the Savart was so set as to
give a black centre when the bands were parallel to the plane of po
larization.
    I then asked Mr. Burton to see if he could detect any bands upon
 the sky away from the zodiacal light, but he was unable to do so
 even at 90° away from the sun's position.
    I again took the instrument, but was unable to see any bands
 myself.    On the next night the zodiacal light was again visible, but
 with considerably less brilliance than before.       Father Secchi ob
 served it with a Savart, and thought that he detected faint bands,
 but said that he could not be sure of his observation.
    If other observations should confirm those of Mr. Burton, we shall
 be in possession of proof, not only that the zodiacal light consists of
 matter which reflects the sun's light, but that
     (1) That matter exists in particles so small that their diameters
 are comparable with the wave-lengths of light ; or
     (2) It consists of matter capable of giving specular reflection.

           glacier-clad mountains of my native country, especially
THE     when glistening in the rays of evening, exerted on me,
from my childhood, a powerful attraction ; and this was after
wards enhanced by their scientific interest.        The present memoir
contains  individual   observations  and reflections upon certain phe
nomena of glaciers     —  the result of the magnificent days I have
spent in the glacier-region under all conditions of the atmosphere,
of the study of the literature of the subject, and of some experi
mental researches.
                         1. The Glacier-Grain.
   The observations of the capillary fissures which run through
the ice of glaciers, and form the boundaries of the glacier-grain,
and the reflections suggested by them, especially as regards their
origin, occasioned a strong controversy among those who 30 or
40 years ago devoted themselves to glacier-investigation ; and
no one conquered.        In the more recent works the question is
mostly passed over.       Even Professor Tyudall (' Glaciers of the
Alps/ pp. 338, 339) devotes only a few lines to the capillary
fissures, and does not mention the glacier-grain.         So much the
more were we surprised at a memoir by M. Grad, which appeared
in 1867, in the Comptes Rendus, in which he advances precisely
the view which Hugi forty years previously had so energetically
maintained.      It is not clear from the memoir whether the author
was acquainted with Hugi's writings, or whether by his own
observations he has independently arrived at the same result.
This view may be briefly expressed thus : —Direct observation
teaches that the grains (or crystals) of the glacier are the further

 developed granules of the neve.       This development, consisting
 in enlargement and (according to M. Grad) superadded " crys
 talline orientation5' of the granules of the neve, it is to which
 all the phenomena of the movement of the glacier are to be re
 ferred.   Thus Hugi and M. Grad. The latter remarks, " Pro
 fessor Tyndall derives all the phenomena of the motion from
 pressure ; but this is erroneous ;" of this erroneousness, how
 ever, he gives no proof, and as little on behalf of his own view.
 Resting on the observation that the glacier-grain is larger
towards the lower part of the glacier than further up, and that
in the direction of the lower part of the glacier the structure of
its ice more and more approaches the crystalliine condition of
water-ice, while the axes of the crystalline grains arrange them
selves all parallel and perpendicular, he simply says it is so.
    Still more diverse are the results of the researches intended to
answer the question whether the network of capillary fissures
runs through the whole body of the glacier.         Agassiz found the
capillary fissures even in the most compact glacier-ice.        Schla-
gintweit infiltrated them with solutions of chromate of potassium
tp the depth of 60 and 80 metres beneath the surface of the
glacier.    MM. Berlin, Grad, and Dupre obtained results agree
ing with the above. On the contrary, Hugi absolutely denies
the penetrability of the inner ice of the glacier; and according
to Mr. Huxley's experiments, in sound unweathered glacier-ice
no capillary fissures exist.     All have experimented very con
scientiously ; but the results are diametrically opposite.    Whence
comes this ?
    If the capillary fissures exist throughout the glacier-ice, but,
as must be the case in " sound blue " ice, are filled with water,
infiltration experiments cannot lead to any result ; for there is
nothing to cause the water to give place to the coloured liquid,
unless we have to do with a layer of ice beneath which the liquid
can freely run away, and on which there is the pressure from
above of a considerable column of the coloured liquid.       It is still
more difficult to conceive that the infiltration through capillary
fissures, which the other observers assert that they have seen,
was a mere delusion ; for it is agreed that they also operated on
" sound " glacier-ice. In the parts of the glacier where great
pressure prevails, and so everywhere in the
                                                  " structure mill" of
Professor Tyndall, the water in the capillary fissures, supposing
these to go through the whole glacier, is partly pressed out. la
these parts it will be impossible for the infiltration-liquids to
penetrate ; this will more easily be possible where the ice is sub
jected to less pressure —for example, above declivities where
transverse fissures make their appearance, and in bends of the
valley, on the convex side of the body of the glacier.        The dif

ferent results of infiltration experiments probably stand in direct
relation to the parts of the glacier where they were carried out.
   That even the most solid, transparent, blue ice from the inte
rior of the glacier, in the warmer air, and especially through the
operation of the solar rays, becomes white through a network of
fiue fissures becoming visible, which everywhere divide the ice
into irregularly formed grains of a certain constant magnitude
in any one locality, is an observation which no one has yet dis
puted and which any one can repeat. But why does not this
happen to common ice ? How could heat call forth such a gra
nular structure, if it were not already sketched out, even in the
" sound," compact ice ? How it is present in the " sound " ice
— whether in the form of actual capillary fissurelets filled with
water, or whether, from some unknown cause, the ice more rea
dily liquefies on surfaces irregularly permeating the mass, or how
otherwise it may be imagined — whether capable of infiltration
or not is to us indifferent, — it is sufficient that a similar granular
structure to that which we observe on the surface goes through
the whole mass, or at least is traced out therein.
     Attempts have been made to explain how this granular struc
ture arises. The unproved view of MM. Hugi and Grad, above
quoted, that the glacier-grains are the further developed gra
 nules of the neve, is not what they think, a*something taught by
direct observation, but an hypothesis. (I shall return to this ques
tion.) We will for a few moments adopt         it,
                                                 and found upon       it   a
 little calculation, which will the soonest put in the right light.
                                                     it
     In glaciers of about 8000 metres length (for example, the
 Hiifi Glacier, Rhone Glacier, &c.) the glacier-grain grows from
 the size of wheat-grain to at least the size of walnut (in larger

30; the corresponding volumes are from 33 to 303, or (which
gives the same proportion) from      1 to 1000.     And this enlarge
ment of form takes place throughout the mass of the glacier,
and not merely in the layers nearest to the surface.      In the time
necessary for   a   point at the upper end of the glacier to arrive at
the lower, the glacier, but for the superficial melting away (abla
tion), would become 1000 times its original volume       the ablation,

then, must not only, in just this time, carry away in water the
mass of ice present, but also compensate for the thousandfold
increase.     Although we shall apply our calculation to the Aletsch
Glacier, the length of which amounts to more than twice 8000
metres, we will yet, in favour of the hypothesis, content our
selves with a    simple increase of volume to 1000 times instead of
2000. The numbers we shall use will be only approximate,
always rounded off in favour of the hypothesis.

   The mean annual rate of motion of the Aletsch Glacier is
about 40 metres.    Measured from the foot of the Dreieckhorn
and Faulberg (where the glacier, properly speaking, begins)
onwards, it is 17000 metres loug. We will now, as regards
alteration in volume, consider the glacier below the transverse
section situated at the above-designated   place, until it is all
melted, and thus our transverse section, slowly travelling with
                                                       17000
the ice, has arrived at the lower end.       For this about...  =425
                                                          40
years are necessary.    The volume of our glacier-tongue may be
estimated as about 6150 million cubic metres; of course the
number is not certain to 100 millions more or less.         This mass
of ice, together with its increase through the growth of its gra
nules, actually turns to water in 425 years by ablation.          The
melting of the glacier beneath through the warmth of the ground
is doubtful — at any rate, vanishingly small.      The vertical sink
ing of the surface through melting away amounts to an average
of about 3 metres yearly: it was measured by the constantly in
creasing protrusion of stakes which had been driven into the
surface, or by the relative elevation of parts artificially sheltered
from ablation.     The surface of ablation in the first of the 425
years,   measured   on the Federal atlas, is 25,000,000 square
metres.    In the second, the transverse section forming the upper
boundary of our glacier-mass has moved 40 metres down the
valley ; here the glacier is 1600 metres wide ; thus the surface of
ablation     for the second year, 40 x 1600 = 64000 square metres
           is,
less than that of the first.    Just so in the following years be it
comes continually less the further our transverse section travels.
At the end of the 425 years reaches 0. The surface on which,
                                  it
during the 425 years, the vertical ablation of about          3 metres
yearly has operated, and effectually melted the mass of the gla
cier, is the sum of all these 425 unequal surfaces belonging to
 the individual years.    If the surface of the glacier were exactly
rectangular, as broad below as above, this sum would be 425
times half the surface of the first year, consequently
                 =425   x   25000000 x   £   = 5312500000
square metres.   Were    exactly
                             it   triangle (of which the base,
                                        a
the greatest breadth, =1800 metres, and the height the length
 = 17000), the sum in question would be
or =2175000 square metres.     In reality    lies between; we
                                                      it
will take the mean — namely, 3740 million square metres. To
mark on the map the situation of the upper limit for each year,

                       M. A. Heim            on Glaciers.                                 489
to measure the surface below this, and to sum up the 425 sur
faces would be a needless labour, because all our other numbers
are not correspondingly accurate.
   We have now the equation : — Surface multiplied by ablation
equal to original volume times x.                  If
                                           the hypothesis of Hugi
and Grad is correct, we must obtain for x above 1000 ; if no real
increase of mass takes place in the ice, a value near I.  Inserting
our values,
         3740000000 x      3   = 6150000000 x x, .'.              a:   =   l'8.
That   is,   inorder to compensate for the thousandfold increase of
 volume which would ensue from the growth of the granules,
the ablation jwould have to be nearly 1000 times as great as                               it
is
 ;    otherwise, instead of the volume of the glacier having quite
vanished at the end of the 425 years,              would be nearly 1000
                                                        it
 times as great as at the beginning.
    From this calculation      it appears to me certain that,         were      if   it
 true that the glacier-grains are the developed neve-granules —                           if
it  were true that the large glacier-grain of the lower regions ori
ginates from the smaller granule of the upper through growth
produced      by the freezing upon       itof infiltrated water, then the
glacier would become larger,        it would never come to an end, and
at the present time the whole earth must be lying under               deep           a
covering of ice.
    In the above we have rounded off all the numbers in favour of
the hypothesis of Hugi and Grad, and hence have found for
x a   greater value than   1   ;   but we could take them still more
favourably    for  that  theory,  and  yet the result would be strikingly
adverse to the hypothesis.
    But the old dilatation theory must accept an increase of mass
through the water freezing in the capillary fissures.            M. Grad
insists upon the dilatation theory, without adducing            single ex   a
periment to confute the numerous objections which, years before,
were advanced against it.          The measurements made           himself      by
and M. Duprein 1869, on the Aletsch Glacier, contain evidence
against the dilatation theory; for he there finds that the lower
part of the glacier moves considerably more slowly than the
upper.     As Forbes acknowledged, according to the dilatation
theory,   that  should be exactly reversed, since we have to regard
the upper end of the glacier as          afixed point of support for the
glacier-tongue, and the dilatation must sum up to continually          a
greater motion for    a    point the further           removed from the
                                                        it   is
beginning    of  the  glacier.
    Some other facts can be adduced which are opposed to the
derivation of the grain of the glacier from that of the neve. The
distention occasioned     in   the mass       by
                                              the growth of the granules

490                    M. A. Heim     on Glaciers.
could not but show itself in the form of the glacier; but only a
shrinking through melting is to be recognized therein, never a
swelling.
  We very often find isolated air-bubbles enclosed in the large,
splendidly transparent glacier-grains, and sometimes, indeed,
quite in their centres, sometimes excentric.   In the fine neve
the air is found only between the granules ; and if these were
gradually to grow larger by water freezing on them, the air
would remain between the grains.             I cannot conceive how it
could be enclosed in them.           On the contrary, in thawing snow
it is immediately evident that it becomes large-grained through
single minute crystals, afterwards single granules, uniting to
form one, and consequently that a larger grain of the neve is
not a small one increased in size, but corresponds to several
small ones.
    That the grain of the upper part of the glacier is smaller than
                                                             I
that of the lower it is easy to see ; but, often as have sought
for   it,
       I   have never been able to trace the transition from the
neve-grain to the glacier- grain. Where the neve ends and the
clear ice, though rich in bubbles, appears at the surface, this
shows no distinct granular structure       ;   the glacier-grain begins to
make its appearance (at first rather small) further down the val
 ley.    Also the increase of size of the grains as the end            is ap
proached     seems  to  me  to take  place not  at all so  regularly   as has
been asserted.       For long time thought my own observation
                           a          I
 was at fault, until the above calculation reassured me.
     How could the fine divisions between the individual neve"-
 granules be preserved for two or even three or more centuries,
 often under strong pressure, without being destroyed             by  regela-
 tion — while
      ?           by  this process the mightiest crevasses may disap
 pear and scarcely leave       a  trace, and two pieces of ice, gently
 pressed together     for  a few  days, so regelate that the piece, on
 being fractured, will not break again at the same place.
     The network      offissures, or the structure of the glacier-ice
 which in warm air gives rise to that network,        is  necessarily always
passing away and almost simultaneously being formed afresh; for,
 asis   proved   byour calculation, the glacier-grains (bounded         by the
 capillary fissures)   of  the higher and lower parts      of the glacier do
 not correspond to each other.
   It   was already conjectured      by Forbes that these fissures might
  be divisions produced, or at least preserved,            by pressure and
 motion.
    When we take       a piece of ice from the surface of the glacier and
  divide    into its grains, we are struck
            it                                  by  the fact that they do
  not all separate with equal facility. While the fissures circum
  scribing the grains are partially visible through the air which

                            M. A. Heim         on Glaciers.             491
has penetrated them, and appear silvery white, and along these
the grains can be easily separated (primary capillary fissures),
irregular surfaces of division transverse to the grains come into
view on the application of greater force.    The latter are surfaces
of division already traced in the substance, not new surfaces of
fracture ; they often help us to divide a grain into several pieces ;
by way of contrast to the above-mentioned we will name them
secondary capillary fissures.   It is natural to suppose that these
secondary fissures are old primary ones not yet quite regelated,
and that in these two forms we have surfaces of division of the
glacier-grains in different states of development.   The primary
capillary fissures are mostly smooth, curved or plane ; the secon
dary show for the most part (perhaps always) fine, acute eleva
tions which accurately fit into depressions in the adjacent faces,
often all elongated in one direction ; and then the faces exhibit
parallel wrinkles.
   Between the explanation of glacier- motion by pressure, as given
by Tyndall, and the continual renewal of the network of fissures
there  is,   itseems to me,      deep and intimate connexion.
                                  a                                    Pro
fessor Tyndall says,       relation to his experiments,
                            in                               " The   ice, in
changing its form from that of one mould to that of another, was
in every instance broken and crushed               by

both processes proceed simultaneously               and uninterruptedly
throughout the mass of the glacier — and, indeed, the more
actively the quicker the motion, and the more irregular the form
of the valley, to which the glacier must bend — in short, the
greater the relative motion of neighbouring portions of the ice.
   We cannot expect to be able to find, in support of this view,
forms of conchoidal fracture in the grain of the glacier.               The
concentric streaks which characterize that are only grouped
around certain pronounced points of action of the force; while

out the mass : we have here an infinite number of mutually equi
valent points of action for the force.
   If the above explanation of the origin of glacier-ice is correct,
it must be possible to produce also in compact water-ice, artifi
cially, a breaking up into fragments analogous to the glacier-
grains; and in this I have actually succeeded.      Had Professor
Tyndall,   in his experiments on the moulding of ice, not put in
operation so strong a pressure that the ice must have instanta
neously burst into fine powder, had he not suddenly compelled
it to so great a change of form, and had he experimented on
larger masses, a granular structure would have been visible in
the moulded ice.      His glacier-grains were as fine as powder,
and hence escaped observation.
   In a block of wood a tray-shaped depression was cut about 1
foot broad, and 6 inches long ; the radius of its curvature was
2 feet 6 inches ; and a piece of wood was cut so as to fit into
the cavity.     Between these two parts of the mould a flat plate
of river- ice, beautifully clear, about 2 inches thick, was placed,
exactly as long and broad as the cavity ; and the whole was firmly
enclosed with boards to prevent the escape of the ice.         A stroke
with a weight-stone of half a hundredweight, brought down
upon   it, was sufficient to crush the flat plate of ice into the shape
of the cavity.
  A   main imperfection in this experiment          that here
                                                   is         a   nearly
equal pressure does not, as in the glacier, operate simultaneously
on every part of the mass to be moulded, but the pressure acts
on different parts of the plate of ice in succession, not simulta
neously, although within the brief time of the stroke; conse
quently the effect cannot be equal throughout the entire mass
as in the glacier.       The experiment would be improved         if the
shape   of  the   cavity  could  be slowly  altered —  perhaps    by the
plate of ice, squeezed between two flexible steel plates instead of
in a  wooden mould, being slowly curved.            On account of the
imperfection    indicated,  the fragments  exhibit  conchoidal  fracture
(concentric streaks).
   Between the two parts of the mould, and bent to its concavity,
there now lay  a  mass of ice divided    cracks into grains.

times as much     ;and between them there lay frequently fine
splinters of ice.  In one case the ice mass thus moulded, lying
in the hollow, was kept cold, and from time to time sprinkled
with water; in    asecond case      was placed where in the daytime

the night, remained between 0° and —2°, and only rose a little
above 0° in the afternoon.         la the first two cases the circum
stances were similar to those at the surface of a glacier ; in the
third, more like those which operate on the internal ice of it.
     In each case   I  obtained a mass of ice apparently pretty com
pact; only part of the fissures were still visible, though cer
                a
tainly not distinct.      I  could perceive no difference between its
appearance and that of the surface-ice of a glacier in the early
morning, before the ablation commences — at least, as far as          I
 still had the latter in my memory.         On applying a little force,
the whole could be severed by        the hand  into its grains. Placed
in the warm room, or in the midday sun, the network of fissures
became somewhat more distinctly visible, and the grains could
 now be more easily separated.          Their surfaces had no longer
 the form of conchoidal fracture, but were rough with irregular
 elevations and depressions, exactly as in the secondary capillary
 fissures, except that the unevennesses were finer and more nu
 merous.
      In these experiments, immediately after the breaking, con
 choidal surfaces only were seen ; after regelation and partial
 soaking had operated, only capillary fissures of the second order.
 Because all these processes take place simultaneously in the gla
 cier, therefore we find also their effects together in the glacier-
 grain.
      From the observations adduced it follows that the secondary
 fissures originate from the primary by a secondary process, which
 can be no other than regelation and soaking, because no other
 intervened.       Under the given circumstances, these processes
 produce     a wrinkling of the surface in the originally conchoidal
  (in the glacier, flat) capillary fissures.     Some experiments for
 the purpose of deciding whether it was more the one process or
  the other could be brought to no further conclusion.
      On the banks of the Havel and of the Miiggelsee, near Berlin,
  I  found in the thawing crust of ice a division into irregular ver
  tical prisms (often trilateral).    The ice had been formed during
  a fall of snow.     The prisms were partly separated by interspaces,
  and partly adherent; but the surfaces of nearly all of them were
  finely wrinkled, reminding one of the secondary capillary fissures.
  From the infiltrated water produced by the melting, furrowed
  surfaces also occurred, which must not be confounded with the
  plaited ones.
       The tray-shaped granular ice plate obtained in the experiments
  could, within certain limits, be bent exactly as is the case
  with the granular plates which, on hot summer days, can often
  easily be separated from the borders of the crevasses and parallel
  to them (reminding one of itacolumite) . When thus carefully

  bent, the same noise, proceeding from the sliding on each other
  of the grains, was audible as in plates of real glacier-ice. When
  forcibly bent more than the movement of the grains permitted,
 fracture gave origin to new primary fissures.        It     in all pro       is,
  bability, the reciprocal friction of the grains, some of which are
 strongly pressed against each other, together with the " rude
           "
 rupture      (or the origination of new fissures), that produces the
  noise often perceived (and first noticed                    by
                                                  Agassiz) in glaciers
 when otherwise deep stillness reigns — for example,          the night        in
 or early morning, ere yet the brooks from the melted ice have
 begun to purl and babble.
     The aspect of the granular ice obtained from the experiments
 is, at the first glance, exactly that of genuine glacier-ice, the sole
 difference being that there the size of the grain         more regular  is
 than could be obtained in our little experiment.
     Could we suddenly take away the property of regelation from
 the glacier-ice, the glacier would behave        its movements like
                                                              in
 sand, earth, or      heap of
                           a  gravel*.
    When, in the above experiments,          weaker pressure (stroke)

 fragments or grains.      The stronger the pressure, the more ac
curately must the ice conform to the cavity, and the smaller the
grains.     Each new fissure begins and proceeds where the cohe
sion   is least.   If there are air-bubbles in the ice, the capillary
fissures have tendency to strike through them.
                      a                                  Ice abounding

    To this the conditions in the glacier precisely correspond.      In
the upper parts the ice appears white through              multitude of  a

Through these water can reach the cavities of the former, and
freeze therein, and the air escape.      Thus the number of bubbles
diminishes, the ice becomes continually more compact as           moves             it
forward, and hence the grain larger.        In the upper parts of the

it myself) that, in   a glacier which has to follow a sharp curve in
the valley, the grain is smaller on the concave side than on the
convex one.       In the middle the pressure is the usual, normal
pressure,    on the concave side a maximum, and on the convex a
minimum ; there the capillary fissures are more numerous than
here : therefore this also is concordant.
     If these explanations are correct, it is clear why, immediately
below the limit of the neVe, a distinct glacier-grain never occurs
in the middle of the surface ; for these parts of the ice have never
 yet been compelled by strong pressure to considerable differen
 tial motions.     The greater the pressure, differential motion, and
porosity of the ice, the more will it be divided, and the volume of
the grain the smaller ; with the diminution of the pressure the di
 vision diminishes, and the volume of the grain increases.
     This theorem could have been arrived at by deduction ; it
 agrees with the facts known to me, and thereby commends itself
 to further examination.
     That the number of bubbles diminishes in the manner above
 indicated I will not positively assert.     We know the properties
 of glacier- ice only near the surface.      There is a vast interval
 between this and the knowledge of what goes on within the
 glacier.
      In the badly conducting mass of the glacier the cold of winter
  can only penetrate to the depth of about 8 metres. In the spring,
  where the first water penetrates from above into the refrigerated
  layer it is frozen and occasions an increase of volume (a swell
  ing) . But this is very limited ; it only affects the uppermost
  layers, and is confined to a few brief periods.
      M. Grad ascribes to the freezing of the infiltrated water in the
                                                                "
  capillary fissures, not only the enlargement, but also the crys-
  tallographic orientation" of glacier-ice, discovered by Berlin,
  and afterwards confirmed and generalized by MM. Grad and
  Dupre.     But he seems to me to form no accurate conception of
  how this is to be produced by the water freezing round the sur
  face of the grains.     It might be very difficult to do so.    I  am
  inclined rather to look upon the " crystallographic orientation "
  as a function of the pressure.     The ice masses of the lower part
  of the glacier, in which it has been observed, are not the same
  which in the upper part did not exhibit the phenomenon ; they
  are those which, during many years, have sustained the mighty
  pressure of the overlying layers of ice, now melted away. When
   we consider that, in a body the temperature of which is always
   near its melting-point, molecular       derangements readily take
   place, and  that there  is no lack of shocks which go through the
   mass of ice (such as occurs, for example, in the crash whenever
   a crevasse opens or closes), the latter notion becomes still more

496                     M. A. Helm     on Glaciers.
 probable.   The phenomenon observed by MM. Berlin, Grad, and
 Dupre,   that  in lamella? cut horizontally out of the lower part of
 the glacier coloured rings with a black cross are seen when they
 are viewed in the polarizing microscope, does not necessarily in
 dicate actual crystalline structure ; amorphous glass can yield
the same phenomenon through strains forced upon it by external
pressure.    It appears to me that the effect in the glass also would
necessarily be permanent, if the violent pressure had operated
for many years. Experiments on a small scale, for the purpose
of producing by pressure the crystallographic orientation in
pieces of ice, gave no result.                                   I
                                     This is not surprising ; for could
not, as many a glacier does, operate with a pressure of 5 cwt.
per square inch, or factors of similar magnitude. Already in the
27th volume of the Philosophical Magazine Sir John Herschel
conjectured a parallel arrangement of the optic axes, but not on
grounds corresponding        with M. Grad's explanation.
    I must not, however, omit to mention that, according to the
calculations of an Englishman (Canon Moseley) in the Philoso
phical Magazine for May, 1869, the resistance of the ice to the
shearing-forces of the glacier-motion would be too great for the
ice to be broken by gravity alone and thus the glacier to move
by its own weight.        If I  rightly understand the experiments of
Tyndall    and  my   own   on the  remoulding of plates of ice, the ice
therein and in the glacier is not compelled to shear, but to break
by the bending.        The shearing, tangential displacements take
place along    the  fissures  previously produced by fracture (bend
ing) . The very peculiar mechanical conditions of the ice seem
to me not to have been sufficiently considered in the calculation.
One of these is its extraordinary brittleness even at 0° C. ; the
same pressure which a mass of ice will sustain in a state of rest
for a long time without breaking, breaks it immediately a shock
is added.     Another is the occurrence of crowds of minute air-
bubbles, which must very much diminish the compactness of the
ice.   In the lower part of a glacier, where air-bubbles are almost
absent, we have the old, only half regelated secondary capillary
fissures, along which fresh fracture is easier : while in this region
the primary fissures are somewhat less numerous, the secondary
 (which are longer preserved) exhibit a peculiar abundance of
plaits. So many factors, unmeasured in their effect, and scarcely
known in their mode of operation, are involved in the mechanics
of glacier- motion, that the result of a calculation based on the little
that is known cannot possibly induce me antecedently to reject the
explanation by pressure, with which all the facts of which I have
any knowledge, and all that I have seen, agree so perfectly.        Ac
cording to the explanation of glacier-motion given by Mr. Moseley
(Phil. Mag. Jan. 1863 and Aug. 1869), the total motion must

be, on the average, equal in amount in the upper, middle, and
lower parts of the glacier, which is not the case.             As in no part
of the glacier, certainly not     at   the  lower   end, has   any (even the
least) upward motion ever been observed at certain times, the
line which, as a base, remains relatively fixed must, when the
temperature falls, lie at the upper end of the glacier ; when the
temperature rises, at the lowest point.             That with rise of tem
perature the lower end would remain stationary, and drag after
 it the whole long glacier-tongue (which cannot descend by its
 own weight), without its being rent transversely into single in
 dependent fragments,       I  cannot conceive.         The surface of the
 glacier undergoes more and greater variations of temperature
 near its margins than in the centre — now from reflection of heat
 from the sides of the valley, then from their shade, but especi
 ally through the winds (which in the centre arrive with their
 temperature already approximated to that of the glacier).               The
 margins    have   in  some measure      a more   continental,   the centre a
  more oceanic climate.       Hence one would think that the edges
 of the glacier would move faster than, or at least as fast as the
  centre, if variations of temperature effected the motion.
     I have not the remotest intention to summarily reject Mr.
  Moseley's views ; but I thought it admissible to state what at
  present appears to me opposed to them, in order to justify my
  continuing to hold Professor Tyndall's explanation.                Perhaps
  Mr. Moseley will be able to remove these difficulties and, especi
  ally by measurements of the interior temperature of glaciers,
  give his views a better foundation.
     In the Philosophical Magazine for March 1869, a " new
                               " is advanced
  theory of glacier- motion                        by Mr. Croll, which, as
  regards the shearing-forces,       is free from the difficulties of Pro
  fessor Tyndall's theory.       I    must omit a discussion of this
  theory, because     I do not yet clearly understand it.          According
  to it an explanation of the vertical arrangement of the optic axes
  would   be very easy.

     The theory of plasticity, as given by Forbes, led immediately
  to experiments with semiliquid masses.              At that time the dif
  ference between viscous and non-viscous semiliquids was neg
  lected.    Both yield to pressure ; but while the former extend
  on being drawn, and contract transversely, so as even to form
  thin threads, the latter resist change of form by traction or are
   torn across.     In the former the parts are rearranged by traction
   and by pressure; in the latter, pressure produces a rearrange
  ment, traction either no effect or division.             Ice is solid and
   very brittle ; neither by pressure nor by traction are its particles

 perceptibly displaced ; either their position is quite unaltered,
 or they are completely separated — the piece break?.           This pro
 perty is also possessed by glacier-ice.       Pressure does not alter
 the arrangement of its particles, but separates them through
fracture at the capillary fissures ; and all the ice fragments which
are traced out thereby (the glacier-grains) behave now like the
 molecules of semiliquid masses, which are plastic to pressure.
The glacier cannot possibly behave to traction* like a " viscous
body," because the grains partly are separated from each other
and have not, like molecules, a sphere of attraction surrounding
them, partly unite by regelation and then constitute an aggre
gate like a piece of water-ice, brittle.
    If with homogeneous semiliquid masses we would make ex-
periments on motion which can be brought into direct relation
with what is observed in glaciers, their molecules must be
merely displaced by pressure, and not merely displaced but se
parated by traction.        But in bodies of this class known to me
the pulling force necessary for separation is very small, less than
the weight of each single molecule ; and this gives them the
property of thin liquidity.         We cannot use them for experi
ments on glacier-motion, because, if a fissure were to ensue,
the weight of the particles at its margin would immediately
drag them down into       it,  so that no fissure could remain.
 I    see no simpler expedient than the following.              We must
procure  a   thickly  liquid  mass,  not homogeneous,       but consisting
of solid corpuscles adherent so that, drawn asunder, they are
easily separated, while yet the adhesion      is sufficient to neutralize
the weight of   a   small number of corpuscles, but not of wholea
mass.
    Wet sand, moistened powder, &c. would be such.               Through
other labours I      was first led to " killed
                                                " gypsum. " Burnt "
gypsum powder       is   seen under the microscope to be distinctly
crystalline.     Moistened     with water, after   a  little while
                                                                 it   sud
denly shows lively motion; the form changes almost momenta
rily, and other gypsum crystals appear. At the same time the
mass stiffens.     After  a  few seconds, a    multitude of new, quite
fine, needle-shaped crystals make their appearance, which, when
not disturbed, unite in beautiful radiate groups; they add to
the density of the texture formed       by the other, larger crystals,
and thereby  enhance   the  solidity   of the  stiffening mass.   The
moment of violent motion       probably that at which the crystals

the circumcrystallization  ensues,   fresh   water  in proper quantity
be poured in, and the mass be briskly stirred or moved, the
crystals cannot interweave themselves, but will remain single
and free ; the mass will not stiffen again, and may be kept for

any length of time in a thickly liquid state.        Dried by heat, it
becomes full of cracks and mealy.          Such   a gypsum paste the
potters and plasterers call
                              "  killed."
    Killed gypsum therefore consists of rod-like and needle-shaped
crystals only loosely adherent by the water in the interspaces j
it is  a mass of wet powder.
    By the addition of more or less water, any degree of thick
liquidity can be exhibited.      The experiments on the motion of
killed gypsum were conducted in the following manner.            Out
of potter's clay a glacier-valley, or several joined together    were
prepared, with windings and more and less steep, narrower and
wider parts, about 4 feet long; and then the gypsum paste was
poured in at the upper part, and this put into flowing motion
as slow as was desired by knocking at the base or by raising the
upper end.     With paste slightly liquid the motion was a simple
flowing ; the more thickly liquid it was made, or the smoother
the valley-sides, the more was the motion a compound of sliding
and flowing; and it could easily be employed so thick that the
 motion exhibited only a sliding of the whole mass along the
valley-sides.    Corresponding to the conditions in glaciers, a
 mean was preserved, which effected a motion compounded of
 sliding and flowing. The fissures produced by non-uniform
 motion are often as fine as a hair. If the water with which the
 gypsum is killed be previously coloured darker (for example,
 blue), these figures will all be still more evident, being filled
 with the coloured water, while the white gypsum will be only
 tinged. The. whole impression given by these gypsum streams
 is perfectly that of a glacier.     My honoured teachers, Professor
 Escher von der Linth and Professor Mousson, have viewed some
 of the experiments.     The following are some of the results.
     The Middle Wall of Compound Glaciers. — If nearly equal
 streams of gypsum be caused to flow through two valleys into a
 third formed by their junction, immediately at the confluence a
 depression is produced solely by the mechanical force of the
 motion, but a very little further on a decided central wall-like
 elevation which soon attains a constant height, and only after
 a longer course gradually disappears again.          Each of the two
 streams was semicircular in transverse section, about 5 centims.
 broad, and 2 centims. deep ; the united stream was 8 centims.
 broad.    The resulting central longitudinal wall had at its most
 perfectly formed part a breadth of about 13 millims. and a
 height of 3 millims.      The phenomenon is often very striking,
 but does not always occur in this manner ; it is veiy much influ
 enced by the angle of junction of the streams, the form of their
 transverse section, &c.
    This immediately    suggested the conjecture that a part of the

 500                         M. A. Heim     on Glaciers.
 elevation  of many a central moraine of compound glaciers is
produced, not by the underlying ice being protected from melt
ing by the debris, but in such a purely mechanical manner.
The central moraine would then, where the mechanical middle
wall is rising, increase in height more quickly than further on,
where the mechanical dam is already formed and attains no
further elevation.
    In the Aar Glacier, for a length of 1200 metres, the whole
  central-moraine dam is not covered with debris, but only
 crowned therewith; and this extent commences about 400
  metres below the confluence — exactly where in the 12000-fold
 diminished scale of the gypsum experiment a middle wall began
 to arise.   Afterwards the debris slide down the side and cover
 the previously clear declivity.     Whether, as in the gypsum
                               I
 stream, it sinks again, know not. Fig. 2
                                             (Plate VII.) represents
 the profile of a transverse section through the middle of the
 Lower-Aar Glacier, 250 metres below the union of the two
 principal streams — the Lauteraar (L) and the Fiusteraar Glacier
 (F); figure 3, one at about 1000 metres below the point of union ;
 and figure 4, one at 3300 metres further down.        A peculiarity
 of the Aar Glacier          is,
                          that (as shown in fig.      the moraine-

    Altogether the same as in the Aar Glacier, but much more
striking,  I found     the Steinlimmi Glacier where

                                 metres) and Thierbergli (2754).

    As in the gypsum experiments, certain irregularities in the

like the above are       by
                        no means to be expected in all compound

 § 21, 1841).
    Fissures of Displacement. — If across the surface of a stream
of killed gypsum a straight line be drawn of another colour, one
might have expected that, in consequence of the greater velocity in
the centre, it would be drawn out into a continuous curve with
its convexity turned towards the lower end of the valley, instead
of which we obtain a form like fig. 8. There appear displace
ment-fissures approximately parallel to the margin, especially
numerous near the bank ; and on these our line is broken, pro
ducing a broken curve.        A row of stakes driven into the ice, in
a line across the glacier, will not suffice to enlighten us concern
ing the corresponding condition there ; we must have a distinct
continuous line.        Such a one can easily be made by gathering
small dark-coloured stones and laying them close together in a
straight line. They form a line which cannot be disturbed by
the most violent shower of rain, because, through greater absorp
tion of heat, they immediately sink into the ice.       At the end of
 August, 1869, I, with the aid of my friend Alfred Kleiner,
 Stud. Med., and Joseph Maria Trosch, chamois-hunter of Ma-
 deraii, placed such lines in two different places on the Upper
 Rhone Glacier, and at the beginning of September across the
 Hiifi Glacier. When, three weeks later,       I again visited the lo
 calities, all the lines had remained quite entire ; but the interval
 was too short for a perceptible change in the form of the lines to
have been produced.         Hoping that our lines would last through
 the winter, and in the summer of 1870 more change of form
 would be visible, I descended the valley again.
                 I
    Although have not yet demonstrated the displacements, yet
 I          I
   believe have discovered displacement-fissures of the most defi
 nite character, especially on the Upper Rhone Glacier.         When
 the bed of a glacier is regular, we know that the principal fis
 sures proceed from the margin obliquely upwards towards the
 middle.      These may often have considerable breadth.         They
 are perpendicular, or nearly perpendicular, to the ice-structure
 (the blue bands) in the lateral parts.          Now, in the Upper
 Rhone Glacier, there is also a system of fissures which are partly
 parallel to the structure, and partly cut it at slight angles.   This
 system has hitherto remained unnoticed, because these fissures
 do not gape ; mostly they only offer space sufiicient to insert
 the blade of a pocket-knife, and at first sight may be confounded
 with the structure.      They penetrate the mass of the glacier, and
 can be traced downward in the deepest principal fissures.       They
 are very regular in their course — as far as we could trace them,
 always rectilinear — and are continued till they cut the bank at

an oblique angle, or disappear beneath the lateral moraines.—
which gives lengths of 800 metres and more. There are never two
very near together, but they are at nearly uniform distances (per
haps from 10 to 20 feet), like the displacement-fissures in the
gypsum stream.      We found by many excavations that the ice
is perfectly divided in these fissures, while it is easy to cut a
piece of white glacier-ice through which blue bands run trans
versely, and the structure does not destroy the cohesion.
    Where the structure cuts these fine fissures, many displace
ments which have taken place along them are directly demon
strable ; and in those which we have found, the fragment nearest
the middle was always in advance of that nearer the bank. See
fig. 9 : the structure-bands a and a, b and b, on the two sides
of the displacement-fissure x, correspond to each other.       From
different points of the valley-slopes we viewed the glacier under
different lights, in order to see the course of these fissures over
the whole glacier ; but at a little distance they cease to be vi
 sible, even under oblique illumination.      How difficult it    is,
                                                                   on
 the surface ofa  glacier, to take the bearings of these and  similar
objects, he only knows who has experienced it.        The enormous
 dimensions of the surface, the excessive number of great eleva
tions and depressions all resembling one another, the large open
 fissures one must go round, the attention he must pay to his
footsteps — all this renders the survey incredibly difficult.      On
this account I  was obliged to content myself with ascertaining
the course of the displacement-fissures on the eastern side of the
Upper Rhone Glacier.       1 afterwards found on other glaciers,
especially near irregular banks, similarly situated fine fissures
with quite the same character, but could not accurately follow
their course. They are met with chiefly where the motion                is
retarded at the margins more considerably than in             aregular
valley, as behind projections.        Fig. 10  shows  their course  in
the Upper Rhone Glacier    :   adenotes the displacement-fissures,

D  and  E  must occasion great retardation of motion in these
parts of the Rhone Glacier.
   In the gypsum stream the displacement-fissures, when nu
merous, may altogether replace the ordinary gaping fissures             ;
in glaciers they appear rather to be local phenomenon, while
                                             a
the gaping fissures are universal.  Whether the system of fine
fissures found on the Rhone Glacier      really the analogue of
                                                 is
the displacement-fissures in the gypsum stream can only be de
cided   by subsequent observation of the stone lines which we

 constructed : their situation on the Rhone Glacier is indicated
 by thick lines in fig. 10 : —one in the region of A ; the other on
the other side, above.
    In a somewhat more complicated experiment with killed gyp
sum, in which two larger and one smaller streams were brought
to confluence, longitudinal lines also were interrupted by dis
placements.      The middle wall of the two larger streams was
cut through obliquely by fine fissures at which the gypsum was
slightly displaced vertically.      In one set of experiments the
cracks corresponding to the usual glacier- fissures, which go ob
liquely upward from the margin toward the centre, were very
distinct ; but instead of being very open, they were more nume
rous.    In other experiments they appeared to be rendered un
necessary by displacements in the mass.          An attempt to photo
graph    all the fine forms  must  be  repeated.
    Expansions. — When a glacier, in consequence of entering a
wider part of its valley, can expand at its lower end, at the upper
part of the widening it throws out longitudinal fissures which,
curving to the borders, form at the lower end a radiating, fan-
 like system.     This is readily intelligible.   The pressure of the
middle portion, to which the ice can now yield, is radial, and
 carries the ice in a periphery having the end of the glacier for
its centre ; the fissures are thrown out perpendicular to the di
 rection of motion, and are therefore radiating.         Remarkably it
is not so in experiments with killed gypsum.            There two sys
 tems of fine fissures occur at the end, which cut one another at
 a constant angle of from 69° to 72°.        These fine fissures never
gape.     At them the lower parts     are displaced vertically upward.
 They are nearly similar triangles — one side formed by the border
 of the out-spread mass, the two others by a fissure of each of
the two systems.        The system of radiating gaping fissures in
 the glacier is here replaced by two systems of displacement-
fissures which cross one another.
    In wet masses so . small, adhesion is proportionally strong,
and more opposed to divisions than to displacements.           We have
already above encountered this preference in the killed gypsum
for displacements, which appears to me to be the cause of the
difference here — though perhaps it has a deeper foundation in
the essential nature of the substance.           Unfortunately   I was
unable to investigate other semiliquid non-viscous substances in
this relation ; nor do I know how far the angle of about 70°,
peculiar to killed gypsum, depended on the degree of thick
liquidity.     In glaciers I have not found any trace of a double
system, much as I have sought for it.         Fig. 1 1 shows the course
 of the fissures at the end of the Rhone Glacier; fig. 12, the dis
placement-fissures at the expanded end of a gypsum stream.

    Differential Motion.
                               — It has already been endeavoured to
refer   the    structure    of glacier-ice (the blue and white bands)
to surfaces of greatest differential motion.              This, like the ice-
structure, takes place at surfaces which have the form of spoon-
bowls laid one in another, the drawn-out end downward.                  Such
surfaces can easily be         obtained.      If in the  gypsum stream we
colour one layer differently, it will be seen, when in motion,
to assume this form.            The differential motions, however, do
not take place in these bauds, but cut them, as shown in
fig. 8. Professor Tyndall has already called attention to this
point. Whether the differential motion is greatest on these
spoon-shaped surfaces, or parallel with the sides of the valley
— in other words, whether "the direction in which the filaments
slide past each other will be obliquely directed toward the
middle," or parallel with the middle line, I have endeavoured to
prove by an experiment.           I will develope       it,
                                                         because  itpresents
points    of connexion      in another   direction.
    A  number of lamellar or linear solid corpuscles in            a  thickly
liquid mass remain quietly          in their position without any definite
arrangement when every part of the mass moves with equal ve
locity; the lamellae are in no wise all arranged (as has recently
been said) perpendicular to the direction of the flow — for ex
ample, in lavas.        A definite arrangement           only brought about
                                                        is
by   differential motion (when some parts move more quickly than
others).     This       everywhere the case where the mass flows in
                       is                                                   a
fixed bed.       There friction diminishes the velocity near the sides
of the bed (lava, mud-streams, glaciers). When lamella lies ina
a  flowing mass, the end of     is it
                                      turned to the more slowly moving
side moves more slowly,               kept back relatively to the other     ;
the lamella       isturned tillit   falls into the surface of greatest dif
ferential motion; and in this position             it remains.    Were it   by
accident to be turned beyond,            it would immediately be tipped
over, and again be turned in the same direction into the same
 surface, as at first. All lamella; in             a flowing mass arrange
themselves in the surfaces of greatest differential motion.
 I    cut an immense number of minute chips of wood, of about
a  square line surface and the thickness of stout paper.               These
were mixed with the gypsum, and the mass set flowing along
the valley-channel, and afterwards dried up solid (in which pro
cess,   it   true, the form was

position    of  the   chips   was  investigated.      Fig. 13  shows  the ar-
rangemeut in       a longitudinal section through the middle line           ;
therefore the surfaces of greatest differential motion are parallel
to the sides of the bed.          In the middle of the higher parts,
where generally the differential motions are much smaller, no
arrangement had entered.            If
                               the other view were correct, the

what plausible if we consider that at the margins of the gla
cier, where the motion is much slower, a heaping up of masses,
and in consequence a movement of them toward the middle
must take place.      This, however, is the case only at the upper
most part of the glacier, where the wide channel of the neve
opens into the narrower glacier-valley.         There the chief mass
moves toward the middle,         and at the margins only that is
 driven after which has plenty of room.          In the glacier itself,
as the undisturbed course of the central and lateral moraines
shows, it is otherwise.    The glacier behaves as a number of half-
 cylinders lying one within another, the inner sliding more quickly
down the valley than the outer ; there is no trace of heaping-up
at the margins. The only question            are these cylinders infi

the surface are never those of the glacier, because there             no   is
ablation,   and at the  progressing  lower end of  the  gypsum stream
the motion     is   rolling; while

of the cavity  a splendid system of transverse fissures is ob
tained, exactly as they are formed in neve-plateaux, which
are the boundaries of glaciers.     This system of fissures can
never be replaced by displacements.
   With all this a variety of thoughts, leading to further expe
riments, connect themselves — for instance, about an arrange
ment of semiliquid masses in a systematic series according to
mechanical principles, &c.     Perhaps I shall subsequently    re
sume the subject.    The experiments, still very incomplete, could
not be further continued on this occasion ; for as in a mountain-
stream the rubble stones move more slowly than the water, so
our labours are always outstripped by time.
                         3. On Structure.
  In    order to prove that the structure of glacier-ice (the blue
bands) is not derived from the stratification of the snow, Pro
fessor Tyndall searched for places where the structure and the
stratification might be seen together, and after long searching
he found them.       On the Upper Rhone Glacier, in the summer
of 1869 we had continual opportunities of repeating and con
firming his observation.       In almost all the fissures the snow-
bedding     was horizontal ; and  almost perpendicularly cutting it
the structure was visible; so that we could have wished Profes
sor Tyndall had first sought for it here; he would have sooner
found what he wanted to see.         The same was distinctly to be
seen abundantly on the Upper Trift Glacier, and even on the
little Glarnisch Glacier.
    A second proof of the difference between stratification and
the structure, and partly also a support for TyndalL's explana
tion of the origin of the structure, is the following : — I thought
to myself, " If a glacier with distinctly developed structure (lon
gitudinal, or much-drawn-out transverse structure) has after
wards to make a fall, the new transverse structure originating
at its foot must cut the already present longitudinal structure.
Were the structure a stratification, it could not cut itself."  The
Rhone Glacier, in its upper part, has already the ordinary struc
ture ; we therefore sought at the foot of the fall, in the " struc
ture-mill/' for crossed structure. So regularly, however, was
the fact not as I had thought, that the masses in the fall
tumble into considerable disorder, are many times twisted and
dislocated ; the old structure could not be traced throughout
its course, but was only partially distinct ; it was often not clear
to me whether   I  had to do with the new or the old.      However,
after long search and diligent cutting up of the upper white
crust   (it was a   splendid day at the end of summer), we
found an immense number of places, scattered over the whole

                      M. A. Heim       on Glaciers.                   507
breadth of the glacier, in which crossed structure was distinctly
visible — for example, in the fine ice full of white bubbles a blue
band one inch broad, cut at an angle of 40° by another of nearly
equal breadth, and others similar, even a complete system of
bands which crossed one another, as distinct as one could wish.
Further down the " structure-mill " the new structure was so
predominantly complete, that traces of the old were not easy
to find.
    In many other glaciers crossed structure is probably still
more readily to be found ; and every thing will be more regular
when the fall is not so wild and the structure is better developed
in the upper part than in the Rhone Glacier.
    The bounding surface between bubble-free (blue) ice-band
and bubbly (white) ice can be readily laid bare in a hand spe
cimen by a carefully directed stroke.           It immediately strikes
one that it is cylindrically grooved vertically.      At the first glance
the following explanation obtrudes itself:       —  The paths which, in
the formation of the blue band, the retreating air-bubbles have
taken are preserved, filled with ice, reminding one of kernels in
stone; and in isolated cases the air-bubble does not urge its
way quite to the top, it stays at the end of the ice-kernel which
marks its unfinished path.          How much this observation sup
ports Professor Tyndall's explanation of the origin of the blue
 bands in the white ice is obvious.       I made it first on the Upper,
then on the Lower Rhone Glacier, and afterwards found it con
firmed in other glaciers.      Fig. 15 (Plate VII.) represents a piece
of white glacier-ice in which the bounding surface of one of
the blue bands is laid bare.
    When the minute displacement-fissures are no longer opera
 tive as such, the water in them at length freezes to a bubble-
 free narrow ice-vein of at most 1 centim. thickness.             This is
 readily distinguished    from  the  blue bands   by its regular  course ;
 it has a somewhat different aspect; in addition to which it
 usually cuts the structure at a slight angle, as is frequently to
 be seen in the walls of the normal open fissures (in fig. 16, a is
 the ice-vein).    On the left side of the Rhone Glacier these
 glacier-veins are found pretty numerous both immediately above
and below the fall.     I have never seen on their bounding surface a
 cylindrical structure.     This is at once explained by their different
manner of formation.
    Far more suitable than any other glacier for the study of the
origin of the dirt-bands and structure is the Trift Glacier, which
on the Triftlimuii is connected as a neVe cap with the Rhone
 Glacier, but descends in the opposite direction, into the valleys
 to the north.    Its principal fall is incomparably more magnifi
cent and wild than that of the latter.           Thence in a length of

508           Mr. D. Vaugban           on Secondary   Planets
2000 metres, with a breadth of 1100, the glacier has a descent
of only 115 metres; this is followed by steeper, almost precipi
tous portions, extending 1800 metres.        From the Clubhiitte
(which  stands close above and  beside the glacier) one commands
a view of the whole, and can perfectly gather immediately from
Nature the explanation given by Professors Forbes and Tyndall
of the origin of the dirt-bands. The structure is so distinct
that it can be accurately followed throughout its course.     Never
have    I
        enjoyed so magnificent a mountain-scene      as this ; little
known, it surpasses in beauty all the larger glaciers           I
                                                                have
seen.
                               4. N(v6-snow.
   On the 25th August, 1869, we ascended, under a cloudless
sky, the Galenstock ; and on the 28th we walked up the whole
Rhone Glacier, and over the Triftlimmi.        There, all over the
                                               I
surface, the snow was finely ribbed as do not remember having
ever seen it before.  In two directions, at an angle of about 60°,
the snow was finely furrowed, and thereby divided at the surface
into little rhombs, the longer diagonal of which (perhaps 2 or
3 centims.) had in every case an east and west direction.     Fig.
17 shows their form.     The wind often produces something si
milar in the neve-snow; but the immense regularity and uni
versal distribution were nevertheless peculiar.

FROM
   earth,     it appears legitimate to pass to kindred researches
on the extent in which the close proximity to a great central
orb may affect the form of a satellite, the gravity at its surface,
 or its capability of maintaining the planetary structure.      On
this subject I partially treated in communications for the Phi
losophical Magazine about ten years ago. But it seems desi
rable at the present time to extend the investigations which I
then presented, as they will be found to have an important
bearing on certain questions of scientific interest, and the basis
on which they rest can be rendered more secure.      In supposing
that the same side of a satellite is always turned towards its pri
mary, there might appear some dealing in uncertainty ; for the
arrangement which our moon and other secondary planets ex
hibit could not be assumed as the result of a general law as
long as it was ascribed to special causes supposed to operate in
very remote ages.    The assumption might be more justifiable       if,

in accordance with modern doctrines, the ultimate effects of tides
on the rotation of a satellite were regarded as the cause of the
synchronism of its orbital and rotatory movements ; yet there
would seem to be too great a demand on hypotheses in claiming
for every minor world the possession of seas and the tempera-
rature required for their fluidity.
    A more certain, though perhaps a more slow cause of the
arrangement in question, will be revealed on considering how
a solid satellite, consigned to a small orbit and rotating in such
a manner as to present its opposite sides alternately to the pri
mary, must have its form perpetually changed by the attrac
 tion of the latter body; for these changes (even when they
proceed from oscillations of the internal matter with unim
paired elasticity) would have the same effect as tides in altering
 the rotation until it kept pace with the periodical revolution.
 This   I have shown in the Philosophical Magazine for December
 1 861 ; but it may be proved more easily by the aid of the modern
 doctrine of the definite relation between heat and motion.      In
 the case of the supposed secondary planet, with an incessant
 change in the gravity at its surface and in the pressure on its
 internal parts, the resulting oscillations must be accompanied
 by the production of heat ; and this being necessarily gene
 rated at the expense of motion, the rotation would evidently
 change until it became adapted for keeping the same side ever
  confronting the primary. The want of coincidence of the planes
  of orbital and diurnal motion and the eccentricity of the orbits
  would also be corrected by the oscillations and the calorific
  action resulting from them ; and the surface of the satellite
  would thus constantly assume a more tranquil condition, as the
  disturbance from the central body varied little either in inten
  sity or in direction.
     For producing and maintaining the arrangement so favour
  able to repose, the causes alluded to are most effective when a
  large secondary planet is in the closest proximity to its primary,
  and those extreme cases where stability is scarcely possible
  may be investigated with the least dependence on hypothesis.
  Such cases are also recommended for consideration by their
  connexion with certain celestial phenomena.      For maintaining
  the planetary structure of two large satellites in the region oc
  cupied by Saturn's rings, so great a density would be required,
  that the condition of the mysterious annular appendage must be
  ascribed to its proximity to the primary.      While also the re
  sistance of a space-pervadiug medium may be expected to con
  sign to an orbit too small for stability a member of some of the
  numerous planetary systems of the universe, an exact investi-
  gatiou will show that the great dismemberment must take place,

 510           Mr. D. Vaughan     on Secondary Planets
 not gradually, but in a paroxysmal manner.       These results, to
 gether with some facts respecting the light of meteors, furnished
 the chief grounds on which I have hitherto maintained that
 temporary stars are great meteoric displays attending the dila
 pidation of a world, its fragments sweeping through the atmo
 sphere of a greater central orb.       More positive evidence is
 afforded by observations made on the star which displayed its
 ephemeral brilliancy in the constellation of Corona in 1866.
     That hydrogen is the main constituent of the highest part of
 the solar atmosphere was first inferred by Dr. Stoney from
 theoretical principles, but has been proved more conclusively by
 the observations of late years.     As the same light gas is now
 known to exist in most of the great orbs of space, it must
 form the chief part of their external envelopes, in obedience to
 the law which gives fluids a position depending on their den
 sity, and which, from the great rarefaction and feeble expan
 sibility of the uppermost atmospheric strata, must overrule
the tendency which the power of diffusion exerts for produ
cing a uniform mixture of all aeriform collections of matter.
From their position in the outward envelopes of all great ce
lestial bodies, the most rare and attenuated elements must act
a most conspicuous part in such great meteoric displays as may
be expected to occur when a primary or a secondary planet,
gradually introduced into too small an orbit, undergoes either a
total or a partial dismemberment, and sends its innumerable
fragments through the atmosphere of the central orb.         As the
fragments sweeping through the upper atmospheric stratum of
the latter body would escape immediate precipitation     to its sur
face, and continue the production of heat and light during many
revolutions, and as large meteors must require some time to
partake of the high temperature which they impart to the re
 sisting medium, it may be reasonably expected that the peculiar
characters of hydrogen and of other rare gases would be im
pressed on the vast flood of light sent forth during these ex
hibitions of meteoric brilliancy.
    This explanation accords with the fact that the temporary
star of 1866 exhibited, not only the ordinary spectrum of side
real bodies, but also another, consisting of four bright lines, two
of which indicated the presence of hydrogen gas in a high state
of incandescence.      The eminent observer to whom science is
indebted for this discovery, ascribes the phenomenon to effects
of burning hydrogen ; but the cause would certainly be inade
quate to call forth the wonderful brilliancy of the star, even
though the gases participating in the combustion could meet
in the exact proportions required for chemical union, and no
inert elements reduced the temperature by sharing the heat

which they took no part in producing; but if surrounding a
star equal in mass to our sun, an envelope of hydrogen tra
versed by meteors would acquire from pressure alone a tempe
rature many thousand times as great as that arising from its
combination with oxygen.          The disproportion in the efficiency
of the two causes will appear still greater when the slowness with
which large collections of different gases can mix, so as to afford
scope for the play of affinity, is contrasted with the rapidity with
which a host of meteors in the supposed case would make their
terrific influence felt throughout an extensive region of a solar
or a planetary atmosphere.
                                                                 I
      In investigating their form and stability in small orbits, shall
regard the satellites as fluid ; for when their size is considerable
 the resistance of solid matter cannot occasion any wide depar
 ture from a figure of equilibrium.      The mechanical theory of the
 resistance of solids shows that passive strength increases in a
 less rapid ratio than weight, and that large structures are weaker
 in proportion to their size than smaller ones. But in bodies as
 large as worlds the restraint from solidity is far less than that
 given by theoretical estimates, as a strain extending over many
 hundred miles must fall on some localities in an undue proper-
  portion ; and in the planetary structure rents would be gradually
 produced, its several parts yielding in succession to a force which,
  if duly distributed     as theory supposes, might be successfully
  resisted by the solid mass.      Accordingly, in questions relating
  to the form of a large satellite, the gravity at its surface and
  the radius of the smallest circular orbit which it can describe,
  no serious error can arise from adopting the hypothesis of flui
  dity. A source of greater discrepancy in the results for differ
  ent bodies would be found in the heterogeneous character of
  their materials, and in the variable rate at which density might
   decrease from the centre of each to its surface.      But the maxi
  mum      extent  to which   this cause  can affect the  result of our
   inquiries may be determined by selecting two extreme cases, in
  one of which the satellite is regarded as homogeneous, while in
   the other the matter at the centre is supposed to be infinitely
   dense in comparison with that by which it is surrounded.            A
   similar course has been adopted by writers on the figure of the
   earth.
       I shall take up first the case in which the central matter is so
   exceedingly dense that it may be supposed to monopolize the
    whole of the attractive energy, and accordingly that gravity at
   every part of the surface of the body is directed to the centre.

 was entirely annulled at the part of the surface in conjunction

    This determines the size of the smallest orbit in which the sa
 tellite could preserve its integrity.        If revolving a small distance
 beyond the surface of the great central orb, it could not hold its
parts together unless its mean density were more than seven
 times that of the primary.            To the constitution which have I
 assigned to the satellite many comets seem to approximate ; and
 from the degree of compression which these bodies exhibit, or
 from their power to resist the dismembering action of the sun at
 certain distances from him, we may hope to gain some informa
 tion of their masses and densities by means of formulae similar
 to those I have deduced.             But the investigation for comets
 could not have so well-defined a basis, nor lead to very certain
 results, as the shape which their attenuated matter assumes de
 pends not on gravity alone, but on forces which seem removed
 from the domain of scientific inquiry.
    For some of the questions involved in the case of a homoge
 neous satellite, an approximate solution was given in my com
  munications to the Philosophical Magazine for December 1860

                            in Small Orbits.                        515
and   April 1861.     For  a  more complete and accurate investiga
tion some of the formulae which I then employed will be found
necessary ; and these I will briefly deduce. While retaining the
same notation as in the preceding case, I shall put P, Q, and R
for the force of the satellite's attraction at the extremities, of the
axes, the major axis ranging with the centre of the primary.
That the figure of equilibrium is an ellipsoid will be rendered
evident by a comparison of the results to which this hypothesis
leads.     Regarding the body as an ellipsoid, its attraction at the
point   of the surface represented by x, y, and z will, by a well-
known theorem, have the following components in directions
parallel to each axis :

    The ellipticity at a given distance from the primary may be
 found by the foregoing equations ; but my main object is to de
 termine the greatest ellipticity which the body could exhibit, and
 the radius of the smallest circular orbit in which it could main
 tain its integrity.      Now equilibrium ceases to be possible on
 the surface of the satellite, not when the disturbance of the cen
 tral orb wholly neutralizes gravity in the direction of the axis A,
 but when it becomes too great to serve as a counterpoise to the
 forces acting in the direction of A and C.           This disturbance is
                     p8
 proportional to    ^;    and accordingly    the maximum value which,
 for different degrees of elongation,       must be given by the last
 equation to ~    , will enable us to express, in terms of the radius
 of the primary, the radius of the smallest circle which the
 satellite cau describe.      In the Philosophical Magazine for De
 cember 1860 I made, on this principle, an approximate estimate
 of the size of the smallest orbit, regarding the satellite as a pro
 late spheroid ; but for strict accuracy in calculating this item, and
 also the ratio of the principal axes of the body, it is necessary to
 have recourse to elliptic integrals.
     For the sake of brevity,     I shall avail myself of the results of
 the investigation which Legendre has given for the attraction of
 a homogeneous ellipsoid, in his Exercices de Calcul Integral,

the deviation from a true sphere to arise from the sole action of

 LXV.     On Double Refraction.      By the Hon. J. W. STRUTT,
                 Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge*.

          former               I
                            have shown that, of the various hypo
IN theses which might        be made to explain the diminished ve
locity of light in transparent matter, only one can be reconciled
with the observed laws regulating the intensity of polarized
light scattered in different directions from an assemblage of par
ticles whose diameters do not exceed a small fraction of the wave
length. We are forced to suppose that the difference between
media which is the cause of refraction is a dynamical and not a
statical difference, that the rigidity or force with which the
aether resists distortion is absolutely invariable.      In this view
there is nothing novel.      Fresnel distinctly adopts it in the in
vestigation of his celebrated formulae for the intensities of re
flected light ; and, what is more important, Green's rigorous
 mechanical theory of reflections      J
                                      is based on the same assump
 tion. Cauchy also, to whom much of the credit really due to
 Green has been transferred, starts from the principle of conti
 nuity of movement, which asserts that in the passage from one
 medium to another there is no break in the continuity of the
 values, either of the displacements or of their differential coeffi
 cients.   I believe that Cauchy has nowhere explained the ground
 or significance of his principle ; but it is easy to see that to as
 sume the continuity of strain is equivalent to asserting a com
plete continuity of statical properties, so that, as has been pointed
out by Haughton§, Cauchy's theory is essentially the same as
Green's.
    On the other hand, MacCullagh and Neumann have founded
their investigations of reflection on the hypothesis that the dif
ference between media is statical and not dynamical.         There     is,

however, no difficulty in showing that their hypothesis is as in
consistent with the phenomena of regular reflection as it is with
those of diffraction from small particles, as I may perhaps ex
plain in detail on another occasion.          But there is one argument
urged by them against the rival view which deserves the greatest
attention.     How, they ask, can double refraction be accounted
for if the elastic forces brought into action by a given deforma
tion of the aether are the same in all cases ? It is well known
that all the theories of double refraction hitherto given by
Fresnel and his followers assume expressly that within a doubly
refracting medium the elasticity varies in different directions.
 How is it possible, in investigating the laws of reflection from
the surface of isotropic media, to suppose that the statical con
dition of the aether is invariable, and then, when we come to
double refraction, to turn round and say that in them the aether
has a rigidity dependent on the direction of displacement ?              I
am not surprised at the importance attached by MacCullagh and
Neumann to this objection.          Fresnel and Green's investigations
of reflection are indeed absolutely inconsistent with the received
views as to the cause of double refraction.             We find ourselves
then in this position : either we must give up Green's theory of
reflection, which is the nnly one hitherto proposed, or easily con
ceivable, capable of meeting the facts of the case ; or else we
must abandon the ideas of Fresnel as to the mechanical cause of
double refraction.
    MacCullagh and Neumann were consistent, though, as be           I
lieve, consistently wrong.        They rejected the hypothesis of a
constant rigidity and variable density as incompatible with the
existence of double refraction.        How, indeed, conceive a density
different   in different directions  ?
    Fresnel and Green were inconsistent. The latter has given
two rigorous theories of double refraction* which differ from
one another in important points, but agree in this, that neither
of them can be reconciled with his explanation of reflection ;
for both assume that the forces which resist displacement within
a crystal vary according to the direction of displacement.           Pre
cisely  the  same   remark   applies  to  the  investigations of Cauchy.
    It will readily be anticipated that, having the strongest grounds
for believing that the rigidity of the aether is constant whether it
be free as in vacuum or entangled with the molecules of matter,
I  adopt the latter of the two alternatives already mentioned, and
look in another direction for the explanation of double refraction.
In taking a step which may seem retrograde, I would remark that
we are not abandoning a theory in itself very complete or satis
factory.     Fresnel's explanation of double refraction will always

be considered worthy of his great genius ; but it is well known
that as a rigorous mechanical theory it will not bear criticism.
Nor do the attempts that have been made to improve upon it
carry the mark of truth.                                I
                                 On this point refer to the excellent
report   on  double   refraction   by Professor Stokes in the British
Association's Report for 1862, and will only say that the ana
logy between the vibrations of the aether and those which may
take place in solids, so striking as long as we confine ourselves
to ordinary media, seems to break down when we pass on to
consider the case of crystals.          For Green has shown that the
elasticity of a crystallized medium depends in general on twenty-
one constants*, while the phenomena of double refraction in
biaxal crystals involve only six.         It is true that, by assumptions
more or less arbitrary, the redundant constants may be got rid
of, and the result manipulated so as to agree very well with ob
servation ; but no one, 1 suppose, would consider a theory arrived
at in such a manner altogether            satisfactory.    At any rate this
is not the opinion of Professor Stokes, who says that in his be
lief the true theory of double refraction is yet to be found.
    We have, then, to consider this question : Can double refrac
tion be explained if the statical properties of the aether are inde
 pendent of the associated matter ?             Can we suppose that the
 density within a crystal is a function of the direction of vibra
 tion ? I answer, yes.       The absurdity is apparent only, and dis
appears on more attentive examination.                As     I
                                                           am conscious the
position is one that will need all the light that can be thrown
upon    it,I  think  it well to give an illustration of         comparatively
                                                                 a
 simple   character  which    occurred     to me   at  an early stage of this
 inquiry, and which was of great use in showing me in                  general
                                                                          a
 way the possibility of the kind of explanation             was in search of.

           a
 space that its centre of inertia          free to move in any direction,

point with      aforce symmetrical all round and proportional to
 the displacement.        The arrangement may be supposed to be
 such that the body always retains its parallelism.               Under these
circumstances,      avibration may be performed in any direction,
and its period       the same
                    is            in all cases. If the inertia of the body
be increased, the only result can be that the motion will become
more sluggish and the period longer.              Here we have the ana
logue of singly refracting media.            But now suppose that instead
of moving in free space the body              immersed in
                                                is               fluid of sen

body, and that in a manner dependent on the direction of vibra
tion. An extreme case will make this evident.            Suppose that
the ellipsoid degenerates into a circular disk of inconsiderable
thickness.     It is clear that if the vibration be performed in a
line perpendicular to the disk, the fluid, which cannot readily
pass from the one side to the other, will greatly impede the
motion — that       is,

here of loss of energy from friction or viscosity.

disk, the fluid has no effect and might as well not be there. We
see, then, that,'4to all intents and purposes, the disk has    density,                a
or rather inertia, of variable magnitude dependent on the line of
 vibration, and symmetrical round an axis, and are reminded of                                  a
 uniaxal crystal.     Next suppose that we try to make the disk                                vi
 brate in  a line oblique to itself.       would at once appear that
                                                     It
 such a  vibration cannot be performed without an additional con
 straint, which we may suppose applied.         The system would then
 perform pendulous vibrations whose period            function of the

 position  of  the  line   in which  the centre  of inertia   made to              is

When 6=0, let T=T,           ; when   0=90°, let         r=rt;     then
   There   is,of course, one case which does not bring out the pe
culiarity for  whose sake the illustration      brought forward,
                                                         is                          I

   From the problem generally we may infer that there         nothing       is
absurd in the idea of an inertia varying       with  the direction  of
motion, and that the want of symmetry causing double refrac
tion may be attributed with as great probability to the dynamical
as to the statical conditions of the question.    We know nothing
about the real nature of the tether, and,   possible, still less about

probable that the relatively considerable effect of ponderable
 matter is   due to its action rather on the small quantityfthe
 inertia)  than on the great quantity (the rigidity)               ?
    Instead, then, of assuming for the energy of the medium
let us take the most general quadratic function of         i),   contain
                                                                   |,       f,

may be that the energy cannot be expressed at all as the sum of
parts corresponding to the various elements of the Eether.          Ordi
nary   chromatic   dispersion    and  rotatory polarization,    which                 is   a
phenomenon of the same nature, show that the mutual influence
of the parts      not restricted to

as vanishingly small in comparison with the wave-length; and

tion which is   a circle ;  but the other is not a true ellipse. Within
a uniaxal   crystal  one   ray always follows the ordinary law.
   In ordinary media the transversal vibrations can be propagated
without any tendency to produce dilatation (positive or negative).
But it is not so here. Suppose in our illustration that the centre
of the ellipsoid is constrained to move in a certain plane.              We
should find two directions of possible vibration and two corre
sponding periods, just as for light in a crystal.              The question
presents itself, What in the latter case takes the place of the ex
ternal constraint ?      The resistance oftheather to compression — is
the answer. Any part of the aether during the passage of a trans
verse wave over it tends (except in particular cases) to move nor
mally ; but the tendency is shared by all the other parts in the
same sheet parallel to the wave-front.             The motion, therefore,
cannot be actually performed, because it would involve a com
pression of the medium, which by hypothesis requires an infinite
force.   The pressure p, however, is not without effect ; for it
modifies the reflection and refraction when light enters a crystal,
and it is probably closely connected with the oblique propagation
of a ray in the interior. The actual direction of a ray is to be
found from the wave-surface, just as in Fresnel's theory.
   I  had got about as far as this in my original work when, on
reference to Professor Stokes's report,         I  was greatly surprised to
find allusions to a theory of double refraction mathematically, if
not physically, identical with that here advanced.              After insist
ing on the importance of precise measurements, he says : — To
                                                                        "
make my rrcaaing clearer,         I  will refer to Fresnel's construction,
in which the laws of polarization and wave-velocity are deter
mined by the sections, by a diametral plane parallel to the wave-
front, of the ellipsoid

to the two planes of polarization, and by their magnitude the re
ciprocals of the corresponding wave-velocities.              Now a certain
other physical theory which might be proposed leads to a con
struction differing from Fresnel's only in this, that the planes
of polarization and wave-velocities are determined by the section,
by a diametral plane parallel to the wave-front, of the ellipsoid

made by planes passing through the wave-normal and thetwo optic
axes, remains the same as before ; but the positions of the optic
axes themselves, as determined by the principal indices of refrac
tion, are somewhat different; the difference, however, is but
small if the differences between a*, i2, c* are a good deal smaller
than the quantities themselves.      Each principal section of the
wave-surface, instead of being a circle and an ellipse, is a circle
 and an oval, to which an ellipse is a near approximation.      The
 difference between the    inclinations of the  optic axes  and  be
tween the amounts of extraordinary refraction in the principal
 planes, on the two theories, though small, are quite sensible
 in observation, but only on condition that the observations are
 made with great precision.     We see from this example of what
 great advantage for the advancement of theory observations of
 this character may be."
   And again   :   —
    "The curious and unexpected phenomenon of conical refraction
has justly been regarded as one of the most striking proofs of
the general correctness of the conclusions resulting from the
theory of Fresnel.      But    I wish to point out that the pheno
menon is not competent to decide between several theories lead
ing to Fresnel's construction as a near approximation                We
see, therefore, that the limitation of the number of tangent
planes to the wave-surface which can be drawn in a given direc
tion on one side of the centre to two, or at the most three, is
intimately bound up with the number of dimensions of space;
so that the existence of the phenomenon of internal conical re
fraction is no proof of the truth of the particular form of wave-
 surface assigned by Fresnel rather than that to which some
other theory would conduct.         Were the law of wave-velocity ex
pressed,    for example, by     the   construction   already mentioned
 having reference to the ellipsoid (12), the wave-surface (in this
 case a surface of the 16th degree) would still have plane curves
 of contact with the tangent-plane, which in this case also, as in
 the wave-surface of Fresnel, are, as       Ifind, circles, though that
 they should be circles could not have been foreseen.
     " The existence of external conical refraction depends upon the
 existence of a conical point in the wave-surface, by which the inte
 rior sheet passes to the exterior.     The existence of a conical point
 is not, like that of a plane curve of contact, a necessary property
 of a wave- surface. Still it will readily be conceived that if Fresnel's
 wave-surface be, as it undoubtedly        is,
                                             at least  a near approxima

     Between the theory here advanced and that of Fresnel obser
  vation ought to decide ; but it does not appear that any experi
 ments hitherto made are competent to do so.                As Professor
  Stokes points out, all the measurements which are to be com
 bined in one calculation should refer to the same specimen of the
 crystal ; otherwise an element of uncertainty is introduced suffi
 cient to render the application of the test ambiguous.           Should
 the verdict go against the view of the present paper, it is hard
 to see how any consistent theory is possible, which shall embrace
 at once the laws of scattering, regular reflection, and double
 refraction.
              LXVI.     Boiling-points of Organic Bodies.
                        By F. BURDEN, Esq.*
             it was observed that the boiling-points of      each homo
 SINCE logous  series of organic bodies was higher for every addition
 to the substance of CHS, several continental chemists (but espe
 cially M. Kopp) have tried to discover the law which connects
 the boiling-point with the composition.         No proportionate rela
 tion has yet been found to connect different series ; and yet I
 believe I can show that the greater number of those organic
bodies which contain only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen obey a
law of great generality and simplicity, and that there are reasons
for believing that further experiments will reduce the number of
exceptions.
    It has been calculated by Joule and Clausius, on the hypo
thesis of a motion of translation in gaseous molecules, that the
velocity of the atoms of hydrogen necessary to balance a pres
sure of 15 Ibs. per square inch at the temperature of 0° C. is
6050 feet per second. And it has been assumed by them, on
mechanical grounds, and verified experimentally by Graham, that
the product of the specific gravity of any gas upon the square of
the velocity is a constant, under the same circumstances of tem
perature and pressure.        As the specific gravity of hydrogen is
taken as unity,    this constant   must be 36,602,500. The velocity
of the molecules of any vapour at 0° C. can therefore be obtained
by dividing this constant by the specific gravity and extracting
the square root.      In this way was calculated the fourth column
of the accompanying Tables.
    It has been further deduced from known laws that this velocity
                     * Communicated
                                       by the Author.

     Mr. F. Burden    on the Boiling-points of Organic Bodies.      529
is increased by ^fa of the velocity at 0° C. for each degree the
vapour is raised above this point.           Therefore the velocity of
the molecules of any vapour at its boiling-point may be calcu
lated by dividing the number in the fourth column by 273, mul
tiplying the quotient by the number which indicates the boiling-
point, and adding the result to the number in the fourth column.
By this means were obtained the numbers in the sixth column
 of the Tables.
     A comparison of the Tables for paraffins, defines, aromatic
 and other hydrocarbons, and the ethers (simple, mixed, and com
 pound) shows such a uniformity as clearly indicates a law. The
 very small difference is less than might have been expected from
 the difficulties in the way of obtaining the exact boiling-points.
     The law which I would deduce from these results may be ex
 pressed thus : —When any hydrocarbon or oxygen ether in a
 state of vapour, under a barometric pressure of 760 millims., is
 gradually cooled until the velocity of its molecules is reduced to
 1 140 feet per second, then, and not till then, has the force of
 cohesion power to condense it into a liquid.
     It is an easy algebraical deduction from this that the boiling-
 point of any of these bodies may be found by multiplying the
 square root of the specific gravity by a constant which          I have
  calculated at 51 -5, and deducting 273°; and whatever may be
                                           I
  thought of the hypothesis by which have endeavoured to con
  nect the facts with molecular theories, the fact remains that by
 this formula a Table of boiling-points for these bodies may be
  constructed which will not differ from the results of experiment
  more than these differ from one another.          As a proof of this, I
  have added a number of supplemental Tables, in which the cal
  culated boiling-points are compared with those observed by the
 experimenter whose name follows.
      The remaining Tables show a considerable difference from
  these results.     The alcohols and acids especially give a much
  higher velocity at their boiling-points.        There are grounds for
  believing, however,    that these  series   are  not so exceptional as
  they at first appear.      M. Bineau, in a paper in the Comptes
 Rendus, states that the acids belonging to the series H OH**""1' 0s
  exhibit a remarkable variation in the volume of vapour which
  they furnish at different temperatures.       Thus formic acid at its
  boiling-point has a specific gravity of 46 in place of 23, and re
  gains its proper bulk only at a temperature of 213°.             Acetic
   acid at its boiling-point has a specific gravity of 57 instead of 30.
   If we make the alteration required by these facts in the Table for
   acids, formic acid will show at its boiling-point a velocity of
   1160 feet, and acetic acid a velocity of 1,134 feet per second.
      The experiments of M. H. Herwig show that ethyl alcohol

which constitute the curve of curvature, the geodesic line         in                                                is

 third limiting kind, the lines which pass through an umbilicus :
 any such geodesic line passes through the opposite umbilicus,
 and is in general an infinite curve passing an infinite number of
 times alternately through the two umbilici; but possibly it is in
 particular cases a reentrant curve passing a finite number f
 times through the two umbilici.         I annex a figure giving a
 general idea of the configuration of the geodesic lines drawn in
 different directions from a given point P on the surface of the
ellipsoid : this is drawn (as it were) on the plane of the greatest
 and least axes ; but it is not a perspective or geometrical repre
 sentation of any kind, but a mere diagram for the purpose in
 question.    We have A, A, B, C, C the extremities of the axes ;
  U,, U9, U3, U4 the umbilici; P the point on the surface; 1 P2
  and 1 P 4 the curves of curvature through P, viz. these are ovals
  containing the umbilici Uu Ug and Uj, U4 respectively.         Then
 U ,P Us and U2P U4   are the limiting geodesies passing through th
 umbilici ; the line T P T' represents a geodesic line of the one
 kind, viz. this at T touches an oval (curve of
                                                   curvature) U, U^
 and at T' the conjugate oval              Similarly  S P S' is a geo
                                 U2 VB.
 desic line of the other kind, viz. this at S touches an oval
                                                                (curve
 of curvature) U, Uj, and at S' the conjugate oval USU4; the
  dotted figure-of-eight curves are the loci of the points of con
tact T, T', S, S'.

  the Sun.   By Lieut. AUGUSTUS MOUSE DAVIES, B.A., R.A., fyc.
      Longmaus, 1871.
''PHIS    work, illustrated by nineteen plates, is, as its title imports,
-•-                              Based upon the assumption, which the
       nearly pure theory.
author considers he is justified " in making of the solar motion being
in reality a curve," he builds up his theory of the rings of Saturn
having resulted from the planet arresting groups of meteors which
it encountered as they descended towards the sun.
    The work is divided into sections, the first containing brief notices
of the successive theories which have been broached from the time
of Maupertius to that of Proctor, three hypotheses having been sub
mitted, viz. the solid, the fluid, and the satellitic.        In connexion
with the last, Lieut. Davies has the following remark : — " I have
thus far attempted to sketch very briefly the satellite theory of
Saturn's rings ; and here the question naturally arises, Whence has
this vast cloud of minute satellites been drawn, and how has it been
subjected to Saturn's dominion ? Has Saturn always been attended
by these magnificent rings, or has some fortuitous encounter with
space- wandering meteors enabled      it, at some remote period, to enrich
the splendour of its eight-mooned orb
                                              " The
                                               ?       remaining portion of
 the section  is occupied with considerations tending to show that, of
 the four large and exterior planets, Saturn       is more favourably situ
ated for arresting and retaining groups of meteors than either Jupiter,
 Uranus, or Neptune.
    In Section II. Lieut. Davies proceeds to determine the absolute
path of Saturn in space upon the assumption of the solar curve, and
 chooses for the epoch that in which the major axis and the line of
 the solar motion lie in the same vertical plane, the result of his cal
 culations being that Saturn's motion in space          always in the same
                                                        is
 direction as the sun's.
    Section III. contains the geometrical interpretation of the result
 obtained in the preceding section, from which             appears that the
                                                             it
 four exterior planets trace out progressive spirals in space.
    In Section IV. the author arrives at the conclusion that an       if
 encounter with meteors has occurred, Saturn, of all the planets,
 would be most likely to accumulate them as        a  ring system.
    Section VI. contains the investigation of the circumstances of the
 attachment of the meteors to the Saturnian system, from which
 Lieut. Davies finds that, at point 59,000 miles from the centre of
                                a
 Saturn, the velocity of the meteors      isabout 61,592'4 miles per hour.
 " Hence," he says, " we subtract from this their velocity in com
                        if
 mon with Saturn in     a     direction at right angles to their motion at
 this point, we   shall  have  33,378'66 miles per hour for the velocity
 of the  meteors   at  that point in their orbit round Saturn, their cal
 culated velocity being 33,714-3 miles per hour.           This is, think,
                                                                  I
  conclusive as  to  the  meteoric origin of  the rings."

     Having arrived at the conclusion that Saturn's rings originated
 from an encounter of the planet with a group of meteors, the author
 seeks for information relative to the period of attachment.         He con
 ceives that the Saturnian       meteors,  and those now composing the
 zodiacal light, entered the solar system together, at a period con
 siderably anterior to that of the sun's first luminosity, but not much
 anterior to the earth's early fluid state.          " Geologists," he says,
 " have given the duration of the period throughout which the earth
 has borne living species, variously from one to nine millions of years.
 We may therefore conclude that the formation of Saturn's meteoric
 rings has occurred not much more recently than two millions of
 years ago, and probably at a date not very much more remote than
 nine millions of years.      The earth's original fluid state was probably
 owing to a meteoric storm due to the entry of the meteors into the
 solar system."
     To the meteoric theory of Saturn's rings is appended a paper on
 the meteoric theory of the sun, in which the author considers that
 the source of energy from which solar heat is derived is undoubtedly
 meteoric, and that the solar spots result from the absence of me
 teoric streams falling into the sun, which make themselves manifest
     " willow leaves," — also that the
 as                                    periodicity of sun-spots is accounted
 for by a periodicity of the meteoric flights, fewer meteors falling on
 the sun during the maximum period of spots.
     We have in the preceding paragraphs endeavoured to give a faith
 ful analysis of the work before us. With regard to the assumption
on which the author's conclusions are based, we leave it with his
 readers to exercise their own judgment.             Mr. Proctor has lately
 broached a theory of solar eruption, in which he considers that the
solar coronal matter consists of meteors ejected from the sun, and
rushing through the photosphere with a velocity of 200 miles a second,
the initial velocity (generated at a point far below the photosphere)
being not less than 300 miles a second.              Lieut. Davies speaks of
the probable velocity of a meteor falling into the sun from space
just prior to its final dissipation on the surface as ranging from
246 to 390 miles a second.          The two theories are now before the
public, and will doubtless furnish material for further and closer
investigation.

of a Galvanometer-Coil from a single deflection of its own needle."

train or network of conductors, let the galvanometer and battery be
interchanged, another arrangement is obtained which will probably
be useful for a very different, although reciprocally related object.
Hence, as soon as I learned from Mr. Mance his admirable method
of measuring the internal resistance of a galvanic element (that de
scribed in the first of his two preceding papers *), it occurred to me
that the reciprocal arrangement would afford a means of finding the
resistance of a galvanometer-coil, from a single deflection of its own
needle, by a galvanic element of unknown resistance.           The resulting
method proves to be of such extreme simplicity that it would be in
credible that it had not occurred to any one before, were it not that
 I fail to find any trace of it published in books or papers, and that
 personal inquiries of the best-informed electricians of this country
 nave shown that, in this country at least, it is a novelty.         It consists
 simply in making the galvanometer-coil one of the four conductors of
 a Wheatstone's bridge, and adjusting, as usual, to get the zero of
 current when the bridge-contact is made — with only this difference,
 that the test of the zero is not by a galvanometer in the bridge
 showing no deflection, but by the galvanometer itself, the resistance
 of whose coil is to be measured, showing an unchanged deflection.
 Neither diagram nor further explanation is necessary to make this
understood to any one who knows Wheatstone's bridge.
     " On a Constant Form of DanielPs Battery." By Prof. Sir William
 Thomson, F.R.S.
     Graham's discovery of the extreme slowness with which one liquid
 diffuses into another, and Pick's mathematical theory of diffusion,
 cannot fail to suggest that diffusion alone, without intervention of a
 porous cell or membrane, might be advantageously used for keeping
 the two liquids of a DanielPs battery separate.          Hitherto, however,
 no galvanic element without some form of porous cell, membrane, or
 other porous solid for separator, has been found satisfactory in practice.
     The first idea of dispensing with a porous cell, and keeping the twe
 liquids separate by gravity, is due to Mr. C. F. Varley, who proposed
 to put the copper plate in the bottom of a jar, resting on it a saturated
 solution of sulphate of copper, resting on this a less dense solution of
 sulphate of zinc, and, immersed in the sulphate of zinc, the metal zinc
 plate fixed near the top of the jar. But he tells me that batteries on
 this plan, called "gravity-batteries,"     were carefully tried in the late
 Electric and International Telegraph Company's establishments, and
 found wanting in economy. The waste of zinc and of sulphate of cop
 per was found to be more in them than in the ordinary porous-cell bat
 teries.   Daniell's butteries without porous cells have also been tried in
 France, and found unsatisfactory on account of the too free access of
 sulphate of copper to the zinc, which they permit.           Still, Graham's
 and Pick's measurements leave no room to doubt that the access of
 sulphate of copper to the zinc would be much less rapid, if by true dif
 fusion alone, than it cannot but be in any form of porous-cell battery
 with vertical plates of copper and zinc opposed to one another as are
the ordinary telegraphic Daniell's batteries which Mr. Varley finds

 superior to his own
                         " gravity-battery." The comparative failure of
 the latter, therefore, must have arisen from mixing by currents of the
 liquids.    All that seems necessary, therefore, to make the gravity-bat
 tery much superior instead of somewhat inferior to the porous-cell
 battery, is to secure that the lower part of the liquid shall always remain
 denser than the upper part. In seeking howjto realize this condition, it
 first occurred to me to take advantage of the fact that saturated solu
 tion of sulphate of zinc is much denser than saturated solution of sul
 phate of copper. It seems* that, at 1 5° temperature, saturated aqueous
 solution of sulphate of copper is of P 186 sp. gr., and contains in every
  100 parts of water 33' 1 parts of the crystalline salt, and that at 15° the
 saturated solution of sulphate of zinc is of sp. gr. 1'44 and contains
 in every 100 parts of water 140'5 parts of sulphate of zinc — both
 results being from Michel and Krafft's experiments f.               Hence I
 made an element with the zinc below, next it saturated solution of
 sulphate of zinc, gradually diminishing to half strength through a
few centimetres upwards, saturated sulphate of copper resting on
this, and the copper plate fixed above in the sulphate-of-copper
solution.     In the beginning, and for some time after, it is clear that
the sulphate of copper can have no access to the zinc otherwise than
by true diffusion.      I have found this anticipation thoroughly realized
in trials continued for several weeks ; but the ultimate fate of such
a battery is that the sulphate of zinc must penetrate through the
whole liquid ; and then it will be impossible to keep sulphate of cop
per separate in the upper part, because saturated solution of sulphate
of zinc certainly becomes denser on the introduction of sulphate of
copper to it. To escape this chaotic termination I have introduced
a siphon of glass with a piece of cotton-wick along its length inside
it,  so placed as to draw off liquor very gradually from         alevel some
what nearer the copper than the zinc — and            glass funnel, also pro

level.    A  galvanic element    thus arranged   will  undoubtedly continue
remarkably     constant  for many   months     but

                                                        it
prevents    me  from  expecting permanence     for  years.   The zinc being
below, must sooner or later, according to the less or greater vertical
dimensions of the cell, become covered with precipitated copper from
the sulphate of copper, which finds its way (however slowly) to the
zinc. On the other hand,        if the zinc be above, the greater part of
the deposited copper falls off incoherently from the zinc through the
liquid to the copper below, where     it does no mischief, provided always
that the zinc be not amalgamated — most important condition for
                                           a

ley. Placing the zinc above has also the great practical advantage
that, even when after very long time

 the cell ; whereas if the zinc be below, it cannot be cleaned without
 emptying the cell and mixing the solutions, which will entail a re
 newal of fresh separate solutions in setting up the cell again. I have
 therefore planned the following form of element, which cannot but
 last until the zinc is eaten away so much as to fall to pieces, and
 which must, I think, as long as it lasts, have a very satisfactory de
 gree of constancy.
     The cell is of glass, in order that the condition of the solutions
 and metals which it contains may be easily seen at any time.           It
 is simply a cylindrical or rectangular jar with a flat bottom.         It
 need not be more than 10 centimetres deep; but it may be much
 deeper, with advantage in respect to permanence and ease of ma
 nagement, when very small internal resistance is not desired.     A disk
 of thin sheet copper is laid at its bottom. A properly shaped mass
 of zinc is supported in the upper part of the jar. A glass tube (which
 for brevity will be called the charging-tube) of a centimetre or more
 internal diameter, ending in a wide saucer or funnel above, passes
 through the centre of the zinc, and is supported so as to rest with its
 lower open end about a centimetre above the copper. A glass siphon
 with cotton-wick core is placed so as to draw liquid gradually from
 a level about a centimetre and a half above the copper. The jar is then
 filled with semisaturated sulphate-of-zinc solution.     A copper wire
 or stout ribbon of copper coated with india-rubber or gutta percha
 passes vertically down through the liquid to the copper plate below,
 to which it is riveted or soldered to secure metallic communication.
 Another suitable electrode is kept in metallic communication with
 the zinc above.    To put the cell in action, fragments of sulphate
 of copper, small enough to fall down through the charging-tube,
are placed in the funnel above.      In the course of a very short time
the whole liquid below the lower end of the charging-tube becomes
saturated with sulphate of copper, and the cell is ready for use.       It
may    be  kept always ready by occasionally (once  a  week for instance)
pouring in enough of fresh water, or of water quarter saturated with
sulphate of zinc at the top of the cell, to replace the liquid drawn
off by the siphon from near the bottom.          A cover may be advan
tageously added above, to prevent evaporation. When the cell is
much used, so that zinc enough is dissolved, the liquid added above
may be pure water ; or if large internal resistance is not objected to,
the liquid added may be pure water, whether the cell has been much
used or not ; but after any interval, during which the battery has
not been much in use, the liquid added ought to be quarter-sa
turated, or even stronger, solution of sulphate of zinc when it is
desired to keep down the internal resistance.     It is probable that one
or more specific-gravity beads kept constantly floating between top
and bottom of the heterogeneous fluid will be found a useful adjunct,
to guide in judging whether to fill up with pure water or with sul
phate-of-zinc solution.     They may be kept in a place convenient for
observation by caging them in a vertical glass tube perforated suffi
ciently to secure equal density in the horizontal layers of liquid, to
be tested by the floaters.

Sir W. Thomson       on a Constant   Form o/Daniell's Battery.       541
    An extemporized cell on this plan was exhibited to the Royal
Society ; and its resistance (measured as an illustration of Mance'a
method, described in the first of his two previous communications)
was found to be -29 of an Ohm (that is to say, 290,000,000 centi
metres per second).      The copper and zinc plates of this cell, being
circular, were about 30 centimetres in diameter, and the distance
between them was about 7'5 centimetres.         A Grove's cell, of such
dimensions that forty in series would give an excellent electric light,
was also measured for resistance, and found to be '19 of an Ohm.
Its intensity was found to be 1 '8 times that of the new cell, which
is the usual ratio of Grove's to Daniell's ; hence seventy-two of the
new cells would have the intensity of forty of Grove's.      But the re
sistance of the seventy-two in series would be 209 Ohms, as against
76 Ohms of the forty Grove's ; hence, to get as powerful an electric
light, threefold surface, or else diminished resistance by diminished
distance of the plates, would be required.        How much the resist
ance may be diminished by diminishing the distance rather than
increasing the surface, it is impossible to deduce from the experiments
hitherto made.
    Two or three cells, such as the one shown to the Royal Society,
will be amply sufficient to drive a large ordinary turret-clock with
 out a weight ; and the expense of maintaining them will be very
small in comparison with that of winding the clock.      The prime cost
of the heavy wheelwork will be avoided by the introduction of a
comparatively inexpensive electromagnetic engine. For electric bells,
and all telegraphic testing and signaling on shore, the new form of
battery will probably be found easier of management, less expen
sive, and more trustworthy than any of the forms of battery hitherto
used.     For use at sea, it is probable that the sawdust Daniell's, first
introduced on board the 'Agamemnon' in 1858, and ever since
 that time very much used both at sea and on shore, will still be
found the most convenient form ; but the new form is certainly
better for all ordinary shore uses.
    The accompanying drawing represents a design suitable for the
electric light, or other purposes, for which an interior resistance not
exceeding ^ of an Ohm is desired. The zinc is in the form of a
   rating, to prevent the lodgment of bubbles of hydrogen gas, which I

                           (Received  February 2, 1871.)
     The principle which I have adopted for keeping the sulphate of
 copper from the zinc is to allow it no access to the zinc except by
 true diffusion.     This principle would be violated if the whole mass
 of the liquid contiguous to the zinc were moved toward the zinc. Such
 a motion actually takes place in the second form of element (that
 which is represented in the drawing, and which is undoubtedly the
 better form of the two) every time crystals of sulphate of copper are
 dropped into the charging-tube.           As the crystals dissolve, the liquid
 again sinks, but not through the whole range through which it rose
 when the crystals were immersed. It sinks further as the sulphate
 of copper is electrically precipitated on the copper plate below in
 course of working the battery.            Neglecting the volume of the me
 tallic copper, we may say, with little error, that the whole residual
rise is that corresponding to the volume of water of crystallization of
the crystals which have been introduced and used. It becomes, there
fore, a question whether it may not become a valuable economy to use
anhydrous sulphate of copper instead of the crystals ; but at present
we are practically confined to the " blue vitriol
                                                          "
                                                             crystals of com
 merce ; and therefore the quantity of water added at the top of the
 cell from time to time must be, on the whole, at least equal to the
quantity of water of crystallization introduced below by the crystals.
Unless a cover is added to prevent evaporation, the quantity of water
added above must exceed the water of crystallization introduced
below by at least enough to supply what has evaporated.                  There
ought    to be a  further   excess,  because   a downward   movement    of  the
liquid   from  the    zinc  to  the  level  from   which the  siphon  draws   is
very desirable to retard the diffusion of sulphate of copper upwards
to the zinc.     Lastly, this downward movement is also of great value
to carry away the sulphate of zinc as it is generated in the use of
the battery.      The quantity of water added above ought to be regu
lated so as to keep the liquid in contact with the zinc a little less
than half saturated with sulphate of zinc, as it seems, from the
observations of various experimenters, that the resistance of water

semisaturated with sulphate of zinc is considerably less than that of
a saturated solution.       A   still more serious inconvenience than a
somewhat increased resistance has been pointed out to me by Mr.
Varley as a consequence of allowing sulphate of zinc to accumulate in
the battery.     Sulphate of zinc crystallizes over the lip of the jar,
and forms pendents like icicles outside, which act as capillary siphons,
and carry off liquid.      Mr. Varley tells me that this curious pheno
menon is not unfrequently observed in telegraph-batteries, and some
times goes so far as to empty a cell and throw it altogether out of
action. Even without this extreme result, the crystallization of zinc
about the mouth of the jar is very ipconvenient and deleterious.          It
is of course altogether avoided by the plan I now propose.
    In conclusion, then, the siphon extractor must be arranged to
carry off all the water of crystallization of the sulphate of copper de
composed in the use of the cell, and enough of water besides to carry
away as much sulphate of zinc as is formed in the use of the battery.
Probably the most convenient mode of working the system in practice
will be to use a glass capillary siphon, drawing quickly enough to carry
off in a few hours as much water as is poured in each time at the
top — and to place, as shown in the drawing, the discharging end of
the siphon so as to limit the discharge to a level somewhat above
the upper level of the zinc grating.       It will no doubt be found con
 venient in practice to add measured amounts of sulphate of copper
 by the charging-tube each time, and at the same time to pour in a
 measured amount of water, with or without a small quantity of sul
 phate of zinc in solution.
    As 100 parts by weight of sulphate-of-copper crystals contain, as
nearly as may be, 36 parts of water, it may probably answer very well
 to put in, for every kilogramme of sulphate of copper, half a kilo
gramme of water. Experience (with the aid of specific-gravity beads)
 will no doubt render it very easv, by a perfectly methodical action in
 volving very little labour, to keep the battery in good and constant
 action, according to the circumstances of each case.
    When, as in laboratory work, or in arrangements for lecture-illus

 is not used, it will be convenient to cease adding sulphate of copper
 when there is no immediate prospect of action being required, and to
 cease pouring in water when little or no colour of sulphate of copper
 is seen in the solution below.      The battery is then in a state in which
 it may be left untouched for months or years.              All that will be
 necessary  to set it  in action again  will be to  fill it up with water to
 replace what has evaporated in the interval, and stir the liquid in the
 upper part of the jar slightly, until the upper specific-gravity bead
 is floated to near the top by sulphate of zinc, and then to place a
 measured amount of sulphate of copper in the funnel at the top of
 the charging-tube.

     " Measurements of Specific Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics, in

  544                         Royal Society    : —
  the Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow."              By John
  C. Gibson, M.A., and Thomas Barclay, M.A.
      This paper describes the instruments and processes employed in a
  series of experiments on the specific inductive capacity of paraffine,
  and the effect upon it of variations of temperature.        The instruments
  described are the platymeter and the sliding condenser.          The former
  of these was, in a rudimentary form, shown to the Mathematical and
  Physical Section of the British Association at its Glasgow Meeting in
  1855, by W. Thomson.         It consists of two equal and similar conden
  sers employed for the comparison of electrostatic          capacities.    The
  sliding  condenser  is a condenser  the  capacity of which may      be  varied
  by known quantities by altering the effective area of the opposed
  surfaces.    By means of these two instruments, along with the qua
  drant electrometer, the capacity of a condenser may be determined
  by equalizing the sliding condenser to it.        The method of working,
 and the electrical actions upon which it depends, are described in
 detail. In order to determine the capacity of the sliding condenser
 at the lower extremity of its range, a spherical condenser, so con
 structed that its capacity could be accurately determined in absolute
 measure, was employed.         An apparent discrepancy in the results
 obtained, arising from an inequality in the condensers forming the
 platymeter, is then considered, and the method of deducing the true
 result investigated. A series of experiments are then described which
 gave 1-975 as the specific inductive capacity of paraffine, that of air
 being taken as unity, but failed to show whether this alters with va
 riations of temperature.      An improved form of condenser, composed
 of concentric brass cylinders with paraffine for the dielectric, and the
 results obtained from it, are then described.           The measurements
made at different temperatures show no variation of specific inductive
 capacity. In order to allow to the paraffine freedom of expansion
 with temperature, another form of condenser was employed, and the
same results obtained.       A series of experiments were then made on
the expansion of paraffine with temperature, in order to estimate the
 effect of this upon the capacity of paraffine condensers.         As a mean
 of the results, it was found that the linear expansion of paraffine at
 9° C. is -000237 per degree.        Some further measurements           of the
cylindrical condenser were made with the same result as before.
Thus all the measurements of this condenser made at temperatures
ranging from — 1 2°' 1 5 to 24°-35 C. show no variation of specific in
ductive capacity of paraffine with temperature.          This was found to
be l-977, that of air being taken as unity.
     In a note added to the paper a description is given of an improved
form of sliding condenser.

    " On   a Registering Spectroscope."       By Willian Huggins, LL.D.,
D.C.L., F.R.S.
    The short duration of    the totality  of the solar eclipse of  December

             Dr. W. Huggins    on a Registering     Spectroscope.       545
last, led .me to seek some method by which the positions of lines ob
served in the spectrum of the corona might be instantly registered
without removing the eye from the instrument, so as to avoid the loss
of time and fatigue to the eye of reading a micrometer-head, or the
distraction of the attention and other inconveniences of an illumi
 nated scale.
     After consultation with the optician Mr. Grubb, it seemed that
this object could be satisfactorily accomplished by fixing in the eye
piece of the spectroscope a pointer which could be moved along the
spectrum by a quick-motion screw, together with some arrangement
by which the position of this pointer, when brought into coincidence
 with a line, could be instantly registered.
      I  was furnished by Mr. Grubb with an instrument fulfilling these
 conditions, and also with a similar instrument with some modifi
 cations by Mr. Ladd, in time for the observation of the eclipse.
      Unfortunately, at my station at Oran, heavy clouds at the time of
 totality prevented their use on the corona ; but they were found so
 convenient for the rapid registration of spectra, that it appears pro
 bable that similar instruments may be of service for other spectrum-
 observations.
      In these instruments the small telescope of the spectroscope is
 fixed, and at its focus is a pointer which can be brought rapidly upon
 any part of the spectrum by a screw-head outside the telescope. The
 spectrum and pointer are viewed by a positive eyepiece which slides
 in front of the telescope, so that the part of the spectrum under
 observation can always be brought to the middle of the field of view.
 The arm carrying the pointer is connected by a lever with a second
 arm, to the end of which are attached two needles, so that these move
  over about two inches when the pointer is made to traverse the spec
  trum from the red to the violet. Under the extremity of the arm
  fitted with the needles is a frame containing a card, firmly held in it
  by two pins which pierce the card. This frame containing the card
  can be moved forward so as to bring in succession five different
  portions of the card under the points of the needles ; on each of
  these portions of the card a spectrum can be registered.
      The mode of using the instrument is obvious. By means of the
  screw-head at the side of the telescope, the pointer can be brought
  into coincidence with a line j a finger of the other hand is then pressed
  upon one of the needles at the end of the arm which traverses the
  card, and the position of the line is instantly recorded by a minute
  prick on the card. A bright line is distinguished from a dark line by
  pressing the finger on both needles, by which a second prick is made,
  immediately below the other.       In all cases the position of the line is
  registered by the same needle, the second needle being used to de
  note that the line recorded is a bright one.
       It was found that from ten to twelve Fraunhofer lines could be
  registered in about 15 seconds, and that, when the same lines were
  recorded five times in succession on the same card, no sensible
   difference of position could be detected between the pricks register
  ing the same line in the several spectra.

   546                       Geological Society:  —
      It is obvious that, by registering the spectra of different substances
   on the card, a ready method is obtained of comparing the relative
   positions of the lines of their spectra.
     Each spectroscope was furnished with a compound prism, which was
   made by Mr. Grubb, and gave a dispersion equal to about two prisms
   of dense glass with a refracting angle of 60°.

     The following communications were read : —
     1.  "  On Lower Tertiary Deposits recently exposed at Portemouth."
   By C.   J. A. Meyer, Esq., F.G.S.
     The author described some exposures of Lower Tertiary deposits
  made during excavations for the " Dockyard Extension Works
                                                                         " in
  Portsmouth Harbour.        The thickness exposed, exclusive of alluvial
  deposits, amounted in all to 127 feet.         The beds dip S.S.W., or
  nearly south, 2J to 3 degrees. The author grouped them under the
  four following divisions, in ascending order : —
            1. Clays and sands with pyrites                    36 feet.
            2. Argillaceous sands with Dentaliwm       ....    25 „
            3. Sands with Lingula                                8  „
            4. Clays with Cyprina and sandy clays      ....    55 „
     The author indicated the fossils contained in each of these divi
  sions, remarking upon the range of some of the species, and upon the
  apparent mixture of London-Clay forms with others usually regarded
  as characteristic of higher or lower beds, which occurs especially in
  the " £in<7u7a-sands." He suggested that, as the species found here
  present some slight differences from those occurring in other do-
  posits, the difficulty might be got over on Darwinian principles.
 The author considered that the fossils did not furnish any satisfactory
 evidence of the true position of these beds ; but, from stratigraphical
 evidence, he regarded them as being included in group 3 and part
 of group 4 of Mr. Prestwich's section of the Whitecliff strata in.
 the Isle of "Wight.      He concluded with some remarks on the su
 perficial deposits consisting of gravel and old and recent mud over
 lying the Tertiary beds in the section described by him.
    2. " Note on some new Crustaceans from the Lower Eocene of
 Portsmouth, collected by C. J. A. Meyer, Esq., F.G.S."               By H.
Woodward, Esq., F.G.S.
    Mr. Woodward, drew attention to the occurrence in the fossil
state of pelagic forms of Crustacea armed with long spines on the
latero-anterior angles of the carapace.
    Two Eocene forms had been described by Dr. Alphonse Milne-
Edwurds, namely Enoplonotus armatus sadPsammocarcinus Hericartii.

       Mr. W. Whitaker   on the Chalk    of Dorset and Devon.        547
    Two new forms, differing generieally from the above, but pro
bably referable to the same family (the Portunidce), were described,
under the name of lUutcliisoma (g. n.), E. echinata and 21. bispinosa.
    A third form, belonging to the Corystidse, was then noticed. This
family, represented in the fossil state by the genus Palteocorystes, is
well known in the Gault and Upper Greensand of Folkestone and
Cambridge, one species ranging up as high as the Macstricht beds.
The occurrence of Pal&ocorystes in the Lower Eocene is of great
interest.    Mr. Woodward named this new Pal<xocorystes P. glabra.
    3.  "On    the Chalk of the Cliffs from Seaford to Eastbourne,
Sussex."      By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    The author compared the chalk of the Sussex coast with that of
the Kentish coast, and stated that it consisted of the following divi
sions in descending order : —
1. Chalk with flints, o" great thickness.
2. Chalk with flints and nodular layers, weathering rough.
3. Chalk without flints, but with nodular layers, weathering rough.
4. Thick-bedded massive chalk without flints.
5. More thinly bedded chalk without flints, but with marly beds.
6. Chalk-marl, 50 or 60 feet.
    The highest of these divisions stretches as far eastwards as Beachy
Head, and forms the whole of the cliffs to within a short distance of
that point.
    4. " On the Chalk of the southern part of Dorset and Devon."
 By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    The divisions of the Chalk we-e traced by the author westward
from cliffs on the north side of Swaiage Bay to beyond Beer Head
in Devonshire. First the succession of the beds was shown to be
 as in the Isle of Wight, namely : —
 1. Chalk with flints, veiy thick.           4. Chalk without flints.
 2. Chalk with few flints.                   5. Chalk-marl.
3. Chalk-rock, very thinly developed.
     It was shown that the lower beds became thinner westward,
 until, at one part of the Beer-Head section, the chalk with flints
 rested at once on the Upper Greeusand ; and the following general
 conclusions were drawn : —
    That the chalk-marl thins westward, and its bottom part becomes
 marked by the presence of quartz-grains, showing perhaps signs of
 a less deep-sea character than usual.
    That the chalk without flints thins westward (from about 200
 feet in the Isle of Wight) until, in Devonshire, it is but 30 feet
 thick, or even less.
    The consequent nearness of the chalk with flints to the Greensand
 helps to explain the deposits of flints on some of the Devonshire hills.

     The following communications were read : —
     1. " On the older Metamorphic Rocks and Granite of Banffshire."
 By T. F. Jamieson, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author indicated three divisions in the metamorphic strata of

548                       Geological Society.
Banffshire : — At bottom a great thickness of arenaceous beds, more
or less altered into quartz-rock, gneiss, and mica-schist ; next a
series of fine-grained clay-slates, in the midst of which is a bed of
limestone ; and then again an upper group of arenaceous strata.
The author stated that the arrangement of the rocks is very similar
to that occurring in Bute and Argyllshire.       He remarked that the
general texture of the beds is fine-grained, and considered that they
were probably deposited in the depths of the sea, off the mouth of a
great river, the deposition of the argillaceous strata having taken
place during a period of increased depression.    The deposition of the
beds was said to have probably taken place after the formation of
the (Cambrian) Red Sandstone and Conglomerate of the North-west
Highlands, or in Lower Silurian times, the river by which the sedi
ment was brought down being supposed to have drained the great
Laurentiaa region to the north-west.      After their accumulation the
author supposed that " a glow of heat from beneath approached
                                                           "
them, causing expansion and the wrinkling of the mass into folds
running from S.W. to N.E.         The granites were considered by the
author to owe their origin to the fusion and recrystallization of the
arenaceous    beds.
    2. " On the connexion of Volcanic action with changes of Level."
 By Joseph John Murphy, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author commenced by discussing the chemical theory of vol
 canic action, which he considered he had disproved. He remarked
 on the coincidence of volcanic action with elevation of the surface,
 but stated his opinion that the elevation of one part of the earth's
 surface, and the depression of another are the results of a movement
 of subsidence in the following manner : — The interior of the earth
 is constantly cooling, and as it cools it must contract. But the cold
 strata of the surface cannot contract in the same proportion ; and as
they must remain in contact with the core, they are compelled to
form folds and ridges. The breaking out of volcanoes is duo to the
breaking of part of the earth's crust by these foldings.      According
to the author, " volcanic action is not the cause, but the effect of
secular changes of level ; and secular changes of level are due to the
subsidence of the surface on the interior, as the interior contracts
in cooling."
    3. " On some points in the Geology of the neighbourhood of Ma
laga."     By Don M. de Orueba.
    After referring  to the writings of previous authors upon the geo
logy   of the south of Spain, the author noticed a mountain-chain near
 Antequera, one branch of which, knownas the " Torcal," he de
scribed as presenting a very singular appearance from the huge
 blocks of stone of which it is composed.       The division of the rock
 into separate blocks, often of the most fantastic shapes, was attri
 buted by the author to denudation by water.         The " Torcal
                                                                  " con

formably on the east upon a fine-grained white oolitic marble of con
siderable thickness.         At the divisional line between the two forma
tions many Ammonites were said to occur ; and three of these were
doubtfully identified with A. giganteus, biplex, and annufatus. These
species would indicate the deposit to be probably of Portlandian
age.
     The plain of Antequera was considered by the author to consist
of Tertiary formations.          One of these, at the south of the city, he
regarded as analogous to the "Calcairc grossier."              He mentioned
indications of the presence in the vicinity of a Miliolitic marble, and
of a limestone containing Nummulites.              Between Antequera and
the Torcal, he noticed a small calcareous deposit containing many
forms of GrypJuva,          The paper was illustrated by photographs of
two scenes on the Torcal, and of several species of Ammonites.

ON THE SENSITIVENESS              TO LIGHT OP THE SILVER HALOID COM
      POUNDS, AND THE CONNEXION OF THE OPTICAL AND THE CHE
      MICAL ABSORPTION OP LIGHT. BY C. SCHCLTZ-SELLACK.
'T'HE      haloid compounds of silver, which share with so many other
  •*•
         substances  the property of being altered by light, are remarkable
from the fact that they are photographically excited by light ; that is
to say, they have the property of condensing mercurial vapour from
the air (Daguerreotype), or silver when being deposited from a liquid
(photography).         The photographic excitation is due to the chemical
change ; but as it occurs before the products of decomposition of the
silver-salts can be shown by other means, the photographic process
is especially fitted for investigating the chemical action of the various
spectral colours on the haloid compounds of silver*. All luminous
rays which act chemically upon a substance are absorbed, as was
shown by Draper ; since chemical and optical rays of 'the same re-
 frangibility cannot be separated, or rather are identical, they, of
 course, disappear as regards the eye.          Hence by the photographic
process we obtain absorption of light joined with chemical action,
 chemical absorption of light.        Chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver,
as I have previously shownt, may by melting be obtained in perfectly
clear masses ; in this condition they are only very slowly changed by
 light, and are especially suited for investigating optical absorption.
     I have found that optical and chemical absorption of light exactly
 coincide.      All colours which in a thickness of some millimetres exert
an appreciably optical absorption, effect chemical decomposition;           ab
sorption of light in these substances is always connected with chemical
 action.
     Iodide, bromide, and chloride of silver are sensitive to the ultra-
     *
        In what follows, the usual collodion process was used : collodion mixed
 with dissolved haloid salts was poured upon a glass plate, the plate dipped
in solution of silver, and after exposure developed by means of ferrous
 sulphate.

violet of the solar spectrum      ;  they are variously so for the visible
part of the spectrum.
    Chloride-of-silver collodion is only sensitive for the extreme violet,
as far as about halfway between Fraunhofer's lines H and G.
    lodide-of-silver collodion is sensitive to beyond the line G.
    Bromide-of -silver collodion is sensitive nearly to the line F.
Mixed iodide and bromide-of-silver collodion is sensitive to the line E,
as well as mixed iodide and chloride of silver.         The very remarkably
greater delicacy     of  mixtures   of bromide  and  iodide of silver has long
been used in practical photography.
    The optical absorption of transparent plates of these substances is
seen, on being examined spectrally, to be accurately restricted to
the limits given of chemical action.         This is specially the case with
 mixtures of iodide and bromide of silver. Chloride of silver is colour
less, iodide of silver bright yellow and transparent, bromide of silver
of a somewhat deeper yellow ; but the mixture of the two obtained
by melting is orange-yellow.           This difference in colour, which indi
cates the different delicacy of light, can be recognized by the preci
pitates : pure iodide of silver and pure bromide of silver are pale
yellow ; the precipitate with the mixed iodides and bromides, and
with the iodides and chlorides is intense yellow.
     I have formerly shown that the ultra-red heat-rays, which do not
act photographically, are not at all absorbed by the haloid silver-
salts; so that, including the heat-rays, the principle holds: — The ha
loid compounds of silver are chemically changed by all rays which they
absorb in appreciable strength.
    This connexion of absorption of light and chemical action pro
bably holds for all substances sensitive to light.         Moreover Herschel
 (from   experiments     on bleaching   vegetable  colours) and Draper (from
experiments on the decomposition of ferric citrate) have called atten
tion to the reciprocity of chemically active and transmitted light. —

    CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL CHANGES IN HALOID SILVER-
              SALTS BY LIGHT.          BY C. 8CHULTZ-SELLACK.
    Chloride and bromide of silver are decomposed in light, chlorine and
bromine being liberated in such quantities that they are recognizable
by the odour and by chemical reagents ; the dark-coloured product
 of decomposition is therefore probably a subchloride and subbromide.
 If a greater excess of chlorine- or bromine-vapour be admitted, the
colour disappears on continuing the illumination.             In the action of
light upon iodide of silver a dark coloration also sets in, although no
free iodine could be shown ; by a slight addition of free iodine the
coloration is prevented.
    As these decompositions depend upon the tension of the vapour of
free chlorine, bromine, and iodine, they can be regarded AS phenomena
of dissociation effected by light. The tension of dissociation of iodine
in the case of iodide of silver is then so small that iodine cannot be
directly detected in the vicinity.        As the tensions of dissociation in

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                551
crease in general with the temperature, this may also be expected in
the case of iodide of silver; and if at a higher temperature            any
liberated iodine be removed and collected, the reaction for iodine may
possibly be obtained. Moreover at a higher temperature              the far
darker coloration, and therefore the more powerful optical absorp
tion of the silver haloid salts, renders probable, as I have already
remarked, a stronger chemical absorption and decomposition.
                                     I
    By my previous experiments have not been able with certainty
to detect iodine in the current of air which has been passed over
heated and insolated iodide of silver ; a decisive result for these ex
periments may be expected with the use of the summer sun.
    Chloride of silver and bromide of silver may in the dark be ob
tained in clear lustrous crystals from their solution in ammonia, and
iodide of silver from its solution in hydriodic acid. If these crystals
be exposed in the presence of free chlorine (or bromine or iodine)
in glass tubes to the action of light, no chemical change takes
place, though a mechanical change is observable.              The crystals
of iodide of silver fall to powder; crystals of bromide of silver and of
chloride of silver become opaque and lose their lustre.        The deport
 ment of the clear transparent layer of iodide of silver, such as is ob
tained by iodizing a silver mirror, is similar.       The freshly prepared
clear layer changes in a few minutes in sunlight to a yellowish-grey
rough mass, which exhibits different colours in transmitted light,
 varying with the duration of the action : it first of all appears yel
lowish brown, then dark brown and very turbid, then red and green
 and blue, becoming considerably more transparent, and is finally of
 a pale bluish white.      The ultimate colour may, moreover, be differ
 ent, according to the thickness and colour of the layer and the inten
 sity of light.   These colours arise from diffraction of light, and de
 pend upon    the degree of pulverization of the iodide produced by the
 action of light.   If the air in the interstices of the powder be replaced
 by another medium, the layer impregnated with lac, the colours alter
 and mostly lose intensity.        It is probable that in what are called
 " coloured                 "
                                    colours also result from a change of
              photographs      the
structure.
     Most sensitive to mechanical change is iodide of silver when it has
 first been formed in iodine-vapour ; by lengthened keeping in the air,
 or by immersion in dilute silver solutions or other substances which
 absorb iodine, the sensitiveness is almost entirely removed, but is
 restored by again fuming with iodine-vapours.             The mechanical
 change of iodide of silver is effected only by those colours of the
 spectrum which photographically excite iodide of silver ; light which
 has passed through a layer of iodide of silver (and has thus been de
 sensitized) is therefore quite inactive.
    This deportment of iodide of silver may be used for preparing
 photographic pictures ; and by the use of a photographic negative a
 brown picture which is positive by transmitted light is obtained.        If
 light be allowed to act further, the brown colour changes into a clear
 blue, the shadows become bright, the positive changes into a negative.
 By hyposulphite of soda both the coherent and the pulverulent iodide
 of silver are obtained ; by washing with dilute solution of nitrate of
                                    202

silver, or by coating with a transparent resinous lac, these pictures
may be preserved in the light.    The coating of lac probably acts by
enclosing the parts of the iodide of silver so firmly that they cannot
 separate.
    These pictures, which I shall name mechanical iodide-of-silver
 pictures, are formed upon iodide-of-silver collodion fumed with
 iodine, which already contains iodide of s-ilver as a precipitated fine
 powder, appearing transparent and of a brownish-yellow            colour.
 The layer of powder, however, is still further disintegrated by light ;
 and by adequate exposure under a photographic negative, there is first
 obtained a. positive, which appears dark brown in transmitted light
 and, by a series of beautiful shadings, ultimately changes into a nega
 tive. If the layer of iodized collodion be almost allowed to dry be
 fore immersing in the silver solution, the iodide of silver will be
 precipitated in such fine particles that it will show these colours
 directly without any action of light.
    It remains to be decided whether this mechanical change of the
 haloid silver-salts effected by light plays a part in the ordinary pho
tographic process.      By adequate exposure a visible picture may be
directly obtained on the sensitive Daguerreotype plate, or on a chlo
ride-, bromide-, or iodide-of-silver collodion plate which has been
immersed in nitrate-of-silver solution : this picture is not soluble in
hyposulphite of soda, and can therefore be fixed by it. The substance
of this picture, which is poorer in iodine than iodide of silver*, pos
sesses the photographic attraction for particles of mercury or silver.
This chemical image is changed by excess of iodine into iodide of
silver soluble in hyposulphite of soda ; its colour changes, and it
thereby simultaneously loses its photographic property ; while the
above-described    mechanical iodide-of-silver picture is just formed in
the presence of excess of iodine, is not again destroyed by           andit,
of itself has not the photographic property.
    It thus appears to me proved that the mechanical change of the
haloid silver-salts in the photographically sensitive condition    indeed
                                                                    is
quite parallel to the chemical change, but         extremely
                                                  is           small, and
that the photographic process      isinseparably bound  up with  chemical
decomposition.
  It   isworthy of remark that the mechanical change of the silver
 haloid salts (the removal of the cohesion of the molecules)         is  most
 powerful when the chemical change (the separation of the atoms in
 the molecules)   is  least.  Possibly  a   disintegration by light, sucli as
 has hitherto only been known in the case of realgar, takes place also in
 other substances which are sensitive to light; apparently crystallized
 iodide of tin undergoes this change, and probably also bichromate of
 potash. — Berliner Chemische Berichte, No.      6,   1871.
   * This    most simply seen from the following experiment: — If
             is                                                      a   regu-
line surface of silver produced upon glass be superficially iodized, so that   a
thin layer of silver remains unchanged, by exposure    a  picture may be pro
 duced upon the plate and fixed by hyposulphite of soda. In the places in
.which light has acted, the layer of silver which gives the background of the
picture has -disappeared, the iodide of silver which has been exposed must
therefore have given up iodine to silver.  Moser, who first observed these
pictures, thought they consisted of physically modified iodide of silver.

  MY          previous works upon this subject have been so favour
             ably accepted by the Royal Scientific Society, that          I  am
  encouraged once more to lay before the Society some inquiries
 founded upon the principle of the Lost Forces, which                   I   for
  merly   stated;     and  I   am  the    more   happy   at   having been    re
 quested      to continue   my  researches,    which  have  afforded me  many
 pleasant recreations from my other occupations, because the
 sequel will contain a basis for a series of inquiries which,             I  am
 sure, are in many respects not without interest.
     On former occasions, as is well known, I have in part referred
 to the intimate connexion which is proved to exist between the
 powers of nature ; in part          I  have tried to explain the common
 law according to which the respective powers of nature may be
 developed from each other ; and the correctness of the funda
mental principles proposed here has been confirmed by experi
ments, which        I have performed upon the heat developed by fric
tion of solid bodies.
     I cannot omit the remark that just as it is the various forces
of nature connected with the parts of matter which continu
ally have caused and continually will cause the incessant deve
lopment of the endless variety of different bodies which nature
presents at all times, and just as the peculiar character of
trie bodies is owing to these forces, so the incessant change
which, in fact, may be considered to be the characteristic of mat
ter is caused by their mutual effect.             But a general view of the

2           M. L. A. Colding    on the Universal     Powers of
various energies must evidently call forth the idea that they also
are produced and developed tor the purpose of disappearing after
having performed one or another effect on the particles of mat
ter; for, in the first place, it is well known that every kind of
energy (as, for example, energy of heat, mechanical energy,
electric energy, &c.) is able to produce all these energies ; and,
secondly, we know that when quantities of mechanical work,
quantities of heat, &c. are produced through certain quantities
of work, quantities of heat, &c., then these energies disappear
by degrees as new ones arc produced.        It is a well-known fact,
too, that the production of heat through heat, ov of quantities
of mechanical work through quantities of mechanical work, &c.,
is in reality nothing but the energy imparted from one system of
material particles to another, and no new production, and also
that the receiving body can at most merely receive an increment
of. energy of the same quantity as that which the imparting body
loses; on the contrary, keeping to the indistinct view of the
energies having acted their parts when certain material results
have been produced, we have not as yet formed a clear idea of
the general proportion between the acting and the producing
forces. Thus, for example, when the mechanical energy con
tained in a quantity of water falling upon a water-wheel drives a
saw-mill, then it produces every moment a certain material
result, but the corresponding mechanical energy itself is lost.
Or when heat, developed by burning coal under a steam-boiler,
moves a corn-mill by means of a steam-engine, then the heat
likewise every moment produces a material result, at which the
common idea stops ; but the energy of heat which has produced
this result exists no more, and we say it has become latent.       In
the same manner, when the electrical current developed by che
mical forces is performing a certain work by means of an electro
magnetic machine, then its energy disappears during the work,
&c.     That new forces, as heat, electricity, &c., are developed
along with the material work is indeed well known ; but this is
generally considered a secondary thing.         This view has, how
ever, always appeared to me a very unpleasant one; and                I
think, on the contrary, that the only natural view of this subject
 is, as I explained before:  That the forces    byno means vanish in
matter, and consequently   it must be   a general law     nature that
                                                            of
the forces, without exception, undergo      amere change when they
seem to vanish, and afterwards reappear as active sources      power

of  the same quantity but under different forms*       :.
   If the alleged proposition     is correct,   it   evident that the
                                                     is

 different kinds of energy, as energy of heat, mcclumical energy, the
 energy produced by the mutual effect of chemical forces, §c,, cannot
 be of different essence, but that all tlie various kinds must be looked
 upon as one and the same energy, as, for example, mechanical
 energy.
     As heat consists in the motion of the particles        of bodies, it
 follows from this:
     1 . That the material particles of which bodies consist are in con
 tinual motion,     even when the particles of the body seem to be at
perfect rest   ;  and
     2. That, in investigations into the internal motions to which
 the bodies are subject, we need not look upon heat as a particular
force, but rather as the result of the existing attractions and repul
 sions in connexion with certain quantities of motion imparted to
 the particles   of the body.
     As to the condition in which the material particles of a body
 are, it is most natural to admit, with Davy, that, according to
 their nature, the smallest elementary particles of the body pos
 sess a certain electric force, through which they attract or repel
 the other material particles of the body. The proportions between
 the quantities of the various elements contained in the body, as
 well as the number of the different elements and the quantity of
 their electric forces, determine the positions of equilibrium of the
 individual particles as depending upon the adjacent particles
 and their internal groupings in bodies. About these positions of
 equilibrium, •which for each individual particle are determined by
 the attractions and repulsions of all the other particles, the par
 ticles attracted and repelled continually vibrate on account of the
 imparted momentum ; and, in my opinion, the heat of the body
 consists in this motion, which, like any other kind of motion,
 may be more or less, according to circumstances.             Thus it is
 obvious that the internal quantity of energy in a body will in
 crease as well when a new quantity of energy, whether in the
 shape of mechanical energy, or of heat, electricity, &c., is im
 parted from one body to another, as when those forces are
 increased by which the particles of the body are moved among
 themselves.       On the contrary, the quantity of energy will de
 crease when some part of the motion contained in the body is
  conducted into other bodies, or when the forces decrease by which
  the particles of the body are moved.
     When no energy is imparted to or taken away from the body,
 and the forces by winch the particles of the body are moved among
 themselves do not change, then the energy contained in the body will
 remain ahvays the same.
     Now the problem is to determine the proper mathematical ex
 pressions for the energy contained in a body.         In consequence of

    4          M. It, A. Colding   on the Universal Powers   of
    the preceding remarks this will not be difficult, as we have seen
    tluit the various kinds of energy are in reality not different, but
    that all of them may be considered as one — for example, as me
    chanical energy.
       As we consequently have to determine the general mathema
    tical expression for the mechanical energy among the material
    particles, or, which is the same thing, to determine the mathe
    matical expression for the total integral of vis viva which has
    been called forth among these particles by an originally existing
    source of motion, the following well-known example may be
    useful.
       If a quantity of water m be at rest at the height ft above the
    surface of the earth, and if h is small enough for us to suppose
    the force of gravity at the height h to be equal to the force of
    gravity^ at the surface of the earth, then it is a truth admitted
    by all, and completely proved, that the whole integral of motion
    which may be produced and imparted (for example, to a water-
    wheel, or to any other machine) through the force of gravity will
    be expressed by
                               Q=»i.#. h;
    which effect, however, we shall only be able more and more nearly
    to approach, never to obtain entirely, on account of the impedi
    ments which always occur, such as resistance of air, resistance of
    friction, &c. As m ,(j is the weight of the water, and h is the
    height through which the water is allowed to fall, we perceive that
    if m ,y is expressed in pounds and h in feet, then the mechanical
    energy, which in mechanics generally is called the quantity of
    work, is to be expressed in foot-pounds — that is say, in pounds
    raised one foot.
       Further, it is well known and proved that, if we abstract from all
    those resistances which in fact will occur, then we obtain exactly
    the same quantity of work, whether the water moves vertically in
    the direction of gravity or is forced to move along any inclined
    plane or any curved line through the height h ; the consequence
    of which is that the increment of quantity of work rfQ which is
    developed by the falling through each little part ds of the path s
    is equal to m ,g multiplied by ds, resolved in the direction of the
    force; that  is,

    The energy which the material point loses during the motion

original magnitude merely under another form.      Thus the new
energy may be represented                           by
This equation, which may easily                                be    put into the form

the amounts of the energies which the accelerating forces in the
direction of the axes will separately produce.
     If
      we imagine the material point to be subject to any kind
of resistances, and     we denote the resultant of them all

   This equation shows that the newly developed energy is equal
to the product of the friction and the space passed through,
which is in accordance with my earlier experiments, and that
the amount of this energy is independent of the velocity with
which the slider is moved ; and this result was likewise derived

     If now   we compare what has been set forth in equations (1)
to (7) above, then we perceive that the whole internal energy
which is contained in a system of material points may in all
cases be represented by
 C being    an arbitrary constant.
     Hence results that u-hen the energy of a body manifests itself
under the shape of heat, then the contained quantity of heat may
always be expressed by the vis viva contained in the material par
 ticles of the body, as ice mean by vis viva half the amount of all
 the masses of the material particles, each multiplied by the square
 of its own velocity.
     In a note by Ampere, " Sur la Chaleur et stir la Lumierc
 considered commes resultant de mouvemens vibratoires "*, the
 author has set forth the idea that, while all rays of light and              .
 heat advance in waves through the aether, the propagation of hcnt
 in bodies depends upon the vibrations of the atoms and their
 propagation from particle into particle.      Thus, looking upon heat
 as a motion of atoms, the author compares the quantity of heat
 contained in bodies with the vis viva of the atoms, and thereafter
 shows that the general equations for the propagation of heat in
 a body must also hold true for the propagation              of the vis viva.
 As I think 1 have proved in the above that the internal energy of
 a body must necessarily be equal to the vis viva contained in the

means disagreeing with nature to apply the stated principle to
the propagation of heat in bodies, as, on the contrary, it leads to
truths proved by experience.
   Now I shall proceed to examine how the internal quantity of
energy contained in a fluid must vary when the pressure and
density of the fluid vary.
   Let dm be the element of the liquid mass m, whose particles,
according to the above, must be supposed to be in incessant in
ternal vibration ; let the coordinates of the point of mass in
question, after the time t, be x, y, z, and let \dm, Yrf?n, Zdm be
the moving forces on dm in the direction of the three rectangular
coordinate axes ; further, let the density at this instant for the
said point of mass m be p, and let p be the pressure on the unit
of surface ; if moreover the velocities of the clement dm in the di
rections of the three coordinate axes be denoted by
                          dx            dii               dz
                      u=di'       v=dt'         w=Jt'
and   if the increments  of the velocities during the time dt are
equated to
then, in conformity to the above, the increment of mechanical
energy which the clement dm would have received during the
time dt if it had been perfectly free will be
But,   as the element dm is not perfectly free, in fact          it only receives
an increment which may be represented by
During the tirrie-elerrient dt this clement of               mass consequently
loses some part of the mechanical energy which is really pro
duced through the accelerating forces.               If the energy which dm
loses during the time / is represented by q . dm, then the energy
lost in the time-element dt is equal to dq . dm, and thus we get

   From (Erstcd's later experiments upon development- of heat
through compression of water, we may infer approximately that
the development of heat is proportional to the pressure, so that
2, 3, 4, &c. times as much heat is developed by 2, 3, 4, &c. at
mospheres of pressure as by 1 atmosphere of pressure.

suppose its density = D' and its volume =                 V

ture T', and if we put the pressure on unit of surface =gmh, and
if we further suppose that the pressure is changed and becomes
 =p', then the temperature rises to (T' + 0'), the density becomes
 p1,and the volume becomes V. We thus have

    This expression for the specific heat of water shows that when
the quantity of heat which is able to heat 1 pound of water 1
degree Celsius (the so-called unit of heat) is used in the most
profitable manner for producing mechanical energy, then 1204-3
units of work may be produced from               as    unit of work      it,        a                        is

pearing as energy of heat, will be increased          exactly one unit             by

not be unnecessary.
    It is known that Poisson, by means of formula (36), has proved
that when the quantity of heat contained in an aeriform body is
 denoted by w, then w must be such a function of^j and p that it
satisfies the differential equation

    But   we  know that this equation is integrated by putting
                       pdp—ypdp = 0 and dw=0;
for if the integrals of these two equations are respectively      de
noted by
                             M = a and w = b,
 when they are supposed to be resolved with regard to the arbi
 trary constants    a and b, then we know that
                                 M = F(w),

in which ¥(w) denotes iiu arbitrary function of w, represents
the complete integralof the preceding partial differential equation.
      But for steam at maximum of density we suppose w, and ac
cordingly also F(w), constant; then M = constant ; whence fol
lows that for steam at maximum of density </M = 0, or

       t  It is well known that an overland telegraph-line acts as a Leyden jar
    in the same manner as a submarine cable, having, however, only n much
    smaller capacity, on account of the insulating layer (the air between the
    telegraph-wire and surrounding conductors) being very thick. But though
    the capacity may be small in comparison with that of any cable, it is

important of which                        is,
                           that they are frequently stronger than the
singnalling current of         far distant station, and consequently
                                                a
throw the relay out of its adjustment, and so make               unfit to                            it

necessary to devise some simple means             which these discharge-         by
currents could be safely eliminated from the relay of the sending
station* and
           ;       was found that for terminal stations
                         it                                    peculiarly                            a
constructed key answered the purpose best.              This key, after
each signal sent,             by
                        proper application of well-tempered springs,
                                      a
makes   a momentary contact direct with earth,            which the dis                        by
charge of the line      effected before the final contact with earth
                                  is is
                        made; and such keys were supplied to the
through the relay
terminal stations of the Indian main lines, where they have
worked well.     But to eliminate the discharge-currents from the
relays of terminal stations       of far less importance than to do so
                                                     is
from the relays at translation stations; for              clear that the                  it   is
discharges     translation stations may not only be inconvenient,
                    in
but may momentarily interrupt the line, so that the real signal
cannot pass on; and even              they do not cause interruption
                                                          if
during the whole of         signal, they will, at all events, produce
                                          a
points instead of bars at the receiving station, thereby causing
considerable delay and confusion.
   It true that
      is              principle the arrangement in use at terminal
                                  in
stations might also be applied at translation stations, where the
very decided charges and discharges. Fortunately the charges of the Indian
main lines (so long in comparison with the direct-worked lines in Europe)
still occupy such short time as not to influence in the least our maximum
                         a
working speed attainable with the present signalling system (25 to 30
 wordsa   minute)      e.;  signal sent from Calcutta to Agra arrives there

   In India we invariably use positive currents (or copper to line) for sig
nalling, because they reduce tbe leakage. By using positive currents for
signalling     one direction and negative currents in the other, and having
               in
 polarized receiving instruments, the effect of discharges would be, of course,
 so far eliminated that the receiving instruments would not actually be
 worked    bythem, the discharges going in the wrong direction through the
 polarized relays.   But this      bad plan.   The continued passage of strong

armatures of the sounders, or any other receiving instruments,
act as keys; but there arc many mechanical difficulties in the
way, especially the very small play of these armatures, which
would make such a method unsafe.            It was therefore decided to
use for translation stations another discharging arrangement,
          I
which will now describe. This arrangement consists of a Sie-
mcns's polarized relay with comparatively small resistance, and
of a small bobbin of wire acting as a shunt to the coils of the
relay, which latter may appropriately be called the
                                                          " discharging
relay."     The parallel circuit of discharging relay and bobbin of
wire  is interposed between the line to be discharged after each
signal and the sending battery.
   The contact-screw of the discharging relay is connected with
one end of the receiving relay, while the axis of the tongue of the
discharging relay is in connexion with the other end of the re
ceiving relay,     e. the earth.
                    »'.             Such an arrangement may be, of
course, applied equally well for terminal stations in place of dis         a
charging key and as the telegraph circuit for two terminal sta

for two terminal stations working direct with each other, as, for
instance, Calcutta and Agra.

greatly depend upon its resistance (supposing the resistance of
the discharging relayand also all other circumstances were given),
the following investigation was made in order to ascertain its

poles of a battery, E, the circuit of which may be closed and
opened at will by a stopper, 1.            Only one of the bobbins (r for
instance)     contains    iron, which    becomes     a magnet as soon as the
batteiy     circuit is  closed.    When the circuit is opened the mag
netism inr ceases, causing an extra current in (r + b) which acts
 in the same direction as the original battery current, and conse
 quently causes the loss of magnetism in r to go on much slower
 than it would without such a shunt b ; and therefore, if the mag
 netism in r were made use of for closing a contact, 2, this con
 tact would be somewhat prolonged by such a shunt.                        Conse

           b
  be the best possible channel for an extra current) no such cur
  rent could be established, because no original current would pass
  through      r,and therefore no magnetism in             could have been de
                                                                  r

the thickness of the necessary insulating covering of the wire in

     The ceasing of this magnetism  after the battery circuit has
been   instantaneously opened at 1 must be considered the cause
for producing an extra current in the closed circuit (r + x), which
extra current in its turn reproduces magnetism in the iron bar
in the coil r.     This whole process, of course, occupies time,
however short it may be, and goes on steadily.          But it will
U'ad apparently to the same result for our purpose if we suppose
that the cessation of the original magnetism produces instanta
neously the whole extra current, and that the extra current (or,
better, an average value of   since   it,variable as regards time)
                                                      it   is
is used for producing fresh magnetism in the iron bar of the
coil r. Under these circumstances            reasonable to take
                                                       it       is                               a
proportional quantity of the original magnetism as the new elec
tromotive force for producing the extra current C'       the circuit              in
with the resistance +   x, r
   Therefore we Lave
                    C' =  E  const
and this expression, multiplied                  by
                                the number of convolutions                                       n,

   Now    it   isevident that the prolonging effect      e. the time           (i.
during which the bar of iron keeps perceptibly magnetized after
the instantaneous opening of the battery circuit) must increase
with m' and consequently
         ;                         making m1by  maximum the pro      a
longing  effect  of the arrangement must also be greatest.   Taking,
therefore,      the above expression for m1, x only as variable, we

      In the application to a long overland line, /represents the line
 resistance, including the resistance of the sending battery and
  distant receiving relay, while r is the resistance of the coils of
  the discharging relay.
      In order to weaken as little as possible the signalling current
 by the introduction of such a discharging relay, we take naturally
 r (its resistance) only so great that a given electromotive force
  (as is generally used for signalling through the line) will work it
  with safety through the given line resistance ; and if the dischar
  ging relay is of a good construction, this r can always be neg
 lected in comparison with /.

    The function m' (formula I.) is to be considered as representing the re-
 mfinent magnetism in the closed circuit (r+x), no matter by which of the
 two coils the magnetism is produced ; thus m' must necessarily be symme
 trical as regards r and x.     But having selected one of the two coils by
 which m' (the remanent magnetism) is to be produced, it is at once fixed
 which of the two coils must be taken as variable in order to find the maxi
 mum of m'.     If, for instance, r is taken as the coil developing m', while x
 acts as shunt only, neither producing extra current nor magnetism, then
 the shunt a; must be taken as variable, and not r, since otherwise factor
 would have to be differentiated, giving that value of r which represents a
•maximum of m' developed by x — just the case to be avoided as much as
 possible.

charging relay.      This law will hold good for any long overland
telegraph line ; and it is only for a long line that such a dischar
ging arrangement is required.
    As regards the absolute value of r, it was found that 200
S. units, using a Siemens's polarized relay, were quite large
enough.      Such a relay works safely with 30 Minotti's cells
through 10,000 S. units.
    The shunt itself, even without having iron in           it,

 India     the one between Calcutta and Kurrachee, 1700 miles in

 length, which has been worked direct now for more than two

 sible to work this enormous distance altogether direct without
 Agra in translation      but practically nothing would be gained
                            ;                                                    by
 this, since then, on account of the great length, the charge be
 comes so large as to reduce the speed to less than fifteen words
a   minute, while        having Agra in translation the speed,

                     a
   Note. — Mr. A. Cappel, in his report on the Central London Office
of the Electric and International Telegraph Company, states that                 a
shunt in connexion with an electromagnet for discharging one of the
cables was made use of as early as 1867, and was announced to him
 by Mr. Culley as an invention of one of the telegraph clerks. This
appears to be the first application of the extra current for this pur
pose  ; but am not aware whether this simple principle has since been
               I
used for overland telegraph lines.
   Mr. Cappel says — " The duration of the zinc current (necessary
                           :
to neutralize,  after each signal sent, the positive discharge of the
cable) can be regulated    varying the resistance of the shunt but no
                                 by                                    ;
definite law or conclusion has yet been arrived at on the subject."

III.   On the Application of a new Integration of Differential Equa
    tions of the Second Order to some unsolved Problems in the Cal
    culus of Variations.   By the Rev. Professor CIIALLIS, M.A..
    F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
               stating the principle of the proposed new integra
BEFORE
    tion, and     applying it in an example, it will be proper to
direct attention to the following two Lemmas : —
   I. The formula \ydjc may express the area of any curve between
assigned limits of the abscissae, whatever may be the origin and
direction of the rectangular coordinates, and whether y has one
or more values for a given value of x, provided always the inte
gration be taken along consecutive points of the curve.
•   II.   Under precisely the   same conditions          if 1 +   ~^\'dx may
express tlie length of any curve between assigned limits of the
abscissae, the radical being always taken with a positive sign.
   To exemplify the first Lemma, suppose the curve to be a
circle situated within the quarter for which the signs of x and y
are both positive.    Then if we begin the integration with the
less of the two ordinates corresponding to a given abscissa, and
proceed along consecutive points of the curve in the direction of
the movement of the hands of a watch till we arrive at the ex
tremity of the other ordinate to the same abscissa, the integra
tion between these limits will be the segment of the circle cut
off by this ordinate.    For the integration from the given ab
scissa to the minimum abscissa is negative,      because  through
that interval dx is negative; and the integration from the
minimum abscissa to the given abscissa is putilire, because in
the return direction dx is positive.     Also the positive area is
made up of the negative area and the above-mentioned segment
of the circle, so that the total integration gives the area of the
segment.
    The    same   principle applies, however complicated            the curve
 may be ; only to effect the required integrations it is necessary to
 obtain all the real values of y corresponding to any value of x,
 either exactly or by approximation, as explicit functions of x.
    If it be required to calculate the area enclosed by a portion of
 the curve haying its extremities at given points and the chord
joining the points, the same rule applies,               if,
                                                   after integrating
 from one point to the other, the integration be continued along
the chord to the first point.
    With respect to the second Lemma,              only necessary (o
                                                    it   is
 remark that when the integration          taken along consecutive
                                               is
                   *   Communicated    bv the Author.

     Integration of Differential Equations of   the Second Order.     29
points, the       radical and    dx change   sign   together,   so  that
(   1+ -T^j) dx has always the      same  sign, which we may assume
to be positive.
      Exactly the same considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, if
 the curve be referred to polar coordinates ; and in the case of a
 closed curve the pole may be at any point either within or
 without it.
      The foregoing Lemmas, which ought to be introduced into the
 Elementary Treatises on the Integral Calculus, I supposed to
  be new, until it was pointed out to me by Mr. Todhunter on my
  submitting to him Lemma I., that in his ' History of the Cal
                         '
  culus of Variations      (art. 139) an application of the method of
  integrating along consecutive points of a curve is recorded as
  having been made by M. Delaunay in a memoir published in
  1813.      It is evident from this account that M. Delaunay pro
  duces the method as a recent discovery made by himself; but
  the principle of it is not stated by him as generally as it might
  be, uo mention being made of integrating along a chord, or with
   respect to intersecting portions of different curves.
       My purpose also requires a few preliminary remarks to be
   made respecting the principles of the Calculus of Variations.
   The elementary treatises on this branch of analytics give a me
   thod of obtaining a differential equation on the integration of
   which the solution of the proposed problem depends.           But they
   do not usually take into account that, as in all problems involving
•two variables x and y it is abstractedly possible to treat the va
   riations Sx and By as independent, and to obtain two differen
   tial equations, one of these is just as much as the other entitled
   to be applied in the solution of the problem.       Similarly, if there
   are three variables x, y, s, three equations, all applicable to the
   problem, are obtainable.       (This method of treating the Calculus
   of Variations is given in Francoeur's Mathematiques Pares,
    torn. ii. 2nd cd. art. 885.)     The possibility of obtaining more
    than one differential equation is a significant analytical circum
    stance which cannot be overlooked without restricting the ap
    plications of the calculus.    When there are only two variables x
    and y (as is supposed to be the case in all the subsequent rea

    Mr. Todhunter states (art. 366) that this problem      discussed    is
 by  Legcndre, and also       Steguiaun in

longer ago than 1854, and that these two geometers arrive at
 the same   result, viz. that the required line         some cases
                                                            is     in              a

 one or two straight lines.     The foregoing solution proves that
 this conclusion      iserroneous.    Mr. Todhunter has failed to
 notice that the error      due to riot recognizing the principle of

 integrating with respect to consecutive points of curve.          a

32         Prof. Challis         on a new            Integration of Differential
would seem, therefore, to follow that the condition of a minimum
 can always be satisfied by a catenary so situated.            But on trial
 this is not found to be the case.        Mr. Todhunter states (' Hist.
 ofCalc. of Var.' art. 308) that this problem was the subject of
 an essay by Goldschmidt which obtained a prize in 1831, in
 which " the conclusion                is,
                                  that sometimes two such catenaries
 can be drawn, sometimes only one, and sometimes no catenary."
 The same problem            discussed at considerable length in arts.
                                 is

fact, this appears to be        discontinuous solution of the problem.

the axis, generate surfaces of different magnitudes             and as the             ;
descending gradations       of  magnitude    cannot  go   on  indefinitely,
there must be        limiting minimum surface, the form of which
                      a
should admit of being determined                             by

The purpose of the following investigation              to show how this    is
may     be  done.
    I'irst,    may be remarked that the present problem differs
               it

of the equation          A=0   and its derived equation             ~ =0.      That
integral may consequently               be applied      in the solution of the pro

                                            that an additional arbitrary
constant   is available for satisfying the given conditions of the

I shall now proceed to apply         to another problem.
                                          it
   Problem      III.
                   Required the maximum solid of revolution of
given superficies, the generating line of the surface being sup
posed to join any two given points in            plane passing through
                                                         a
the axis of revolution.
   In the usual enunciation of this problem the two points are
supposed to be in the axis of revolution.          But according to the
principle  of integrating along consecutive points of the curve, as
stated in the Lemmas at the beginning of this communication,
the process for h'nding the required differential equation              the    is
same wherever the given points be situated, the coordinates of
their positions coming under consideration only in determining
the limits of the integration.        This problem has hitherto not
been generally solved even for the case in which the given points
are on the axis.        propose to apply to
                         I                            treatment precisely

  which, from considerations analogous to those adduced in the
  preceding problem, may certainly be pronounced to be possible.
      First it is to be remarked that here, as in the last problem,
  \pdx is an exact differential, while A.-'r is not, and consequently
  that the equations A^=0 and A = 0, not being equivalent,
  must both be taken into account.        From the former we have
                                                       , =o.

  4* being the   arbitrary constant.   Consequently
  This equation cannot be exactly integrated; but MM. Di-launay
  and Sturm have proved (Journal tie Liourillc, vol. vi. p. 315)
  that the curve it represents maybe described by the focus of an
  hyperbola which rolls on a straight line.        Its form can therefore
  be ascertained without difficulty.     But on doing this it is found
  that the curve is incapable of giving a solution of our problem,
  whether or not the given points arc on the axis.        It has, however,
   been shown by Mr. Todhunter (Hist, of Calc. of Var. p. 410),
   for the case in which the problem is to find the greatest solid of
   revolution of given superficies, the generating line of the surface
   consisting of ordinates perpendicular to the axis at two given
   points and of a curve connecting them, that the form of the
   curve is given by the integral of the above equation, and that
   the two ordinates are equal and join on to the curve continuously.
   But the general problem under consideration requires for its so
   lution an independent integration of A=0.
       In order to effect such an integration, I shall proceed, just as
    in Problem II., to deduce from A = 0 the equation of the evolute.
   Tutting p for the radius of curvature, the equation A=0 gives

   Resuming the equation (8), and substituting in it p* for -

As this equation contains p, it is of the second order, and its in.
tegral will involve two arbitrary constants in addition to k. That
integral cannot, therefore, satisfy A = 0, which is of the second
order.   But it is important to remark that the equation obtained
by eliminating the three arbitrary constants is satisfied by the
values of q and            r deduced respectively from A = 0 and                                            -^-   =   0.

\.   /^NE       of the authors of this communication          endeavoured    f
     ^•^      in 18G7 to call attention to the          circumstance that
wherever the spectrum of a gas consists of lines of definite wave
lengths there must be periodic motions in the gas, and that mo
tions of this kind can exist only within the individual molecules
of the gas; and more recently          J  he has pointed out that from
each periodic motion there will usually arise several lines, and
that the lines which thus result from one motion will have periods
that are harmonics of the periodic time of the parent motion.

sequences to the test of observation, \vecommencedwith absorp
tion-spectra, for the examination of which the apparatus at our
immediate command was best suited.               The apparatus consisted
mainly of the great Grubb spectroscope of the Royal Dublin
Society, and of the appliances in the laboratory of the Society
for keeping up an abundant supply of the oxhydrogcn lime light.
    3. The chief obstacles we anticipated were those that arise
from the extreme closeness with which the lines are often found
to be ruled, and those to be expected from the complexity of
spectra; for usually lines belonging to several distinct systems
are presented together to the eye within the same field of view,
and this makes an apparently              confused maze of lines, from
which it is difficult to pick out those that arc to be referred to
any one motion in the gas.            Accordingly, as a preliminary step,

  42      Messrs. G.   J.  Stoney and     J.  E. Reynolds  on the Cause
  we looked at several of the absorption-spectra of coloured vapours,
  to see whether amongst them we could find one in which there
 is a system of lines which we might hope to refer to a single
  motion in the molecules of the vapour, free from lines emanating
 from other motions in the molecules of the vapour, and suffi
  ciently separated from one another to he easily measured. A
 few days after we commenced operations we were so fortunate
 as to meet with the object of our search.           The brown vapours of
 chlorochromic     anhydride (CrO'Cl2) when interposed between
 the lime-light and the spectroscope gave a spectrum of the re
 quisite simplicity.
     4. In order to test that part of the theory which indicates that
 the periodic times of the wave-vibrations of the several lines are
 harmonics of one periodic time, we find it convenient to refer
 the positions of all lines to a scale of reciprocals of the wave
 lengths. This scale of inverse wave-lengths has the great conve
 nience for our present purpose, that a system of lines with
 periodic times that are harmonics of one periodic time will be
 equidistant upon it : it has also the minor convenience that it
 much more closely resembles the0spectrum, as seen, than the scale
 of direct wave-lengths used by Angstrom in his classic map.
 Upon our scale the inverse wave-length 2000 corresponds to
 Angstrom's     direct   wave-length       COOO.     The numbers       which
 Angstrom uses are tenth-metres, i. e. the lengths obtairred by
 dividing the metre into 1010 parts; and from this it follows
 that each number upon our scale is the number of light-waves
in a millimetre : thus 2000 upon our scale means that the corre
sponding wave-length is s^Vo °f a millimetre. Now, if k be the
inverse wave-length, expressed upon our scale, of a fundamental
motion in the aether, its direct wave-length will be vth of          a milli-
                                                             K
metre, and its harmonics       will have the wave-lengths — ,        —,  &c.
                                                                iv/r oA
Accordingly the inverse wave-length            of the nth harmonic will    be
                              !„=(»+ 1).*.                                (1)
Hence    it is easy to see that      a system of harmonics which are
equally spaced along      our  scale   at intervals of k divisions are har
monics of a fundamental        motion    whose inverse wave-length is k,
whose direct wave-length       is jth of     a millimetre, and whose pe-
                                  rC
riodic time is 7, where T is the periodic time of an undulation in
the aether consisting     of waves    one millimetre long.       If  we  use

     SECTION     II.  On the periodic time of one of the motions in the
                  molecules of Chlorochromic Anhydride.
     5. We generally made use of the vapour of chlorochromic an
hydride mixed with air, and at the temperature and pressure of
the atmosphere.          We tried the vapour freed from air, and also
 at somewhat higher temperatures ; but in neither case did we
 observe any marked difference in the spectrum.                 An image of
the lime-light was formed on the slit of the spectroscope by a
 condensing-lens of about 30 centims. focus, and of such a size
that the whole of the collimating-lens was filled with light*.
The column of chlorochromic vapour, if not too longt, was placed
 between the condensing-lens and the slit.              The spectrum which
 then presents itself consists of a number of sensibly equi
 distant dark lines in the orange, yellow, and green.                   In the
 orange these lines fade away and leave part of the orange
 and the red unsubdued            by lines.    In  the other direction      the
 lines are gradually lost in an increasing obscuration of the spec
 trum, which entirely blots out the more refrangible colours. The
 lines are nowhere sharply defined or narrow, nor are the spaces
 between them devoid of duskiness            J;  and the region of general
 absorption, which occupies the more refrangible part of the spec-
     * This is a condition which is essential to making good measures.        If
 only a vertical strip of the collimating-lens is supplied with light, the beam
 belonging to one line in the spectrum reaches the image in the observing-
 telcscope as a thin wedge of light, upon which the eye does not readily
 focus itself.    Under these circumstances the eye keeps continually altering
  its adjustment, feeling about for the right distance; and if the strip of
 light has not passed exactly centrally through the instrument, this causes
 the. image of the line to appear to deviate in various degrees from its true
 position, accordingly as the adjustment of the eye fluctuates.
     f  \Ve used columns of various lengths, varying from 4 to 80 ceutims.
  From 15 to 20 centims. is a good average length. By increasing the length,
 the lines in th.2 yellow and orange become more conspicuous ; and by dimi
  nishing it the lines in the green are better seen. With the longest column
  we were obliged to place two condensing-lenses at the ends of the tube, one
  to send the light from the lime-light in a parallel beam along the tube, and
  the other to condense this parallel beam into an image upon the slit of the
  spectroscope.
      t See further on, § 22.

44      Messrs.    G. J. Stouey and 3.    E. Reynolds    on the Cause
trum, seems to consist simply of lines of the       same series so widened
out that they are blended into one mass.
    6. For the convenience of reference we have numbered the
lines from a conspicuous one which happens to fall between the
two D lines, nearer to the more refrangible one.            There are 106
lines, counting from this line inclusive to a point somewhat
 beyond b ; and we have measured the deviations of 31 of these
in a spectroscope giving a dispersion from A to H of about 24°.
We have from these measures deduced the inverse wave-lengths
by a comparison with the deviations of forty lines of iron, copper,
zinc*, and sodium, extending over the same range of 0 the spec
trum, of which the wave-lengths in air arc recorded by Angstrom
and Thalen.        The interpolation has been effected by a graphical
method ; and our measures in no case, when repeated, differed
by one minute of arc f.
    7. The first column of the following Table gives the numbers
of the several lines which we measured, reckoned from that line
which lies between the two D lines.            The second column gives
the observed positions of the lines upon a scale of inverse wave-
                                                               o
lengths in air, viz. upon a scale of the reciprocals of Angstrom's
wave-lengths, which are wave-lengths in air of standard pressure
and 14° temperature.          The third column contains the corre
sponding positions upon a scale of inverse wave-lengths invacuo,
obtained by applying to the numbers of column 2 the correc
tions for the dispersion of air at 760 millims. pressure and 14°
temperature, deduced from Ketteler's valuesj.              The fourth co
lumn gives the calculated positions,         on   the  hypothesis that the
lines of the spectrum arc equally spaced upon this lust scale, as
they should be according to our theory.              And the fifth column
gives the differences between columns 4 and 3, between the cal
culated and observed positions.
   * The zinc-line to which Thalen assigns the wave-length 5/45, appears
rather to hnvc a ware-length of about 5739.
   f  The measuring-apparatus of the spectroscope hns only recently been
completed.     It is apparent to us that the instrument is capable of mea
suring deviations even far more accurately than we have yet attempted. This
is due to the extraordinary precision with which Mr. Gnibb's automatic ar
 rangement returns over and over again to the same position. It has, indeed,
almost made of the spectroscope a new physical instrument.

   The outstanding differences fall within the limits of the errors
of observation and interpolation. Our theory is therefore verified
in the case of chlorochromic anhydride.
   8. The interval between two consecutive lines, which we used
in calculating column 4, was 2%70 scalcins, or units of our scale.
This value cannot be in error more than one five-hundredth part.
 Hence the periodic time of the parent motion in the molecules
of chlorochromic anhydride, from which all these lines have pro
ceeded,     is within one five-hundredth part of
                                                 ^—
                                                    ,                              r    having the
signification already assigned to it.
   9. Having ascertained k, or the interval between two consecu
tive lines, we may by equation (1) determine n, or the number
of the harmonic.   Thus, if the inverse wave-length of our zero-
line be 1697-3, and if k be nearly 2'7, n+ 1 must be an integer
which is nearly = — — — = 628'6.                           The only possible values arc
627, 628, 629, and 630, since any other integers would carry us
beyond the errors of observation.  And when the measures shall
have been made with sufficient accuracy to decide which of these
numbers is the trne one, it will in turn be possible to fix the
value of k with great precision.  Thus,    as     most probable, if,        is
our zero-line    the 628th harmonic, and
                      is                       its inverse wave        if

        SECTION   III.   On the character    of this molecular motion.
      10. But beside thus determining with very great precision
 the periodic time of one of the motions in the molecules of the
 vapour of chlorochromic anhydride, the study of this spectrum
 has elicited other information about the motion, which we think
 ourselves justified in putting upon record, although it is imperfect.
      11. It was just before leaving off work on the 28th of January
 that we first looked at the absorption-spectrum            of chlorochromic
 anhydride,    and   found  that it gives   in  the greenish yellow a spec
 trum of lines arranged in nearly the following pattern,
                                                                            (4)
  each section   of the pattern consisting of five lines, a very dark
  one followed by a very light one, then two of medium intensity,
  and then another very light one.
      1 2. We saw no more upon that evening ; but in thinking over
  the pattern afterwards, it seemed to offer some hope that we
  should be able to trace out not only the periodic time of the pa
  rent motion to which the lines are clue, but even some informa
  tion regarding the character of that motion.            In fact the pattern
  seemed to suggest a very simple law of variation of intensity in
  passing from line to line, viz. that the intensities may probably
  be related in some simple way to the lengths of the ordinates of
  a curve of sines raised from points which divide the interval from
- crest to crest into five equal parts, thus

48      Messrs. G.  J. Stoney and   J. E. Beynolds  on the Cause
 which assigns to the corresponding       parts of the  spectrum    the
 following pattern — :
                                                                   (10)
 Halfway between the regions (4) and (10) the pattern would          be
                                                                   (11)
 And in general the variation of the pattern in passing along the
 spectrum may be represented to the eye by conceiving the system
 of six ordinates  in fig. (5) to travel sideways while the curve is
 fixed.   In the position represented by the continuous lines in
 fig. (5), the squares of the ordinates represent intensities which
 would give pattern (4).      If they are shifted to the left into the
 position  of the dotted  lines  until e comes to the point of inter
 section o, e will entirely disappear, a, d, and    /  will become of
 equal length, while b and c also become equal but shorter than
 the other three; and in this position the squares of the lengths
of the ordinates will represent the intensities of lines which
 would give pattern (10). And all other patterns which could
 arise on this hypothesis would be represented by the other posi
tions of this system of six ordinates.
     15. On the 30th of January we were able to compare these
anticipations with the spectrum itself; and we had the satisfac
tion of finding that changes closely approximating to the pre
dicted changes of pattern actually take place in the absorption-
spectrum of chlorochromic        anhydride, but not at the uniform
rate of change which the simple hypothesis represented by equa
tions (8) and (9) would indicate.
    16. The results of the comparison are embodied in the follow
ing Table, the left-hand side of which gives the observed inten
sities of the lines on an arbitrary scale in which 10 indicates a
very dark line, and 1 the faintest visible; while the right-hand
side states what the succession of intensities would be on the
hypothesis represented by equations (G) and (7).         Notes of in
terrogation are introduced when the lines were too much dilated
for the observation of their intensities.   The lines drawn between
the two columns point out where the observed succession of in
tensities of column I. can be most nearly matched in column II.
The changes are in the main the same in the two columns ; but
the rate of change follows a law in column I. which has not yet
been traced out, while in column II. it is uniform.

50       Messrs. G.   J.  Stoney and    J. E. Reynolds     on the Cause
     17. We have endeavoured by modifying this simple hypothesis,
or substituting another, to gain a closer approach to the actual
phenomena, and we have in this way been able to fit the hypo
thesis to the phenomena ; but it has been by assumptions which
are as yet too arbitrary to warrant our placing the somewhat
complicated details before the public.             The simple case given
above will sufficiently explain the method we employ ; and we
think we have received sufficient encouragement from the results
of our discussion to hope that this method may elicit in some
cases really valuable information about the nature as well as the
 periodic times of molecular motions.
         SECTION   IV.   On the perturbations      the motion suffers.
     18. In conclusion we wish to advert to one other phenomenon
 which appears to us worthy of note.             Every line in a spectrum,
 in order to be visible, must have a certain physical as well as in
 strumental breadth.        By the physical breadth of a line we mean
 that breadth which it has because the light that constitutes it
 is not restricted to one wave-length, but extends between certain
 limits of wave-length ; by the instrumental breadth we mean
 that appearance of breadth which is given to a line by the width
 of the slit of the spectroscope.       A line becomes invisible if either
 its physical or its instrumental breadth dwindles to zero*. Now
 the lines of chlorochromic anhydride have a very considerable
  physical breadth.      Hence the original disturbance communicated
 to the aether by the motion in the vapour consists of waves of
  corresponding physical breadth.          This must be occasioned either
  by a property inherent in the Bether, whereby it can expand over
  a certain range of wave-length a disturbance which it receives
  from a strictly isochronous source ; or it is due to real differences
  in the periodic times of the motions in the molecules of the va-
  pourf. Now the variety of the phenomenon in the spectra of
  different gases forbids our accepting any general explanation,
   such as that which alleges a property of the scther ; and we are
  therefore compelled to admit that the motions in the molecules
   of the vapour are not strictly isochronous, but that the periodic
   times of some of them slightly exceed, and of others fall short of
  the mean periodic time.          The presumption appears to be that
   the motions within the molecules have naturally a definite pe-

                               (1868) § 5. p. 13G.
      t The supposition that it rany be attributed to the irregular journeys of
  the molecules amongst one another, which must in some cases lengthen
  and in other cases shorten the intervals at which the light-waves reach the
  eye, is excluded (1) by the amount of the effect (which is beyond what this
   cause could produce), and (2) by the circumstance that lines situated in the
  same region of the spectrum are variously expanded.

riodic time, but that this period is exposed to perturbation when
 two molecules pass sufficiently close to one another, and that
 during the intervals between two perihelion passages it settles
 down towards its mean value (Phil. Mag. vol. xxxvi. (1868)
 p. 135).      The perturbations, as a rule, seem to take place in
 both directions, some of them increasing and others of them di
 minishing the periodic time ; for in most gases the lines widen
 out in both directions on raising the temperature — that            on   is,
 rendering the molecular collisions more violent.          But   someit
 times happens that the disturbed motion differs in character
from the normal motion so sensibly that           gives rise to
                                                         it      somea
 what different pattern of spectrum.
     19. For example, this occurs in the case of the principal lines,
the   D   lines, of the sodium-spectrum.      By introducing sodium-
carbonate into suitable part of the oxyhydrogen flame, the bright
                        a
lines can be made to widen out to any desired amount; while
the original positions of the lines are at the same time presented
to the eye      bythe dark absorption-lines, or reversed spectrum as
it   iscalled, caused          by
                           the surrounding mantle of cooler sodium-
vapour.       In this way the positions of the lines when narrow and
when wide can be directly compared, and will be found to differ.
 In neither of the lines does the dark line b'e in the middle of the
 bright band in DI (the more refrangible one) inclines towards
                    :                                         it
the red end of the spectrum, and inDn (the less refrangible one)
it  inclines towards the blue.      Hence the middles of the broad
 bands are further asunder than the narrow lines.
    20.   A   similar appearance     met with in the case of chloro-
                                         is
chromic anhydride.        The eye can easily detect that the lines are
not everywhere equally spaced, though the deviation of any one
line from its calculated position       so slight that in the measures
                                               is
 we have taken the amount cannot be separated from errors of
observation.       The middles of the lines appear to be displaced by
 small amounts, some to the left, others to the right.        And since
those parent motions in the molecules of the vapour whose pe
riodic times are somewhat longer than the normal amount must
have      a predominance in the formation of the lines that deviate
towards the blue end of the spectrum, and vice versd, we can                    by
this property distinguish between the lines which belong to mo
tions in the gas that are faster than, equal to, or slower than,
those of normal period; and                by
                                       treating each of the series of
lines so obtained as in section            III.
                                         of this paper, information as
to the differences in the nature of the motion in these three
cases may perhaps be attainable.
    21.   It    evident that we only need to obtain more accurate
               is
 measures to be able,               by
                             applying the method described above in

rather than 1697-3 (the calculated amount),         will follow that

which    is   somewhat longer than the duration we have assigned* to
the mean periodic time, 'viz.             _    .   It   would thus seem pro-
bable that this line     due principally to those disturbed motions
                        is
in the molecules of the vapour which continue sufficiently long
in   aphase in which they have           periodic time about 1-0002

between the lines which        occasioned

                                               still wider departures
from the mean periodic time.        This shading evidently follows
laws intimately associated with the laws which determine the
general pattern of the spectrum      for we have noticed that marked
                                      ;
excesses and defects in the shading recur between the corre
sponding lines of several successive sections of the pattern.     But
this is   part of the phenomenon to which we have not yet had
          a
time to give sufficient attention, and we therefore merely men
tion it here.
                         SECTION     V.   Conclusion.
   23. We think that our measures satisfactorily confirm the
theory which was recently laid down                 by
                                           one of us as to the
cause of the lines which present themselves in the spectra of
gases, and that we have ascertained with considerable precision
the normal periodic time of one of the motions in the molecules
of the vapour of chlorochromic anhydride at the temperature
and pressure of the atmosphere.
   In reference to the other matters upon which we have ven
tured to touch, the results at which we have as yet arrived
are defective and less secure   and we have entered into them
                                     ;

  V.  On the Direct Conversion of Dynamic Force into Electricity.
                   By S. TOLVER PIIESTON, Esq.*
                                                is capable of direct
 IT conversion
       is  a well-known fact that electricity
                   into motion, this principle    being illustrated in
 its simplest form by the use of apparatus in which metallic cir
cuits alone arc employed, motion being effected, as in the case
of the apparatus of Ampere, without the use of either commuta
tor or magnet.       As far as   I am aware, the exact converse of
this case, i. e. the direct conversion of dynamic force into elec
tricity without the aid of magnetism, has not been shown to be
possible.    The apparatus of Faraday, consisting of a metallic
disk caused to rotate between the poles of a permanent magnet,
is well known — the current thus induced in the disk having
been conducted through a galvanometer whose terminals were in
connexion with the axis and circumference of disk respectively.
    lu the annexed figure the helix S takes the place of the gal
vanometer, one extremity being in con
nexion with the circumference of disk D
through a spring S', the other extremity
being connected in any convenient man
ner with the axis.
    In the apparatus of Faraday the cur
rent induced in the disk was solely due
to the influence of the permanent magnet,
the current traversing that portion of the circuit formed of the
galvanometer producing no useful effect. Supposing, however, in
the present case the pole of a magnet or a second separate helix
traversed by a current (from any source) to be placed near and
parallel to the helix S, then the current thus induced by the
rotation of the disk will traverse the helix S which forms part of
the circuit of the apparatus, and (by a suitable direction of rota
tion) the direction of the current in both helices will be identical.
    The current traversing the exterior circuit is therefore by this
arrangement capable of contributing to the effects, both helices
being similarly situated in relation to the disk and traversed by
a current in the same direction.
    Moreover, the helix S forming part of the circuit of the appa
ratus, the intensity of the current traversing it is therefore a
function of the velocity of rotation.
    The inductive influence on the disk of the helix S, which de
pends on the intensity of the current traversing its coils, is
therefore capable of indefinitely exceeding that due to the sepa
rate helix, in which the intensity of the current, whatever the
                    *
                      Communicated by the Author,

54       On   the   Direct Conversion of Dynamic Force into Electricity.
velocity, can only remain constant (its potential may be sup
posed indefinitely low).
   It is therefore clear that, after the first inductive impulse has
been given by the presence of the separate helix, the latter may
be removed without appreciably affecting the result, the main
tenance of the current being due to the dynamic force employed
in effecting rotation, or to the inductive influence upon each
other of the portions of the circuit in relative motion.
   If a core of soft iron were supposed introduced into the helix
S, and on rotating the disk a magnet were only momentarily
approached (thus imparting by induction a slight polarity to
the iron core), it is clear that the velocity of rotation necessary
to maintain a current of given intensity would be much reduced;
for the iron core, becoming magnetic under the influence of the
current circulating in the surrounding helix, would thus contri
bute to the effects without adding to the resistance of the circuit,
on the amount of which, ceeteris paribus, the intensity of the
current depends.
    The following principle serves further to elucidate the sub
ject. On the rotation of any machine by the influence of elec
 tricity, the motive current is lowered in intensity by the induc
tive action of the moving parts of the machine ; but by causing
 the rotation to take place by the use of force in the opposite di
 rection, the intensity of the original current             is,
                                                     conversely, aug
 mented   ;  or, as explained            by
                                 the law of the conservation of force,
 the electric current in effecting the rotation of the machine                   is
reduced in intensity           by
                             an amount which           is
                                                  represented      the      by
portion    converted  into  dynamic energy,   and on driving  the ma
 chine in the opposite direction the intensity of the original cur
rent     israised         by
                       an amount which         the equivalent of the
                                                  is
mechanical energy employed.
   The apparatus described        in principle clearly an electric
                                          is
motor;     e. i.current
                    a   supposed to traverse the circuit made up
of the helix and radius of disk would tend to effect the rotation
of the latter therefore
                    ;               by
                            the principle just stated,   the appa      if
ratus be caused to rotate in      suitable direction,
                                              a        current in  a
troduced into its circuit                by
                                induction or otherwise would be
raised to an intensity dependent on the dynamic force employed
in effecting rotation.
   If no limit be assigned to the velocity of rotation which could
be imparted,     follows as logical fact that the circuit could be
                     it             a

   The question suggests itself whether, by improvement of the
construction, this principle might not be made practically avail
able in those cases where a uniform current (without successive
inversions) is desirable, as afforded by a voltaic battery.
   It may be remarked that in the figure a portion of the cur
rent finds a circuit within the disk itself; this, however, may be
avoided by a change in the details of construction, as is the case
with the apparatus of Ampere, which shows the electrodynamic
rotation of a current.

56 Prof. W. A. Norton        on the  Physical Cons'lilution ufifie fw
ously visible in total eclipses, and observable at all times with
the aid of a spectroscope, are most of them due to violent erup
tions of masses of incandescent hydrogen*.               He remarks that
" it is impossible, without passing beyond the well-known ana
logies necessary for the explanation of cosmical phenomena, to
assign any other cause to these eruptions than the difference of
 pressure of the gases emanating from the interior aud from the
 surface of the sun.     To make such a difference of pressure pos
 sible, it is necessary to admit the existence of a separating stra
 tum between the inner and outer strata of hydrogen, the latter
 of which, as is well known, forms an important portion of the
 solar atmosphere.     In reference to the physical constitution of
this stratum, we must furthermore assume that it cannot be
 gaseous, and must therefore be either solid or liquid."           He re
 marks further that "with regard to the inner masses of hydrogen
 bounded by that stratum two suppositions are possible, viz. :— (1 )
 The whole interior of the sun is filled with incandescent hydro
 gen gas, which would make the sun an immense bubble of hy
 drogen surrounded by a liquid glowing envelope. (2) The masses
 of hydrogen bursting out into protuberances arc local collections
 in bubble-like caverns, which form in the superficial layers of a
 liquid glowing mass and burst through when the pressure of the
 confined gas increases."        Professor Zollncr adopts the latter
  supposition as the more probable of the two.
     This theory may furnish an adequate supposablc cause for the
  observed eruption of incandescent masses of hydrogen ; but its
  fundamental hypotheses have no secure ground to rest upon.
  The notion that the sun's photosphere is in the liquid state is
  irreconcilable with the astonishing rapidity with which changes
  often occur on the sun's surface, and also with the fact that the
  vast elevated masses, seen as the faculaB, occasionally retain the
  same position for several days — and though suggested long since,
  has not, to my knowledge, been adopted by any astronomical
  observer.    No hypothesis of the possible origin of the sun's
  spots upon this idea has been framed that affords a satisfactory
  explanation of even their more conspicuous features and pheno
  mena.     To this remark the theory advanced by Professor ZollncT,
  viz. that " the nucleus of the solar spots is a scoriaceous pro
  duct of local cooling on a liquid surface, and the penumbras
  clouds of condensation which surround at a certain height the
  coasts of these islands of slag," offers no exception.         It is not
  new, and has been already overthrown by the investigations of
  M. Fayef.       The other fundamental hypothesis of Professor

1'rof.  W. A. Norton      on the  Physical Constitution of the Sun. -57
Zollner's theory of the physical constitution of the sun, viz.
that the masses which burst out into protuberances are local
collections in bubble-like caverns which form in the superfi
cial layers of a liquid glowing mass, does not derive any support
from analogical facts.       It must be regarded as a pure hypothe
sis, unsustained by any inherent probability, or by any known
fact other than that which it is framed to explain.          Besides, an
hypothesis which brings the hydrogen in eruptive or streaming
masses to the sun's surface does not suffice.            Another arbi
trary hypothesis      is required  to dispose of the hydrogen which
has thus been accumulating above the sun's photosphere for
an indefinite period of time.
     Such being the state of the case with regard to the recent
attempts to discover the secret of the sun's physical consti
tution, in the light of the late remarkable discoveries, we seem
to be in this dilemma : whatever conception is formed of the
condition of the sun's photosphere, whether liquid or gaseous,
it appears to be contradicted by received principles, or con
troverted by established facts.         We are thus naturally led to
 suspect that either some physical cause has been hitherto left
out of account which plays an important pait in solar phe
nomena, or else the conception adopted of the mechanical con
 dition of the solar vapours is radically at fault.           It appears
 to me that good and sufficient reasons may be urged that will
justify both these grounds of suspicion, and that anew point of
 view may be gained from which we may obtain a deeper insight
 into the physical processes in operation on the sun.
     It is a little remarkable that it should have been hitherto as
 sumed that the facts and laws of terrestrial physics can alone
 furnish a true philosophical ground for a theory of solar phy
 sics, and that no serious attempt should have been made to ob
 tain additional light from known processes in operation on a
 cosmical scale in the regions of space.           There is a class of
 bodies, some of which in their periodical excursions through the
 fields of space approach quite near the sun, and which are in
 general conspicuously subject to influences of a powerful nature
 exerted by the sun, besides the force of gravitation.       It certainly
 seems natural to expect that these cosmical bodies might give
 us some insight into the nature of the forces in operation at
  the sun's surface.      It is assuredly too late to urge that the
  transformations     which they undergo under the sun's influence
  are wholly involved in mystery ; for it has certainly been satis
  factorily established that a portion of the cometary matter be
  comes subject to a solar repulsion, and is urged away by this
 force with a high velocity and to great distances from the sun.
 and that this repulsion augments in intensity as the comet ap-

     preaches the sun*.         Now, if such an energetic force of repul
    sion emanates from the sun and operates on cometic matter at
    all distances, both small and great, according to the law of in
    verse squares, there is assuredly a high probability that it may
    play an important part on that vast arena where solar forces
    are obviously engaged in fierce contention.               It may be con
   jectured that the solar vapours are entirely different substances
    from, and wholly unlike in their physical state, the comctary
    vapours that appear to be so exceedingly subtle.                 But it is
*
    certainly more philosophical to suppose that the same sub
    stances, or substances possessed of the same general properties,
    are present in all cosmical bodies and the earth.             Besides, we
   are not without direct evidence on this point.             iluggins/ by ex
   amining the spectrum furnished by the light emitted from the
    Comet II., 1868, detected the presence of the vapour of carbon
   in the brighter portions of the comet.              " He has been able to
   discriminate between the light of the nucleus of a comet and
   that of its tail.    The nucleus is self-luminous, and its substance
   is in the form of ignited gas.            The coma shines by reflected
   light as clouds do."
       If, as is now conceded by astronomers, the tail of a comet
   is made up of matter detached from the general mass of the
   comet by reason of a repulsive action exerted by the sun, it
   must also be admitted that the matter expelled is not all urged
   away by the same intensity of force and with the same velocity j
  for we find that it is much more widely dispersed in the plane
  of the comctary orbit than is consistent with this supposition.
                     I
  For example, have shown in my theoretical discussion of Do-
  nati's cometf that, if we conceive particles of matter to have been
  expelled from this comet with a certain small lateral velocity,
  and urged away during a certain interval of time by a solar re
  pulsion bearing to the force of gravitation the ratio of 1'213 to
  J, they would at the end of the interval have been found distri
  buted over a narrow band coincident at its forward line with
  the curved preceding side of the tail of the comet, and that the
  other portions of the tail must have been composed of matter
  subject to various degrees of solar repulsion less than this.              In
 fact,    the   definite conclusion     was   in  this  way reached   that  the
 preceding half of the tail consisted of matter repelled from the
 sun with a force varying between the limits 1'213 and 0, and
      * This is
                generally, if not universally, admitted by astronomers.     The
author has undertaken in former Numbers of Silliman's Journal to establish
 by rigorous calculation that the luminous train of Donnti's comet was deve
 loped by a force of solar repulsion cooperating with the attraction of gra
vitation, both varying according to the law of the inverse squares.        (See

that the following half was for the most part composed of matter
detached from the comet simply by reason of a weakened gravi
tation toward the sun, the intensity of the force of gravitation
along the following side of the tail being O455.              There would
 seem then to he no alternative but to admit that the tail of
Donati's comet was composed of different substances (or else of
 one substance in different physical states), subject to a repulsive
 action from the sun of various degrees of intensity, and either
prevailing over the sun's attraction of gravitation or partially
 counteracting        and so giving rise to an effective repulsion for

                                                   a
 others.    The simplest theoretical explanation that can be given
of this state of things       to suppose that the solar repulsion con
                                     is
sists of   aseries     impulses propagated in waves through the atther
                       of
of space and taking effect upon atoms          different sizes with vary
                                                       of
ing intensity.      It obvious that, this be true, the smaller the
                            is                    if
atom the more effective should be the repulsion as compared
 with the gravitating force soliciting the atom, since the ratio of
the two forces should be proportional to the surface divided                                 by
the volume of the atom, assuming that the mass                proportional  is
to the volume, or that all atoms have the same density.                We
are thus incidentally led to infer that the larger comets consist
of variety of substances like the earth.
  a
    The question now arises, what can be the origin of the force
 of solar repulsion.        There       another side of the diversified
                                             is
picture presented           by
                           conietary transformations under the sun's
influence, which gives some intimations on this point.                 Not
 only is   acertain portion of the cometary matter repelled             the             by
 sun, but   it   is
                  also repelled            by
                                      the nucleus of the comet.         We
see in large comets         series of envelopes rise at intervals from
                                 a

nearly uniform rate until they become dissipated                 the sun's       by
 repulsion.     Luminous jets also stream out at times from the
same side of the nucleus.         These phenomena,          can hardly be
                                                                       it

sive energy of the heat received                   by
                                             the comet.      We are thus
led to infer that the repulsive action exerted                    by
                                                       the sun upon mat

                      of
wholly or partially, in repulsive impulses prepay ated in the heat
waves proceeding from the sun.
    Let us now see whether any confirmation of these inferences,
and any additional light in the direction of our present inquiry,
can be obtained on the substantial ground of terrestrial physics.
The definite question presented for consideration             whether the   is

 60    Prof. W. A. Norton      on the   Physical Constitution of      the Sun.
 results of observation or experiment afford any indication of a
 direct repulsive action exerted by radiant heat on the atoms
 of bodies.      It is universally admitted that radiant heat, when
 imbibed by a body, acts as a repulsive or separating agency
among its molecules.          It is also conceived that the conduc
 tion of heat is by radiation from atom to atom.                     The most
 natural inference      from   these   facts is  that   the  waves   of radiant
heat which pass from atom to atom directly urge the atoms away
from each other by repulsive impulses.                 Instead, however, of
 adopting this simple idea, physicists have generally been in
 clined to refer the expansion of bodies from heat to some mode
 of motion of the atoms originated by the heat received, though
no detailed satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the
manner in which such motions would directly originate an
expansion.        Strangely enough, this notion is even entertained
 by physicists who regard heat as the only cause of the repul
 sion subsisting among the molecules of bodies.                 It should here
be rioted that if the expansion of all bodies of matter from
heat is to be ascribed to a direct impulsive or repulsive action
 of heat-waves proceeding from one atom and falling upon the
 surrounding atoms, then this force takes effect at the greatest
 distances by which the atoms are separated in the rarest gas
 under the feeblest pressure ; and we should thus be led to ex
pect that heated bodies in contact with each other might ma
nifest signs of repulsion.
     In point of fact many evidences of a heat-repulsion subsist
 ing between particles of different bodies in contact or in close
 proximity have been adduced by different experimentalists and
 writers on physics, some of which may be briefly mentioned.
     1. "When pure silica in an extreme state of division is
 highly heated, the slightest motion then causes the particles of
 the powder to slide over each other, and the surface of the
 powder is thrown into undulations almost like those of a
liquid."
     2. A rise of temperature is attended with            a decrease of capil
 lary   attraction.    Also  the   frictional    resistance    to the flow of
 water in pipes is diminished by heat.
     3. " The spheroidal state of liquids is a complicated result
 of four distinct causes. The most influential is the repulsive
 force which heat exerts between objects which are closely ap
 proximated to each other "*.
     4. The vibrations of heated metals, as shown in " Trevilyan's
 instrument" or "rocker," resting on a block of metal, are pro
  bably due to the direct repulsive force of heat, as maintained
 by Professor Forbes, of Edinburgh, in opposition to Faraday,
                          * Miller's '
                                       Physics,' p. 285.

who conceived that they were attributable to the sudden expan
sion by heat of the body on which the rocker rests.                   Faraday's
explanation    of  these   curious    phenomena       is adopted   by  Tyudall,
who    endeavours    to  overthrow     Professor     Forbes's    theory.    His
experiments serve to disclose the fallacy of certain features of
the theory, but do not dislodge the fundamental idea that the
phenomena are due to a force of heat-repulsion.                   This might
be made apparent if we had space for a statement of the general
principles on which the explanation rests, and for a detailed dis
cussion of the results of the experiments.
    Let us now consider if any sufficient evidence exists of a ge
neral force of molecular repulsion in operation at all tempera
tures, beyond the sphere of sensible adhesion or cohesion.                  We
ueed, in fact, to look no further for this than to the simple
fact that in the ordinary contact of bodies the interval of dis
tance between them, minute as it             is,much exceeds the range of
the attraction of cohesion or adhesion             ;for in such contact the
weight of the upper body           counteracted
                                   is                      by

outer repulsion of some of the particles may be overcome, their
attraction of cohesion brought into play at the reduced distance,
and an equilibrium established at the neutral point between this
attraction and the inner repulsion.            This occurs in the welding
of iron.

  distances, they tend toward each other by the attraction of gra
  vitation. But are we therefore to conclude that the repulsive
  action, so energetic at the near approach of the molecules, has
 vanished altogether when they arc a considerable distance apart ?
 Is it not more probable that this force is confined to the surface-
 molecules, and disappears at moderate distances, in comparison
 with the attraction of gravitation which is the result of the
 action of the entire masses on each other, because it decreases
 according to the inverse squares of the distance between the
 surfaces instead of the distance between the centres ?                   I have
 elsewhere shown* that the force of gravitation cannot be the
 attraction of cohesion operating at considerable or great dis
 tances. It is a force sui generis, entirely distinct from the forces
 of molecular attraction and repulsion in operation at minute
 distances and determining the constitution of bodies and their
 mechanical properties, and operates in conjunction with, but in
 dependently of, these molecular forcesf.

 physics, it will be admitted that, in attempting to gain a new
 insight into the physical constitution of the sun and the pro
 cesses of change in operation on its surface, we are at least en
titled to assume the following as probable hypotheses : —
      1. That the sun exercises a repulsive action upon the mole
 cules of every gas or vapour that subsists at its surface, or is at
 any time in any part of the region of space exterior to the sur
face ; that this force is the sum of all the heat-impulses propa
 gated in sethereal waves from all the gaseous molecules posited

     t It  ought here to be stated that in my paper
                                                     " On Molecular Physics,1'
published in Silliman's Journal, vols. xxxviii., xxxix.,and xl., I have deduced
from the fundamental conception of a primitive molecule (or chemical
atom) adopted a force of molecular repulsion operating beyond the sphere
of the molecular or cohesive attraction, and reached the conclusion that
this force has its immediate origin in the physical change to which the
 development of heat is in every instance due, viz. an inward or contractile
vibratory movement of the electric envelopes by which all atoms are con
ceived to be surrounded as well as by rethereal atmospheres.        It is accord
ingly termed the molecular heat-repulsion.       The repulsive energy of heat
 in operation on any molecule is the sum of all the athereal impulses de
veloped by such movements of the envelopes of other molecules (whether
originating in the attraction exerted by the central atoms on their enve
lopes, or in an external collision or pressure), and propagated to the mole
cule.     From the principle of interception of wave-force it results that the
external repulsive action exerted by a solid body is confined to the surface-
molecules ; while a force of heat-repulsion is propagated to an indefinite
distance from all the molecules of a gas.

above the solid or liquid body of the sun, and from the surface-
molecules of this central mass, except iu so far as these im
pulses may be intercepted in their passage; and that it is op
posed to the force of gravitation, which is due to a virtual
attraction of the sun's entire mass, so that the effective force
soliciting any gaseous molecule is the difference between these
two forces (attractive and repulsive) by which it is urged.
    2. That the force of solar repulsion, since it consists of im
pulses propagated in sethereal waves, is comparatively more
effective in proportion as the atomic weight of the solar vapour
is less, it being assumed that the quantity of matter in any
atom is proportional to its volume.
    3. That in a hypothetical        condition of equilibrium of the
sun's atmosphere the elastic force of each of its vaporous consti
tuents at any depth will consist in the intensity of the effec
tive heat-impulses tending to urge its molecules outward, which
will be counteracted by the weight of the superincumbent por
tion of the atmosphere.        Now let us assume, for the moment,
that at some anterior epoch in the sun's history all the present
 vaporous constituents of the sun's atmosphere were diffused
throughout a space exterior to the central body of the sun, and
 limited by the spherical surface (A) at which the molecules of
 the vapour of greatest atomic weight are in equilibrium under
 the action of their own weight and of the heat-repulsion urging
 them upward.        This hypothetical state of things could not con
 tinue, since the atoms of each of the other solar vapours would
 be urged upward by an effective force.            If we conceive a small
 quantity of each     of  them  to  escape  from    all points of this sur
 face, the rising vapours will ascend to greater heights in propor
 tion as their atomic weights are less, and finally, when the
 equilibrium is attained, form a series of spherical envelopes
 wholly detached from each other, and arranged in the order of
 atomic weights — beginning with the heavier metallic vapours and
  terminating with the lighter (potassium, sodium, &c.) and the
 permanent gases, with hydrogen             outermost.    If    ether small
  portions  of  each  of the vapours   were  to  rise  from  the surface A,
 they would serve to augment the thickness of the envelopes
 already formed ; and the same would be true for each succes
 sive discharge.      The final result would be the same if the dis
  charge   were   continuous   during a certain interval of time, as
  would naturally happen.         After a certain amount of the solar
  vapours have escaped, contiguous envelopes might interpenetrate
  each other more or less.         What it is especially important to
  observe  is, that throughout the whole depth intercepted between
 each envelope and the outer limiting surface        A   of   the vapour  of
 greatest atomic weight, every atom       of   the substance   of  which the

61    Prof. W. A. Norton   on the  Physical Constitution of the Sun.
envelope is composed that may chance to be present is urged up
ward by a force of repulsion.    If, as we must suppose, the rise
of the solar vapours from the surface A continued for an indefi
nite time, the interpenetration of contiguous envelopes would
increase, and eventually a condition of equilibrium would be
attained, if the sun's temperature remained the same.         But if
this temperature were to increase, as it must down to a certain
epoch in the process of consolidation, the process above indi
cated would be continually renewed.       It is still more important
to observe that if there were any cause in operation withdraw
ing continually at short intervals a portion of one or more of
these rising vapours, a statical equilibrium would not be reached ;
and it would be permanently true that for every such vapour there
would be a region of repulsion, as above stated, extending from its
envelope down to the outer limit A of the vapour of greatest atomic
weight.    Throughout this region the vapour would be perpetu
ally rising, taking the place of that which is withdrawn, and so
maintaining a dynamical equilibrium.       The depth of this region
would be the greatest for hydrogen, the outermost gas (unless
there is some solar vapour of less atomic weight than 'hydrogen).
Now it is easy to see that a certain physical cause tending to
produce such results must come into operation at some stage
of the sun's process of consolidation.       As conceived by Faye,
the cooling going on at the outer surface must eventually bring
the temperature there down to the point at which the vapours
having the highest affinity for oxygen will undergo combus
tion. The product of such combustion, being compound mole
cules, will have a greater weight in comparison with the repul
sion to which they are exposed than the simple molecules
before the combination took place, and hence they will descend
more or less rapidly into the depths of the photosphere.          To
all appearance the sun is now passing through this period of its
physical history, as supposed by Faye; and in the "granula
tions" which give to the solar disk a mottled appearance
 (Herschel's "subsiding chemical precipitates") we probably
discern the products of the combustion occurring in the upper
photosphere and determining its outer limit in the act of de
scending.     The continual upward flow, from the depths of the
 photosphere, of the hydrogen, oxygen, and the lighter metallic
 vapours will bring about the necessary intermixture of oxygen
 with the other vapours.     This must occur below the natural
 outer limit of the hydrogen envelope ; and we know that, as a
 matter of fact, the chromosphere, composed chiefly of hydrogen,
extends above the photosphere.
   If the products of the surface-combustion were all to descend
indefinitely into the vaporous photosphere       without undergoing

decomposition,     no further visible effects would ensue. We
could only follow with the mind's eye the gradual growth of the
central nucleus of the sun, and recognize that we probably have
before us a picture of the process by which the materials of the
earth's crust were fashioned and accumulated in the earlier ages
of its history.      But the probability is that the descending
masses would eventually arrive at a depth where the higher
temperature would effect a dissociation of the combined ele
ments (as Faye supposes).        This must inevitably happen unless
the tendency of the heat that augments with the depth is coun
teracted by the opposing tendency of the increasing gaseous
pressure.    By reason of these opposing tendencies it may well
happen that there may be a certain region of dissociation of
limited depth, above and below which decomposition would not
occur.    But it is to be observed that it does not follow that all
of the products of surface-combustion as they pass through such
a region would be decomposed, since the reduction of tempera
ture attending every instance of decomposition tends to prevent
 decomposition of other surrounding masses in the act of de
scending.
    This sudden dissociation of large masses of combined ele
 ments, though occurring at certain depths within the- photo
 sphere, it will be seen, may eventually play a conspicuous part
at the surface.     Unless the region of dissociation should lie
 below that of repulsion for the elements separated, these ele
 ments after separation will be urged upward by the effective
 force of repulsion, ascend rapidly, and emerge with a high velo
 city above their respective envelopes.       The ascensional velocities
attained will be greater if large masses are suddenly decom
 posed.    The masses of hydrogen set free should attain to the
 greatest velocity and rise to the greatest height.         They should
 rise in eruptive masses above the hydrogen envelope, or, in other
 words, the chromosphere.         According to Lockyer, in the solar
 protuberances the ascending hydrogen has in some cases a ve
locity as high as 120 miles per second, and rises to a height
of more than 40,000 miles.
    A vertical jet of hydrogen having a projectile velocity of
 120 miles per second should attain an altitude of 43,000 miles,
 if the solar gravity were constant for that altitude.             Some
 prominences have extended to a height of 100,000 miles above
 the sun's photosphere.        Professor Kespighi has even noticed
 instances of an elevation of 160,000 miles.           Such enormous
 heights imply   either   a greater   initial velocity than 120 miles
 per second, or that the full energy       of the solar attraction does
 not take effect on the eruptive masses of hydrogen in the region
 above the photosphere.      From our theoretical point of view we

  perceive that the latter supposition should be true, since the
  solar repulsion should be in operation above the hydrogen
  envelope or the chromosphere, diminishing the gravitating ten
  dency.
      The metallic vapours set free in the region of dissociation
  should rise to heights varying with their atomic weights.             Some
  of them, especially the lighter ones (sodium, magnesium, cal
  cium, &c.), may acquire velocities sufficient to bring them above
  the chromosphere.         In fact, the spectroscope has detected,
  besides hydrogen, magnesium, sodium, iron, and chromium in
  the solar protuberances.        Lockyer states that he has invariably
  found that in solar storms the chromospheric layers are thrown
  up in the order of vapour-density.           He regards the chromo
  sphere as built up of the following layers, which are in the order
  of vapour-density in the case of known elements : — a new ele
  ment giving the green coronal line in the spectroscope, hydrogen,
  another new element, magnesium, sodium, barium, iron.                   He
  remarks that " all the heavier vapours are at or below the level
  of the photosphere itself"*.
      The green coronal line was traced in the late eclipse by Pro
  fessors Young and Winlock as far as 16', or 425,000 miles from
  the sun's limb.      From our present theoretical stand-point we
  naturally infer, as Lockyer has already done from his observa
  tions, that the element present in the solar corona which gives
 this line is much lighter than hydrogen.                We see also that
 an element several times lighter than hydrogen might be sub
 ject to a solar repulsion that would predominate over the at
 traction of gravitation at all distances, and urge the subtle
 vapour indefinitely away from the sun.             Since the same line is
  seen in the light of terrestrial auroras, we must conclude that
  the same substance is present in our upper atmosphere, either
 in a permanent upper layer or derived from the sun (as I have
 elsewhere maintained).         We must infer also that it is magnetic,
 which apparently cannot be the case unless it takes on the con
 dition of compound molecules.               Such compound molecules
 might become dispersed in the upper atmosphere of the earth,
 or in the photosphere of the sun, by electric discharges or sudden
 evolutions of heat, and then the separate atoms repelled off, form
 ing the streamers of the corona and aurora, illuminated either by
 electric light or, in the case of the corona, in part also by reflected
 solar light f.

     The probable origin of the sun's spots and other questions
  of solar physics that claim attention must be left for future
  consideration.      I will only remark here that it has long been
  apparent that the diverse phenomena which occur at the sun's
  surface are traceable, more or less directly, to the action of some
  form of eruptive force.       The present investigation seems to have
  led to the discovery of the true nature and origin of this force, and
  at the same time to have revealed the process by which the sun's
  radiation is maintained, the primary source of the solar heat
  being doubtless, as now generally believed, the process of conden
  sation maintained by the force of gravitation.
     It is worthy of remark, in conclusion, that as comets directed
 our attention at the outset toward the sun, so the sun, in its
 turn, leads us back again to our starting-point, since we see
 that   if we transfer   to cometary bodies the physical      structure  we
 have recognized in the sun's upper photosphere, viz. the exist
 ence of a succession of light vaporous envelopes subject to the
 energetic action of the force of heat-repulsion,          the mystery in
 which some of the curious transformations            they undergo have
 hitherto been involved seems to be in a great degree dispelled.
 No one doubts that comets are chiefly composed of very light
 vapours, though some of the larger ones may have a solid nu
 cleus.     If, as intimated, certain observed cometary phenomena
 indicate that these vapours, like the solar vapours, are arranged,
 for a certain depth at least, in envelopes which are liable to be
 greatly expanded, or even wholly expelled by the increasing
 amount of heat received from the sun, we have in the probable
 physical structure of comets another indication that these bodies
 were originally detached from the sun's photosphere, in addi
tion to that furnished by certain features of the cometary
 motions*.

68     On Increasing the Rigidity  of long, thin Metallic Pointers,  fyc.
close to the scale, the weight of the suspended mass is frequently
increased at the expense of delicacy.
    Where it is required to obtain an index or needle long, light,
and at the same time rigid,      I suggest that the thin metal be
buckled : an ordinary steel pen is an example of a thin piece of
metal rendered very rigid by buckling in the manner proposed ;
but the increased rigidity bestowed by such alteration of form is
so well understood as to render it unnecessary to dwell on it
here.     An index would, of course, be bent in the direction of its
length, and the shape of the cross section might be varied.
    It is evident that with a given weight a longer, and with a
given length a lighter index is possible if the metal be buckled
instead of used plane as at present; a longer and finer point
may be bestowed on the buckled than on the unbuckled index ;
and the greater rigidity of the buckled index would render it pos
sible to approach it nearer to the scale of the instrument without
fear of contact.
    I have alluded to galvanometers particularly ; but the improve
ment suggested is applicable to any instrument in which a long
and sharp yet light index is a desideratum, while it may not
be required in some cases, where weight cannot be reduced by
reason of the necessity for a certain magnetic mass.                .
    I have stated the principle as applicable to indices composed
of metal, but it is applicable to other materials, as horn, vulca
nite, &c. ; aluminium and brass, however, are probably most
generally applicable and would usually be employed.              Slight
modifications in the mode of attachment might be rendered ne
cessary by the buckling of the index ; but such details cannot
present any difficulty, while the improvement would be appre
ciated by all in the habit of using instruments with long, light
indices as at present constructed.       I  have seen clock-hands in
which the principle has been partially applied ; but in such cases
it is scarcely necessary, and ornament appears to be generally
the object.     The subject of this paper suggested itself to me
from the difficulty I have found in keeping the needles of de
tectors &c. flat in spite of the handling of them in remagne-
tizing, and in using delicate galvanometers, the long light
needles and long thin brass pointers of which have to be occa
sionally handled, are very readily bent, and by no means readily
rendered straight again.

 language which would render them easily intelligible to readers
 who were not desirous of mastering the more abstruse portions of
 the science.    Upon reviewing our perusal of 402 pages we look back
 on our literary journey as having passed through regions of black and

 moons, smoking suns, hypothetical planets, atmospheric star-showers,

 allusions to wax-doll astronomy, a chemical theory of Saturn's rings,
 and a new explanation of the dark lines in the solar spectrum ; and
 we seriously inquire, Have we mistaken the title? is it really
 Astronomy Simplified ? For most assuredly we should have arrived
 at the conclusion that "Astronomy Mystified" would have been
 the better title, had not the title-page itself informed us of the sim
 plicity of the work and its suitability for general reading.
     Amongst the numerous books, popular and otherwise, that have
 been written on astronomy, there is much that may be characterized
 as calculated to furnish general and accurate ideas of stars and star-
 systems, of nebula?, of the sun and his planetary family, of comets,
 and of the connexion between astronomy and chemistry through the
 medium of spectrum analysis ; and had the author abstained from
 controverting theories which are likely to be established, and intro
 ducing those of his own which have to pass through the necessary
 ordeal, he would, we are convinced from various passages in the
 work, have succeeded in producing a book which would have an
 swered to its title. For example, had he grouped selections of known
facts under heads as above mentioned, referring but sparingly to
 theories, and to those only which would clearly explain classes of
 facts, his work would have taken rank with the productions of the
 popular scientific writers of the day. But he has gone out of his way
 to guard the public against what he terms the authority of science;

the champion of the non-scientific, to defend them against the plau
 sible suggestions of time-honoured philosophers, who have given to
the world, by means of observation and theory, the facts and expla
nations of the constituent bodies of the universe, substituting his
new explanations and, as he calls them, discoveries, for much that
is now generally received.
     In that portion of the work which is devoted to the consideration
of stars, star-systems, and nebulae, it would have contributed greatly
to simplicity had the author, in addition to the array of figures ex
pressing hundreds of billions, given the quantities in so many words.
The experience of the general public, for whom Mr. Rollwyn writes,
in estimating quantities seldom exceeds hundreds of thousands, and
as a billion is a million times a million, it is by a great mental effort
that so large a quantity can be apprehended by figures alone.        With
regard to stellar arrangements, Mr. Rollwyn does not appear to be
 well read up ; for in his work we look in vain for any notice of Proc
tor's theories of star-drift, star-streams, the constitution of the uni
verse, &c. ; and it is remarkable that, amongst theories which have
been regarded with but little favour by the author, the speculations
of Proctor should have been overlooked.            On the other hand we
find the author demolishing, as he thinks, the gaseous character of
 the nebulae, calling in question the results of Dr. Huggins's obser
 vations of the bright lines in the spectra of nebulse, as well as the
 observations of Sir VV. Herschel, whose telescope, the author says,
 invests and unites the Dumb Bell with a fictitious elliptical halo and
junction.     "How can such luminosity yield a spectrum analysis ?
 We should as soon think of testing the spectrum analysis of a ghost,
 or a night-mare, or a dream.      To come to the conclusion that be
 cause such a spectrum presents no elementary lines it must be the
 spectrum of a vapour, would be vapouring indeed, and with very
 thin vapour.     All honour to spectrum analysis ! but we trust we are
 too jealous of the integrity of scientific truth to accept implicitly the
 first suggestions and unfledged conclusions drawn from      it, — too ap
 preciative of its great achievements, too respectful to its already well-
 won and wonderful laurels, to drag        itthrough the mire in support
 of hasty and ill-digested inferences."
     Of the three bright lines in the spectra of nebulae discovered by
 Dr. Huggins, Mr. Rollwyn remarks, "        it  surely exacting too much
                                                 is
 to ask us to assume that when three lines only appear in the spec
  troscope, this miserable meagre telegram exhaustively explains all
.the luminosity embraced within the extended confine."
      It would be wasting time to go further into an analysis of the
  work.    Not only  is the author ill-read in his subject and extravagant
  in his suppositions (of which the pear-shaped form of the moon an  is
  example, the diameter directed towards the earth being 3893 miles,
  while that at right angles to  it   is 2153    :whence he obtained his
 data we are at  a   loss to conceive ;  the micrometrical measurements
  of Gussew in 1859 or 1860 gave the greatest mean deviation from
  the spherical form as about -fa of the radius, or less than 60 miles),

but his misquotations and errors are numerous, so that as a work

the inequality of the motions of the Earth and Venus, the period
of which is 240 years, is ascribed to Le Verrier, with not one word of

 •*•" Results of Seven Years' Observations of         the Dip and Hori
zontal Force at Stony hurst College Observatory, from April 1863 to
March 1870."      By the Rev. S. J. Perry.
   The object of the present paper          to bring further evidence to
                                              is
bear upon an important question of terrestrial magnetism.
   The existence of     sensible semiannual inequality in the earth's
                        a
magnetic elements, dependent on the position of the sun in the
ecliptic, was deduced by General Sir Edward Sabine from                adis
 cussion in 1863 of continuous series of the monthly magnetic ob
                      a
servations taken at Kew.        previous reduction of observations made
                                 A
at Hobarton and at Toronto had first suggested the idea, and           new
                                                                       a
confirmation of the results has lately been obtained by Dr. Balfour
Stewart from subjecting      second series of Kew observations to the
                             a
same tests as before.     The observations, which form the basis of
the present discussion, extend over the period from March 1863 to
 February 1870, during which time the same instruments have been
in constant use.    These are    Jones unifilar and dip-circle

Sabine, who made the Stonyhurst Observatory one of his magnetic
stations in the English survey in 1858, greatly encouraged the
undertaking of monthly magnetic observations, and the Rev. A. Weld
procured in consequence the instruments still in use.           Only occa
sional observations were made with these instruments for some years,
and     was only in 1863 that
       it                          continuous series of monthly deter

Sidgreaves. He observed regularly until September 1868, when               I
returned to my former post at the Observatory, and          have continued
                                                             I
the same work ever since.
   A stone pillar was at first erected for the magnetic instruments
in the open garden, and this remained in use from 1858 until the
beginning of 1868, when most convenient hut of glass and wood
                              a
was built for the instruments in     retired corner of the College garden.

results a correction for change of station, it has the great advantage
of securing immunity from disturbance for the future.
   Considering the object in view in drawing up this reduced form
of the dip and horizontal-force observations,       I  have judged it ad
visable to adhere strictly to the tabular forms in which the matter
has been presented in previous discussions of a similar nature.       Each
element is the subject matter of these tables.        In the first are the
monthly values of the element, the deduced mean value, and its se
cular variation.    Next in order comes the calculation of the semi
annual inequality.     The residual errors, and consequent probable
weights  of the  observations  and results, compose the third and last
Table.
   The yearly mean values of the horizontal force are found to vary
progressively from 3-5926 to 3-6178 in British units, the mean for
Oct. 1st, 1866, being 3'6034, with a secular acceleration of 0-0042.
Calculating from the monthly Tables the mean value of the horizontal
force for the six months from April to September, and for the semi
annual period from October to March, we find the former to be
0-0005 in excess over the latter, showing that this component of
the intensity is greater during the summer than during the winter
months.     Treating the dip observations in a precisely similar way,
we obtain 69° 45' 21" as the mean value of this element for October
1st, 1866, subject to a secular diminution of 1' 49'''2; the extreme
yearly means being 69° 48' 47" and 69° 37' 52". The resulting ex
cess of 10" for the winter months in the computed semiannual
means is so small, that the observations tend mainly to show that
the effect of the sun's position is not clearly manifested by any de
cided variation in the dip.     Deducing the intensity from the above
elements, we obtain for the summer months the value 10'4136,
whilst that for the winter months is 10-4128.         The intensity of the
earth's magnetic force would thus appear to increase with the sun's
distance, but the difference is not large enough to have more than
a negative weight in the question under discussion.           This weight,
moreover, is lessened by the slight uncertainty arising from the
probable disturbing causes at the first magnetic station.
   It is hoped that a second series of observations at the new station
will throw greater light on the fact of the sun's influence on terres
trial magnetism, by either confirming the results obtained above, or
by adding fresh weight to the conclusions arrived at by the President
of the Royal Society.
  March 23. — General Sir Edward Sabine, K.C.B., President, in the
                                  Chair.
   The following communications      were read   : —
   "On an approximately       Decennial Variation of the Temperature
at the Observatory at the      Cape of Good Hope between the years
 1841 and 1870, viewed in     connexion with the Variation of the Solar
Spots."    By E.   J. Stone,  F.R.S., Astronomer Royal at the Cape of
Good Hope.       In a Letter  to the President.
                      Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, Jan. 17, 1871-
   DEAR SIR, —    I enclose a curve of the variation of the annual mean

                Variation of Temperature at the Cape.                     73
temperature at the Cape deduced from observations extending from
 1841 to 1870 inclusive.      I   have carefully examined the zero-points
of all the thermometers which have been employed in this series of
observations.    I have then deduced the rate of change of these ther
mometers, from a comparison of the index-errors thus found and
those given originally or obtained in 1852 by Sir Thomas Maclear,
when he compared the principal thermometers at the Observatory
with the readings of a standard "Regnault" which had been sent
out to the Observatory for that purpose by you. These indications
of change have been carefully checked by all the comparisons made,
at different times and for different purposes, of these thermometers
inter se and with others which still remain at the Observatory.
From the agreement of the different results thus checked,          I have no
doubt upon my own mind of the systematic character and sensible
amount of the increase of readings of thermometers with age thus
indicated. In some cases the change appears to amount to as
much as 00-05 F. per annum. From these results I have deduced the
index-errors of the different thermometers for the different periods,
and applied these corrections throughout.          I have also corrected the
mean results of the five observations made daily since 1847 in order
to deduce the true daily mean.
    The results thus reduced on a general system, and extending over
thirty years, appeared likely to afford information respecting any
connexion which might exist between the mean temperature and the
frequency of solar spots.       I  have therefore constructed the curves of
variation of mean annual temperature, and the inverse curve of solar-
spot frequency for comparison.         The latter curve has been founded
upon   Wolf's  observations.
    The observations of temperature from 1841 to 1851 inclusive were
made in the original Meteorological Observatory, which was burnt
down in 1852, March 11.
    The observations from 1852, April 24, to 1858, August 31, were
made in a wooden shed erected for the purpose on the site of the old
Observatory.
    The observations from 1858, August 3 1st, to the present time
have been made in the crib before the south-west window of the
Transit-Circle Room.
    These changes are so far unfortunate, that there is clearly a change
of mean temperature arising from the different circumstances of expo
sure.    I have therefore referred each set of observations to the mean
temperature deduced from all the observations made under the same
circumstances of exposure.         The deviations of the mean temperature
 for each year from the mean of the whole period of similar exposure
 are then laid down as ordinates on the scale of one division of the
 ruled paper to 0°'05 F.       To smooth down the irregularities, 1 have
joined  the  points thus  laid   down, and bisected the lines thus joining
 these points whenever the corresponding mean temperatures              were
 deduced from a full year's observations.        In other cases the tempe
ratures corresponding to the deficient months have been supplied
from the adjoining years, and the resulting mean temperature allowed

 74                           Royal Society      :—
 less weight.      The inverse curve of the frequency of solar spots has
 been formed by simply subtracting 100 from Wolfs numbers, and
 laying down points to the scale of a number 4 to 0°'05 F., or one
division of the ruled paper.
The broken curve represents the variations in the mean annual temperature
   at the Cape ; the continuous line ii the inverse curve of solar spots' frequency.
    The agreement between the curves appears to me so close that                    I
cannot but believe that the same cause which leads to an excess of
mean annual temperature leads equally to a dissipation of solar spots.
There is on the whole a curious appearance of lagging of the inverse

                  MM. Wolf      and Fritz on Sun-spots.                75
curve of solar spots over that of temperature.          At the maximum
about 1856, however, this does not appear to be the case ; but when
the uncertainties of the data, both of the solar spots near the mini
mum, and of the mean temperature also, are taken into account,
such discrepancies might perhaps fairly be expected, even if there
be a physical connexion between the two phenomena as results of
some common cause.         If  there be a sensible inequality in the mean
temperature with a period of about ten years, then the mean tem
perature resulting from the observations in the temporary Observa
tory, which were made near a maximum, will be too high.               The
corresponding ordinates, therefore, will be depressed too much rela
 tively to those corresponding to observations made in the other two
observatories.     In the curve 2, 1 have imperfectly corrected the mean
of the results for the temporary observatory on the supposition of
such an inequality existing.       The only result of such a correction is
to modify the curve at the points of junction of the observations
made in different positions.     The general form is unaltered.  It should
be mentioned that the point about which the curves appear to differ
most is near or at the change of exposure from the original observa
tory to the temporary shed, about 1852.
    I may mention that     I  had not the slightest expectation, on first
laying down the curves, of any sensible agreement resulting, but that
I  now consider the agreement too close to be a matter of chance.        I
should, however, rather lean to the opinion that the connexion be
tween the variation of mean temperature and the appearance of solar
spots is indirect rather than direct, that each results from some ge
neral change of solar energy.
    I  have forwarded these curves to you, knowing the great interest
you have ever taken in such inquiries, and on account of your being
the chief promoter of the establishment of a Meteorological Observa
tory here. The problems of meteorology appear to be presented here
in a simpler form than in England ; and probably systematic photo
graphic self-registering observations extended over a few years might
lead to important results.

    Re'sume' of  two   Papers on Sun-spots : — " On the Form of the
Sun-spot Curve," by Prof. Wolf; and
                                             " On the Connexion of Sun-
spots with Planetary Configuration," by M. Fritz.          By B. Loewy.
    Of these two series of investigations, one is by Professor Wolf,
the other by M. Fritz, communicated to Prof. Wolf.
    In the first, Prof. Wolf has proposed to himself to find the mean
character of the curve of sun-spots, i. e. its real form from one
minimum to another. He investigates the form only for 2| years
before, and 2| years after each minimum, and concludes by a simple
proportion of the remainder.        He finds that the curve ascends more
rapidly than it descends — the ascent taking in the mean 3'7 years,

76                         Geological Society: —
the descent lasting 7'4 years.      We have established these data far
more reliably in our last paper ; and our curve gives 3-52 years for
the ascent, 7'54 years for the descent (average of the three periods).
Professor Wolf also thinks that although a single period may differ
essentially in its character and form from the mean, still, on the
whole, if the descent is retarded, the ascent in the same period is
also retarded ; if the former is accelerated, the latter is also acce
lerated.     This is not quite borne out by our curve.     He also over
looks the secondary maximum, which may lead to great conclusions
if more investigated together with other matters.
    M. Fritz comes to the following conclusions : —
     1. The connexion     between sun-spots and auroral and magnetic
disturbances indicates an external cause, to be sought in planetary
configurations.
     2. The relative influence of the planets must be exerted in the fol
 lowing order : — Jupiter (greatest), Venus, Mercury, Earth, Saturn.
     3. This influence cannot entirely depend on the time of rotation ;
 but changes in the magnetic axes of these planets may have the
 most determining effect.
     4. Investigating the comparative influences of them singly and
 together (as far as possible), at the times of conjunction and quadra
 ture, he finds the greatest coincidence of maxima of sun-spots with
 the time when Jupiter and Saturn are in quadrature ; and the great
 est coincidence of minima when these planets are in conjunction.
     5. There is also (a minor) coincidence of maxima when Jupiter
 and Venus are in quadrature.
     There is also an extension of the paper for finding the connexions
 with auroras, and a statement that every 27 '7 days there seems to be
 a monthly maximum, which may probably be explained (according
 to Fritz) by the tendency of a particular solar meridian to spot-
 formation, depending upon the presence of an intra-Mercurial planet.

     1. " On the Physical Relations of the New Eed Marl, RheBtic beds,
 and Lower Lias."       By Prof. A. C. Ramsay, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The author commenced by stating that there is a perfect physical
 gradation between the New Red Marl and the Rhsetic beds.              He
 considered that the New Red Sandstone and Marl were formed in
 inland waters, the latter in a salt lake, and regarded the abundance
 of oxide of iron in them as favourable to this view. The fossil foot
 prints occurring in them were evidence that there was no tide in
 the water.     The author maintained that the New Red Marl is more
 closely  related  to the Rhsetic, and even to the Lias, than to the

             Mr.  J. W. Judd    on the Punfield Formation.            77
Bunter   ; and in support of this opinion he cited both stratigraphical
and palseontological   evidence.   He described what he regarded as
the sequence of events during the accumulation of the later Triassic
deposits and the passage through the Rhaetic to the Lias, and inti
mated that the same reasoning would apply to other British strata,
especially some of those coloured red by oxide of iron, including the
Permian, the Old Red Sandstone, and a part of the Cambrian.

probably   Dinosaurian,  and referable to the genus Iguanodon."       By
J. W. Hulke, Esq., F.K.S., F.G.S.
   The author stated that the skull described by him was obtained
from a Wealden deposit at Brooke, in the Isle of Wight, from which
many remains of Dinosauria have been obtained.         He described its
characters in detail, and remarked that its most striking peculiarities
were : — the completeness of the bony brain-case ; the obliteration of
the sutures, especially those of the basicrauial axis ; the massiveness
of the skull ; and the great downward extension of tho basisphenoid,
with the attendant upward slant of the lower border of the basi-
presphenoidal rod.     The first of these characters occurs elsewhere
among reptiles only in Dicynodon ; and the first and second cha
racters combined were regarded by the author as approximating the
skull to the ornithic type. The reference of this skull to Iguanodon
was founded chiefly on the place from which it was obtained, which
has furnished abundant remains of that genus, and on the oblitera
tion of the sutures, which the author stated to be a character of the
mandibles of Iguanodon.

   The following communications were read : —
   1. " On the Punfield Formation."     By John W. Judd, Esq., F.G.S.,
of the Geological Survey of England and Wales.
   Those formations which have been deposited under fluvio-marine
conditions, and which yield at the same time marine, freshwater,
and terrestrial fossils, are of especial interest to the geologist, as
they furnish him with a means of correlating the great freshwater
systems of strata with those of marine origin.
   At the bottom of the Wealden we have one such fluvio-marine
series, the well-known Purbeck formation ; at its summit is another,
less known, but not less important, for which the name of " Pun-
field Formation" is now suggested.      Some of the fossils of the latter
were first brought under the notice of geologists by Mr. Godwin-
Austen in 1850 ; and their peculiarities have since been the subject
of remark by Prof. E. Forbes, Sir C. Lyell, and others.
   The typical section of the beds is at Punfield Cove, in the Isle of
Purbeck, where they are about 160 feet thick, and include several
bands with marine shells.     The lowest and most remarkable of these
yields about forty well-defined species, many of which, as well as

  78                       Geological Society.
 one of the genera, are quite new to this country.      A section some
 what similar to that of Punfield, is seen at Worborrow Bay.
     In the Isle of Wight, at Compton, Brixton, and Sandown Bays,
 similar fluvio-marine beds are found at the top of the Wealden, and
 attain to a thickness of 230 feet.    The marine bands here, however,
 yield but a very scanty fauna.     Indications of the existence of beds
 of the same character and in a similar position are found in the dis
 trict of the Weald.
    While the Purbeck formation exhibits the gradual passage of the
 marine Portlandian into the freshwater Wealden, the Punfield
 formation shows the transition of the latter into the marine Upper
 Neocomian (Lower Greensand).         Thus we are led to conclude that
the epoch of the English Wealden commenced before the close of the
Jurassic period, lasted through the whole of the Tithonian and of
 the Lower and Middle Neocomian, and only came to a close at the
 commencement of the Upper Neocomian.
    In tracing the Cretaceous strata proper from east to west, they
 are found to undergo great modification ; while the Neocomian and
Wealden, which they overlap through unconformity, besides being
greatly changed in character, thin out very rapidly.
    On stratigraphical and palseontological evidence, the Punfield
 formation is clearly referable to the upper part of the Middle Neo
 comian.    Its fauna has remarkably close analogies with that of the
great coal-bearing formation of eastern Spain, which is of vast
 thickness and great economic value.
    The claim of the Punfield beds, equally with the similarly situated
 Purbeck series, to rank as a distinct formation, is founded on the
distinctness of their mineralogical characters, their great thickness,
the fact of their yielding a considerable and very well characterized
fauna, and of their being the equivalent of a highly important
foreign series.

 district, with a theory on the Denudation of Oolites generally." By
 W. Stephen Mitchell, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., of Gonville and Caius
College, Cambridge.
    The author briefly referred to the theory according to which
oolitic deposits were supposed to have been originally spread out in
continuous sheets over the country which they occupy, and to owe
their division into separate hills to the action of denudation after
their original deposition and consolidation. He suggested, as an
equally probable hypothesis, that, whilst the marls and clays of
oolitic areas were probably originally deposited in continuous beds,
the limestones in many cases may never have extended beyond
the areas now occupied by them.         He described the beds of lime
stone in the oolitic hills as thinning out towards the valleys on, all
sides, maintained that the limestones owed their origin to coral
reefs, and cited several descriptions of coral islands by Prof. Jukes,
to show the agreement in their structure with that which he ascribed

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.            79
to the oolitic hills.    He assumed that in the event of a coral-area
becoming one of sedimentary deposition, the sedimentary deposit
would preserve intact the contour of the coral islands, and inferred
that this has been the case in the Bath district, so that the Great-
Oolite cappings of the hills of that area may represent the original
contours of coral islands, exposed by the denudation of the Brad
ford clay. The amount of denudation undergone by the Great-
Ooliteli mestono he considered to be very small. The Inferior
Oolite, on the contrary, he believed to have suffered denudation ; and
he considered that the course of the valleys formed by this agent
was dependent on the form of the limestones capping the hills.

             ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF            HAIL.
                             BY PAUL REINSCH.

        counted among     the meteorological phenomena which have not
been fully explained, yet its differences from otheratmospheric deposits
 (as, for instance, in structure) show that in its formation causes are at
work which in the formation of other atmospheric deposits are either
entirely wanting or only operate in less degree. Yet from the differ
ence in hailstones as regards form, magnitude, and internal structure
it must be concluded that the same causes are not always at work.
In any case, in order to give a theory which shall completely explain
the phenomena, it is important to know all types of hailstones ; more
especially does the microscopic structure offer many criteria for a cor
rect theory.      In this subject of meteorology, as in many other
branches of science, the microscope has a future before it. The
present notice has reference to the microscopic structure of the hail
stones of a storm which passed over part of the Westrich in the
afternoon of June 8, 1869, a few days before the fall of the Kraken-
berg meteorite. The hailstones had a diameter of 10 to 12 rail-
lims., were almost exactly spherical, and appeared to have rather a
concentric than a radial structure.      An individual stone laid upon
the object-table of a microscope was seen to be made up of individual
corns or granules all of nearly the same size, in the middle of each
of which was a single minute bubble with a brighter core and darker
periphery.     The individual granules are ordinarily round, but some
times elongated ; they are bounded by a well-defined line, and are
sharply separated from each other ; so that part of a hailstone shows
some similarity to the merenchymatic structure of the vegetable
cell ; the substance of the grain itself is quite homogeneous and free
from structure*.       As the hailstone gradually melts on the surface
of the object-table the following remarkable deportment is observed.
The darker sharp contour of the granule disappears at the fusion-line
   *  I was unfortunately unable to observe the structure of the solid sub
stance of the grain in polarized light.

 ment from the rest of the solid apparently homogeneous mass of the
 granule.      But as soon as the line of fusion reaches the spherical
 bubble of the granule, the bubble rapidly recedes from the line of
 fusion, expanding to more than fifty times its former volume.
    The diameter of the individual granule is from 0'0.)44 to 0'0724 mil-

 in the centre of the granule, and which is seen to be a minute air-
 bubble, is 0'0088 millim.      From what is observed on the melting of
 the granule, the bubble is air, yet air which is condensed to one-
 fiftieth of its original volume.  The individual air-bubbles, which im
 mediately after their expansion have under the ordinary atmospheric
 pressure a diameter of 0-02716 to 0'0314 millim., swim for a short
 time without change in the ice-water of the object-table.        As the

  XI.   On the Reflection of Light from Transparent Matter.      By
     The Hon. J. W. STRUTT, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College,
     Cambridge*.
         connexion with other investigations on light I had occa
  IN sion to consider     the problem of reflection, in order to see
  how far the facts might be accounted for by the different hypo
  theses which have been made as to the condition of the aether in
 transparent matter.       Although, as I now find, some of the re
 sults then arrived at have been already given by Lorenz, of
  Copenhagen, the publication of the present paper may not be
  without use, as I cannot agree with him on many important
 points, and great misapprehension seems to prevail on the sub
ject generally.
     Starting with the assumption that the rigidity is the same in
 the two media, and that the vibrations of light are normal to the
 plane of polarization, Fresnel was led to the conclusion that if
 the incident vibration be represented by unity, the reflected
vibration is given by the expressions
                       sin (0,—0)    tan(fl,-0)
according to whether the plane of primitive polarization coincides
 with or is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.    The process
 by which the first (sine) formula is obtained is rigorous, or at
 least may be made so by additional explanations.       With regard
to the second, the reasoning cannot be considered demonstrative,
although, as a matter of fact, the arbitrary principle assumed

82            The Hon.    J. W. Strutt    on the Reflection  of
 (that the vibrations in the two media* when resolved parallel to
 the surface of separation are equal) and the conclusion are ap
 proximately true.      Fresnel did not contemplate the possibility
 of a change of phase which, as we now know from Jamin's ex-
 perimentsf, accompanies reflection in one, if not in both of the
 principal    cases.
     Green's important work " On the Laws of Reflection and Re
 fraction of Light at the Common Surface of two non- crystallized
 Media," was read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society on
 December 1 1, 1837, and published in the Transactions for 1838 J.
 In this paper, which has never received on theContinent the atten
 tion which it deserves, Green investigates the equations of motion
 of an elastic medium, setting out, as we should now say, from the
 principle of energy.        By Lagrange's method he deduces both
 the general equations applicable throughout the interior, and
  the conditions which must be satisfied at the surface of sepa
  ration of two media.         The statical properties of an isotropic
  medium are defined by two constants A and B, the second ex
  pressing the rigidity, and the first depending, though not in the
  simplest manner, on the compressibility.           For the luminiferous
  aether it is shown that A must be indefinitely great, or that the
  medium resists change of volume with an infinite force.            During
  motion the inertia of the medium comes into play, and a con
  stant expressing the density must be added to the two statical
  constants already mentioned.           In all this there seems to be
  nothing    to which  exception    can be  taken, unless it be to the as
  sumption (expressly stated by Green) that the sphere of sensible
  action of the molecular forces, or, as       I  should prefer to say, the
  range of the mutual influence of the parts of the medium, is in
  sensible in comparison with the length of the wave, and that the
  transition from the one state of things to the other at the bound
 ing surface is so rapid that it may be treated as abrupt.
     But in the application to the question of reflection further
  assumptions are made whose significance has been strangely
 misunderstood.       When light passes from air into a denser me
 dium, it propagates itself slower than before in the ratio of p : 1,
 but this consideration alone is not sufficient to lead to a definite
 solution.      From the equation
                                 B,_ J_B
                                 Pi     P? P

must be known before further progress (other than tentative)
can be made.      From the fact that in all the known gases A is
independent of the nature of the gas, Green argues that we
may assume the same for B,
                                  " at least when we consider those
phenomena only which depend merely on different states of the
                                                "
same medium, as is the case with light — an inference which
certainly appears very precarious.       In a note he says, " Though
for all known gases A is independent of the nature of the gas,
perhaps it is extending the analogy rather too far to assume
that in the lumiuiferous aether the constants A and B must
always be independent of the state of the aether as found in
different refracting substances.      However, since the hypothesis
greatly simplifies   the  equations  due   to the surface of junction
of the two media, and is itself the most simple that could be
selected, it seemed natural first to deduce the consequences
which follow from it before trying a more complicated one, and,
as far as I have yet found, these consequences are in accordance
 with observed facts."
    In a very wild criticism of this theory, at the end of an other
wise sound paper *, Kurz, having mistaken the meaning of A,
 B, attributes to Green the absurd assumption that the wave-
 velocities are the same in the two media, and metaphorically
 holds up his hands in amazement.             I  need hardly point out
 that Green's conditions A=A,, B = B, are something quite
 different, and imply simply an identity of statical properties in
 the case of the two media.      It may be shown, however, that the
          =
 first (A A() is unnecessary, a fact which Green does not seem
 to have perceived.     The cause of the refraction is a variation of
 the dynamical property (density) . The rest of Green's reason-
 ing is rigorous, admitting of no cavil. When the vibrations
 are normal to the plane of incidence, the amplitude of the
 reflected vibration is expressed accurately by FresneFs sine-for
 mula ; but the tangent-formula is only applicable to vibrations
 in the plane of incidence as a first approximation.        It is evident
 that, in order that theory may at all agree with observation, the
 vibrations of light must be supposed to be performed nor
 mally to the plane of polarization ; indeed the two assumptions
 of coustant rigidity and normal vibrations are closely bound
  up together in all parts of optics.     The effect of the hypotheti
 cal relations A  =  AP B B, is greatly to simplify the bounding
                           =
 conditions which then express the equality of the component
  displacements and their derivatives on the two sides of the sepa
  rating surface. In this form they become identical with the
 so-called Principle of Continuity of Movement stated by Cauchy,

who does not appear to have seen that a continuity of strain
implies necessarily a continuity of statical properties across the
surface of separation, as is evident in a moment from D'Alem-
bert's principle.       So far there is absolute agreement between
Green and Cauchy, the only difference being that Green went
 deeper into the matter and gave the interpretation, if not the
justification of the principle assumed straight off by Cauchy.
The divergence which exists between the results of the two theo
ries takes its rise in their treatment of the longitudinal wave
 produced when the vibrations are in the plane of incidence,
 whose consideration cannot be dispensed with, although its di
 rect effect is confined to within a few wave-lengths of the sur
 face.     Green merely supposes that the velocity of propagation of
 disturbances depending on change of volume is infinite in both
 media, and accordingly arrives at a result which contains only
 one constant — the refractive index ; while Cauchy, on the other
 hand, imagines a sort of opacity to longitudinal vibrations, in
 virtue of which the waves are damped, and introduces a new
 constant called the coefficient of extinction.       Cauchy, I believe,
 never published the proof of his formulae ; but the want has been
 supplied by German physicists*.           Whatever may be thought of
 the processes by which they are obtained, there can be no doubt
 that Cauchy's formulse agree very well with the observations of
 Jamin ; while the same cannot be said of Green's as they stand in
 his original memoir.        A modified form of the latter, however, has
 been given by Haughton f, to which I am inclined to adhere. He
 thought that, by supposing the incompressibility, though great,
 to be still finite, the second constant might be introduced, without
 which an agreement with observation is impossible.            Apart from
 the difficulty of explaining what becomes of the longitudinal
 wave when the incidence is nearly normal, in which case it
 must be propagated in the ordinary way, his reasoning is en
tirely vitiated by an oversight already remarked on by Eisen-
lohr. The difference between Cauchy's formula? and Green's,
as modified by Flaughton, is barely sensible in the experiments
of Jamin, which are for the most part confined to the neigh-
 hood of the polarizing angle; but according to KurzJ, whose
observations extended over a wider range, the latter has a decided
advantage as an empirical representation of the facts.
    Quite different from the foregoing is the theory of Mac-
Cullagh and Neumann, which is given in an accessible form in
            '
Lloyd's Wave-Theory of Light.' The following principles are
laid down as the basis of investigation : —

     I. The vibrations of polarized light are parallel to the plane of
polarization.
   II. The density of the aBther is the same in all bodies as
in   vacua.
     III. The vis viva is preserved ; from which it follows that
the masses of the sether put in motion, multiplied by the squares
of the amplitudes of vibration, are the same before and after re
flection.
   IV. The resultant of the vibrations is the same in the two
media ; and therefore in singly refracting media the refracted
vibration is the resultant of the incident and reflected vi
brations.
   When the vibrations are normal to the plane of incidence,
and therefore parallel in all three waves, the application of these
principles gives rigorously Eresnel's tangent expression.             If
the vibrations are in the plane of incidence, the fourth principle
alone leads to Fresnel's sine-formula.         This only shows that the
fourth principle is inconsistent with the others; for, as we shall
see, unexceptionable reasoning founded on I. and II. leads to
an altogether different result.         The very particular case of IV.
required    when   the  vibrations  are   normal to the plane of inci
dence happens to be correct.          In order to prevent misappre
hension, I should say there is a sense in which IV. is perfectly
true.     If the vibrations belonging to the longitudinal surface-
waves be included, it expresses merely the continuity of dis
placement, a condition which must necessarily be fulfilled ac
 cording to any view of the subject.            But understood in this
true sense, it does not carry the consequences deduced from it.
 It remains then to be seen what the magnitude of the reflected
wave would be according to principles I. and II., when the
light is polarized in the plane of incidence.            Let us take up
the question after the method of Green, and inquire what are
the consequences of the various suppositions which may be
made : and first for light vibrating normally to the plane of
incidence.
    The plane of separation of the media being #=0, let the axis
of z be parallel to the fronts of the waves, so that z=0 is the
plane of incidence.       The displacements in the two media are in

    If we assume the complete accuracy of Fresnel's expressions,
either case agrees with observation ; only, if n=n', light vi
brates normally to the plane of polarization ; while if D = l)', the
vibrations are parallel to that plane.        But we know that Fresnel's
tangent-formula is      not accurate,    and  that there is in general no
angle of complete polarization,       so that already the presumption
is in favour of Case 1 ; but      I would not lay much stress upon
this, as the phenomena investigated by Jamin are of a secondary
character, and might be due to the action of disturbing causes.
    Case  III. We may suppose that n and D both vary.            Here we
should obtain something between Fresnel's two expressions,
which could hardly be reconciled with observation, unless one
variation were very subordinate to the other.           Other considera
tions seem to exclude this case ; for if n and D both vary, there
is nothing to prevent their varying proportionally, so as to
leave the wave- velocity unchanged, or /t=l.             The transmitted
wave would then not be turned, although there would be a finite
reflection.    Nothing of this kind is known in nature, whichever
way the light may be polarized.           But the most satisfactory argu
ment against the joint variation is derived from the theory of the
diffraction of light from very small particles, whose diameter does
not exceed a small fraction of the wave-length.            Hitherto there
has been no theoretical difficulty.            Case I. is only a trans
lation into analysis of the reasoning of Fresnel, and Case II. of
the reasoning of MacCullagh.          But when we pass on to the con
sideration of the problem when the vibrations are in the plane
of incidence, our footing is no longer so sure.             However close
the analogy may be between the phenomena of light and the
 transverse vibrations of an elastic solid, one cannot but feel that
 it may not extend to those motions which are independent of
 rigidity, and of which in the case of the sether we have no direct
 knowledge.      Still, in the absence of all others, we cannot do
 better than follow the guide which has already served us so well.

   We have seen that when the vibrations are normal to the plane
of incidence there is no difference of phase between the incident
and reflected waves, unless the change of sign, when the second
medium is the denser, be considered such. Now what is observed
in experiments is the acceleration or retardation of the one po
larized component with regard to the other, and is therefore given
simply by e— e1. The ambiguity must be removed by the con
sideration   that when the incidence is normal there is no relative
change of phase, though throughout Jamin's papers it is assumed
that there is in that case a phase-difference of half a period.      I
am at a loss to understand      how Jamin could have entertained
such a view, which is inconsistent with continuity, inasmuch as
when 0=0 the distinction between polarization in the plane of
reflection and polarization in the perpendicular plane disappears.

                           Lorenz*, who, however, has not discussed

sudden as we have hitherto considered              occupies distance not

immeasurably leas than the wave-length,           —  certainly    very rea         a
sonable supposition.         But there are two objections to bis view
which are, to my mind, fatal. In the first place, Fresnel's tangent-
formula does not express the result of sudden transition a               and
what       more, Green's formula (17), which does express
            is                                                           de                      it, ;
viates from the truth on the other side.           The difficulty     not to                is
explain why Fresnel's formula             not accurately correct, but why
                                             is
the divergences from            are not greater than we actually find
                                 it
them.      According to (17), the light reflected at the polarizing
angle from the diamond or any other substances of high refrac
tive index would be           very considerable fraction of the whole,
                                a
very much greater than what             observed.
                                             is      Another objection to
the view that the light reflected at the polarizing angle            due to                 is
the want of abruptness in the transition, seems to be contained
in the consideration that,          this were really its origin,

 by  the substitution of — esin         for M, agree very well with ex

I am at  a loss to understand how any                                         mechanical   theory of im
perfect elasticity could lead to such an                                      equation.     Ifwe were to
speculate as to the most probable form                                        of the equation of motion,
we should perhaps give the preference                                         to

 I     now come to the modification of Green's theory proposed                                 by
 Haughton. If M were an arbitrary constant instead of defi                                a
 nite function of p, there would be but little difference between
 the two sets of formulae for the factor sin
                                         ;               would not vary 6
 greatly in the neighbourhood of the polarizing angle, where
 alone the correction to Fresnel's original expression           sensible.        is
 So far as the question has been treated experimentally, the ba
 lance of evidence seems to be rather against than for the factor
 sin   0.
        I have already remarked that Haughton's reasons for con
 sidering M as an independent constant cannot be sustained, but
at the same time       think that others of considerable force may

  XII.    On  Mr. Hopkins' s Method of determining the Thickness       of
      the Earth's Crust.    By Archdeacon PRATT, M.A., F.R.S.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
          my letter in your Number for July of last year I gave a
  IN     reply to M. Delaunay on the above subject in a popular
  form, — and in that way explained that, even if the fluid interior
  of the earth's mass at any moment revolved with the crust as if
  the two were one solid mass, this state could not continue ; the
  crust under the action of the precessional force would slip over
  the fluid, not being solidly connected with it.
      M. Delaunay (as reported in 'Nature/ March 16, 1871,
  column 1) has again said that " calculations prove
                                                              " that the
  thickness of the crust has "no influence on the revolution of the
  earth."     I therefore now send you a calculation to show that
  the crust, with an interior fluid nucleus, both following the law
  of density adopted by Laplace, cannot move as it would if the
  crust and nucleus were one solid mass.           The method I pursue is
  this. At the epoch from which t (the time) is measured I assume
  that things are exactly as M. Delaunay supposes, viz. that in
  ternal friction and viscosity have reduced the fluid to entire
  obedience at that moment to the movements of the crust.               I
  then show by the equations that this state of things cannot con
  tinue.     This mode of taking the problem enables me easily to
  calculate the effect of the fluid pressure on the crust at the epoch ;
  and any minute motion, gradually generated in the fluid after
  this for a short time, would enter into the equations as a quan
  tity of the second and higher orders and may be neglected. The
  slowness of the disturbed motion and the viscosity would have
  the effect of prolonging the period through which my equations
  would apply.                           .,... .

      2. The forces acting on the crust are the attraction of the sun
  and moon from without, and the pressure of the fluid against its
  interior surface j and the pressure of the fluid is produced by
  the centrifugal force and the attraction of the sun and moon on
   the fluid.    As the crust is supposed to be made up of spheroidal
   shells, it will have no effect on the fluid.

   XIII.     On a Practical Method for detecting bad Insulators on
          Telegraph Lines.     By Louis SCHWENDLER, Esq.*
             of the many practical measures, and certainly not one
ONE       of the least important, introduced during the last few
years    with   the view of increasing the efficiency of the telegraph
department, is the establishment of a scientific system of testing
all materials and instruments employed on the line.                   Many
practical results have already been obtained therefrom ; but it is
not the object of the present communication to enter into the
details of this most interesting subject ; I will only point out
one important fact that has been established : —
    A great many lines in India contain electrically defective insu
lators — some to such an extent as to lower the insulation to a
degree which is fatal to the direct and regular working of long lines.
     How such insulators could creep in, notwithstanding the
care taken in England to secure efficient telegraph stores for
India, is a question with which          I cannot deal at present, but
which may perhaps form the subject of a future paper when
more data have been collected t-
    The very fact that electrically defective insulators, showing
nothing externally, do exist and are distributed over lines of such
   * From the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for March 18/1.
Communicated by the Author.
    t  The cause for the low insulation of insulators seems to be the porous
state of some porcelain, through which a minute quantity of water diffuses
 itself in time.   When an imperfect insulator is heated, it always becomes
perfect ; but immersed a sufficiently long time in water it becomes again
 imperfect.
    The leakage seems to be invariably in that part of a porcelain which is
cemented in the iron hood.

104          M. L. Schwendler      on a Practical Method
vast extent, has created the necessity of having a reliable method
                                                                     ones
by which such insulators can be detected, and other perfect
substituted with the least possible expense.
   It is clear that such a method, to be practicable, must be very
simple, and the instruments used portable and handy*.
   After some searching in this direction, the following method
was found to answer the purpose most satisfactorily.
   The principle of the method is to produce magneto-electric
currents through the resistance of the insulator under test, and
to measure these currents by the effect they have on the body of
the tester.
   The subjoined diagram shows the connexions readily.
    J is a magneto -electric    machine, the two terminals t and /' of
 which are insulated from each other and from the ground.
    / is in permanent contact with a perfectly insulated leading
 wire I, long enough to reach the insulator,        to the iron hood of
 which it is to be hooked.
    * To use a deflection method is out of the question, because the still
 comparatively high resistance of the insulators which have to be detected
 would necessitate a high electromotive force and a very delicate galvano
 meter, which arrangements could not be made easily portable, as is required
 when the tester proceeds along aline.

          for  detecting bad Insulators on Telegraph Lines,       105
    t1 is in permanent     connexion with the clamp c, to which is
fixed a small platinum knob m; and both the clamps cand t/are
permanently connected with each other.         A well-insulated lead
ing wire, II, which is to be hooked on to the bracket of the insu
lator under test, is in contact with the moveable platinum knob
mf, which, however, is insulated from d when pressed down, but
which in its position of rest (or when not pressed down short)
closes the circuit between c and c1 at/.
    The whole arrangement is constructed light but strong, pro
tected from rain, and can be carried along the Hue by one man
only.
    The tester proceeds as follows : —
    After having cleaned the insulator carefully, he removes tem
porarily the line from the insulator and hooks the leading wire
No. I to the iron hood, and leading wire No.       II to the bracket
of the insulator.       He then turns the handle of the magneto-
electric machine with one hand, while one finger of the other is
resting on the knob m of clamp c.
    As soon as he touches with the other finger the knob m1 of
clamp d, at the same time pressing it down, the metallic circuit
 between c and m1 is opened, and the positive and negative mag
neto-electric currents have to pass from one finger to the other,
and consequently, if strong enough, will give the tester sensible
 shocks, by which he is at once informed that the insulator under
 test is defective, and much under the fixed standard of insulation.
     If the tester does not feel any current through his fingers (a
comparatively rough galvanoscope), he has only to repeat the
 experiment by placing his tongue on the knob m while his hand
 still presses the knob m! down.        If no current is felt by the
 tester through this most delicate galvauoscope (the tongue), he
 can rest assured that the insulator is perfect for all practical
purposes.
     By opening and closing the circuit alternately at the knob m'
 the tester has it in his power to allow at short intervals currents
to pass through his tongue, and consequently will be able to de
 tect the slightest induction-currents.
     The following experiments were made with insulators of known
 resistance, to ascertain the highest limit by which the tongue is
 still able to detect induction-currents.
     The currents in these experiments were produced by one of
 Siemens's well-known dial instruments, the revolving bobbin of
 which had a resistance =1577 S. units.
     The absolute resistance of each insulator was first carefully
 measured in the ordinary manner without water in the porcelain
cups, and the insulator afterwards tested by the method above
described.

  From     these experimentsit follows that all insulators offering
a resistance up to about 1 millim. S. unit can be detected by
the fingers, and those above 1 millim. and under 8 millims. can
be unmistakably     detected by the tongue.     It appeared also that
tongues of different persons were equally sensitive, since several
persons (Europeans and natives) acknowledged the known acid
taste, even through the insulator No. 9, having 8'2 millims. S.
units resistance.
   The highest limit of the method could, of course, be increased
by filling the revolving bobbin of the magneto-electric machine
with much finer wire and increasing the number of permanent
magnets; however this will be scarcely necessary, because it
seems to be a fact that if an insulator has more than about 8
millims., the resistance is generally so high as to be practically
infinite, and therefore a greater sensitiveness of the instrument
would only complicate the method.
    As it is intended that the tester himself should turn the handle
of the magneto-electric machine, he has it entirely in his power
to regulate the strength of the induction-currents        by turning
faster or slower ; and as, besides this, he always begins the test
ing by at first sending the currents through his fingers, no
 severe shocks can occur to him in the subsequent operation.
    The method has also a safeguard in itself against carelessly
rejecting good insulators, because the tester will certainly be
careful in having the insulator properly cleaned before testing                   it,
in order to avoid severe shocks.
    There can also be scarcely any doubt that the tongue          the        is

best detector in this particular case, because it is sufficiently sen
sitive, never gets out of order, and indicates almost momentary
currents ; it is besides the cheapest instrument that could be used.
    Note. — This method may also with advantage be used for de
tecting bad joints in a telegraph line. It is then only necessary
to connect the two ends of the joint to the two terminals of the
magneto-electric     machine in such a way that the body of the
tester acts as a shunt to the joint.
    A joint which offers a resistance of not less than 5 S. units
allows a current to pass sufficiently strong to be detected by the
tongue ; but if the joint has a resistance of more than 200 S. units,
the current passing is strong enough to be felt already by the
fingers of the tester.

   I  shall not delay longer on this first operation, except to make
the following remark. At the end of this first operation, the
new values of A and C are equal but with opposite signs ; and
it is evident that the same remark will apply to the result of
every succeeding operation.     But it did not apply to the values
A, C with which we started. We must therefore consider these
values obtained after the first operation as the beginuing of the
symbolical series; and we may call them A0. B0. — A0.

the values Aw Bn) — A. : and that we examine the effect of tbe

proof of correctness to be necessary when real values are in
ferred from a process conducted by means of imaginary quan
tities.
    It is worthy of remark that the expression for the amount of
prominence consists, in each case, of the product of two terms
which vary with the number of operations.                 The second term is
periodical, showing          that  the   prominence may even change sign.
But the first shows a rapid decrease in geometrical progression :
one operation makes a reduction in the proportion of 14 : 5
nearly ; two operations, in the proportion of 8 : 1; four operations,
in the proportion of 64 : 1, &c.              The rapid approach to a truly
plane surface is thus explained.

Introductory Remarks.      Primary postulate of the atomic theory. Dalton's

   neither suggest nor prove the existence of indivisibles ; the equatorial
   method leads only to a least common multiple.        Instances of the sup
   posed explanation of isomerism on atomic principles : chemical structure.
   Definite proportions may be consistent with infinite divisibility, and are
   consistent with continuity : illustrations.     Absence of evidence that
   matter and division are mutually related : appeal to philosophy neces
   sary.   Digby's proof that there are no parts in quantity.      The atomic
   theory shares in the fallacy of materialism, — and of the absolute, so far
   as that is fallacious.   Actual realization of the atom : parallel from
   phlogiston. Instances of uncertain and contradictory results. Opinions
   of Newton, Descartes, Leibnitz, Kant, Davy, Wollaston, and Faraday.

defenders are not agreed.      Dalton, for example (New System,
 pp. 135, 136), conceives water to have an internal constitution
resembling square piles of shot arranged in successive horizontal
strata.    " A vessel full of auy pure elastic fluid " also "
                                                              presents
to the imagination a picture like one full of small shot " (pp. 147
& 189). When two gases are mixed, an intestine motion ensues,
and continues " till the particles arrive at the opposite surface of
 the vessel against any point of which they can rest with stability,
and the equilibrium at length is acquired when each gas is uni
 formly diffused through the other" (p. 190).          Solids likewise
 consist of arranged particles (p. 209).     Hence it is evident that
Dalton regarded atoms as enjoying a perfect repose, unless when
mechanically or chemically disturbed.         In this purely statical
contemplation he has been followed by most chemists, some of
whom have believed themselves to dissent wholly from his theory.
What is the theory of types, but an emanation from the prime
idea involved in the celebrated figures at the end of the ' New
System'? The wooden models with which Dalton illustrated his
lectures have reappeared as glyptic formulae; and the material
existence of their connecting wires is perpetuated in the lines or
" bonds " of graphic formulae.
   But atoms have been considered from another point of view.
It has been found by not a few thinkers that rest is a condition
which falsely represents the facts of nature, and that atoms must
therefore be conceived as moving with an industry to which cessa
tion is unknown. On this view, the state of dissolved salts and
the process of precipitation are explained much as Berthollet ex
plained them, only in corpuscular language.            Supposing, for
example, hydric chloride      be  added  to aqueous cupric sulphate.
That cupric chloride is formed is shown by the green coloration
that ensues.     Hence there has been a partition of the copper. This
is accounted for by supposing all the atoms in the mixture to
move constantly — by adopting, in short, the theory of greatest
effort.    Another chemist observes that if all the atoms were per
fectly free to move, no compound could be stable, and conse
quently brings forward an hypothesis of "limited atomic mobility."
    Considerations derived from chemical formulae have frequently
been adduced in favour of the atomic theory, and therefore de
serve attention.    The formula themselves were at first the results
of experimental facts in quantitative analysis, and are therefore
independent of theory.        Dalton first applied a method of sym
 bolic ratios, in which attention was especially drawn, first, to a
 standard unit for each element, and secondly to that unit's co
efficient.   The standard unit is then taken as the atom ; a ne
cessary consequence of which supposition            is,
                                                  that all coefficients
must be integral.       It will be observed, however, that we are now

no longer dealing with fact but with a crude conjecture ; and
the well-known rules given by Dalton for ascertaining the com
plexity of a combination, and intended to develope his system of
ratios, are more conjectural still : —   If  only one combination of
two elements exist, it must be presumed to be binary ; when
three combinations are obtained, we may expect one to be a bi
nary, and the other two ternary, and so on*. Berzelius himself
felt enamoured of the theory, and occasionally turned aside from
the path of induction to guesswork of a similar kind : — Strong
bases consist of a radical taken once, combined with oxygen taken
oncef; and,     "if  a combustible    radical J  unite with oxygen in
several proportions, these are compared, and the result is reduced
to the smallest number of atoms possible." With the introduction
of the word equivalent by Wollaston, the symbolic unit acquired a
new implication; and the historical reader is familiar with the con
fusion produced and maintained for very many years bythis inser
tion of a peculiarly dynamical idea in the ungenialsoilof contempo
rary speculation. Writers of text-books failed to understand their
position ; and the science was still struggling underground when
the splendid discovery of Dulong and Petit gave it vigour and fo
liage. This discovery, indeed, was left to other hands to improve
or perfect; but by the distinct relation it evinced between the sym
bolic standard and specific heat, decision and certainty were able
to displace conjecture.     Another important step was to adopt a
uniform understanding as to the relation of composition to specific
gravity of vapour, this understanding having been based upon
formula which had been determined by the previously existing
canons.     The indications afforded by isomorphism are of minor
value.    But throughout these various processes —establishing
by analytical comparison certain standard units and ratios, dis
covering that certain of these were connected with the specific
heat by a simple law, that to these a uniform vapour-volume
may be assigned, and that similarity of chemical function fre
quently involves similarity of form (another function) — where
does indivisibility suggest itself? Still less is the existence of
an atom proved.
    I now pass from the singular relations of formula to consider
them as existing in equations.       Let it be required, for instance,
to find the formula of benzol.         The values C = 12, H = arel
given.    The analytical result, in terms of these values, is C H.
Recourse is then had to chlorination, which occurs, or may be
taken to occur, in successive stages ; the product at each stage
is analyzed (Cl = 35-5), and the corresponding minimum equa
tions are written thus : —

    The    passage  from chlorine derivative to parent compound is
effected    by the  numerical exchange of Cl for H, the validity of
 which need not be disputed, though it is often much misunder
 stood. We then have four formulae— C6 H6, C8 H3, C8 H«, C H
— between which to choose. Now the equational method, if I
 may so term         does not exactly choose between these, but takes
                    it,
 the least common multiple         them, and, on that ground, decides
                                       of
 on C6 H6 as the formula of benzol.          The doctrine of replacement
in successive stages (as, for instance, the treble ethylation of
 ammonia)     is  substantially identical in its symbolic exposition
 with the equational method.         Now this method         held to point
                                                                   is

whether, as professedly inductive reasoners, they are still pleased
to accept these shadows for reality.           My argument may have            a
better fortune, perhaps, with those who sit loose to theory, or at
 least will not voluntarily put on the shirt of Nessus.            Accord
ingly, it   may  be   advantageous       after

C4 H4 Bra O4, and three dibromo-pyrotartrates   (Cs H6 Br4 O4) arc
formed.   We have therefore to explain how it is that these facts,
assuming them to be true, are compatible with each other. Ke-
kule proceeds as follows : —
   " In accordance with the views relating to the atomicity of the
elements which we have previously unfolded on several occasions
 (see especially § 1369), all the affinities of the atoms comprising
the molecule of succinic (or its homologue pyrotartaric) acid are
saturated ; these acids constitute, in a manner, closed molecules.
They contain two atoms of typical oxygen, that          is,
                                                          oxygen bound
on to carbon     by  only oue of its two units of affinity.     Two   hy
drogen atoms are united with the carbon only through the inter
vention of these typical oxygen atoms.              These two typical
hydrogen    atoms   are  easily displaceable      by
                                                 metals  ; but there are
two other oxygen atoms present which are attached          to the carbon
 by  two units of affinity, aud consequently, in the language of the
type theory, belong to the radical.
    " Now, it   is easy to see that, in addition to these two typical
hydrogen     atoms,    succinic has four, and pyrotartaric acid six,
more    atoms  of hydrogen.     This hydrogen, which in the language
of type theory belongs to the radical,          is,
                                               according to the theory
of the atomicity of the elements, directly combined with the
carbon — in fact, in such       manner that two hydrogen atoms are
                                a
always    united  with  the  same  carbon atom.
    " Next, let us assume that two such hydrogen atoms are absent
(fehlen) from one or other of these two normal acids; we have,
on the one hand, the composition of fumaric and maleic acid,
the formulae of itaconic, citraconic, and mesaconic acid on the
other.     But since in succinic acid two pairs of such hydrogen
atoms are bound to the carbon, two acids may evidently exist with
less hydrogen   ;   and similarly,     the case of pyrotartaric acid, we
                                       in
can understand how there may be three isomers with less hydro
gen, according to the absence of one or other of the three pairs
of hydrogen atoms, which in the normal substance are directly
united with the carbon.
    "At that place in the molecule whence the two hydrogen atoms
are absent, two units of affinity of the carbon are left unsaturated   ;
at that place there   is, so to speak,    gap.
                                            a     Hence we can explain
the exceptional facility with which these substances unite,      by  way
of addition, with hydrogen or bromine.          The free units of affi
nity of the carbon make an effort to saturate themselves, and so
to fill up the gap.
    " If hydrogen be introduced into these unoccupied spaces, all
carbon atoms within the molecule are united to the same ele
ment — hydrogen; there appears no ground for the existence
of differently modified normal substances as so obtained.             In

  fact, only one succinic and one pyrotartaric acid are at present
  known.
     "If,   on the other hand, bromine be put                        in
                                                        those same unoc
  cupied spaces, the carbon within the molecule             'partly unitedis
  with hydrogen, partly with bromine           and    ;         it   is
                                                         readily perceived
  that different modifications of such bromo-acids must necessarily
  exist, according as the bromine finds itself in one or the other of
  those spaces."
     This mode of explanation             now virtually common to all
                                             is

                               is
  cules, these again of atoms; that determinate space or position
  (Stelle)  is conceivable without atoms, and exists indeed in their
  absence;    and that into this space there stretch at all times mys
 terious units of affinity, which, when the atoms are no longer
 present, strive after combination.         But all chemical substances

 "to rivet together," &c. It             much to be deplored that no

Sinne," has tacitly shown the weakness of the atomic interpreta
tion of isomerism.
     Those who consider isomerism explained by such methods as
have just been discussed, must understand by an explanation
something different from the scientific meaning of that term.        A
phenomenon is explained when it is shown to be a part or in
stance of one or more known and more general phenomena.
 Isomerism is not, therefore, explained by assertions about indi
 visibles, which have neither been themselves discovered nor
 shown to have any analogy in the facts or course of nature — nor
 by explicit statements about a "structure" which has never
 been seen — nor by the use of a phrase to which no clear defini
 tion has been, or can be, attached.
     Before isomerism had acquired the importance it now pos
 sesses, the great argument in favour of the atomic theory was
 that the law of multiple and that of definite proportions unde
 niably represent facts which can be explained only by the exist
 ence of atoms.       Here the inadequate and idle notion of an
                 "
 "explanation recurs.       I have already (p. 115) exposed the fal
 lacy   of  supposing  that  the equational method of arriving at
 formulae is any thing more than the arithmetical process of taking
 the least common multiple — and pointed out the imaginary
 nature of Dalton's rules (p. 114); and formulae            that have
 been obtained by these means, in order to affirm the law of mul
 tiple or definite proportions, are condemned accordingly.         But
  the exact point of this argument, so far as it has not been alluded
  to already, lies in the following considerations.     Supposing an
 aqueous solution of hydric chloride be mixed with successive
  email quantities of sodic hydrate.     Several actions occur; but
  consider for a moment only that one whereby the hydrogen of
  the hydric chloride is exchanged for sodium.         It is quite evi
  dent that, on each addition of the sodic hydrate, a new compound
  ought to be produced containing, say, the whole of the sodium,
  in the form Hx Nay Clz; and as the quantity of the sodium may
  be varied infinitely at pleasure, an infinite variety of hydrosodic
  chlorides must, if matter be infinitely divisible, be the result of
  the process.    But not only does such a variety not arise, there
  is a perfect absence of any hydrosodic compound ; for the sole
  product of the reaction in every case is sodic chloride, Na Cl.
  Hence it is inferred that matter cannot be infinitely divisible —
 that there has been a saltus — in short, that atoms exist.
      Now this is a question of a constant ratio considered as ex
  isting between sodium and chlorine when brought together
  under conditions which need not be constant.         As the mixture
  is made, the sodium and chlorine are unquestionably divided by
 being dissolved in a larger quantity of liquid than before.         If

 10 grammes of sodium were originally present, they now con
 sist of two lots of, say, 5 grammes each.        This makes it quite
 conceivable that, without the addition of any more of the solvent,
 the division may continue of its own accord, say, into ten lots of
 1 gramme each, a thousand       lots of a decigramme each, and so
 on, without limit.     The same is true of the chlorine. On en
 deavouring to prepare a compound from the solution, only one
 is obtained with an invariable ratio between the sodium and the
 chlorine.     The reason of this phenomenon is presumed to be
 unknown and to be now sought.           I can only say that the fact,
 from the above point of view, is as conceivable on the supposi
 tion of continuous as it is upon that of limited division.      Two
phenomena continuously proceeding without obvious end (ma
thematical " infinites ") are well known to be capable of a finite
ratio.     Through one point an infinite number of curves may be
 drawn.     The neutralization of aqueous hydric chloride is some
thing like the process of differentiation, and its result, a con
stant finite ratio, like a difi'erential coefficient.  Or take as an
illustration the properties of the machine known as the " geo
metric chuck." -By a suitable combination of circular move
 ments, this beautiful instrument is capable of describing an end
less variety of curves, one of which is roughly represented in the
margin : such a figure is drawn by a motion which is visibly
continuous,     even at the three points, throughout the entire
period of delineation ; when it has been described, the machine
proceeds to draw an exactly similar triangle, which it accurately
superimposes on the first, and so on, to any num
ber of triangles.     The number of points in the
figure is regulated by previous adjustment of the
constants of the machine ; but the mass of the
instrument, its rate of motion, and the number
of times it is resolved (beyond the. construction-
minimum) have nothing to do with the resulting figure.           The
definite proportions of chemistry, in like manner, precede or
accompany each of our experiments ; they are independent of
mass, rate of action, repetition of action ; and doubtless they
are produced, like these points, by compound uninterrupted
motion.      They certainly suggest nothing that is by nature
atomic.      These mathematical conceptions, however, involve no
breach of continuity, which is rather their essential condition ;
and the chemical phenomenon is at least as conceivable as they
are without introducing the supposition of a limit.
    I may adduce the process of diffusion as one that, in accord
ance with the large number of experiments already made, is pro
bably capable of continuance without any clear reason for a limit.
Yet if matter consisted of indivisibles, some sign, at any rate, of

 hence all the parts in quantity must be indivisible.           But this
 assertion is encountered by the following dilemma. If indivisibles
 make quantity, either a finite or infinite number of them must
 do so.   If  a finite number, select as an instance three indivisi
 bles, add them together, and make a line (whose extent being
 only longitude is the first and simplest species of quantity, and
 therefore whatever is susceptible of partition must be at least a
 line).   Now, by the conditions, this line cannot be divided into
 more parts than three ; yet Euclid (Elements, VI. Prop. 10)
 has demonstrated that a line can be divided into any number of
 parts, however great.     Therefore it is evident that no line, still
less any more complex species of quantity, consists of indivisibles.
    Now, Euclid's demonstration being universal, and proving
that all extension can be divided infinitely into parts, we must
needs confess that it is of the nature of indivisibles, when they
coalesce, to be drowned in one another ; for otherwise there
would result a kind of extension out of them that would be in
divisible, contrary to the demonstration          referred to.    But if
these indivisibles (even if infinitely numerous) are drowned in
one another, they shrink to a single indivisible point.          On the
other hand, the nature of extension requires that one part be
not in the same place where the other is. Therefore quantity
cannot consist of an infinite number of indivisibles ; and it has
been shown that it is not constituted of a finite number.           The
dilemma terminates; and it is proved that quantity does not
consist of indivisibles (either finite or infinite in number), and,
consequently,    that parts are not actually in it.
    With this answer to    a molecular or atomic theorist, it might
have been supposed that our acute and critical reasoner would
have been content to relinquish the argument.           Yet he lingers a
little about it to discuss a difficulty, apparently raised by Sense: —
Are there not parts in a man's body — for example, arms, legs,
fingers, and toes ? Digby points out that sense does not judge
which is an arm, leg, finger, or toe, but that the notions corre
sponding to these words are products of the understanding,
which, among several functions of a substance, is capable of
selecting one, as if the substance had no more.          We are, there •
fore, really dealing with a fallacy of confusion.         Quantity is a
possibility to be made distinct things by division ; whereas the
different limbs above named "are but a virtue to do distinct
things."     Even if this were not so, sense cannot determine any
one part   in a body ; for if it could, it would tell precisely where
that part begins and ends.         If the part begin or end in indivi
sibles, certainly sense cannot determine of them.         On the other
hand, considering that all whereof sense is capable is divisible,
it continually reminds us of more potential parts than one.

Hence         it knows           with   exactitude     neither   the   One nor   the
Many.
   The special form of fallacy that underlies the atomic theory is
the one known as the materialistic.       Just as those who as
sert the existence of matter declare or imply their belief in it as
 a necessary substratum for hardness, weight, and other proper
 ties, which are really their own sensations ; so those who advo
 cate the atomic theory, declare or imply their belief in indivi
 sibles, in units of affinity, and so forth, as substrata.    On close
examination it is found that the substratum referred to has its
necessity only in the imagination ; and the atomic theory, which
 has seldom even pretended to adduce experimental evidence for
 what it affirms to exist, is traceable to the same parentage.     The
same impatience at the recondite nature of forces which we
cannot see, which has led many of us to assert so much more
than we know, has caused both civilized and savage nations to
clothe in statuary their invisible gods.        The same impatience,
mingled    with  discontent,   is recognizable  in that passionate cra
ving for the absolute, or complementary in existence, which is
common to mankind.          Surrounded on all sides with continuity,
motion, and change, our most popular ideas relate to limits, re
pose, and stability.     With the latter, the atomic theory perfectly
accords ; it readily blends with all the prejudices of our educa
tion, and is reinforced by them ; so that after some years it
becomes an essential part of the mind, which has no longer the
 power to reject      even with the aid of the desire.

 would be      matter of the highest importance, one would ima
                  a
 gine, especially on the part of experimental advocates, to adduce,
 or at any rate to endeavour to adduce, an atom itself as the best
 proof of its own existence.       Not only has this never been done.
 but no attempts have been made to do it; and                  probableit   is
 that the most enthusiastic atomisl would be the first to -smile at
 such an effort, or ridicule the supposed discovery.       For who has
 ever seen that which    he  cannot divide or who, being unable to

The experience of two thousand years has failed to produce or to
discover     single atom of the innumerable millions that have
              a
existed during the whole of that time, and still remain unhurt
in their modest retirement.        Yet, in the present day, they are

  124               Dr. E.        J.    Mills   on the   Atomic Theory.
    spoken of as familiarly as if they were fossils.       The ingenuous
    confession of Gregory is difficult to reconcile with his practice,
    but it doubtless expresses the feeling of many atomists : " we may
    admit the atomic theory.        It is to be observed, however, that
    we have no positive proof of its truth, nor are we likely to obtain
   such proof."      Of what use is it to serve a writ of habeas corpus
    upon such a theory ?
      At this point my mind naturally recurs to a period in the
   history of chemistry when the science was in one particular re
   spect under as anomalous a regime as prevails at present.         From
   about the year 1700 the belief in phlogiston             prevailed for
   three quarters of a century, and was as intimately associated
   with experimental inquiries as the atom is now ; and this belief,
   as any one who has read a fragment of the literature of that
   epoch must have observed, was as real and living as can be con
   ceived.    Yet, in 1764, Macquer* confesses, "Hitherto chy-
   mists have never been able to obtain the phlogiston quite pure
   and free from every other substance;" and Bishop Watson, in
   1800 (1781       ?),with      somewhat ruffled dignity, exclaimsf,
                                  a
   " You do    not surely expect that chemistry should be able to pre
   sent you with    a handful of phlogiston separated from an inflam
   mable body   1
                   "   In course of time the nature of phlogiston
   varied as much as the atomic weight of any modern element.
It    began with being materia vel principium ignis, non ipse ignis,
   and ended with        narrow escape from identification with hydro
                          a
   gen. It    was as material as Lavoisier's caloric.       Yet chemists
   argued universally, and apparently                    by
                                                preference, without any
   quest of the substance itself.     How the native freedom of an ex
  perimental science could coexist in the same person with so
  marvellous an abrogation of that freedom was long             puzzling           a
  phenomenon to me.          The phlogistian, however,        much sur       is
  passed by    the atomist.     The former never ascribed to his veiled
  companion an attribute without natural analogy           but the latter;
  teaches Tertullian's paradox, Cerium est, quid impossibile.

 systematic works, and it is the object of the majority of chemical
researches to develope formulae in connexion with them.               Our
 modern theorist " explains " the existence of the two bromides
  (C3 H5 Br, C3 H5 Br3) on the principle of atomicity ; while the
 latter of their two analogues (I Cl, I Cl3) is a " molecular com
 bination."      This is certainly the most pitiful evasion that ever
 passed    under   the name of theory.        Again, the hypothesis of
 specific volumes, which represents a natural fact, is now in a
 languishing state because we cannot determine how many atoms
 and how much space make up a given volume of a substance.
     It is not difficult to show that the doctrine of atoms involves
 several important contradictions, in addition to those previously
alluded to in this tract.        The theory of compound radicals shows
conclusively, in its own way, that whatever compound radicals
 may do, is also done or imitated by absolutely homogeneous
atoms ; their functions are, in short, the same.            Hence by the
 strict necessity of an inductive logic, as well as by the freedom
of our nature, we are driven to deny that the atoms are atoms
at all.     For if the benzoyl atom (C7 H5 0) and chlorine atom
 (Cl)   agree  in so many of their functions, the probability is that
they will agree somewhat in another, namely, complexity.              The
atomic theorist, however, is too anxious to save himself to allow
this conclusion.       Reversing history, he takes the chlorine atom
first, compares the benzoyl atom with               and asserts that the
                                                     it,
radical is
        a       compound atom.        To have asserted that the atom                  is
a compound radical, would merely have been to narrate the
course of   a    probable discovery     ;  to pronounce the radical                   a
compound      atom is   to  statea   pure contradiction, which         theis,   by
laws of language, completely unintelligible.
     These are the parts of     a   system which has been termed, in
modern times, an exact science             !   It consoling to remember
                                                    is
that the most fanciful period of the phlogistic theory immedi
ately preceded the epoch when that theory was extinguished —
when chemists, free for the moment from the fetters of                                a
doctrine which called every operation             combustion, perceived
                                                    a
the whole of nature to be open to their inquiries.                   Such
a   reform and such     a  liberation are needed, and may be hoped
for now.

noticed the opinions of some of the more gifted thinkers with
regard to the atomic theory.           Newton, for example,      often re

ferred to as an authority on the side of the atomist.          That phi

                                                          " God, in the
beginning, formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable,
moveable particles " which never wear or break to pieces, " no
ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made One

 in the first creation"*.    He also followed Lucretius in asserting
 that nature would not be lasting were the properties of these
 particles other than he supposes them to be.       It will be observed
 that Newton allows^ of indivisibility only so far as ordinary or
 natural forces are concerned.     Elsewhere, in a passage too often
 overlooked, he limits the indivisibility to his own time.        " But
 whether these parts, distinct and as yet undivided by natural
 forces, are able to be divided and sundered in their turn is un
 certain "f. And again, he allows that " space is divisible in in-
finitum"\. It appears, then, that Newton had hardly reached
 so great a degree of decision upon this subject as is commonly
 believed.
    Descartes has also been reckoned among the atomists, pro
bably more from the circumstance that he was a strong systema-
tizer and formalist than on the basis of any of his extant works.
That Descartes himself would not have approved of such an im
 putation is clear from the following (translated) passage § : — "It
 is also very easy to recognize that there can be in it
                                                                "
                                                                  (sub
           " no atoms, that is to say, parts of bodies or matter

 which are by nature indivisible, as some philosophers have ima
 gined ; inasmuch as, however small we may suppose these parts
 to be, yet, since they must be extended, we see there is not one
of them that cannot be further divided into two or more others
of smaller size, and hence is divisible."        He then goes on to
argue that it would be impossible,       at  any rate, to restrict the
power of the Deity in division; and adds that it is of the nature
 of even the smallest extended particle in the world to be divisible.
    Leibnitz, moreover, has left on record not a few decided
 expressions of opinion with regard to this subject.           Thus he
 asserts || that   "a  material  being   could  not   be  at  the same
 time material and perfectly indivisible or endowed with real
 unity" (p. 580). " Material atoms are contrary to reason, be
 sides being still composed of parts; for the invincible attach
ment of one part to another         we could reasonably conceive or
                                         (if
suppose such thing)a      would not destroy their diversity" (p. 584).
" Limits are viciously assigned to division and subtleness            as
well as to the richness and beauty of nature, when atoms and                     a
void, or certain prime elements, including the Cartesian, are set
up in the place of true units, when the infinite        not recognized

open at first sight to suspicion, from the fact that they do not
recognize the clearest mathematical proofs as propositions rela
ting to the constitution of space, in so far as it is really the
formal condition of the possibility of all matter, but regard them
merely as inferences from abstract but arbitrary conceptions
which cannot have any application to real things.                Just as if it
were possible to imagine another mode of intuition than that
given in the primitive intuition of space ; and just as if its a priori
determinations did not apply to every thing, the existence of which
 is possible from the fact alone of its filling space.            If we listen
to them, we shall find ourselves required to cogitate, in addition
 to the mathematical point, which is simple, — not, however, a
 part, but a mere limit of space — physical points, which are indeed
 likewise simple, but possess the peculiar property, as parts of
 space, of filling it by their aggregation.          I shall not repeat here
 the common and clear refutations of this absurdity which are to
 be found everywhere in Cumbers ; every one knows that it is
 impossible to undermine the evidence of mathematics by mere
 discursive conceptions        ....  It is not sufficient to find the con
 ception of the simple for the pure conception of the composite,
 but we must discover for the intuition of the composite (matter)
 the intuition of the simple.         Now this, according to the laws of
 sensibility,   and    consequently in the case of objects of sense, is
 utterly impossible."
     Davy and Wollaston both refused to accept the atomic theory.
 Coming still nearer to our own time, I mention, in the last place,
 a great investigator who has but recently departed from among
 us.    No one could be more acute, and certainly none more clear,
 than Faraday in the kind of reasoning that precedes discovery.
 This eminently successful acuteness and clearness were not,
 however, acquired by the aid of graphic formulae or wooden
  models, nor were they accompanied by the doubtful support of
 any such material assistance.          As the air grew thinner, his wing
  was broadened and its thrust more strong.              In 1844, Faraday
  published   f  a 'Speculation touching Electric Conduction and the
  Nature of Matter/ in which the principal subject of discussion
  is the atomic theory.          Starting with the datum, admitted by
  atomists, that matter consists of atoms and space, he observes
  that this is " at best an assumption ; of the truth of which we
  can assert nothing, whatever we may say or think of its proba-

Now, of the two constituents of matter, space                     the onlyis

be composed of atoms and space. Since platinum                   conductor,
                                                                         is

space, being its only continuous constituent, must be            conductor.
                                                                          a a

and   a  non-conductor.      "Any ground of reasoning which tends
to such conclusions as these must in itself be false."             The facts
do not    warrant   any   other   conclusion    than   that  what we call
 matter   is  continuous.    Indeed "a mind just entering on the
subject may consider     it  difficult to think of the powers of matter
independent of separate something to be called the matter; but
                 a
it   iscertainly far more difficult, and indeed impossible, to think
 of or imagine that matter independent of the powers.               Now the
powers we know and recognize in every phenomenon of the crea
tion, the abstract matter in none; why then assume the exist
ence of that of which we are ignorant, which we cannot conceive,
and for which there      is no philosophical necessity ?"
    If we must assume at all, let us assume as little as possible.
The system of Boscovich             isin these respects superior to the
 atomic;  it   assumes much less, and does not contradict the facts
 of nature.     In Matter and the atom disappear; and we find
                  it
 that substances are constituted of centres of force, attractive and
 repulsive.     For the shape of the atom, the direction and relative
 intensity of these individual forces are substituted.
                                                                 " Matter                      is

            M. Dumas      on the Constitution  of Milk and Blood.        129
     Here Faraday proclaims himself at once a Leibnitzian and
 idealist. No answer, so far as I am aware, has ever been made to
 his argument; nor did he, in the exuberant development of
 atomic suggestions which surrounded his later years, publish any
 retractation of his previous opinion.         Therefore, that matter is
force, in some way determined, was probably that great thinker's
 final belief.
     Such being the condition of the atomic theory, whether re
 garded in its chemical or philosophical aspect, certain practical
 results follow.      I shall not take into consideration the physical
 molecules, which are
                            " invested with an arbitrary system of cen
 tral forces invented expressly to account for the observed pheno
 mena," and are hard — nor the new alternative of ring-vortices,
 which are not hard*.           A logical mind, still free to make an
 effort, cannot be content to accept that theory without question,
 or to entertain it without suspicion.           And on inquiry it will
 find, if my argument be sound, that the atomic theory has no
 experimental basis, is untrue to nature generally, and consists
 in the main of a materialistic fallacy, derived from appetite more
 than from judgment; while, on the other side, arises the IDEA
op MOTION, with its subordinate laws, true both to nature and
 the life of man, the highest product of the scientific and the
pure reason, and the noblest generalization the world has yet
known, because it is the only one that neither limits nor enslaves.

ciatc at a glance the importance of the questions which were
addressed to them, the insufficiency of the means at their
command during those troublous times, and the merits of the
practical solutions which they presented to the country, as the
fruit of their previous studies, or of their improvised experi
ments.
   Saltpetre, gunpowder, steel, weapons, gun-metal, potash,
soda, soaps, paper, assignats, and many other objects impli
cated in the defence of the country, the working of its manu
factures and the necessaries of life, gave occasion to investi
gations and discoveries of which the factories have not yet
forgotten the tradition.
   The siege of Paris by the Prussian army could not, it was
said, be sufficiently prolonged to raise any questions of the
same kind ; but nevertheless it has been necessary, as in the
time of our fathers, to seek for nitrated earths, to produce
gunpowder, to manufacture and work up steel, to obtain
bronze and cast cannon ; we also have been in want of paper,
and of a great number of useful objects.
   Considerable, although rapid, investigations have been
accomplished ; and it will be useful as well as just not to allow
their memory to be lost.      I  have busied myself in collecting
the materials for this publication, which       I  shall carry out as
soon as  circumstances   will permit.
   Among the privations which our forefathers did not know
in their most cruel intensity, those which caused the most
decided sufferings to the existing population, relate to the
want of combustibles, which was rendered, intolerable and most
 destructive by an exceptionally rigorous winter — to the scar
city of milk and eggs, the certain cause of the premature
 decease of a great number of young children — and, finally, to
the exhaustion of the supplies of com, flour, and meat, which,
rendering the capitulation of Paris inevitable, marked the
precise day for it.
   Three questions, which have occupied the mind of every
man curious to foresee the future of science, were thus inces
santly presented to the meditation of the scientific men shut
up in Paris, not as far-away dreams in which the imagination
delights and disports itself, but as the despairing prayers of a
people in utter extremity : —
   1. To obtain available heat, without combustibles ;
   2. To reconstruct food with mineral materials, without the
        cooperation of life ;
   3.  To  reproduce,  at least,  the essential   food  of man with
        non-alimentary organic materials.
Man, in warming himself by means of combustibles furnished

          M. Dumas    on the Constitution  of Milk and Blood,    131
 either by the existing vegetation, or by the remains of the
 ancient vegetation of the globe, and in nourishing himself by
 means of products obtained from plants and animals, demands
 every thing from life ; but could he dispense with life in
 obtaining his combustible and his nutriment?            Would the
 forces of science alone suffice to assure to him, in this urgent
 need, those satisfactions which he could no longer demand
 from the forces of living nature ?
    This was the question.      If  put in a time of peace and in
 the midst of abundance, it would probably have received more
 than one response in the affirmative.         The progress of the
 physical sciences has been so brilliant !         One is so much
 disposed   to  exaggerate   their  power  !  Electricity  opens up
 such seductive perspectives !        Synthesis has produced so
 many marvels in the hands of chemists !
    If the necessity had not been so pressing, so that the ques
tion might have been raised as a philosophical thesis, and we
could have said to the physicists and chemists, Could you not,
if it were necessary, furnish man with heat and food without
having recourse to plants and animals? how many, without
saying yes, would, at least, have answered with one of those
smiles which do not say no.
    But in a crisis where it was necessary to realize immediately
 what would have been left to hope, people showed reserve ;
radical solutions were adjourned, and there was no question
either of heating Paris without combustibles, or of feeding it
 without organic aliments.
    But could organi* materials usually disdained be converted
into aliments, so as to replace, by means of clever combinations,
those natural products which could no longer be procured ?
    It is not my design to notice what viands were served at
table, or what resources we were led to seek in the blood and
offal of the slaughter-houses which are usually thrown away,
the bones, feet, and even the skins of the cattle slaughtered.
Nor will     I examine how the butter and lard, which were
speedily exhausted, were replaced.        Of these improvised arts
some have disappeared with the circumstances which gave
them birth, whilst others have left some useful teachings.
    I shall treat only of a special question, the solution oi which
involved certain principles which it seems to me to be impor
tant to guard. Was it not possible to come to the assistance
of new-born children by replacing the milk, which could no
longer be got, by some saccharine emulsion ? In this case
there was no question of creative chemistry, but only of culi
nary chemistry. Recipes were not wanting, all reproducing
an albuminous liquid, sugar, and an emulsion of a fatty body.

132       M. Dumas   on the Constitution   of Milk and Blood.
   As a provisional succedaneum this artificial milk deserved to
be welcomed.     But sometimes there was such a conviction in
the authors of these propositions, that one was forced to dread
for the future the effects of their faith. This was of a nature
to make too many proselytes, to the great injury of the chil
dren at nurse, and the great profit of the dealers in milk.
How could the latter have the least scruple when they were
taught to manufacture an emulsion which they saw recom
mended to the consumers, and even to mothers, as the real
equivalent of milk   ?
   The services rendered by concentrated milk during the siege
were too important to render any excuse necessary in the
country which produces         when we insist upon the prefer
                             it,
ence always due to natural milk, as also upon the characters
which at present do not permit us to confound any artificial
milky liquid whatever with the truly secreted product.
   Natural milk forms    aliquid containing salts, sugar, caseum
in solution, and fatty globules in suspension.    Let us first see
whether we    can imitate   these fatty globules by dividing or
making an emulsion of an oily or fatty matter in          viscous
                                                           a
liquid.
 I    believe that I     experimentally demonstrated the contrary
 some years ago by showing that the globules of fatty matter
 of milk are protected from certain physical or chemical reac
 tions by      true membranous envelope.
               a                               Admitted by some,
 and disputed by others, the existence of this membrane seem
 ing to me to be real and proven, there could be no question,
in my opinion, about confounding an artificial emulsion with
naked fatty globules with milk from the mammae, present
ing fatty globules enveloped by     a  membrane, true free celle,
filled with butter, analogous to the agglutinated cells of adi
pose tissues.
    The existence of this membrane may be proved by two
chemical experiments.
    The first depends upon the property possessed by sulphuric
ether of dissolving fatty matters and collecting together those
which are suspended in liquids, provided that they are free.
Now   if, after shaking together in a tube fresh milk and ether,
they are left to rest, the ether floats on the surface without
having dissolved any thing, and the milk resumes its place
below the ether without having lost any thing of its appear
ance, or yielded any of its buttery matter.
    But when subjected beforehand to the action of acetic acid,
which     isable to dissolve the envelopes of its fatty globules,
milk,  when    shaken up with ether, loses its opacity, and yields
its butter  to  that liquid, in whichit may be found.

         M. Dumas       on the Constitution   of Milk and Blood.        133
   An    inverse test leads to the same conclusions.        A neutral
salt,  such   as  sulphate  of  soda, added   to  milk, enables  us to
filter  it, and to retain upon the filter the globules of butter,
whilst the serosity flows off perfectly limpid and clear.          If
                                                                   the
washings with saline water be continued, these globules may
be freed from all the soluble products of the serum.           Now       if
the butter consisted of simple fatty globules, there would then
remain with them no trace of albuminous or caseous matter.
But whatever care may be taken to prolong the washings, we
always find with the fatty matter such           aproportion of albu
minized substance that there can be no doubt that                  lias
                                                                   it
remained there in the form of those envelopes or cells which
constitute the globules of butter.
    The microscope, moreover, shows plainly the constitution
of the globules of butter, and. reveals the constant presence of
the envelopes.       It  issufficient to crush the globules of milk
by means of the compressor, to obtain          a conviction that? after
the spreading of the fatty matter, the butter-cell still retains its
form and outline, thus showing that the contents and the con
tainer have each their distinct existence.
    For these reasons, and for many others (for no conscientious
chemist can assert that the analysis of milk lias made known
all the products necessary to life which that aliment contains),
we must renounce, for the present, the pretension to make
milk, and especially abstain from assimilating any emulsions
to this product.
    Besides we cannot have too much reserve where we have to
pronounce upon the identity of two products, one natural, the
other artificial,  if they are not crystallizable or volatile — that     is
to say, definite.      We can never affirm that we have repro
duced   a    mineral water, or sea-water for example.           When
manure for plants, or aliments for man and animals are in
question,     isnot the same reserve still more imperative         ?
    These indefinite natural mixtures contain substances which
the coarsest analysis discovers, with others less strongly cha
racterized or less abundant, which are only revealed by deli
cate chemistry, and others again, and perhaps the most essen
tial, which still escape us, either because they exist in infi
nitesimal proportions, or because they belong to the category
of bodies which have not hitherto been distinguished from
other chemical species.
  It   is  therefore always prudent to abstain from pronouncing
upon the identity of these indefinite mixtures employed in the
sustenance of life, in which the smallest and most insignificant
traces of matters may prove to be not only efficacious, but
even indispensable.         In proportion as science extends her

domain, we are sure to see the demonstrations of the appropri
ateness of this reserve multiplied.
    Among the fine investigations executed in France by those
who have continued the labours which occupied the life of the
illustrious Theodore de Saussure, the important thesis of M.
Raulin upon the vegetation of Asperqillus niger will always
be placed in the foremost rank.        All the conditions of the
life of this Mucedinean have been so well determined by that
author that it may be cultivated with precision in a soil
formed of definite chemical species, as if we had to do with
the formation of a compound ; and the soil once sown, we may
follow the transformation or the employment of each of the
elements necessary to its life, just as if we had to do with the
development of an ordinary chemical equation.
    Now, who could have foreseen that the Aspergillus niger,
which has just made its appearance? for example, upon a slice
of lemon exposed to the air, required for the fulness of its
existence traces of oxide of zincc       How. after this, can we
doubt,   in the case of plants of a higher order and especially of
animals, that, besides their coarsely appreciable aliments, they
require also traces of many other aliments, more delicately
used but not less necessary?
    Milk has often been compared to eggs, both from a che
mical and a physiological point of view. Their mission is
equally to furnish the young animal with the nourishment of
its earliest age ; and they have as a common character that
they present in union a fatty matter, an albuminoid substance,
a saccharine or amylaceous matter, and salts.
    But the egg possesses a vitality, an organization, of which
chemistry furnishes no evidence, and which the most minute
anatomy would be powerless to reveal.             If
                                                  fecundation had
not rendered manifest, by the rapid phenomena of segmenta
tion which take place in        that the mass of the yelk of an
                               it,
egg   is  endowed with life, and that     obeys the impulsion of
                                            it
the living germ which takes possession of            we should still
                                                    it,
be ignorant that the yelk of the egg       not
                                             is  mere emulsion of
                                                  a
inert fatty matter.
    Is not milk in the same case?         One      led to think so
                                                  is

for its part, proves to be singularly ready to receive and
nourish germs of more than one kind, which, on reaching                it,
become developed and live at its expense.
  The power of synthesis of organic chemistry in particular,
and that of chemistry in general, have therefore their limits.

         M. Dumas    on the Constitution of Milk and Blood.      135
The siege of Paris will have proved that we have no pretension
to make bread or meat from their elements, and that we must
still leave to nurses the mission of producing milk.        If some
illusions upon this point have found their way into the minds
of persons ill-informed as to the true state of science, they are
due to the dangerous play of words to which the expressions
organic chemistry and organic substances lend themselves,
when applied as these are indifferently to definite compounds
such as alcohol or citric acid, which are unfitted for life, and to
indefinite tissues, the seat or life.
    The former (foreign to life, and true chemical species) are
the only ones that synthesis has reproduced.           The latter,
which can be formed only under the impulse of a living germ,
and which receive, preserve, and transfer the forces of life, are
not definite species ; the synthesis of the laboratories does not
reach them.      The only synthesis which has hitherto been
observed in the case of the chemical materials which consti
tute living tissues, is that determined in brute matter by the
presence and impulse of the living germ itself.
    All those chemical syntheses, otherwise so worthy of inter
est, which have been indicated as reproducing organic matters,
have therefore in reality reproduced only matters unfitted for
life — that is to say, mineral matters.     Thus, of every living
matter or matter that has lived, we must still, whether we
speak as chemists or as physiologists, say what was said of it
formerly : omne vivum ex ovo — that which is not life has
brought nothing to life.
    With' regard to the constitution of milk, the phenomena
presented by the clarifying of butter have been sometimes em
ployed either to demonstrate or to dispute the existence of the
membranes which envelope the butyrous globules ;           I cannot
at present regard these phenomena as having any value in thia
respect.
    It has been said, for example, that the separation of butter
was the result of the formation of lactic acid arising from the
action of the air, favoured by churning.        Numerous experi
 ments effected in my laboratory upon a practical scale, have
 shown that butter separates equally promptly, and at least
 equally abundantly, from a milk to which a large amount of
 bicarbonate of soda has been added, as from natural milk.
 The alkaline reaction of the former, which is maintained
 during the operation and after its completion, has no influence
 either upon its duration or its result.        The proportion of
 butter, far from being diminished, seems even to nave been
increased by it.
    The formation of lactic acid is therefore not necessary for

136        M. Dumas    on the Constitution  of Milk and Blood.
the separation of butter, which appears to me to be due to
purely mechanical causes. Such, at least, is the feeling that
one experiences on examining by the microscope milk sub
mitted to churning whilst the operation is going on.               The
first test-drops present nothing peculiar ;           the  globules of
butter retain their form, dimensions, and aspect.              Soon we
see appear irregular butyrous islands in the midst of globules
remaining unaltered.           These islands of butter increase in
number and extent in proportion as the operation proceeds.
They form a snow-ball, uniting with each other and becoming
agglomerated so as to constitute, at last, the mass of butter
which is the object of the operation.
    The agglomeration of the butyrous globules into a block of
butter would be a true regelation if there were no membrane
surrounding them. The existence of this compels us to admit
that it must be broken, and that this is the object of the repeated
shocks which we make the liquid undergo, in order that the
diffused butter may unite with the fatty parcels and agglome
rations which it meets with on its road.
    If  it is true that the separation of butter is a purely mecha
nical phenomenon, it is not the less so, as           I  shall hereafter
show,     because   chemistry    can give  rules to render  this opera
tion more rapid and more efficacious, and to produce from it a
 better clarified and less alterable butter.
    I  conclude this communication with some details upon phe
nomena of another nature, towards which the hygienic situa
tion of the inhabitants of besieged Paris turned one's thoughts
only too naturally.         What took place in the tissues of this
population deprived        of fresh vegetables, fruits, milk, fish, and
 fresh meat ?      What    changes did the blood undergo under the
influence of this diet? and how must they manifest them
selves ?
    Some years ago       I  had prepared some experiments the ob
ject  of  which   was  to  ascertain whether exchanges by exosmose
 and endosmose take place between the internal liquids con
 tained in the globules of the blood and the liquids of the
 serum.      If these exchanges were easy and rapid, their exist
 ence might be ascertained.          To demonstrate them would be
 to ascertain by what means the constitution of the globules of
 the blood may be altered and vitiated, reestablished, or re
 generated.
    I  never completed these experiments ; but         I have often de
 pended upon the views which guided me, in order to make my
 auditors in my courses at the faculty of medicine understand
 how certain alterations of the blood might be interpreted.
    It is necessary, perhaps, to explain what stopped me.

          M. Dumas   on the Constitution  of Mills and Blood.   137
    Nothing is easier than to compare the serum and globules
of a normal blood with the serum and globules of the same
blood modified by the intervention of a substance capable of
changing the direction or the intensity of the powers of en-
dosmose between the globules and the serum.
    In the blood of a living animal the globules suspended in
the liquid may absorb or lose some ot their elements, if we
succeed in changing the constitution of the serum ; but how
long will the phenomenon last?          If   the substance added be
mischievous it will be eliminated ; the veins on their part will
absorb liquids destined to reestablish the equilibrium, and the
experiment will soon be so altered that the little differences
that we have to measure will disappear, vanishing before great
complications.
    On the contrary, if we withdraw the blood from the body of
the animal and divide it into two parts of equal weight, one
destined to furnish the term of comparison, and the other to
receive the substances modificative of the power of endosmose,
coagulation and what       I have called the asphyxia and death
of the globules will soon do away with any hope of arriving at
 certain results.
    It was therefore necessary to receive the blood into a vessel,
 to oppose its coagulation, and to replace towards it the action
 both of the heart and lungs — that is to say, to keep the blood
 in movement and to present it in a very divided state to the
 action of oxygen or of the air.           I   arranged an apparatus
 which fulfilled these conditions, and allowed one to ascertain
 how alcohol, neutral salts of soda or potash, sugar, &c. act
 when added to the serum, and how the interior liquids con
 tained in the globules may become modified under their influ
 ence either in quantity or in nature.

 invasion of scurvy in the general state of health of the inhabi

 to make up by applicable means for the absence of all fresh vege
 tables and of all fruit in their habitual diet, a foreign doctor.
  Dr.  J.  Sinclair, by following out the ideas which he had
  heard me teach upon this subject, was led to seek in them the
  explanation of the first symptoms of alcoholism, a state which
  he designates by the name of dypsomania.
     Just as scurvy would have as its primary cause an im
  poverishment of the serum in potash-salts and a surcharge of
  salts of soda (which favours the exosmose of the potash of the
  globules and consequently their destruction), so alcoholism
  would have as its starting-point the presence of alcohol in the
  serum of the blood and its effects on the globules.

138        Canon Moseley on the Mechanical Impossibility              of
   Alcohol added to the scrum causes a movement of exosmose
from the interior of the globules to the serum.          The globules
lose a part of their constituent liquids ; and this alteration,
which brings on others, is no doubt reproduced in the cells of
the various tissues which are bathed by alcoholized liquids.
   What it is now my intention to prove              that in the blood
                                                          is,

alter, even slightly, the chemical composition of the exterior
liquid to cause that of the interior liquid to become modified
by endosmose or exosmose.

done me the honour to reply to them.        I am desirous to acknow
ledge the courtesy with which the controversy has been conducted
by my opponents.       Mr. Croll has done me the justice, think, to  I
follow out the mathematical reasoning on which my argument is
based ; and          I
                will not complain if Mr. Ball has not. Mr. Croll
accepts that  one of my two conclusions which is the subject of my
present paper.    He concedes that " if the ice of a glacier be in the
hard, solid, crystalline state in which it is generally admitted to
be, and its particles shear in that state as they are assumed to do,
then glaciers cannot possibly descend by their weight only, as
is generally supposed, and the generally received theory of gla
cier-motion must be abandoned"*.          Mr. Matthews, Mr. Ball,
and M. Heim dissent from this conclusion.                I
                                                   propose to answer
 their objections to it in this paper, and in a subsequent, one
those they have made specially to my own theory of the descent
of glaciers.
   The impossibility       of the descent of glaciers by their weight
only,  results   from   the   consideration that, besides the motion of
the translation of a glacier bodily on its bed, there is a constant
displacement of its particles over one another and alongside
one another; for which displacement the work of a far more
powerful force is necessary than the weight of the glacier would
supply, it being subject (by the principles of mechanical philo
sophy) to the condition that the aggregate work of the forces
which cause it must not be less than that of the resistances which
are opposed to it.
   It of course, impossible to represent this inequality mathe
          is,
matically in respect to         glacier having
                                a                  a variable direction and
an irregular channel and slope but in respect to an imaginary

                         I                   numerically in respect to

glacier of       uniform rectangular section, slope, direction, and
                     a
roughness, descending with the same velocity as the
                                                                   " Mer de

       "  does, and      Ihave found that the work done        bythe weight
of the glacier in such descent through any distance                     only
                                                                         is
about yjth of the work necessary to overcome the resistances
opposed to its descent through that distance.
   The weight of this imaginary glacier would therefore be far
too small      force to cause
                 a                  to descend as glaciers do descend.

   The imaginary case to which my computation applies differs
from the case of the actual glacier in this respect, that the actual
glacier     not straight or of uniform section and slope, and its
            is                       a
channel      not of uniform roughness.

140     Canon Moseley on the Mechanical Impossibility            of
the case, since in the imaginary glacier the weight is found to
be insufficient to cause it to descend, much more must it be so
in the actual glacier. This is my argument ; and if it cannot be
overthrown, it follows from it that no theory is to be received
which accounts for the descent of glaciers by their weight only.
The data I have used in my computation are Professor Tyndall's
observations on the velocity of the surface-ice of the Mer de
Glace at Les Fonts, and those on the velocity of the side-ice on
the Glacier du Geant near the Tacul. These last observations
were made under circumstances of great difficulty and some
danger*. No conceivable error in the data can, however, ac
count for the enormous disproportion which is shown to exist
between the work of the force of gravity which is supposed to
cause the glacier to descend and that of the resistances it has to
overcome.      Among these resistances I have reckoned those of
the sides and bottom of the channel to be as great as though the
ice were frozen to them ; and considering what are the obstacles
in the actual channel from projecting rocks, bends in its direction,
 and frequent contractions, the assumption of a resistance at least
 equal to that which would result in the imaginary form of gla
 cier from the ice being frozen to its bottom and sides, is not
 perhaps unreasonable.        My result is not, however, practically
 affected by throwing the resistance of the channel wholly out of
 the question.      If its bottom and sides be conceived perfectly
 smooth, and if the ice of the glacier be supposed not to adhere
 to them at all, its differential motion remaining nevertheless un
 altered, it still followsf that the work of the resistances through
 any distance of the descent is forty-seven times as great as the
 work of the weight of the glacier through that distance will supply.
     The differential motion   is, in point of fact,    byfar the greater
 part of the motion      of the glacier —  thirteen fourteenths of     on
                                                                      it

 resistance to the differential motion, measured         by
                                                          its work,   is   by
 far the greatest resistance.      Nor will any possible error in my
 assumed value of the unit of shear in ice affect the general result
 at which   I  have arrived.    My experiments on      itwere made in      a
 high temperature of the air.        I  have repeated them when       was
                                                                      it
 below freezing, and found     it  greatly increased.    As the tempe

we may conclude that the     unit of shear in glacier-ice is not less
than that given by my experiments, but greater than it.
    Mr. Ball objects to my assuming the resistance of glacier-ice
to be the same as that of the ice used in my experiments, which
was the ordinary ice of commerce collected on the surfaces of
rivers and lakes in Norway.      " Glacier-ice," he says, " however
slight the indications of it on the surface, is a congeries of sepa
rate fragments more or less perfectly welded together, and show
ing by the frequent presence of air-bubbles, and by its behaviour
when exposed to radiant heat, an inferior degree of solidity "*.
    But this is precisely the kind of ice with which some of my
experiments on shearing were made.          The ice was broken in
pieces and then hammered into the cylindrical hole of the shear-
ing-apparatusf, so as to be formed by regelation into a solid
cylinder.     It was then of the consistency of the glacier-ice de
scribed by Mr. Ball.      It was visibly " a congeries of separate
fragments more or less perfectly welded together."       The glacier-
grain of which M. Heim speaks was clearly seen in it.          Its re
sistance to shearing was nevertheless almost identically the same
as that of a cylinder of ice of the same diameter turned in a lathe
 out of a block of Norway river- or lake-ice J.    The adherence of
 the new surfaces brought into contact in the act of shearing was
 as perfect in this granular ice as in that cut from the block ;
 and there was the same perfect continuity of the substance of
 the ice§.
    As regards the influence of time on my determination of the
 unit of shear, I must have expressed myself imperfectly, for I
 have been misunderstood.      In saying that it " cannot be deter
 mined with absolute accuracy without taking into account the
 time of shearing"        meant that in the act of shearing

142     Canon Moseley on the Mechanical Impossibility           of
 ration, and therefore the time of shearing, would be dependent
on the form and dimensions of the section sheared and the unit
 of shearing.    The unit of shear in this case could only be deter
 mined by observing the time ; and     I  have given a formula for
 so determining it in the case of a prism having a rectangular
 section*. In a temperature above freezing, the prisms of ice ex     I
 perimented upon could not but have been in the act of melting,
 and the whole section of shearing in the act of diminishing by
 thus being melted ; time must therefore in this way have had
an influence on my determination of the unit of shear.          Heat,
too,   must  have  been  continually conducted to the ice through
the apparatus; and the process of shearing must have been ac
celerated by the excess of pressure sustained at the upper and
lower surfaces of the prism, and the lowering of the temperature
of congelation, and therefore the melting at those points conse
quent thereon.      The section of the ice-cylinder was therefore
                    I
probably less than have assumed it to be, and the unit of shear
greater.
    Mr. Ball says very truly that " in some substances the amount
of resistance opposed to the separation of adjoining particles is
nearly independent of temperature, and of the time during which
the pressure is applied.     In other bodies, which oppose a very
considerable resistance to fracture, the particles gradually change
their relative positions under the prolonged action of even a
slight pressure; and in some of them the change depends very
much on their temperature while exposed to pressure."          Apply
ing these remarks to my own determination of the unit of shear
in ice, I  beg to remind Mr. Ball that it was made on one of the
hottest days (August 24) of the year 1869, when the thermo
                                                            I
meter stood in the shade at 74°-75°, and that the ice used was
almost in a state of deliquescence.      No one who has inquired
into the temperature of glaciers has ever thought,      I  believe, of
assigning to it a temperature greater than this ice must have
had.
    Ice covered compactly with other ice, as it is in ice-houses,
does not melt as this did.     If the covering be perfect, as it is in
a glacier, it probably does not melt at all.     So far as the influ
ence of temperature is concerned, the unit of shear in glacier-
ice, however little below the surface, cannot, therefore, but be at
least equal to that of the ice in my experiments ; far down in
the interior of the glacier it is probably much greater.         I
                                                                have,
however, brought this question of the shearing of ice in a tempe

      A second piece of    ice, similar to the above,       was placed in the
 same apparatus at 6^ o'clock in the evening of the same day and
 loaded with 112^ Ibs., being at the rate of 63'6 Ibs. per square
 inch.     At 8 o'clock in the evening the upper surface of the cy
 linder of ice was found to have yielded ^ inch.                   It was then
 left thus loaded all night. At 10^ next morning it was examined
  again, and found not to have sheared at all during the night.
 The night had been frosty, but the frost had not been severe.
      The unit of shear being given, the equality of the work through
  a given distance of the resistances, to the work through the
  same distance of the forces which cause the glacier to descend,
  whatever they may be, is independent of the length of time.                If
  the  resistances   work slowly, the forces which overcome               them
  work also slowly and in the same ratio.              The conclusion I have
  drawn from this equality remains, therefore, unaffected by the
  question of time.
      Mr. Matthews, however, and M. Heim after him, as well as
  Mr. Ball, deny that glacier-ice shears at all. They say that it
  bends.     The following is Mr. Matthews's experiment as de
  scribed by himself : —
      " A plank of ice 6 inches wide and
                                                   2| inches in thickness was
  sawn from the frozen surface of a pond, and supported at each
  end by bearers exactly 6 feet apart.              The whole weight of the
  plank   between    the  bearers could not have exceeded 37| Ibs., and
   its cross section was nowhere less than 14 square inches.                Ac
   cording to the views of Canon Moseley, shearing must surely have
   been impossible.      Yet what was the result ? From the moment
   the plank was placed in position it began to sink, and continued
   to do so until it touched the surface over which it was sup

  144     Canon Moseley on the Meclianical Impossibility
 ported.    At the point of contact it appeared bent at a sharp
 angle, and was perfectly rigid in its altered form. The total de
 flection was 7 inches, which had been effected in about as many
 hours under the influence of a thaw under which the plank
 diminished very slightly in thickness                    With this pro
 perty of ice, viz. its power of changing its form under strains
 produced by its own gravitation, combined with the sliding move
 ment demonstrated by Hopkins, we have, as it seems to me,
 adequate causes of glacier-motion"*.
    " If," says M. Heim, after describing an experiment analo
 gous to those of Tyndall on the moulding of ice by pressure,          "if
 I rightly understand the experiments of Professor Tyndall and
 my own on the moulding of plates of ice, the ice therein and in
 the glacier is not compelled to shear."
    The idea present in common to the minds of these gentlemen
 seems to be that in bending so as to take a set, ice does Hot
 shear.             I
          In this venture to think there is a misapprehension.
 In the bending of a plate of ice every particle, except those at
 the points of support, is made to move in the direction in which
 the plate is bent — those particles which are at the point of
greatest inflection being made to move furthest, and those nearer
 to it being always made to move further than those more re
 mote ; so that every particle moves over that which is alongside
 towards the nearest point of support ; and being assumed to
 have taken a set, it must have sheared over it.        If the resistance
 to this shearing had been the only one to be overcome, then the
 aggregate work of the shearing of all the particles of the plate
 in the act of bending would have been exactly equal to the work
of the pressure which bent it ; and in the case of a glacier, it
would have been necessary to make (on these gentlemen's theory,
that it descends by bending) the same calculation that             I have
made by equating the work of the resistances of its particles to
shearing to that of the forces which cause it to shear ; from
which there would have followed precisely the result at which
I  haye arrived.     But the resistances to bending are resistances to
shearing plus other resistances at right angles to these.              If,
therefore, the weight of a glacier is insufficient alone to over
come the resistances to shearing, a fortiori
                                                  " it is insufficient to
overcome the resistances to bending.
    The pressure theory supposes, however, not exactly that the
ice is bent as in Mr. Matthews' s experiment, but that it is first
crushed or granulated by an exceedingly slow and imperceptible
process of molecular crushing and granulation, and then that,
being compressed, it is regelated.          In the act of being thus
moulded it shears, for the reasons above stated, and is dislocated

 was in the case of the ice-plank.                To make his experiment
 apply to the case of the glacier, Mr. Matthews should have
placed his plank on the two bearers, not flatwise, but edgewise.
 Indeed, looking at the proportion of the length to the width of
a  glacier, and considering that             in the direction of its length
                                                it
                                                is
that the bend must take place                       if
                                                descends it     bending, the  by
plank ought rather to have been placed vertically on one of its
ends, and then         should have been observed whether
                       it                                           deflection     a

                                 lines on its surface similar to those of
the veined structure and dust-bands in glaciers; and even                                           if
these appeared, the analogy would not have been complete unless
they had been found also to exhibit themselves when the ice-
plank, instead of resting vertically on one of its ends, had been
inclined at an angle of -1° 53' to the horizon, being the inclina
tion of part of the Mer de Glace.

    Of Mr. Croll's theory of the descent of glaciers will speak                I
when I     advocate my own.         With reference to my present argu
ment,    it   issufficient to  say that     agrees with my theory in this,
                                                    it
that    itattributes the descent of glaciers to the work of their
weight plus the work of the heat they are constantly receiving
from without*.             acknowledges, therefore, the insufficiency of
                            It
their weight alone to cause them to descend, which                    my pre           is
sent argument.
    In Professor TyndalPs experiment, solid ice was crushed and

 does descend,         have ventured to propose
                       I                              a theory which calls
 in aid of its weight the dilatations and contractions of its mass
 caused      byalternations of temperature.
    To arrive at some knowledge, however imperfect, of the elas
 ticity of ice from its deflection under given deflecting forces,                I
 made the following experiments on the 28th of December, 1869,
 when the temperature of the air was considerably below freezing.
 I      caused planks of ice to be taken from the surface of           pond,
                                                                        a
 and carefully sawn into rods and planed on           a  carpenter's bench
 and squared.           was very difficult to do this, because of the
                       It
 extreme brittleness of the ice. The surface nevertheless worked
 easily under the plane, and was quite dry (in that temperature
of the air) and beautifully smooth. My first experiment was
 with   a  rod of ice 4| inches wide         by
                                           1-j- inch thick, which  I  placed
horizontally on bearings         3feet   inches apart. When loaded in
                                         3

                       a
12 Ibs.      it broke after de
flecting         inch. The frac
                 j^j
ture was probably caused
 by   some motion given to
the last instalment of the
weight in the act of being
placed upon it. The surface
of fracture was continuous
and symmetrical; and hav
ing been repeated under the same geometrical form                  inall the
similar experiments which            made,
                                     I        I append    adiagram copied
from    a  tracing of it.

set.   The following seem, from these and other experiments, to
be physical properties characteristic of ice —                 :
    1. The preservation of the continuity of its substance when
it    made to shear.
     is                     will venture to call this rcadhesion.
                                 I
    2. Its extreme brittleness.
    3. Its elasticity at low temperatures.
    4. Its tendency when deflected easily to take        set.             a
 I    have calculated the modulus of the ice-rod as shown           the                 in
first ten of the experiments, of which the results are given in
the preceding Table, on the supposition that the elasticity of the

1-18       Canon Moscley on the Mechanical Impossibility
rod remained perfect throughout.              Their values are recorded in
the fourth column of the Table.
    That this perfect elasticity was not, in point of fact, pre
 served is plain from the variation of the modulus.                If it were,
and the experiments could in all respects be relied upon, the
elasticity of this rod of ice would be about one third that of cast
iron, three times that of deal, and a little greater than that of
tin*.
    I am far, however,       from putting these experiments forward
as sufficient in accuracy for determining a physical              constant of
 so much importance as the modulus of elasticity                 of ice. The
 elasticity of this ice-rod would have been different at a different
 temperature — or possibly if it had been taken out of another pond,
or even if taken out of a different part of the same pond.                  The
elasticity   of such  a  rod  of  ice remains   perfect only    within   certain
 exceedingly small limits of deflection, which it is not easy to
 observe with precision in the open air in a temperature consider
ably below freezing.         To that end an apparatus better adapted
to the purpose than mine would be necessary.
    Mr. Matthews has referred in just terms of respect to the
contribution     of the late Mr. W. Hopkins to the science of
glacier-motion, and particularly to that well-known experiment
in which placing a block of ice on an inclined plane of sandstone,
the ice descended        (melting at its surface of contact with the
sandstone)     with  a   velocity which, when the inclination of the
plane   did  not  exceed   a certain limit, was uniform.
    I have repeated Mr. Hopkins's experiments in various ways.
I   have used rough paving-stones for the inclined plane, and
stones pierced with holes to allow of the escape of the water
melted from the ice at the surfaces of contact, which seemed
to lubricate them.        With the same view I have used soft sand
stone to imbibe the water, and              I  have caused ridges to be
cut in its surface in the direction of the descent and across
it. In all these variations of his experiments I have found a
perfect confirmation of Mr. Hopkins's results.              His experiments
shows it not to be mechanically impossible that a block of ice
should descend on an inclined plane by its weight alone — and
therefore not to be mechanically impossible that a glacier should
descend by its weight alone, if it descended as the block of ice
did in his experiment.          But it does not. There is an essential
   * The modulus of
                       elasticity of hot-blast cast iron (Buffcry) is, according
to Hodgkinson, 15381200; that of deal (Memel), according to Barlow,
1535200; anil that of cast tin, according to Trcdgolil, 4608000.                I
think the best means of determining the modulus of elasticity of ice would
be found in the acoustic properties which at low temperatures it probably
possesses.

difference ; and precisely in this difference lies the impossibility
of the glacier descending by its weight alone. The block of ice
descended bodily ; its parts did not move over one another or
alongside one another, but with a common motion of descent ;
whereas not less than thirteen fourteenths of the motion of the
Glacier of the Aar       is,
                       according to Professor Forbes, not common               a
motion, but that of its particles one beside another and one over
another, which        called
                        is        differential motion, and to which
                                    a                                                is
opposed the resistance to shearing, which            at the rate of not less

than 75 Ibs. per square inch.
    Mr. Hopkins's experiment leaves therefore more than thir
teen fourteenths of the power necessary to cause               glacier to de

THE" On        the Increase of Electrical Resistance in Conductors with
rise of Temperature, and its application to the Measure of Ordinary
and Furnace Temperatures ; also on a simple Method of measuring
Electrical Resistances." — The Bakerian Lecture.         By Charles Wil
liam Siemens, F.R.S., D.C.L.
    The first part of this Paper treats of the question of the ratio of in
crease of resistance in metallic conductors with increase of temperature.
    The investigations of Arndtson, Dr. Werner Siemens, and Dr.
Matthiessen are limited to the range of temperatures between the
freezing- and boiling-points of water, and do not comprise platinum,
which is the most valuable metal for constructing pyrometric instru
ments.
    Several series of observations are given on different metals, in
cluding platinum, copper, and iron, ranging from the freezing-point
 to 350° Cent., another set of experiments being also given, extending
the observations to 1000° Cent.          These results are planned on a
 diagram, showing a'ratio of increase which does not agree either with
the former assumption of a uniform progression, or with Dr. Mat-
 thiessen's formula, except between the narrow limits of his actual
 observations, but which conforms itself to a parabolic ratio, modified
 by two other coefficients, representing linear expansion and an ulti
 mate minimum resistance.
     In assuming a dynamical law according to which the electrical
 resistance of a conductor increases according to the velocity with
 which the atoms are moved by heat, a parabolic ratio of increase of
  resistance with increase of temperature follows ; and in adding to
  this the coefficients just mentioned, the resistance r for any tempera
  ture is expressed by the general formula
  which is found to agree very closely both with the experimental data
  at low temperatures supplied by Dr. Matthiessen, and with the
  author's experimental results, ranging up to 1000° Cent. He admits,
  however, that further researches will be necessary to prove the limits
  of the applicability of the law of increase expressed by this formula
  to conductors generally, especially when nearing their fusing-point.
      In the second part of this Paper it is shown that, in taking advan
  tage of the circumstance that the electrical resistance of a metallic
  conductor increases with an increase of temperature, an instrument
  may be devised for measuring with great accuracy the temperature
  at 'distant or inaccessible places, including the interior of furnaces,
  where metallurgical or other smelting-operations are carried on.

    In measuring temperatures not exceeding 100° Cent., the instru
 ment is so arranged that two similar coils are connected by a light
 cable containing three insulated wires.     One of these coils, " the
 thermometer-coil," being carefully protected against moisture, may
 be lowered into the sea, or buried in the ground, or fixed at any ele
 vated or inaccessible place whose temperature has to be recorded
from time to time ; while the other, or " comparisou-coil," is plunged
into a test-bath, whose temperature is raised or lowered by the ad
dition of hot or cold water, or of refrigerated solutions, until an
electrical balance is established between the resistances of the two
coils, as indicated by a galvanoscope, or by a deferential voltameter,
described in the third part of the paper, which balance implies au
identity of temperature at the two coils.      The temperature of the
test-solution is thereupon measured by means of al delicate mercury
thermometer, which at the same time tells the temperature at the
distant place.
   By another arrangement the comparison-coil is dispensed with, and
the resistance of the thermometer-coil,   which is a known quantity at.
zero temperature,    is measured by a differential voltameter, which
forms the subject of the third part of the paper ; and the temperature
corresponding to the indications of the instrument is found in a table,
prepared for this purpose, in order to save all calculation.
   In measuring furnace-temperatures the platinum-wire constituting
the pyrometer is wound upon a small cylinder of porcehiiu con
tained in a closed tube of iron or platinum, which is exposed to the
heat to be measured.      If the heat does not exceed a full red heat,
or, say, 1000° Cent., the protected wire may be left permanently in
the stove or furnace whose temperature has to be recorded from
time to time ; but in measuring temperatures exceeding 1000° Cent.,
the tube is only exposed during a measured interval of, say, three
minutes, to the heat, which time suffices for the thin protecting casing
and the wire immediately exposed to its heated sides to acquire within
a determinable limit the temperature to be measured, but is not suffi
cient to soften the porcelain cylinder upon which the wire is wound.
In this way temperatures exceeding the welding-point of iron, and
approaching the melting-point of platinum, can be measured by the
same instrument by which slight variations at ordinary temperatures
are told.    A thermometric scale is thus obtained embracing without
a break the entire range.
   The leading wires between the thermometric coil and the measuring
instrument (which may be, under certain circumstances, several miles
in length) would exercise a considerable disturbing influence if this
were not eliminated by means of the third leading wire before men
tioned, which is common to both branches of the measuring instru
 ment.
   Another source of error in the electrical pyrometer would arise

 measuring electrical resistance without the aid of a magnetic needle
  or of resistance-scales.    It consists of two voltameter tubes fixed
 upon graduated scales, which are so connected that the current of
 a battery is divided between them, with one branch including a known
 and permanent resistance, and the other the unknown resistance to
 be measured.      The resistance and polarization being equal, and the
 battery being common to both circuits, these unstable elements are
 eliminated by balancing them from the circulation ; and an expression
 is found for the unknown resistance X in terms of the known resist
ances C and y of the voltameter, including the connecting-wires, and
 of the volumes V and V of gases evolved in an arbitrary space of

Changes of atmospheric pressure affect both sides equally, and do
not, therefore, influence the results ; but a reading at the atmospheric
pressure is obtained at both sides by lowering the little supply-reser
voir with dilute acid to the level indicated in the corresponding tube.
The upper ends of the voltameter tubes are closed by small weighted
levers provided with cushions of India-rubber;       but after each obser
vation these levers are raised, and the supply-reservoirs moved so as
to cause the escape of the gases until the liquid within the tubes is
again brought up to the zero-line of the scale, when the instrument
is ready for another observation.         A scries of measurements are
given of resistances varying from 1 to 10,000 units, showing that the
results agree within one-half per cent, with the independent mea
surements obtained of the same resistances by the Wheats tone method.
    The advantages claimed for the proposed instrument are, that it
is not influenced by magnetic disturbances or the ship's motion if
used at sea, that it can be used by persons not familiar with electrical
testing, and that it is of very simple construction.
    " On the Change of Pressure and Volume produced by Chemical
Combination."       By M. Berthelot.
     1. A singular question has arisen in the study of the gaseous
combinations, viz. can the pressure be diminished in consequence of
a reaction, at the moment it is accomplished, at constant volume,
without loss of heat, so that the phenomenon of explosion comes
from the excess of atmospheric pressure upon the inner pressure of
the system, instead of coming from the inverse excess of the inner
pressure ? The discussion of this question, however special it ap
pears at first sight, leads to general notions concerning chemical
combination.
    2. The pressure depends upon the temperature evolved, and upon
the state of condensation of the products.        Let us determine this
quantity.
    Let t be the temperature produced by the real reaction, this
being effected at a constant volume, admitting that the whole of the
disengaged heat was employed in warming the products.

   Let V be the sum'of the volumes of the gaseous bodies in tho
initial system at 0° and Om-760.
   At the temperature t, the final system contains in general certain
gaseous bodies.

without changing their state, to 0° and Om>7CO.

   When certain bodies, contained in the initial system at 0°, or in the
final system at t°, are in the solid or the liquid state, you can gene
rally neglect their volume in comparison with that of the gas, when
the pressures are not too considerable. Let us calculate the pressure
during the reaction which takes place at a constant volume and at
the temperature t, the initial temperature and pressure being 0°
and   H.
     Admitting Marriotte's          and    Gay-Lussac's            laws, the pressure    will

                                                                                           c
Q being   the quantity of heat produced in the reaction, and c being
the  mean specific heat of the products between 0° and t°.
   Let us develope this solution.
   3. The pressure augments when the condensation is null, for in
stance chlorine and hydrogen,              K=l,
                                      — and especially when there is
dilatation (combustion of acetylene by oxygen), t being always posi
tive in a direct and rapid reaction between gaseous bodies.
   4. On the contrary, the pressure diminishes if K is very great —
that   is,
         in the case of system containing gaseous bodies transformed
                            a
entirely into products which are in the solid or liquid state at the
temperature developed           by
                             the reaction.    This case      more rare     is
than one would think at first sight, because very few compounds
subsist wholly at the high temperature that would be developed by
the integral union of their gaseous components. Generally       portion         a
of these remain free at the moment of the reaction          but      the   ;        in
present state of our knowledge        impossible to estimate the pres
                                           it   is
sure corresponding to effects so complex.
   It necessary to consider that the present case must not be con
       is
founded with the case in which the products formed in the gaseous
state and at the temperature of the reaction are liquefied or solidified
under the influence of     subsequent cooling
                                a               for instance, the for
                                                               ;
mation of water from its elements, or of chlorhydrate of ammonia
from hydrochloric acid and ammonia, produces equally         diminution     a
in  the tinal pressure.
   5. In theory the most interesting case     that in which the initial
                                                          is
and final systems are wholly constituted of gaseous bodies whose

    154                             Royal Society.
   volume (calculated at 0° and Om>760) is more condensed in the final
    than in the initial system.        But this condensation is always com
    prised within very narrow limits, such as K = 4 (formation of
    arsenious acid by its elements), K=3, 2, 14, &c. j so the funda~
    mental condition
   that determines a diminution of pressure, should be realized only
   in very exceptional cases and when the heat evolved by an integral
   reaction is very little.
        One can ascertain it by making the calculation by means of the
   specific heats at constant volume (deduced with ordinary coefficient
   from the specific heats at constant pressure which M. lleguault has
   determined for many bodies).           One can also make the calculation
   in a more general manner, by admitting with Clausius that the
   specific heats at constant volume have an identical value for the
   atomic weights of elements, that this value is equal to 2, 4, the
   number found for H= 1, and that it does not change from the fact
  of combination. W being the quantity of heat produced in a reac
   tion between gaseous bodies calculated for atomic weights, and n
   the number of atoms in the reaction, the pressure will diminish
   only if
                                  W<655»(K-1).
        It is easy to see that this condition is not fulfilled in the combi
  nations best known. Calculating, either by means of this formula or
  by means of the preceding,         I have not succeeded in discovering any
  example of diminution of pressure among the numerous reactions                 I
  have examined in this present research.
        Besides, it is sufficient to make the calculation for the reaction
  supposed integral, the conclusion being generally the same for the
  reaction supposed incomplete — that is to say, in the case of dissocia
  tion, as it would be easy to prove.
        6. Without further extending         this discussion,  I believe that a
  new general proposition relative to chemical combination can be de
  duced from it.       It is known that every direct reaction which can be
  accomplished in a very short time between gaseous bodies with for
  mation of gaseous compounds, produces a disengagement of heat :
'this is true for all reactions evolved by chemical forces alone, acting
  without help of any work done by exterior forces*. The new pro
  position is the following :
                                  —
       The heat produced       in a reaction of this sort, supposing     it to be
 applied exclusively      and    without   any loss to warm the products, is
  such that an augmentation of pressure always takes place at a con
 stant volume, or, what is the same thing, an augmentation of volume
 at a constant pressure.
     * This proposition is contained in a more general one, which   I  hare given
      '
 in     Annales de Chimie et de Physique," 4™ serie, t. xviii.

                            Geological Society,                      155
    This proposition results not from any <J priori deduction, but is
verified by the whole of facts known to this day.
    7. One may ask if the change of volume, in which the gases keep
the whole heat produced by their mutual actions, is regulated by a
simple law, analogous to those that have been observed when the
gaseous combinations are brought to the same temperature ; never
theless it does not appear to be so.
    Let us compare the formation of the different hydracids by means
of their gaseous elements, which gives no change of volume when
the gas is reduced at 0° and Om-760.
    The formation of chlorhydric gas, H Cl, produces 23,900 calories ;
the formation of bromhydric gas,       II Br, produces 13,400 calories ;
the formation of iodhydric gas,       III, produces 800 calories.    The
specific heat of these gases being nearly the same under the same
volume, it is clear that the quantities of heat aforesaid cannot pro
duce an augmentation of volumes identical or proportional with simple
numbers.

construction of the Albert Dock, Hull." By J. C. Hawkshaw, Esq.,
M.A., F.G.S.
    The Albert Dock is situated on the foreshore of the river Humber.
The excavations for the dock extended over an area of about thirty
acres, and they were carried down to a depth varying from 8 feet to
27 feet below low water of spring tides. Beneath the more modem
deposits of Humber silt a bed of peat, Hessle Clay, Hessle Sand, and
purple clay were successively met with.        The peat was found at the
west end of the dock at the level of low water ; at the east end the
bed dipped so that the upper surface was found at 8 feet below the
level of low water. In the peat were found the remains of a fire,
which the writer attributed to human agency.            Oak-trees of large
size were imbedded in the peat, some of which had grown where
they were found, as was shown by the stocks remaining with the
roots penetrating the Boulder-clay beneath.        In one oak-tree, 5 feet
in diameter, a hole was found filled with acorns and nuts. Many
of the nuts were broken open at the ends, and had evidently formed
part of the store of a squirrel.     Remains of Coleoptera were found,
and one horn-core of a Bos.        The excavation did not extend below
the upper parts of the purple clay. Some of the borings, however,
penetrated the chalk at a depth of 85 feet below low-water level,
passing through a bed of sand 16 feet thick below the purple clay.
Several thousand cubic yards of this sand were brought up into the
foundations by springs of water which flowed up through old bore
holes. The abstraction of this sand from beneath the clay-bed
caused it to subside many feet.       The writer thinks that analogous
subsidences may take place from natural causes — for instance, where
large springs occur in tidal rivers.      Two sections exhibited showed
the beds above the chalk for a distance of rather more than a mile
along the foreshore. The Hessle sand was shown to thin out to the
westward. It does not, in the writer's opinion, increase in thickness
in that direction, as it was shown to do in a section already published
in the Proceedings of the Society.

ON THE      INFLUENCE OF A COVERING OF SNOW ON CLIMATE. BY
     A. WOJEIKOF, MEMBER OF THE IMPERIAL RUSSIAN GEOGRA
     PHICAL SOCIETY.
                                      St. Petersburg, February 20, 1871.
rPHE       influence of a layer of snow resting on the earth's surface in
 -*-    the colder portions of the earth during winter has, to my know
ledge, never been considered in its general bearing on the climate
 and the conditions of the population living in these countries.
     The first and most apparent influence of snow is the protection
 it affords to our crops from the cold of winter.        Where the snow-
 mantle appears regularly, winter crops are always sure, be the
cold ever so intense. In the steppes of South and East Russia              ,

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            .  157
where little snow falls in winter, and this small quantity is often
hlown away by the strong winds, winter crops are scarcely attempted
at all. On the northern coasts of the Black Sea, summer wheat and
Indian corn are very good ; but winter wheat is n precarious crop,
while to the north, in Podolia, it is the principal crop.         There the
forests afford a protection against the wind, the snow falls more co
piously and cannot be blown away.
    As a bad conductor of heat, the snow isolates the warmer soil
from the cold air above ; and there is no doubt that it renders also the
winter cold more intense, as the air cannot receive heat from below.
In countries where the snow-covering is not permanent, as Western
Europe, this influence of snow is well known, and people expect
great cold where a layer of snow has fallen and the sky clears.            In
countries where snow usually lies the whole winter, as Russia and
 the northern parts of America, this is not generally understood, and
in Russia people say it is colder without snow than with it. This
 feeling is quite natural. The first frosts of autumn are more severely
 felt because the human body is not accustomed to them, and also
 because the air is drier than with snow, and a cold dry wind is more
 severely felt than a cold moist one.
    The great relative humidity of the air is a most important feature
 of the countries covered with snow in winter. It is as easy to account
 for it as for the humidity of an island in the middle of the ocean, or
 of a place situated in an extensive swamp-tract. The wind may come
 from every side, it has always to pass over a large evaporating sur
 face, and absorbs moisture if it was originally dry.           In countries
 where cold strong winds predominate, as in the greater part of North
 America and Eastern Asia, this will be less the case, as the winds,
 rapidly passing over the land, have not the time for absorbing much
  moisture ; and the dryness of the air in the United States is felt by
  Europeans going there.         But in countries situated like Europe and
  Western Asia, where the cold winds are usually weak, and only the
  warm southerly winds strong, the air will be always nearly saturated
  when the soil has a snow covering, as the cold winds in their slow
  progress have the time for absorbing moisture.         This feature of cli
  mate is extremely important in the examination         of storms.    It was
  one of the chief merits of Espy to have pointed out the importance of
  vapour in the origin and progress of storms ; and this is now gene
  rally admitted.       If a storm is signalized and the beginning of its
  path   stated, it is important to know the quantity of vapour dissemi
  nated in the countries where it is likely to pass, and the quantity
  which may be expected to be condensed as rain and snow. Now,
  the lower the temperature falls, the more uncertain are observations
  of the psychrometer ; and I am of the opinion that it it not a sure
  guide below the freezing-point.       This stated, it is very important to
  have some general idea as to the quantity of vapour over the cold
  spaces of the earth's surface.     Now in countries situated like Bur"-,
  relative humidity will scarcely fall below 75°-80° so long as the
  earth is covered with snow, so that the quantity of vapour in the air
  of these regions may be very nearly known if we know the tempera

  ture.    In an examination of the barometric range in European Russia
  and Siberia, some time ago,     I have stated that not only does the pres
  sure of the air rise in winter as we advance from the western coast of
  Europe into the interior of the continent, but the barometric minima
 rise even more ; ao that, for example, in Nertschinsk, in Eastern
  Siberia, the mean of the barometric minima of January, reduced to the
  sea-level, is 30'23 inches, and the lowest pressure happening in seven
  teen yearsin this month was equal to 29'93. If we consider that at this
 place the temperature never rises above 14° F. in January, the effect
 of cold and small quantity of vapour in the air in arresting the progress
 of storms in winter will be clearly seen.        In European Russia the
 barometric minima are lower in winter than in the other seasons.
 This shows that the storms of the Atlantic take their course over
 our country.       Speaking generally, the path of storms is from N.W.
 to S.E. in winter, because they cannot advance in an eastward di
 rection as they began, being arrested by the cold. The colder the
 temperature is, the sooner the storms must turn to the southward ;
 and this will be much more the case in January than in November
 and March, when the storms of Europe sometimes advance into the
 interior of Siberia.
    Another feature of the snow is that of arresting the progress of
 temperature above the freezing-point so long as it lies. In rising
above, the heat is employed in melting the snow ; or, in the Language
 of the mechanical theory of heat, it is transformed into work. We
 have some striking facts of this kind in Russia.        For example, Bar
 naul, in Western Siberia, has a winter temperature lower than St.
 Petersburg by nearly 18° F. Yet the thermometer sometimes rises as
high as in this last place in winter, because Barnaul has the Kirghi-
steppes to the south-west.         As they are seldom covered with snow,
warm winds can pass across them and without losing their heat,
while before arriving at St. Petersburg they must lose much of their
heat in melting the snow over an extensive tract.         The result is that
seldom a winter month passes without temperatures above freezing-
point ; but in January and February the thermometer does not rise
above 39°, while at Barnaul a temperature of 42° may occur at that
time (for example, on the 4th, 5th, and Cth of February 1855).
    I have mentioned already the effect of the snow in checking the
rise of temperature, and employing more abundant heat in melting.
This is most felt in spring, and lowers much the temperature of this
time of the year — as, for example, while in Central Europe, at some
distance from the eea.April has nearly the same temperature as October
in the same latitude, in Russia the warmth of the sun's rays cannot
raise the temperature of the air so much, and April is generally 4° F.
colder than October, while May has the same temperature as Sep
tember. As soon as the snow is melted our climate assumes its
true continental character.        In more northern parts of Russia it is
May     which   stays  behind  September — as, for example, at Archangel,
Berezoe, and even Yakutsk in one of the most continental cli
mates of our planet : in this last place May is more than 3° colder
than September, while March is 13|° warmer than November.

   I must now state a last point — the influence of forests in equalizing
the layer of snow and giving to it all its beneficial effects. Without
the forests a great mass of snow is often a check to all communica
tion, as, for example, at this moment in South Russia, where most
of the railways are stopped.         The unusually great mass of snow is
blown in all directions by the wind unimpeded by trees, as some of
these places were always steppes ; in others man was too short
sighted to let the trees stand.        The effect of the melting of snow on
the rising of rivers will be quite different in a wooded and a bare
country.     In the first the snow will lie sometimes a month longer
than in the last, and accordingly the floods of the rivers will be longer
continued but less high and devastating.           Every one who has inha
bited the country will be struck by this fact, and its bearing on the
climate and the well-being of the population all around.           Generally
speaking, as I have stated, the effects of a layer of snow are bene
ficent to man.     The proportion of the crops is of enormous econo
mical worth.      The greater moisture of the air is also good ; and even
the cold of spring, caused by the melting of snow, has its good side.
The too rapid advance of vegetation in early spring is checked by it,
and protracted to a time when the vegetables have less to fear from
night frosts.    Northern Europe, for example, suffers much less from
this curse than the south, where the returns of cold in spring cause
great damage every year.          Only two serious effects are sometimes
felt — the interruption of communication in snow-storms, and the great
floods of spring.     But both of these drawbacks can be avoided by
the foresight of man, as forests arrest the progress of winds and
cause a slow melting in spring, so as to store a great quantity of
water to supply our rivers. — Silliman's American Journal, July

    As M. Schwendler          has referred to a statement of mine in his
paper   in your  July  Number,     may I be allowed to say he is correct in
stating that the
                    " shunt" he describes was invented
                                                              by a telegraph
clerk (Mr. Higgins).         Its application to overland telegraphs is men
tioned in the handbooks supplied to the staff of the Indian Telegraph
Department in 1867, where it is also stated that the proper resist
ance of the " shunt
                        "
                           is about equal to that of the electromagnet to
which it is attached.

 160              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
              ON THE ERUPTION THEORY OF THE CORONA.
       To  the Editors of   the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    In your Supplementary Number for June last you say (page 537)
 that " Mr. Proctor has lately broached a theory of solar eruption, in
 which he considers that the solar coronal matter consists of meteors
 ejected from the sun, and rushing through the photosphere with a ve
locity of 200 mile.s per second," &c.
    I presume that Mr. Proctor will be as much surprised as myself at
this affiliation, inasmuch as in Fraser's Magazine for April last he
 discussed this idea as one which " astronomers first saw enunciated
in Mattieu Williams's ' Fuel of the Sun,' " and pointed out the confir
mations which the recent observations on the corona, and the actual
measurements of eruptive velocities by Zollner, afforded to this ex
planation, which incidentally and unexpectedly forced itself upon me
in working out the necessary physical consequences of the unlimited
extension of ordinary atmospheric matter in the work to which Mr.
Proctor referred.
    As the Philosophical Magazine is one of the permanent records of
the progress of science, it is but a matter of justice both to Mr.
 Proctor and myself that this mistake should be corrected.
                                      Yours truly,
                                              W. MATTIEU WILLIAMS,
    Woodside Green, Croydon,
         June  20, 1871.
    [Although to a certain extent a similarity may exist between the
 theory   enunciated by Mattieu Williams in his work entitled the
 '                    '
   Fuel of the Sun and that which we have ascribed to Proctor, in
 some important particulars they differ materially.       It is generally
understood that the principal material of the solar prominences         is
glowing hydrogen, which, according to Proctor, rushes outwards
through the photosphere in countless exceedingly fine jets. Accord
ing to Williams, the elements of water and metallic vapours are
ejected by continuous explosions from the body of the sun during the
uprush necessary to restore the equilibrium disturbed by the down-
rush forming the spots.          Beyond the photosphere, the products
of combustion of metallic elements solidify in consequence of a series
of condensations, by which metallic snow and hail are produced, filling
for a time the coronal space and then are rained back upon the sun.
The only point, so far as we can see, in which the two theories agree
is that the corona consists of solar matter ; but as to the nature of the
materials the theorists differ.—- KEVIEWEB.]

XX.   Onthe Reduction         of tfle Second Axiom of 'the Mechanical TJieory
  of Heat       to general Mechanical Principles.         By R. CLAUSIUS *.

   J-      have  advanced the' following theorem, valid for every
stationary motion of any system of material points : — The mean
vis viva of the system is equal to its virial. This theorem may be
regarded as one of dynamical equilibrium, since it gives a rela
tion which must subsist between the forces and the motions
called forth by them in order that the latter may continue with
their vis viva, on the average, neither increased by positive work
of the forces nor diminished by negative, but, amid passing fluc
tuations, maintaining a constant mean value.
    As the magnitude which I have denoted by the name virial               is,
with equal coordinates of the material points, proportional to the
                                                                          If, is,
forces operating upon them, the vis viva of stationary motion
ctfteris paribus, proportional to the forces which      balances.

then, we regard heat as        stationary motion of the smallest par
                                   a
ticles of bodies, and absolute temperature as the measure of the
vis vita, we shall find no difficulty in recognizing the agreement
of the above-mentioned mechanical theorem with the law ad
vanced     by me in an earlier memoir          — The                       of

     If,
       however, we wish to make this law the basis of a mathe
matical development, we must give it a more definite form,
because the expression effective force of heat may admit of differ
ent interpretations.   Hence in that memoir                        I
                                                   have, for the pur
pose  of thus applying       it,
                         expressed  the law more  fully,as follows: —
    The mechanical work which can be done                     by
                                                heat in any alteration
of  the arrangement      of
                         body,
                             a    proportional to the absolute tem
                                         is
perature at which the alteration takes place.
   In order to express this law               by
                                         mathematical equation, let
                                                   a
us imagine the body undergoing an infinitely small alteration of
its condition, the change proceeding in       reversible manner, in
                                                             a
which the quantity of heat contained in the body as well as its
constituents may be altered. Work may either be performed
(when the internal and external forces operating on the particles
are overcome) or expended (when the particles yield to the forces).
This infinitesimal work may be denoted         dli work performed
                                                             by        ;
is reckoned as positive, and work expended as negative.          Then
the following equation will stand as the expression of the above
law: —

in which   T denotes the absolute temperature, and A      constant,              a
namely the caloric equivalent of the work, and         represents           Z                a
magnitude which       perfectly determined
                      is                         the present condiby
tion of the body, without      being necessary
                                   it          to know in what way
the body has come into this condition.      This magnitude     have                   I
named the disgregation of the body.

   We have now to find for this equation an explanation founded
on mechanical principles.       For this purpose the above theorem
concerning the virial furnishes a clue, inasmuch as it indicates
the nature of the considerations which must be employed.          But
it is not alone sufficient ; the investigation requires iu addition
certain new and peculiar developments, which are to form the
subject of the present memoir.
   2. To begin with a case as simple as possible in relation to
the kind of motion, and thereby facilitate the view of the mode
of consideration which here comes into use, we will first suppose
a single material point, operated on by a force which may be
represented by an ergal — that                      is,
                                      the components of which, re
ferred to three rectangular-coordinate      directions, are expressed
 by the partial differential coefficients of the three coordinates of
the point, taken negatively.      Under the influence of this force,
the point will have     periodical motion in
                                a                closed path.
                                                           a
   Now let us imagine this motion to undergo an infinitely small
alteration, resulting in     new periodical motion.
                                         a               This conver
sion of the motion can be occasioned in three ways at any place      :
in the path, through       passing external influence, the velocity-
                                     a
components       -j->        -jj>   and -j- may be infinitesimally       altered, and
then the point may again be left to the operation merely of the
original force; or an infinitesimal alteration may occur in the
force operating on the point — for example,            change in the value
                                                            a
of constant occurring in the ergal. The third cause of con
  a
version of the motion will not occur in our considerations on
heat, but    is  of interest for     comparison which we shall make
                                                a
further on       it   the point being compelled to describe
                        is                                            path
                                                                              is a
             :
somewhat deviating from the one chosen               itself— which
                                                           by          also
connected with an alteration of the force, because then to the ori
ginal force  is  added the resistance which the new path-curve has
to perform.
   We will now investigate whether, in all these circumstances,
there exists     universally valid relation between the alterations
                 a
of the different magnitudes occurring in the motion.
   3. The alterations undergone                       by
                                           the coordinates of the point,
its velocity- components, the components of the force, &c. shall,

prefix  d;  so  that,  for example,   dx  will  signify the variation in  x

   In reference to the latter, however, a special remark must be
made, which is of importance for the following.        the altered,           If
motion is to be compared with the initial one in such a manner
as to show how the values of x in the one differ from the corre
sponding values of x in the other motion, we must first settle
which values of x shall be regarded as corresponding to each
other.   For this purpose, any two points infinitely near each
other in the two paths may first be taken as corresponding
points.   Starting from these, in order to obtain the remaining
corresponding points we take as a measure a magnitude which
changes in the course of the motions, and settle that those points
in the two paths which belong to equal values of the measuring
magnitude are corresponding points.     As measuring magnitude,
however, one must be chosen which for an entire revolution has
equal values in both paths; for through an entire revolution the
moving point always arrives again at the chosen initial point in
each of the two paths, and these we have already taken as cor
responding points.
   We will now determine the measuring magnitude in the fol
lowing manner.     Let i be the time of a revolution with the
original motion, and t the variable time which the moveable
point requires in order to pass from the initial position to another
one ; then we will put
                                         t=i.t                                           (3)
For the altered motion, let the time of    revolution be denoted
                                                        a

      i1,

                         /'    ;
                                         C=i'.0.
If,now,     <j>
           has equal values in both expressions,   and    are cor         t        t'
responding times.   The corresponding times being in this man
ner determined, the corresponding points of the two paths and,
accordingly, the corresponding values of x,      z, &c. follow of    y,
themselves.
   The magnitude      we will call the phase of the motion. During
                         <f>
one revolution the phase increases one unit. With further in
crease, the phases which differ                by
                                        whole number of units may
                                                    a
be regarded as equal, in the same sense as angles which differ by
multiples of 2?r.
   Subtracting the first of the two preceding equations from the
second, there results

  5.   In this equation we must first consider the expression SU.
  In    every case in which, with the altered motion, the ergal is
still represented by the same function U as with the original
the quantity 8U (the alteration of the mean value of the ergal)
expresses the work done in the transition from the one stationary
motion to the other.          If,
                             then, as we have done above in the

168              Prof. E. Clausius       on the Second      Axiom
equations referring to heat, we denote by             SL the work performed,
we can put

   When, on the other hand, the change in the motion is occa
sioned by the fact that the force operating on the point has
been changed, the thing is not quite so simple, but requires
special consideration.
   6. As said above, the alteration of the force may be imagined,
mathematically,    conditioned by a constant which occurs in the
ergal changing its value by an infinitely small quantity. With
out going into this more closely, we will only make the following
assumption, which comes to essentially the same thing.               The
ergal,  which  with   the  original  motion    was  represented by the
function U, shall with the altered motion be represented by the
sum U+/iV, in which V signifies any other function of the co
ordinates, and      an infinitely small constant factor.
                      fj,
   In regard  to the   occurrence of the increase pV however, we ,
will preliminarily make the subsidiary assumption that the in
crease does not take place suddenly at             certain moment, but
                                                      a
proceeds   gradually,  during   an  entire  revolution,  — the infinitely
small  factor which   stands   before     increasing uniformly during
                                           V
that time, so as just to reach the value        at the end of the revo
                                                    p
lution, and then preserving this value constant during the suc
ceeding revolutions.      Accordingly, during one element of the
time dt, the factor will increase          by   ~-f       or, which   is   the same
thing, during         an element     of the phase   dd>   the factor will increase
 by   (i   d$.
      In order now to determine the work-variation SL which cor
responds to the entire transition from the one stationary motion
to the other, we must first give the work- variation for any selected
individual phase <£,.     For this purpose let us consider the move-
able point from the moment when, in its revolution in the ori
ginal path,     just passes the place which belongs to the phase
                 it

 sponding to the original ergal          U

   In  the determination of the second quantity, we must, on
account of the gradual nature of the increase /ttV, conceive the
factor    divided into an infinite number of parts, and for each

   We have thus for this case also arrived at the same simple
result which we have already expressed for the other cases in
equation (20).
   To obtain this result, we have made the special assumption
that the alteration of the ergal proceeds uniformly during one
entire revolution.   But we may also extend this result to an
other case, and one which is important for the following. We
will imagine that, instead of one point in motion, there are
several, the motions of which take place in essentially like cir
cumstances, but with different phases.                 If,
                                              now, at any time                     t
the infinitely small alteration of the ergal occurs which    ex             is
pressed mathematically   as    changing into U+/iV, we
                                      U                 have for
each single  point, instead of /*(V— V), to construct    quantity       a
of the form /t(V   — V), in which     represents the value of the
                                               V
second function corresponding to the time        This quantity

in general not =0, but has positive or negative value, accord
                                       a
ing to the phase in which the point in question was at the time                    t.
Hut   ifwe wish to forui the mean value of the quantity ^£,(V— V)
for all the points, we have, instead of the individual values which
occur of   V, to put^the mean value V, and thereby obtain again
the expression /*(V— V), which     =0.       is
   7. From the preceding     follows that, on the suppositions
                                       it
made, we can put 8L in equation (19) in the place of SU, so that
the equation becomes
                                                                              (21)
The expression on the right             may be simplified       by   introducing   A
for the product             V*,   which represents the mean vis viva of the
                                                      .......

   By the help of this equation we can determine the mechanical
work which      done in the change from one stationary motion to
                   is
another, differing infinitely little from              it,
                                                 without perfectly
knowing the motions, since to take into account the mean vis
viva and the time of revolution
                              a      sufficient.
                                              is

                   of the Mechanical     Theory   of Heat.             171
    The expression containing the quantities h and i, which repre
sents the work 8L, is not a complete variation of a function of h
and f ; on the other hand, if the equation be brought into the
following form,
                              =A(81ogA + 281ogi),
the two variations in the brackets can be reduced to one, viz.
                                             .......
                         SL==A8(logA + 21ogj),
or, otherwise written,
                         SL = ASlog(Az8)                               (23)
Hence the work can be represented by the product of A and the
variation of a function of h and i.
    This result corresponds perfectly with equation (2) relative to
the theory of heat,
The quantity log (At9) is replaced in this equation by the pro
duct CZ, in which C is a constant, and Z the magnitude which
in the theory of heat I have named the disgregation.               We have
hence,    so far as we wish to apply this conception to the station
ary motion of a single point, arrived at a nearer determination
of it — namely, that the disgregation is proportional to the quan
tity log   (Az8).
     8. In   order to get an idea of the geometrical meaning of the
quantity log (Aj2),    I will  for A reintroduce the product    —  v*.  We
                                                                At
then obtain
                   log(A»9)   = log(^52".i
The last term on the right-hand           side is invariable, and hence is
unimportant to equation (23), in which only the variation of the
quantity considered occurs ; we need therefore only attend to the
 first term.
     Assuming now as a special case that the velocity is constant
 (which occurs, for example, when a point moves in a circular
path round a fixed centre of attraction, or when a point operated
on by no other force flies forward and backward between fixed

172           Prof. R. Clausius   on the Second   Axiom
elastic walls, from which it rebounds with equal velocity at each
impact), we can write simply v* for v*, and then extract the root,
by which the expression i Vv* is changed into iv. This product
is equal to the length of the point's path ; and consequently we
can say that, in motions with constant velocity, the disgregation
 (neglecting an additive constant, which in the variation or dif
ferentiation is omitted) is proportional to the logarithm of the
length of the path.
   When the velocity is variable, the thing is not quite so simple,
because the mean value of the square of the velocity is different
from the square of its mean value ; but still it is seen that the
disgregation stands in close relation to the logarithm of the
length of the path.
   9. Before leaving the motion of a single point in order to pass
to more extended investigations, it will be to the purpose to sub
mit to a further special consideration the last of the three causes
above mentioned of the conversion of the motion, because we shall
thereby have an opportunity of comparing the result of our de
velopment with a well-known and important mechanical theorem.
   We will, namely, assume the conversion to be occasioned by
the point having been compelled, instead of the path chosen by
itself, to describe another, lying infinitely near it. In this case, for
each place in the changed path, compared with the corresponding
place in the original path, according to the theorem of the equi
valence of vis viva and mechanical work, the following equation
holds good : —
                                           •
                                  \   1~
                               2
Accordingly, in equation (19), instead of 8U,      we can put — ^$v*,
and hence obtain the following equation : —
                        m j-j    m  c.—a
                                                log i,
from w*hich, by easy transformations,      result : —
                        m&P + mv*    4=0,
                                   0 ........               ,   ,
                                                                    (24)
   This equation is in form the     same as that which, for a single

                    of the Mechanical     Theory of Heat.                   173
moveable point, expresses the theorem of the least effect.                 It is
true that in the signification there is a difference, inasmuch as
in deducing our equation we have supposed that the original and
the altered motion take place in closed paths which need not co
incide in any point, while in the theory of the least effect it is
supposed that both motions begin from a common point and end
at a common point ; yet this difference is immaterial to the proof,
because equation (24) can be deduced equally on both supposi
tions, if in the one case we understand by i the time of a revo
lution, and in the other that time which the moving point
requires in order to pass from the initial to the final position.
     Returning now to our more general result, expressed by equa
 tion (23), on comparing it with the theorem of the least effect,
 its applicability is seen to be more extended, inasmuch as it in
cludes also the cases in which the vis viva is altered by a transient
 extraneous influence, or into which a change in the ergal enters,
 whereas such cases are excluded from the theorem of the least
effect*.
     10. Having treated the simple case of a single point moving
 in a closed path, let us now pass to more complicated ones.
     We will assume that there are a very great number of material
 points which, on the one hand, exercise forces upon each other,
 and, on the other, are affected by forces from without.                 Under
 the influence of all these forces the points shall move in a sta-
    * It may, in passing, be further remarked that where the forces present
 consist of central forces proportional to a definite (positive or negative)
 power of the distance, the equations here developed are capable of being
 combined very simply with the equation which expresses the theorem
 of the virial. That is to say, in such cases the virial differs from the mean
value of the ergal only by a constant factor ; for when a force denoted ge
nerally by 0(r) is determined by the equation
                               <£(r)=*r»,
in which k and n are constants, we obtain by integration,      if we suppose the
arbitrary constant equal to 0,
and accordingly the equation
is valid ; and hence the virial is equal to the mean value of the ergal mul
tiplied by the factor
                       '^^.    Consequently the theorem of the virial can for
such cases be expressed   thus : — The mean vis viva is equal to the mean ergal
multiplied by   ^i — It    is obvious how all equations which contain the
mean vis viva and the mean ergal can be simplified by the application          of
this theorem.

174                 Prof. R. Clausius      on the Second   Axiom
tionary manner. We will presuppose that the forces have an
ergal — that        is,
                 that the work which         done is       by
                                                      the whole of the
forces in an infinitely small change in the situation of the points
is expressed        by
                 the negative differential of function of the whole
                                                       a
of the coordinates.       When the original stationary motion                        is
converted into another stationary motion, the forces shall still
have an ergal, which, however, may differ from the preceding
not merely          by
                 the altered situation of the points, but also                       by
another circumstance.       This circumstance may be conceived to
be mathematically expressed             by
                                      the ergal containing     quantity   a
which      constant during each stationary motion, but alters its
          is
value from one stationary motion to the other.
   Further, we will make         supposition which will facilitate our
                                 a
further considerations, and corresponds to what takes place in
the motion which we name heat.           If the body the heat-motion
of which     in question
               is                chemically simple, all its atoms are
                                 is
equal to one another        but
                            ;         ifit  chemical compound, there
                                             is   a
are indeed different kinds of atoms, but the number of each kind
is very great.   Now all these atoms are not necessarily found in
like circumstances. When, for instance, the body consists of
parts in different states of aggregation, the atoms belonging to
one part move differently from those belonging to the other.
Yet we can still assume that each kind of motion           carried out
                                                                     is
 by   very great number of equal atoms essentially under equal
      a
forces and in like manner, so that only the synchronous phases
of their motions are different.       In correspondence with this we
will now presume     also  that,   in our system of material points,
different kinds of them may occur, but of each kind         very greata
number are present, and also that the forces and motions are
such that at all times      great number of points, under the in
                             a
fluence of equal forces, move equally, and only have different
phases.
     Lastly,   will, for the sake of simplicity, make one more
               we
assumption, which will afterwards be dropped again, namely that
all the points describe closed paths.  For such points as have
been said above to move alike, we just now make         special as   a
sumption — that they describe equal paths with equal times of
revolution, while other points may describe other paths with
other times of revolution.   When the original       changed into
                                                                is
another stationary motion, the paths and the times of revolution
are altered, but again only closed paths with fixed times of revo
lution shall occur, of which each holds good for great number   a
of points.
   11. On these conditions let us now again consider the pro-
       (L3C
duct -rr Sx for any point, or (at once multiplying               it   by      the mass

                       of the Mechanical Theory of Heat.                                175

nifies the difference between a value of x in the original path
and the value of x at the corresponding place in the altered path.
    This product changes its value periodically during the motion
of the point, so that at the expiration of every time of revolution
j it returns to its former value. We can hence construct the
following equation: —
This equationcan be further simplified when we consider not
merely  one material  point, but an entire group which move
equally and hence  have   the same time of revolution i. The
                il'V
quantity      m-j- Sx changes its value according                       to the phase in
which the point is.    As, however, at a fixed time the points
belonging  to the group have different phases, and the number of
the points constituting the group is so great that at every time
all the phases may be considered to be proportionately repre
sented, the value of the sum
                                            2m      -3- Sx,
referred to all these points, will not perceptibly vary. The same
holds good for every other group of points of like kind and with
equal motion ; and hence we can at once refer the preceding sum
to all the points of our system and likewise regard as constant
the sum so completed.      We thus obtain the equation
     We will now carry out the differentiation herein indicated
                                                                   y.-,

     In the expression              -~- ,           in which   the quantity   x is first va-

two operations must not be reversed.     Probably, however, this
may be done when the differentiation refers not to the time t, but
to the phase           <f>.
                  Hence we form the following equation,
or    by   replacing          (in accordance with equation             5)   the differential

                          dt      i     d<f>
Here we may exchange the differentiation and the variation on
the right-hand aide, whereby we obtain
                              ~
                          dt     i    d$
After   this  exchange,  we  again   introduce  on the right-hand side
the differential coefficient according to t, putting
                        dx  _ dx     dt  _   dx
                       ~dlj>~dt"(ty      ~lJt'
Thereby we obtain
                                 ndx       dx

 By employing this equation, equation (26) is changed into               i
 As, in accordance with equation (25), the differential coefficient
here standing on the left-hand side is equal to 0, we hence obtain
                                                           .

In like   manner   for the two other coordinates      we can form    the
following equations    :—
When     w,e add together these three equations,      and   at the same
time consider the equation

    In this equation   we now replace the products             mj&>

The left-hand    side of the equation, thus transformed, must be
subjected   to a closer consideration.
    12. Since, according to hypothesis, the forces operating in the
system have an ergal, in all cases in which, on the transition
from one stationary motion to the other, the ergal undergoes
only the change conditioned by the altered position of the points,
the left-hand side of the preceding equation is simply the varia
 tion of the ergal, and, as such, represents the work done in the
transition from one motion to the other, which we have denoted
by 8L.     When, on the contrary, the ergal undergoes a further
change, containing a quantity which, as above said, is constant
 in each stationary motion, but the value of which changes in the
transition from one motion to the other, the special circumstances
 under which this happens must also be taken into consideration.
     For a single moving material point, it follows from our pre
 vious considerations that the work SL depends on the phase in
 which the point is at the moment when the alteration of the ergal
 occurs.    On the other hand, we have also further seen that with
 a great number of points which are in different phases, so that
 at the moment of the alteration of the ergal all the phases are
 simultaneously represented, that difference vanishes for the mean
 value relative to all the points, and that hence we may, as far as
 the mean value is concerned, regard as the expression of the
 work SL that variation of the ergal which the mere change of
position of the points supposes.
     Such a case is our present one, where in every kind of motion
 occurring we have to do with very many points in the most
 various phases ; hence we can replace the left-hand side of the
  above equation simply by SL, whereby we obtain
                       SL=2^V)+2mt>*Slogj-.           •  •   •   (31)

     13. In the preceding derivation it was specially presupposed
 that all the points describe closed paths. We will now drop this

178               Prof. R. Clausius     on the Second   Axiom
supposition and only retain the assumption that the motion is
stationary.
   Since with motions which need not be in closed paths the no
tion of time of revolution        is,
                              in the literal sense, no longer appli
cable, the question arises whether another, corresponding, can be
put in its place.
   For this purpose let us first consider only those components of
the motions which refer to one determined direction — for example,
the components in the x direction of our system of coordinates.
We have, then to do simply with motions alternately to the posi
tive and the negative side    and;     in particular, in relation to
                                         if,
elongation, velocity, and duration manifold varieties occur, there
yet   isin the notion of   stationary motion the prevalence of
                             a                                          a
certain uniformity, on the whole, in the way that the same states
of motion are repeated. Accordingly        must be possible to ex
                                               it
hibit   a mean value for the intervals of time within which the
repetitions take place with each group of points that are alike in
 their motions.   If we denote this mean duration of period of  a
 motion     by
             i,we can unhesitatingly assume as valid also for the
 motion now considered equation (28), namely
   Corresponding equations can be formed also for the           and y   z
directions  ; and in fact we   will  assume  that the motions  in the
various directions of the coordinates so far agree that, in each
        of points, we may ascribe       common value to the quantity
                                         a
froup
  log j for all three coordinate-directions.    By then treating the
three equations so formed as we have equations (28), (28a), and
(286) we arrive again at equation (31)         :—
   14. In the further treatment of this equation              difficulty
                                                                a
occurs, because  in the  different  groups  of points both the velocity
v and the duration of        motion-period may vary, and hence
                              a                    i
these two quantities occurring under the last sign of summation
cannot at once be separated.       Nevertheless     we take advantage
                                                       if
of near-lying supposition,
    a                           the separation  becomes  possible, and
we thereby arrive at    very simple
                         a             form  of the equation.
   As the various material points belonging to our system reci
procally operate upon each other, the vis viva of one group of
points cannot be altered while the vis viva of the others remains
unaltered   ;but the alteration of the one supposes the alteration
of the others, because certain equilibrium between ths vires vivee
                          a
of the various points must be restored before the new state can
remain stationary.    We will now suppose that, in the motion

                  of the Meclianical Theory of Heat.             179
which we call heat, equilibrium is always effected in this way : —
between the vires viva of the various points a fixed ratio subsists,
which is renewed with every alteration that occurs in the total
vis viva.    The mean vis viva of each point may then be repre
sented by a product of the form mcT, in which m is the mass of
the point, and c another constant, determinate for each point,
while T denotes a variable quantity which is equal for all the

Herein the quantity T, as a common factor, can be omitted from
the second sum. We could also omit the variation ST from the
first sum; but it may be left under the sign of summation.

 can be done by heat in an alteration of the arrangement of a body
 is proportional to the absolute temperature, in conjunction with
 the assumption that the heat actually present in a body is dependent
 on its temperature only, and not on the arrangement of its consti
 tuents.      Therewith I considered the circumstance that in this
 way     we  could   arrive at the already otherwise proved equation a
 main support of that law.             Now the preceding analysis shows
 how that law, and with it the second axiom of the mechanical
 theory of heat, can be reduced to general mechanical principles.

                         acquainted with the geometrical freedom which
                 rigid body enjoys by ascertaining the character of all
 the displacements which the nature of the restraints will permit
 the body to accept.           If a displacement be infinitely small, it is
 produced by screwing the body along a certain screw.                 If a dis
 placement      have   finite   magnitude,   it is  produced by    an   infinite
 series of infinitely small screw displacements.             For  the  analysis
 of geometrical freedom we shall only consider infinitely small
 screw displacements.           This includes the initial stages of all dis
placements.
     To analyze the geometrical restraints of a rigid body we pro
ceed as follows.         Take any line in space.         Conceive this line to
be    the   axis about which screws are successively formed of every
pitch from — oo to + co .             (The pitch of a screw is the distance
its nut advances when turned through the angular unit.)                     We
endeavour successively to displace the body about each of these
screws, and record the particular screw or screws, if any, about
which the restraints have permitted the body to receive a dis
placement.         The same process is to be repeated for every other
line in space.        If it be found that the restraints have not per
mitted the body to receive any one of these displacements, then
the body is rigidly fixed in space.

   If, after all the screws have been tried, the body be found ca
pable of displacement about one screw only, the body possesses
the lowest degree of freedom.      If one screw (A) be discovered,
and, the trials being continued, a second screw (B) be found, the
remaining trials may be abridged by considering the information
which the discovery of two screws affords.
   The body may receive any displacement about one or both
of the two screws A and B. The composition of these displace
ments gives a resultant which could have been produced by dis
placement about a single screw. The locus of this single screw
is the conoidal cubic surface which has been called the " cylin-
droid " (at the suggestion of Professor Cay ley) . The equation of
the surface is

   The property of the surface is thus proved. Let Qv Qv 0a be
the angles of three screws upon the surface, and aij, a>3, caa be
the displacements about them.       Each of these displacements
may  be resolved into screw-displacements about the screws of x
and y.   The conditions necessary and sufficient for the displace
ments to neutralize each other are
                    <B,   sin 0, +    o>3

                    OJj COS #j    +   ft>2 COS #s      + <B3 COS #g = 0.
Thus     each rotation is proportional to the sine of the angle
between the other two screws.
   For the complete determination of the cylindroid and the
pitch of all its screws, we must have the quantities a and c.
These quantities, as well as the position of the cylindroid in
space, are completely determined when two screws of the system
are known.
    In the model of the cylindroid which is exhibited, the para
meter a is 2'6 inches.      The wires which correspond in the model
with the generating lines of the surface represent the axes of the
screws.      The distribution of pitch upon the generating lines is
shown by colouring a length of 2'6 x cos 20 inches upon each
wire.     The distinction between positive and negative pitches is
indicated by colouring the former red and the latter black.
This model is in the possession of the London Mathematical
Society, 22 Albemarle Street.
    It is remarkable that the addition of any constant           to all            (c)
the pitches attributed in the model to the screws does not affect
the fundamental property of the cylindroid.
   When     a  rigid body    found capable of being displaced about
                                 is
a  pair  of screws,   it necessarily capable of being displaced about
                           is
every screw on the cylindroid determined           that pair.   by
   The theorem of the cylindroid includes as particular cases the
well-known rules for the composition of two displacements pa
rallel to given lines, or of two small rotations about intersecting
axes.     If the parameter be zero, the cylindroid reduces to
                                      a                                                    a
plane,   and   the pitches of all the screws become equal.      If the
arbitrary    constant     which
                           (c)    expresses the pitch be infinite, we
have the theorem for displacements         and    the pitch be zero we

two displacements        concerned, the plane can only be regarded

as  a degraded form of the cylindroid, from which the most essen
tial feature has disappeared.

XXII.   On the steady Flow of a Liquid.     By HENRY MOSELEY,
   M.A., D.C.L.,    Canon of Bristol, F.R.S., Corresponding Mem
  ber of the Institute of France, fyc*
          hydraulic experiments of M. Darcy, continued after his
THEdeath      by M. Baziu, were made with remarkable industry
and scientific skill, and on a large scale.      In the first series f
circular pipes were used, and they were placed horizontally. In
           J
the second the channels were rectangular, open and closed, and
they were sloped.     The experiments of the first series, which are
those referred to in the following paper, were made with pipes
of different materials, in different states of roughness or smooth
ness of internal surface, and of different diameters, from ^ inch
to 20 inches.     Their lengths were generally 120 yards, but
some of them 60 yards ; and the water was made to traverse
them with velocities varying from 1 inch per second to 20 feet.
   All the necessary precautions were taken to determine the
mean diameters of these pipes, and to measure the water dis
charged from them.      To feed them, it was received from the re
servoirs  at Chaillot into a cylindrical vessel 28 metres high, in
which it could be made to stand at any required height by
opening more or less a cock in the supply-pipe. It passed from
the bottom of this reservoir by means of a horizontal pipe 300
metres long, into a great horizontal cylinder, 1 metre in dia
meter and 3^ metres long, to one end of which horizontal
cylinder were adjusted the pipes to be experimented upon. This
cylinder was crossed internally by an iron diaphragm pierced
with small holes, through which the water was made to pass that
its vis viva might (as far as possible) be destroyed before it en
tered the pipes experimented upon.      Pressure- gauges were fixed
at four different points of each pipe — the first being placed near
the end by which the water escaped from the pipe into the reser
voir of efflux, the second at 50 metres from      it,
                                                    the third at 100
metres from the first, the fourth near the point of entrance of
the water from the horizontal cylinder into the pipe at 4'7 me
tres from the third, and the fifth in the horizontal pipe.     They
were water-gauges.
   The first and third gauges being 100 metres apart, the differ
ence of the heights of the water in these gauges showed, when
the flow of the water had become steady, the head of water ne
cessary to overcome the resistances opposed to the flow of that
portion of the water in the pipe which intervened between these

two gauges.     This head of water is that designated in the fol
lowing paper by the symbol A.
    Besides determining the efflux under different conditions, M.
Darcy determined also the velocities of the water at different
distances from the axis of certain of the pipes on which he experi
mented ; and with reference to the theory of the flow of liquids,
this was the most interesting feature of his experiments.               He
effected it by means of the instrument well known as Pilot's tube,
into the construction and use of which he introduced some ad
mirable improvements, for the particulars of which the reader is
referred to his work.      The results he arrived at are stated at
length in Table I. of the following paper.
    A film in a liquid flowing through a pipe, in the sense in
which the word is used in the following paper, is a continuous
portion of the liquid, every molecule in which flows with the
same velocity.     A filament is an exceedingly narrow film. To
the surface of the pipe a film of the liquid is supposed to adhere
and to remain at rest.       The film adjacent to it moves over this
fixed film, the third over the second, the fourth over the third,
&c. with continually increasing velocities; the film nearer to
the surface moving always slower than that more remote.               This
is proved by the experiments of MM. Darcy and Bazin.
    The resistance opposed by the surface of the pipe to the flow
                                                ......
of the liquid immediately in contact with it is represented by the
formula
                                                                        (i)
where P is the resistance per unit of surface, V the velocity of
the flow,  \, a constant, and /i, a term as to which there is a dif
ference of opinion whether it is constant or increases with the
velocity.
    This formula is founded     on experiment*.      The first term in it
is considered to represent that part of the resistance which is
due to the adherence of the liquid to the surface of the pipe, and
which is of the nature of that which in solid bodies is opposed
to shearing.
    The second term is understood to represent the resistance
caused by the impacts of the molecules of the flowing liquid on
those of the film of liquid fixed to the surface of the pipe, and
on the eminences of the solid surface of the pipe which project
through that film.
    Let the steady flow of a liquid in a horizontal circular pipe of
uniform dimensions and roughness of surface be supposed to be
maintained by the pressure of the liquid in a reservoir whose
surface is always on the same level ; let

From this it follows that, however different the actual velocities
of the films may be by reason of differences iu the heads of water
and in the diameters and internal roughnesses of the pipes, their
relative velocities at equal distances from the axis are (in the
same        liquid) approximately the                     same.        Since moreover            (   — is

approximately independent of these differences in the heads of
water and the diameters and roughnesses of the pipes, it follows

per unit of surface to its being made to move over the film whose
radius is r + dr, Swift, represents the whole resistance to its being
so moved.     And since the distance it is moved over it in the unit

water is represented by (Zirrdr), the pressure constantly acting
to give motion to the film is (Z-rrrdr}wh.    But in the unit of

the expedients he adopted, the water was made to arrive at the
third pressure-gauge with its velocity already acquired, which
velocity was maintained in it against the resistance of the hori
zontal pipe up to the first gauge by a pressure which is repre
sented by the. difference A of the heights of the water in the
third and first gauges.          The additional head of water which

    This supposes the values of v and v0 to have been determined
 in that experiment with perfect accuracy.            That cannot, how
 ever, have been the case in any experiment.            Admirable as are
 the experiments of M. Darcy, and far surpassing any others in
 accuracy that have ever been attempted, the means used (the
 only ones perhaps possible) are in their nature defective.              He
 has applied corrections to his results ; but the authority of these
 is perhaps sometimes doubtful, and it is rather the general
 laws observable in the experiments than the precise results on
which reliance is to be placed.            On this point I will quote his
own words : — " Les quelques differences qui existent ne peuvent
etre attributes cju'a la difficulte d'obtenir plus de precision dans

    In the experiments of M. Darcy the lengths of the pipes
between the first and third gauges were 100 metres.             It is only
to this portion of each pipe that the velocities recorded in

    The velocity v of any film as represented by equation (12),
 and the efflux QB as represented by equation (17), are given in
 terms of the velocity VQ of the central filament, and can only be
 determined by these formulae when that velocity is known. The
 experiments of M. Darcy having made it known in certain cases,
 they serve to verify the theory as it regards the relation of the
 efflux per unit of time to the velocity of the central filament.
 If that velocity could be represented in terms of the head of
 water and the diameter and length and degree of roughness of
 the pipe, then the formula by which this was represented being
 substituted for t>0 in equation (12) would complete the inves
tigation.    I  propose to make it the subject of a future com
munication.
XXIII.      On a supposed new Integration of Differential Equations
       of the Second Order.       Bij Professor CAYLEY, F.R.S.*
 I    CANNOT        assent to the views taken by Professor
       his paper in the     July Number, " On
                                                              Challis in

 new Integration of Differential Equations of the Second Order
to some unsolved Problems in the Calculus of Variations."
    In any problem of the calculus of variations, where there are
two variables x, y, the condition for       a  maximum or minimum       is
obtained in the form
and if the problem involves no relation between &r and Sy, Pro
fessor Challis says that "we have with equal reason A=0 and
Ap = 0 ;" and. he goes on to argue that "it cannot be antece
dently affirmed that these arc identical equations ;" and further,
that " it is necessary to take account of results deducible from
them either separately or conjointly."
    I object to this statement ; it seems to me that in order that
A(Sy—pBx] may vanish, the only condition is A=0; we are
not concerned with the equation Ap=0, as such, at all.            But in
certain cases it happens      that p  is a multiplier of the differential
equation A = 0; viz. by writing this equation under the form
Ap = 0 we have an equation integrable per se, and which by its
integration gives the integral of the differential equation A=0.
    Professor Challis, taking the view that the two equations are
distinct from each other, considers (Problem II.) the following
               "
question : — Required the minimum surface generated by the
revolution of a line joining two given points in a plane passing

The equation Ap = Q is integrable per se; and its integral is
•
    /  --  g =c, or  say  y=c^\+p*,       being,  as is known, the dif
ferential equation of a catenary having its directrix          coincident
with the axis of revolution ; in fact the integral is
                                 J'+c'
      But there are difficulties as regards the application of this in
 tegral to the problem in hand ; and Professor Challis is led to
 consider that the solution of the problem " can be effected only
 by taking into account an independent integration of A = 0;"
 and this he proceeds to obtain by a method which "consists
 essentially in first finding, when it is possible, the evolute of the
 curve or curves of which A = 0 is the differential equation, and
 then employing the involutes thence derivable, which may be
 regarded as the solution of the equation, to satisfy, either by
 computation or by graphical construction, the given conditions
  of the problem." This is perfectly allowable ; but after the evo
  lute is obtained, we must take not any involute, but the proper
  involute of such evolute ; we thus have a solution of the differen
  tial equation A = 0, the same as is obtained by what Professor
  Challis considers to be the integration of the other equation
 Ap = 0. This seems to me obvious a priori; but            I will verify it
 in regard     to  the problem      in  hand.    Taking,  with   Professor
  Challis, x1, y1 as the coordinates of that point of the evolute which
 is the centre of curvature at the point of the involute whose co
 ordinates are x, y, and writing also c=2k (the equation in ques
 tion is obtained in his paper), the several equations obtained by
  him are in effect as follows : —

    Three years later, Mr. W. Ferrel, A.M., Assistant upon the
 American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanack, published (in
 vols. i. and ii. of the ' Mathematical Monthly') a series of'articles
 " On the Motions of Fluids and Solids relative to the Earth's
 Surface, comprising Applications to the Winds and the Currents
 of the Ocean." Mr. Ferrel begins by referring to a pamphlet
 which he published on the same subject a few years previ
 ously, and concludes by pointing out an important modifica
tion in one part of his theory as first published, a modifica
tion which he has seen it necessary to make after reading the
Report of Professor Thomson's paper in the British Association's
Proceedings.       Mr. FerreFs paper, as reprinted from the ' Mathe
matical Monthly/ occupies seventy-two pages, of which about
sixty are occupied with an elaborate mathematical investigation
of the distribution and motion of the atmosphere which would
result from the rotation of the earth combined with the heating
of the equatorial regions on the hypothesis of no friction.          In
the latter part of the paper the modifying effects of friction are
mentioned, and a theory of general atmospheric circulation, as
actually existing, is laid down in such language as to be intelli
gible to those who are not able or willing to follow the steps of
the mathematical investigation.
   Without discussing the question of priority,             I
                                                           may say that
the views advanced by Mr.          Ferrel   and  by Professor Thomson
are substantially the same, as far as they are comparable ; but
Mr. Ferrel's views are much more fully developed and applied.
   As the theory propounded by these two authors (which may
appropriately be called the centrifugal theory of atmospheric dis
tribution and circulation)       is,
                                  I believe, very little known among
meteorologists, I     think  Ishall be doing good service in calling
attention to   it, and in pointing out how some of the numerical
quantities involved may be calculated without the aid of the
higher analysis employed        Mr. Ferrel.
                                  by
   Since the first draft of the present paper was written,  letter    a
has appeared   from  Mr.  Ferrel     Nature' (July 20), in which
                                        in'
he calls attention to some of his principal results, and presents
some points rather more clearly than in his earlier publications.
that of George Hadley, who published     in the Phil. Trans, for 1/35 (vol.
                                             it
xxxix. p. 5S). Hadley appears to have been the first to point out the true
connexion between the earth's rotation and the easting of the trade-winds.
Halley, in 1C86 (Phil. Trans. No. 183), had indicated the existence of a
circulation of air between the polar and equatorial regions, due to differ
ence of temperature, but he erroneously attributed the easting of the trades
to the diurnal wave of heat which runs round the earth from east to west.

                  and Distribution of the Atmosphere.             201
     To prevent misconception, I should premise that the problem
 which the theory professes to solve is a broad one.     It professes
 to describe and account for the grand currents of atmospheric
 circulation over the earth's surface as a whole, and the distribu
 tion of the atmosphere in greater or less quantity over the dif
 ferent parallels of latitude, without taking account of local pecu
 liarities depending on the irregular distribution of land and
 water.     Their discussion constitutes a separate subject of very
 great importance ; but as it is easier to conquer difficulties sepa
 rately than combined, it seems reasonable to begin by neglect
 ing these local complications and treating the earth as a solid of
 revolution with a uniform surface, especially as we have, in
 large portions of the existing oceans, a good approximation to
 these hypothetical conditions, and an opportunity of comparing
 theory with observation.
     The actual state of things over these parts of the occau
 may be described by saying that : —
     I. As regards wind, there is an equatorial belt of calms, then,
 on each side of this, a belt some 20'J wide covered by the trade-
 winds, which blow from the east, and at the same time towards
 the equator, then another calm-belt near the tropic, and then a
 region, extending as far towards the poles as observations go,
 over which the prevailing winds are from the west and at the
 same time towards the pole.
     II. As regards quantity of air, the barometer is low in the
 equatorial calm-belt, from which it gradually rises across the
 trade-wind region to the tropical calm-belt, where the pressure
is greater than on any other part of the earth ; and from this
 latitude, as far as observations extend, there is a regular fall
towards a minimum at each pole, the pressures actually ob
 served in very high latitudes, especially near the South Pole,
 being very much lower than in any other part of the earth at
sea-level.
    The theory which I am advocating asserts that these two
sets of phenomena stand in the relation of cause and effect.        It
asserts that the distribution of barometric pressure (in other
words, the distribution of the air in greater or less quantity
over the different parallels of latitude) is thaiuly due to the
easterly and westerly components of the winds.
    It regards the surface of the earth as a surface of equili
brium under the joint action of gravity and the centrifugal
force of the earth's rotation. But in the case of a body moving
west or east relative to the earth's surface, this equilibrium
no longer exists, because the body has greater or less centri-s
ftigal force than would be required for equilibrium.            West
winds consist of air revolving faster than the earth, and there-

    202          Prof. J. D. Everett   on the General     Circulation
    fore having an excess of centrifugal force.            This excess caii be
    resolved into two components, one of which is vertically upwards,
    and produces an inappreciable diminution of barometric pressure
    under it. The other component is directed along the meridian
    towards the equator, and will produce a deflection towards the
    equator unless the air which lies on that side has greater elastic
    force than the air which lies on the polar side.           This component,
   like the vertical one, would be inappreciable if it only acted
   through a belt five miles wide ; but when the air over a zone
   many degrees wide has a mean motion from the west, the ac
   cumulated effect, in the shape of differential pressure at its two
   margins, is very considerable.
       These remarks respecting the excess of centrifugal force pos
   sessed by west winds, apply equally to the defect of centrifugal
   force in east winds, except that the pressure which they exert in
   virtue of their relative velocity is directed/rom the equator instead
   of towards it.
       Excess and defect of centrifugal force thus produce an increase
   of barometric pressure from the polar to the tropical limit of the
   region of west winds, and a similar increase from the equatorial
   to the tropical limit of the region of east winds.            That is to say,
   the effect due to centrifugal force is everywhere of the same kind
   as the observed difference*.
       As regards the causes of the east and west winds, the prime
   mover is the increase of temperature from the poles to the
   equator, which would of itself give a north wind over the whole
  of the northern hemisphere, and a south wind over the whole of
   the southern, at the earth's surface, with return-currents in the
  opposite directions above ; but in virtue of the earth's rotation,
  which is carrying all points of its surface from west to east with
  velocities proportional to their distances from the axis, a body
  set in motion along a meridian towards the equator will fall
  behind the meridian unless constantly subjected to differential
  pressure on its two sides ; and a body moving from the equator
  towards either pole tends, in like manner, to move in advance
  of the meridian along which it is travelling.               Most writers, in
      * It is
               necessary to*remark, by way of caution, that the effect in ques
  tion depends upon the movement of the whole body of air over a region,
  and not merely of the lower portion whose motion constitutes our observed
  winds.      If some strata arc moving to the east and others to the west, op
  posite signs must be given to eastward and westward velocities, and the
  average of the whole (not a height-average, but a mass-average) must be
  struck.     We assume that this average velocity is westward in the trade-
  wind regions and eastward in the temperate zones, thus agreeing with the
. observed winds.      Indeed the fact of a continual circulation of air between
  the polar and equatorial regions, seems to involve, as a result, that the in-
  tertropical parts of the earth's surface are revolving faster, and the other
  partg of the earth's surface slower than the atmosphere over them.

                 and Distribution    of llie Atmosphere.              203
treating of this subject, express themselves so as to convey the
idea that such a body tends to preserve its absolute eastward
velocity constant* ; but, as Mr. Ferrel has remarked, this is an
understatement of the fact ; it is not velocity, but moment of
momentum that tends to remain constant, and absolute eastward
velocity tends to vary inversely as distance from axis.
    The easting of the trade-winds is thus clearly accounted for.
But the principles thus far adduced would give us in the northern
hemisphere only north-west and north-east winds at the surface
of the earth, with return-currents from the south above. How is
the prevalence of south-west winds at the surface of the earth in
the north temperate zone, and of north-west winds in the south
temperate zone, to be accounted for ? The account which I be
 lieve to be correct, and which in its essential features is due to
 Professor Jarncs Thomson, is as follows : —
    If any stratum of air have less than the average eastward or
 westward velocity (relative to the earth) which prevails through
                       it,
 the strata above      itwill not be able to resist the differential
 pressure from or towards the equator which their motion pro
 duces.    For this reason the lowest stratum of air, having its
 velocity relative to the earth kept down               by
                                                 friction, generally
 moves from the tropical belts of high barometer to the regions
 of low barometer at the poles and equator. This           the origin
                                                             is
 of the prevalent winds of the two temperate zones, which must
  be regarded as constituting   under-currents towards the poles,
 beneath  a  topmost current, also towards the pole, and      middle
                                                                  a
 return-current.
     Between the tropics, on the other hand, the motion thus ge
  nerated in the lowest stratum of air coincides with the motion
  due to difference of temperature    this
                                         ;    probably the reason
                                                   is
 why the trade-winds are more constant than the winds of the
temperate zones.
   The casting of winds blowing towards the equator, and the
westing of winds blowing towards the pole, may be summed up
in the rule that the wind tends to swerve to its right in the
northern hemisphere and to its left in the southern          :that    to
                                                                      is
say, in the northern hemisphere,        not constrained
                                         if                   by
                                                               differen
tial pressure,    will blow along curve concave to its right hand
                 it                  a                                     ;
and  ifit    not allowed thus to swerve, but constrained to keep
            is
a  direct course,    exerts greater pressure against the air on its
                      it
right  hand  than  against the air on its left.     But this tendency
is not peculiar to air which    is moving in     northward or south
                                                   a
ward direction.     We have already pointed out that air which             is
moving from west to east over the earth possesses an excess of
centrifugal force, in virtue of which        tends to deviate towards
                                              it
            * This mistake occurs in

  the equator, while air moving from east to west, relative to the
  earth, tends to travel towards the nearest pole, so that in both
  these cases the tendency is to the right in the northern hemi
  sphere and to the left in the southern.      Moreover calculation
  shows that if the velocity of the wind be small relatively to the
  absolute rotational velocity of the earth's surface in the neigh
  bourhood, the force necessary to prevent deflection has the same
  amount in the case of motion along a parallel of latitude, as in
  the case of motion along a meridian.      Nor is it important, in
  this respect, to distinguish between motion along a parallel of
 latitude and motion east or west along an arc of a great circle;
 for the deflection due to excess or defect of centrifugal force                 is,
 in ordinary cases, more than       hundred times greater than the.
                                           a
 deflection from one of these paths into the other.       For motion
 along  a  great circle in any horizontal direction, the intensity of
 the force necessary to prevent deflection      rigorously the same

     The application of these principles to the explanation of
  cyclones will be at once apparent to those who are familiar with
  Taylor's explanation as adopted                by
                                               Uove, Hcrschel, and other
 eminent authorities, an explanation founded on the tendency of
 north and south winds to be deflected in the northern hemi
 sphere to their right and in the southern to their left.              The fact
 is, that winds from all points of the compass, flowing in to                    a
 centre of barometric depression, experience this tendency to de
 flection, and the tendency          the same for them all.
                                     is                                Accord
 ingly,  what   actually  occurs       an
                                        is  inflow  from    all  sides  not     di
 rectly but spirally     or,
                           ;  to put the   same   fact     otherinwords,  there
is  inflow towards the centre compounded            with   rotation   round  it.
 The rotation    is produced and maintained                 by
                                                         the pressure which
 the inflowing components exert each to its own right; and the
 central depression       maintained
                           is                 the pressure which the ro

law, which is a mere summary of observed facts, is stated in the
following words in Mr. Buchan's recently published text-book.
   " The wind neither blows round the centre of least pressure
as circles, or as tangents to the concentric isobaric curves, nor
does it blow directly towards that centre ; but it takes a di
rection intermediate, approaching, however, more nearly to the
direction and course of the circular curves than of the radii to
the centre ; or the angle is not a right angle, but from about
60° to 80°."
  Dove's law of rotation of wind-direction at any one place (viz.
that it changes from north to north-east, then to east, and so round
with the hands of a watch in the northern hemisphere, and in the
opposite direction in the southern) is probably an indirect con
sequence of the same tendency to deviate to the right in the one
hemisphere and to the left in the other; but Dove's law is not
a law in any strict sense of the word, it is merely a statement of
what happens in a majority of instances.
   The quantitative determination of the forces dealt with in the
present paper maybe obtained as follows; and it is important to
bear in mind that they require no correction for friction.

  XXV.      Account   of Experiments upon the Resistance of Air to the
      Motion of Vortex-rings.       By ROBERT STAWELI, BALL, A.M.,
      Professor of Applied Mathematics and Mechanism, Royal Col~
      lege of Science for Ireland, Dublin*.
             experiments, of which the following is an abstract, were
  THEcarried        out with the aid of a grant from the Royal Irish
  Academy.       A  paper containing the results has been laid before
  the Academy.        A brief account of one series of the experiments
  and a Table embodying them will be given.
      Air-rings 9 inches in diameter were projected from a cubical
  box, each edge of which is 2 feetf.        The blows were delivered
  by means of a pendulum called the striker, which, falling from
  a constant height, ensured that the rings were projected with a
  constant velocity.      In the experiments described in the present
  series,  this velocity was a little over 10 feet per second. The pen
  dulum was arranged so as to open a circuit at the instant of its
 release.
     After the ring had traversed a range which varied from 2
  inches to 20 feet, it impinged upon a target.           The blow upon
 the target closed the circuit, which had been opened at the release
 of the striker. A chronoscope measured the interval of time
 between the release of the striker and the impact upon the target.
     The target was placed successively at distances of 2, 4, 6, 8,
 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 feet from the orifice of the box.           Not less
 than ten observations of the time were taken at each range. The
probable error of the mean time at each range is in every case
 less than 1 per cent, of the whole amount.           A special series of

the velocity of the ring at its different points is approximately
found.
   A second projection is made in which the abscissae are the
ranges and the ordinates are the velocities ; the points thus de
termined are approximately in a straight line.
    It follows that the rings are retarded as if acted upon by a
force proportional to the velocity, and an approximate value of
the numerical coefficient becomes known.
    A more accurate value having been determined by the method
of least squares, the results are embodied in the following Table,
of which a description is first given.
    I. contains a series of numbers for convenience of reference.
    II. It was found that the motion of the ring in the immediate
vicinity of the box was influenced by some disturbing element.
The zero of range was therefore taken at a point 4 feet distant
from the orifice.     This column contains the ranges.
   III.   The interval between the release of the striker and the
arrival of the ring at a point 4 feet from the orifice is 6'5 chro-
noscopic units, or about 0'93 second. This constant must be
subtracted from the mean readings of the time in order to reduce
the zero epoch to the instant when the ring is 4 feet from the
orifice.    This column contains the mean readings of the chro-
noscope    corrected  by this amount.
   IV. When the ranges are taken as abscissa? and the corre
sponding times as ordinates, it is found that a curve can be
drawn through or near all the points thus produced.        To iden
tify the points with the curve, small corrections are in some cases
required.      These corrections are shown in column IV.          In
the case of No. 5 the correction amounts to O7. This is about
O09 second.       The magnitude of this error appears to show that
some derangement, owing perhaps to a current of air or other
source of irregularity, has vitiated this result.   For the sake of
uniformity, however, the corrected value has been retained.
   V. This column merely contains the corrected means, as read
off upon the curve determined by the points.
   VI. The value of the chronoscope unit after the first few revo
lutions is
                            0-1288 second,
with a probable error of 0-0002 second.
   By means of this factor the corrected means in column V. are
evaluated in seconds in column VI. •
   VII. This column contains the time calculated on the hypo
thesis that the rings are retarded as if acted upon by a force
proportional to the velocity, the coefficients being determined by
the method of least squares ; the formula is

XXVI.       On the Action of Magnetism on Gases traversed by Elec
    tric Discharges.    By MM. A. DE LA RIVE and E. SARASIN*.
            of us (M. de la Rive) has been for a long time occu
ONEpied         with the action of magnetism on the electric jets
which are propagated in very rarefied gaseous media. In his last
researches, which appeared in theArchives des Sciences Physiques^,
M. de la Rive showed that the action of magnetism determines
a considerable increase of the resistance to electric conduction —
an increase which varies according to the portion of the jet sub
mitted to the action of the electromagnet, and according to the
position of the tube traversed by the discharge relatively to the
magnetic poles.
    M. de la Rive has also studied in detail the rotation effects pro
duced by the action of one magnetic pole on the electric jets in
various much rarefied gaseous media.          He has described the dif
ferences of velocity which result from the greater or less degree
of rarefaction of the medium and from its greater or less con
ductivity, dwelling particularly on the curious appearance pre
sented by the electric jet in a medium containing a rather consi
derable proportion of aqueous or alcoholic vapour — which con
sists in the jet being divided into several, forming as it were the
spokes of a wheel, and which never takes place at any degree of
rarefaction in gaseous media which contain no vapour.
    At the end of his work M. de la Rive intimated that there
were still many points in this interesting subject which it was
important to elucidate.        This is the study which we have under
taken together, and the results of which we now communicate
to the Society.
    The first point we had to ascertain was, whether, when an
electric jet traverses a rarefied gaseous medium, the influence of
the magnetism determines a change of density, probably an in
crease, in the portion of the gas submitted to the action of the
magnet.
    We next sought to determine the influence of magnetism ou
 the electric conductivity of the rarefied gases traversed by the
 discharge when this is effected in a direction perpendicular to
 the line joining the poles of the electromagnet — that is to say,
 equatorially.
     Then   we studied this influence in a case     in which it had not
 been previously studied, viz. when th.e discharge is effected axially,
 or along the line which joins the two poles.

212       MM. A.   de la Rive and E. Sarasin    on the  Action of
   Finally we examined in the same connexion a third case, in
which the electric jet is caused to rotate continuously under the
action of an electromagnet arranged for that purpose within the
rarefied gaseous medium.
   As our aim was not to search out for each gas the numerical
coefficients relative to those different kinds of action, but only to
determine the general laws of the phenomena with which we are
engaged, we have limited our operations to three gases very dif
ferent in their physical and chemical properties, viz. atmospheric
air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid.
   I.  Influence of Magnetism    on the  Density of the rarefied Gas
                 traversed by the Electric Discharge.
   When the electric jet transmitted through a rarefied gas in a
tube is submitted to the action of magnetism, the jet, tending,
as Pliicker has shown, to describe a magnetic curve, bears towards
the sides of the tube (which just prevent it from describing ex
actly the curve), and that to one side or the other, according to
the relative direction of the magnetism and of the electric cur
rent. At the same time the jet, which spreads itself out more
or less in the tube according to the density of the gas, seems to
contract to a tolerably thin thread.       One is therefore disposed
to believe that the gas itself is condensed under the action of the
electromagnet, and that perhaps this is the cause to which is due
the greater resistance it then offers to electric conduction ; conse
quently we thought we ought to commence our work by endea
vouring to ascertain if this condensation really takes place.
   From the first trials we made, by putting the tube traversed
by the electric discharge under the action of magnetism into
communication with a very sensitive manometer, we recognized
that the apparent condensation of the electric jet is accompanied
by an augmentation of the elastic force of the gas ; and this fact
is observed with the greatest facility. When the induction-
current is passed through a tube filled with any gas brought &
a certain degree of rarefaction, and communicating with the ma
nometer, the latter indicates a very notable increase of pressure
at the moment the discharge begins to pass.           This increase of
pressure evidently    results from   the  heating  of  the gas. When
the tube, continuously traversed by the electric discharge, is
afterwards submitted to the action of magnetism, the pressure in
the tube is seen to diminish, but never returns quite to what it
was before the passage of the current.        Under the action of the
magnetization, then, the elastic force of the gas traversed by the
electric discharge has been sensibly diminished, though without
returning to what it was before the passage of the current. This
diminution must be due, at least in part, to the weakening of
the current, which from that time must produce less heating.

       Magnetism on Gases traversed by Electric Discharges.            213
     In order to study this special point more closely, we made
 use of a large glass tube with two compartments divided the one
 from the other by a stopcock, also of glass, with a large opening.
 The length of this tube is 51 centimetres, its diameter 65 milli
 metres, the length of each of the two compartments 225 millims.;
they are joined together by a tubulure 60 millims. long., 10 mil-
 lims. in diameter; and the opening of the glass stopcock has the
 same section as the latter.      The stopcock, working with perfect
 smoothness, closes hermetically.          The tube carries at its two
extremities brass mountings, with stopcocks and knobbed elec
 trodes, also of brass.      The distance from one electrode to the
other is 41 centims.       The tube is placed transversely between
the two poles of the electromagnet in such a manner that the
centre of one of the compartments is on the axis of the magnet,
while the other is completely withdrawn from the action of the
magnetism.       The electromagnet used in these experiments was
that described by M. de la Rive in his memoir on the magnetic
rotatory polarization of liquids*.           We usually magnetized it
with the current produced by 40 Bunsen couples.              In order that
the magnetic action might be as intense as possible on one of
the two moieties of the electric discharge, the two poles of the
electromagnet were brought into immediate contact with the
 sides of that compartment of the glass tube which was to be
 submitted to its action.       This compartment was put in commu
nication, by means of a small leaden tube, with a very sensitive
manometer, consisting of a double barometer and a cathetometer
which permitted the estimation of hundredths of a millimetre.
The other compartment was connected by a system of leaden
tubes with an ordinary air-pump, a mercurial air-pump, and an
apparatus for introducing and desiccating the gases.               The in
duced current was furnished by a Ruhmkorff coil of medium
size excited by the current of a Grove pile of four pairs.
  . 'In making    the experiment, we commenced by producing a
vacuum throughout the apparatus, then introduced the gas which
was to be operated on, again exhausted the apparatus, reintro-
duced the gas, repeating the process several times, till the con
tained gas was sufficiently pure; the gas in the tube was then
brought to a well-determined pressure, which could be easily
done, within 5 or 10 hundredths of a millimetre, either with the
mercurial pump, or with the ordinary air-pump, by suitably re
gulating the working of the stopcocks.
     Communication with the lead pipes being closed, the level of
the mercury is taken very exactly; then the cock which regu
lates the communication between the glass tube and the mano-

214     MM. A.    de la Rive and   E. Sarasin   on the    Action of
meter is closed, the electromagnet magnetized, and the current
passed.    In the compartment which is placed between the two
magnetic poles the luminous jet is very much condensed and
driven against the side of the tube.       In the other compartment
scarcely  any   effect is apparent, except  the diminution of bright
ness resulting from the considerable augmentation of resistance
produced in the compartment submitted to magnetization, and
consequently the diminution of the intensity of the discharge.
The magnetism is permitted to act during from 10 to 20 se
conds; then the large glass cock is closed, while the current is
still propagating;      at the same moment the interrupter of the
Ruhmkorff is turned, and thus the current is stopped.           Finally,
the manometer is observed while the cock which separates the
first compartment from the manometer is opened and then the
large glass cock.        By operating thus it is found that the gas
contained in the compartment on which the magnet has acted
presents a very sensible increase of pressure, while in the other
an equivalent partial vacuum has been produced.           By observing
the manometer, a great oscillation is seen to be produced there
 the moment the cock is opened which puts it in communication
with the compartment on which the magnet has acted ; the level
 of the mercury falls several hundredths of a millimetre.         Then,
 when we open the glass cock (which puts the second compart
 ment in communication with the first and with the manometer),
 we observe a second oscillation, in direction opposite to the first;
 and when the motion of the mercury has ceased, we see that its
 level has returned exactly to what it was before the experiment.
 Thus, then, under the action of the magnetism, a certain quan
 tity of gas has passed from the compartment which is outside of
 that action into that which was submitted to       it, and has conse
 quently increased the density of the gas contained therein.
     This effect, of course, varies with the force of the magnet, with
 the intensity of the induced current, and the initial pressure of
 the gas operated on.     It   evidently increases with the intensity
 of the magnetism and with that of the discharge           ;   increases
                                                               it
 also very notably with the initial density of the gas, provided the
  discharge is   strong enough for its intensity not to be too much
 weakened    by   this augmentation of density.      For  a given inten
 sity of the current of the induction-coil, and     a   determined dis
 tance of the electrodes, there   is,  then, for each gas   apressure at
  which the effect observed  is  the maximum.       This pressure     the
                                                                      is
  lowest for air (the worst1 conductor of the three gases on which
  we operated), high for carbonic acid, and higher still for               hy
  drogen.    For example, in the large tube with the. glass cock,
  and with the Ruhmkorff of medium 'size, the three pressures
  corresponding to the maximum effect were 7-8 millims. for air,

       Magnetism on Gases traversed by Electric Discharges.           215
10-12 millims. for carbonic acid, and         15 millims. for hydrogen.
A  very great     number     of  experiments have shown us that the
condensation is the greatest with air, sensibly less with carbonic
acid, and very slight with hydrogen.            With the medium-sized
Iluhmkorff coil, we obtained for the variation of the elastic
force, having for the three gases the same initial pressure of 8
millims. :—

       0-12 and 0-16           0'08 and 0-12       0'02 and 0'04.
    It was needless, as may be seen, to reduce the current to the
same intensity     in each case, as we had done at first; for even
when this is not done the order in which the gases range them
selves does not change ; and the result is then so much the more
significant, because the intensity of the current, greater in car
bonic acid and hydrogen than in air, ought on the contrary, if it
disturbed the experiments, to invert the order of the three gases.
    Although the numerous experiments made under these condi
tions left no doubt of the effect, variable from one gas to the
other, which magnetism exerts on a rarefied medium traversed
by the electric discharge, we desired to resume the experiments,
and to repeat them with a very powerful Iluhmkorff coil, which
permitted us to work with much higher pressures by having a
stronger current, and to obtain thereby even much more pro

     These numbers refer to the case in which the compartment
 containing the negative electrode is placed between the two poles
 of the magnet, the other being placed outside of its action. Our
 experiments snowed that the effect is much less in the inverse
 case.     When the magnet acted on the positive part of the jet,
 we obtained for that variation of pressure with air, at 20 millinir.,
 0-16-0-18 millim. instead of 0'32 millim.
     It results, then, from these experiments that the action of
 magnetism sensibly increases the density of a gaseous medium
 traversed by the electric discharge in that portion of the medium

216         MM. A.    de la Rive and   E. Sarasin   on the  Action of
 on which the action is exerted.         This effect varies according to
 the different gases : it is so much the greater as the electric con-
 ducting-power of the gas is less.         It varies also according to the
 portion of the jet submitted to the action of the magnet, being
 a maximum when the magnet acts on the negative portion.
      We confine ourselves for the present to stating the fact, with
 out venturing as yet to give the interpretation of it.              It may
 proceed     either from   a real condensation   of the gaseous   molecules
 effected by the magnetism, or from a difference of temperature
 between the part of the jet which is submitted to the magnetic
 action and that which is not, or from both causes combined.
 We purpose to resume the examination of this question in the
 study which we intend to make of the influence of magnetism
 on the calorific effects produced by the passage of the electric
 discharge through rarefied gases.
 II.    Action of Magnetism on the Conductivity of Rarefed Gases
      when the Electric Discharge is directed transversely to the line
      which joins the poles of the electromagnet, or Equatorially.
      In order to study the influence of magnetism on the resistance
 opposed by a rarefied gas to the transmission of the electric dis
 charge when this takes place in a direction perpendicular to the
 line of the poles of the electromagnet, we used a cylindrical glass
 tube of which the dimensions were such that the electric jet was
 submitted in its whole length to the intense action of the mag
 netism.       This tube was 20 centims. long, and 35 millims. in
 diameter; at each extremity it had a brass mounting with a
 stopcock and a knobbed electrode, also of brass.             The distance
 between the two electrodes was equal to the diameter of the soft
 iron of the electromagnet, viz. 9 centims.             This cylinder was
 arranged like the large tube with glass stopcock in the preceding
 experiment, and communicated by lead pipes, at one end with
 the manometer, and at the other with the air-pump.
      That we might be able to institute a comparison between the
 three gases on which we wished to operate, it was necessary to
 reduce them all to the same pressure, and pass through them a
 current of the same intensity.         But as it was not easy to place
 a rheostat in the induced circuit, we thought of varying the in
 tensity of the inducing current by introducing a wire of German
silver 6f greater or less length.        The induced current traversing
the rarefied gas was measured by means of a very sensitive gal-
          iiter* and the apparatus described by M. de la Rive in his
reseai\!ef!s on the electric discharge in rarefied gasesf.            Lastly,
    *
       This galvanometer was placed in an adjoining room, at a sufficient dis
tance from the etefromagrict to preclude its needle being influenced by it.

      Magnetism on Gases traversed by Electric Discharges.        217
as  the gaseous column on which we operated was very short and
 not sufficient, especially in the case of hydrogen, to eliminate the
 induced current of feeble tension given by the Ruhmkorff coil at
 the same time as the current of strong tension, in the opposite
 direction, which was used in the experiment, we introduced into
 the induced circuit a cylindrical Geissler tube of 49 centims.
 length, 30 millims. diameter, and containing rarefied hydrogen.
    To measure the influence of magnetism on the electric conduc
 tivity of a rarefied gas traversed by the induction-current,       we
 reduced each of the gases operated on to a given pressure, the
 same for all three ; then we regulated the intensity of the indu
 cing current in such manner as to have always, in each series of
 experiments, the same intensity of the induced current.      Having
 thus, at the commencement of each experiment, placed the gas
 in identical initial conditions, we magnetized ; then we sought
 the degree of rarefaction to which it was necessary to reduce it
 in order that, under the action of the magnetism, the intensity
 of the traversing current might become the same as before the
 magnetization.      This method is more delicate than that which
 would consist simply in measuring the diminution produced in
 the deflection of the galvanometer when the rarefied gas is sub
 mitted to the action of magnetism.       That deflection may, in fact,
 under the action of magnetism, be reduced from 60° or more to
 a very slight one — from 6° to 8°, for example, and even less,
 about the value of which it is very easy to make a mistake.
There   is, besides,a   great advantage in varying the pressure, of
 which a   very precise measurement can be obtained — rather than
 the intensity, which cannot be accurately measured by the de
flections of the galvanometer-needle, to which     it   isnot propor
 tional when they exceed 30°.
    We commenced the experiment          by
                                          making a   vacuum through
out the system  ;    then we introduced dry and pure the gas to be
operated on, exhausted again, reiutroduced the gas, and repeated
this two or three times in succession, so as to expel foreign gases.
By afterwards suitably regulating the cocks of the air-pump, we
succeeded in making its action perfectly regular, and thus ob
tained, very exactly, the degree of rarefaction desired (30 mil
lims. for example).      The moment this pressure was reached, the
cock of the glass tube was closed then the intensity of the in
                                     ;
ducing current was regulated so as to obtain the required deflec
tion of the galvanometer.      This being done, we magnetized, and
gradually exhausted the tube until the galvanometer-deflection
had returned to. exactly what   it   was before. We then again in
terrupted   the  communication    of  the glass tube with the pump,
verified again that the induced current had really resumed pre
cisely its initial intensity, and, lastly, took the reading of the

218        MM. A.        de la Rive and    E. Sarasin     on the    Action of
manometer, which during the whole experiment had remained
in communication with the glass tube.
    After repeating these experiments a few times, one can make
them with great rapidity and yet obtain, for the same gas in the
same conditions, almost absolutely concordant results.
    We executed several series of comparative experiments with
air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid, at pressures of 20, 30, and 40
millims. We limit ourselves to giving the results of some; all,
however, were perfectly concordant with one another.

    From this Table is seen how the influence of magnetism on
the electric conductivity of a gas traversed by the induction-
current varies from one gas to the other.                     The numbers just
given show that magnetism diminishes the electric conductivity
of hydrogen much more than that of air ; yet the apparent con
traction of the jet under the action of magnetism is much less in
hydrogen than in air.            This at once makes it evident that the
condensation of the jet is not the sole cause of the augmentation
of resistance, and that probably it is not even the preponderant
cause.

     From these multiplied experiments we may therefore conclude
 that the increase of resistance which results for a gas from the
 action of magnetism is as much greater as the electric conduct-
 ing-power of the gas is greater.            In fact we have seen that it is
 greatest for hydrogen, the conducting-power                  of which is very
 great — less for carbonic acid, which is sensibly less conductive —
  and least for atmospheric air, which presents a much greater re
  sistance than the two preceding gases.               As we have already re
 marked, the compressibility appears to play only a very secondary
  part, if any, in this class of phenomena.
 III.    Action of Magnetism on the Electric Jet when this is directed
        along the line which joins the magnetic poles, or Axially.
     The action of magnetism on the electric jet varies, of course,
  much with the position occupied by the jet relative to the poles
  of the electromagnet.           Divers physicists have occupied them
  selves with this subject, and in their researches have considered
  the most varied cases ; but we do not think that the simple case
  which forms the subject of this section, and, as we shall see, is
  very interesting, has yet been particularly studied.
      It was necessary that the two ends of the tube through which
  we transmitted the electric discharge should be capable of being
  introduced into the cylindrical opening in the two pieces of soft
  iron of the electromagnet.          Therefore the apparatus we used in
  this series of experiments consisted of a narrow glass tube, 22

 220       MM. A.     de la Rive and E. Sarasin     on the Action of
  millims. in internal diameter, and 40 centims. long ; the jet had
 a  length of 20 centims.      To the two extremities of this tube were
 cemented the two electrodes, each formed of a brass rod ending
 in a knob, likewise of brass.       One of these electrodes extended
 externally in a long brass     stem   ending at the extremity of the
 opening in the soft iron, the other in a lead pipe very narrow
 and flexible, which, passing through the opening in the second
 soft iron, put the glass tube in communication with the mano
 meter and the air-pump.         The effect of magnetism on the elec
 tric discharge thus arranged axially varies with the distance of
 the poles of the magnet. With our apparatus, the most favour
 able case appeared to be that in which we had a fixed distance of
 10 centims. between the two poles, which distance we maintained
 throughout our experiments.          The effect of magnetism on the
 resistance of the rarefied gas contained in the axial tube, as well
 as on the appearance of the electric jet, varies likewise with the
 position occupied by the electrodes in relation to the magnetic
 poles; the action of magnetism on the resistance reaches its
 maximum when the knob serving as the negative electrode is in
 the middle of the interval separating the magnetic poles.           The
 influence of magnetism on the axial discharge is very feeble at
pressures above 2 millims.         Nevertheless, even in this case the
 magnetization sensibly modifies the appearance of the jet : having
 been discontinuous       and striated, it becomes much more conti
 nuous; still it is not possible as yet to verify an appreciable change
 in the resistance.     From 2 millims. the effect is much more pro
nounced ; and here we must distinguish two principal positions
of the electrodes in the tube.
     1st position. The negative electrode is placed in the centre of
the interval separating the magnetic poles. When the gas is
brought to a pressure below 2 millims., the moment we magne
tize, a complete modification in the appearance of the discharge
is observed.       The extremity of the positive jet lengthens into a
dart which applies itself to the side of the tube, approaching
more and more to the negative electrode, and ends, at the lowest
pressures we have been able to attain, by passing between the
tube and the negative knob to unite behind it with a blue sheath
which has replaced the negative aureole.           The change produced
in the resistance is still more remarkable than the modification
in the appearance of the jet : indeed, in this case, contrary to
what would take place with the transverse discharge, the electric
conductivity of the gas traversed by the electric jet is increased
under the influence of magnetism.             At 1 millim. pressure, for
example,     while  the galvanometer     placed  in the derived current
gave    a deflection of 30°  when  the  electromagnet was not in action,
it marked 35° after the magnetization in the case of air, 38° in

       Magnetism on Gases traversed by Electric Discharges.                       221
the case of carbonic acid, and 40° in the case of hydrogen.        We
see by this that the electric conductivity of the rarefied gas con
tained in the axial tube is notably augmented by the magneti
zing.     At the same time we ascertain that the effect is not the
same in the different gases : it is maximum in hydrogen, mini
mum in air; the order of the three gases is the same here as in
the experiments with the .transverse discharge.         The less the
pressure, the more marked is the effect ; at ^ millim. pressure
we have seen the deflection of the galvanometer pass, in conse
quence of the magnetizing, from 15° to 26° with air, to 30° with
carbonic acid, and to 38° with hydrogen : it is seen that the in
tensity of the current was more than doubled in hydrogen.
     2nd position. The negative electrode is in the immediate vici
nity of one of the magnetic poles. The modification induced in
this case in the appearance of the electric jet is much more re
markable than in the preceding.       In proportion as the pressure
diminishes below 2 millims., the luminous envelope which sur
rounded the negative electrode lengthens more and more, inva
ding the dark space ; at the lowest pressures we have been able
to attain, the negative part of the jet formed at last a very elon
gated frustum of a cone, filling the whole interval between the
two electrodes, the positive part having been driven back into the
interior of the soft-iron cylinder.     In this position of the tube
the increase observed in the conductivity of the rarefied gas is a
 little less than that obtained in the first position.      By slowly
 moving the tube, it may be made to take all the positions be
 tween the two on which we have particularly dwelt.           Starting
 from the second position, we see the negative luminous cone
 shorten more and more, then give place to the positive dart,
 which advances as far as behind the negative electrode.           The
 direction of the magnetization has no influence, either on the
 increase of conductivity or on the appearance of the electric jet.
     M. de la Rive had already, in his study on the same subject
  (cited at the beginning of our memoir), described a special case
 in which the action of magnetism appeared to him to increase the
 electric conductivity of the gas instead of diminishing it : it was
 where the discharge was transmitted through a spiral tube placed
 in a peculiar manner between the poles of the electromagnet ;
 but he did not dwell on      it,
                              reserving the study of      for   future
                                                                   it     a

 IV.   The Action    Magnetism on the Electric Jet when this
                     of                                                          is   ro
       tated continuously round the pole             of
                                         the Electromagnet.
     The rotatory movement of the jet may either be performed                          in
a   plane perpendicular to the axis of the electromagnet which

222         On the Action   of Magnetism     on electrified Gases.
produces the rotation (which takes place when the spark strikes
between a metallic ring perpendicular to the axis of the magnet
and an electrode placed in its centre in the continuation of that
axis*), or take place vertically round the axis of a small cylinder
of soft iron magnetized by contact with one of the poles of the
electromagnet, and of which the extremity constituted one of the
electrodes.
    In the first case there is no sensible variation of conductivity
in the gas when the jet is put in movement by the action of
magnetism ; the conductivity remains exactly what it was when
the jet was not under the influence of the magnet and conse
quently was at rest. It is the same when, aqueous or alcoholic
vapour being introduced into the rarefied gas, under the mag
netic influence the jet, previously single, is divided into several
resembling the spokes of a wheel.
    With aqueous vapour the medium at the same degree of ten
sion is more conductive than the dry gas ; with the vapour of
alcohol it is less so, in the same conditions ; but with neither of
these two vapours, any more than with the dry gas, does the
magnetism, when it determines the rotation of the jet, influence
the electric conductivity.
    It is quite different when the jet describes round the rod of
magnetized soft iron a cylinder whose axis is that of the rod. In
this case there is a very sensible increase of resistance to the elec
 tric conduction when the jet, instead of being motionless, rotates
 from the effect of the magnetism.          But this increase is sensibly
 greater   when  it is positive electricity that issues from the apex
of the soft iron than when it is negative.          Thus in the first case
we have seen the deflection of the galvanometer diminish from
 65° to 45°, while in the second case it diminished only from 65°
 to 55°.    Let us remark that in the case in which the diminution
 of conductivity is the greatest the rotation of the jet seems to
 be effected with more difficulty, in the same conditions of inten
 sity of the electric discharge, intensity of magnetism, and rarefac
 tion of the gaseous medium, which is simply atmospheric air at
4 millims. pressure : not only is the rotation much less rapid, but
 the jet itself, instead of remaining vertical, takes during its rota
 tion an inclined position; this is observed to a curtain degree in
 the other case, but is much more pronounced in that in which
 the conductivity is most diminished.
     It would therefore seem that this diminution of conductivity
 corresponds to the constrained position which the electric jet is
 forced to take under the influence of the magnetizing in the case
 in which it is naturally vertical ; whereas, when it is naturally

horizontal and turns in the      same direction as the hands of a watch,
the magnetism merely impresses on it a continuous movement
of rotation, without making any alteration in its form, its direc
tion, or its appearance.
                                Conclusions.
    It follows   from the experiments described in this memoir: —
    1.  That the action of magnetism, when it is exerted only on
a portion of an electric jet transmitted         through a rarefied gas,
determines in that portion an increase of density.
    2. That the same action, when it is exerted on an electric jet
placed equatorially between the poles of an electromagnet, pro
duces in the rarefied gas in whicli it is propagated an increase of
resistance which is as much greater as the gas itself is more
conductive.
    3. That this action, on the contrary, determines a diminution
of resistance when the jet is directed axially between the two
magnetic poles, this diminution being as much greater as the
gas is more conductive.
    4. That when the action of the magnetism consists in im
pressing a continuous movement of rotation on the electric jet,
it has no influence on the resistance to conduction, if the rota
tion is effected in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the mag
netized soft-iron cylinder which determines the rotation j while
it notably diminishes it if the rotation takes place so that the
electric jet describes a cylinder round the axis of the rod.
    5. That these different effects apparently cannot be attributed
to variations of density produced in the gaseous medium by the
magnetic action, but very probably their explanation will be
found in the perturbation induced by that action in the arrange
ment (or disposition of the particles of the rarefied gas) neces
sary for the propagation of electricity.

 in 1864, we gave the results of our observations of the spectra of the
 planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn ; but we found the light
 from Uranus and Neptune too faint to be satisfactorily examined with
 the spectroscope.
    By means of the equatorial refractor of 1 5 inches aperture, by
 Messrs. Grnbb and Son, recently placed in my hands by the Royal
 Society, I have succeeded in making the observations described in
 this paper of the remarkable spectrum which is afforded by the light
 of the planet Uranus.
    It should be stated that the spectrum of Uranus was observed by
 Father Secchi in 1869*.      He says, " le jaune y fait compldtement
 defaut.   Dans le vert et dans le bleu il y a deux raies tres-larges et
 tres-noires."   He represents the band in the blue as more refrangible
 than F, and the one in the green as near E.

 absorption, which are broad and strong in comparison with the solar

absorption, which are shown in the diagram.             The band which has
a  wave-length of about 5/2 millionths of           millimetre  a less refran        is

planetary bands at 595 and 618 of the scale appeared very nearly
coincident with bright lines of air. The faintness of the planet's
spectrum did not admit of certainty on this point              suspected that;   I
the planetary lines are in           small degree less refrangible.

bright lines which present themselves when the induction-spark                                     is
passed through this gas.         The result was to show that the bands of
Uranus cannot be ascribed to the absorption of this gas.

        It is well known that one metal has the power of decomposing
   the salts of certain other metals, and that the chemical change will
   proceed until the more powerful metal has entirely taken the place
   of the other. The authors have investigated what takes place during
   the process.
        The experiments were generally performed as follows : — 72 cubic
   centimetres of an aqueous solution of the salt of known strength,
   and at 12° Centigrade, were placed in a tall glass ; a perfectly clean
   plate of metal of 3230 square millimetres was weighed and placed
   vertically in this solution without reaching either to the top or bot
   tom ; the action was allowed to proceed quietly for ten minutes, when
   the plate was removed, and the deposited metal was washed off. The
   loss of weight gave the amount of metal dissolved, and represented
   the chemical action.
        The most complete series of results was with copper and nitrate of
   silver.

Dr. Gladstone and Mr. Tribe        on a Law in Chemical Dynamics. 227
    In tlie earlier terms of this series, twice the percentage of silver-
salt gives three times the chemical action. The mathematical expres-
                             log_3
sion of this law is c=Cpl°s2, c being the chemical action, C the
constant, and p the proportionate quantity of salt.             The close
agreement of the observed numbers with those calculated on this
supposition as far as the 9th term is shown in the 5th and 6th
columns.      The law then breaks down, and after about 7 per cent,
the increased action is almost in direct ratio with the increased
strength.
   The position of the plate in the solution was found to make no
difference to this 2 : 3 law.
    Similar series of experiments were made with zinc and chloride of
copper, zinc and sulphate of copper, zinc and nitrate of lead, iron and
sulphate of copper, and other combinations ; and in every instance
where the solution was weak^and the .action simple, the law of three
times the chemical change for twice the strength was found to hold
good.
    It was proved that the breaking down of the law at about 3'5 per
cent, of salt in solution was irrespective of the quantity of the liquid,
or of the time for which the plate was exposed.            With 72 cub.
centims. of a 1'41-per-cent. solution of nitrate of silver the rate of
action remained sensibly the same for as long as twenty-five minutes,
notwithstanding the constant deposition of silver. This apparently
paradoxical result is due to fresh relays of the original solution
being brought up to the plate by the currents produced, and that
period of time elapsing before any of the products of decomposition
are brought back again in their circuit.
    When it was perceived that within easily ascertainable limits the
chemical action is the same for similar consecutive periods of time,
experiments were made in far weaker solutions.         It was only neces
sary   to lengthen  the time of   exposure.   It was thus found that the
law of three times the chemical action for twice the strength of so
lution holds good through at least eleven terms of the powers of 2 ;
in fact, from a solution that could dissolve one gramme of copper
during the hour, to a solution that dissolved only O'OOOOOl gramme,
a million times less.
    The manner in which the silver is deposited on a copper plate was
examined, and the currents produced were studied.         At first a light-
blue current is perceived flowing upwards from the surface of the
plate ; presently a deep-blue current pours downwards ; and these
two currents in opposite directions continue to form simultaneously.
 A similar phenomenon was observed in every case where a metallic salt
 attacked a plate of another metal.      The downward current was found
to be a solution of almost pure nitrate of copper, containing about
 three times as much NO3 as the original silver solution, while the
 upward current was a diluted solution of the mixed nitrates.
 Moreover the heavy current took its rise in the entangled mass
 of crystals right against the plate, while the light current flowed from
 the tops of the crystalline branches.      It was evident that when the
                                     Q2

228                      Geological Society:   —
fresh silver was deposited on these branches, and the fresh copper
taken up from the plate, there was not merely a transference of the
nitric element from one combination to another, but an actual mole -
cular movement of it towards the copper plate, producing an accu
mulation of nitrate of copper there, and a corresponding loss of salt
in the liquid that was drawn within the influence of the branching
crystals.     Hence the opposite currents.
     The amount of action in a circuit of two metals and a saline so
lution must have as one of its regulating conditions the conducting-
power of that solution.      It appeared by experiment that a strong
solution of nitrate of silver offers less resistance than a weak one ;
and it was also found, on adding nitrate of potassium to the nitrate
 of silver, that its power of attacking the copper plate was increased,
that the augmentation of the foreign salt increased the action still
 further, and that the 2 : 3 law holds good between two solutions in
 which both the silver and potassium sah are doubled, though it does
 not hold good if the quantity of foreign salt be kept constant. Si
 milar results were obtained with mixed nitrates of silver and copper.
     While these later experiments offer an explanation of the fact
 that a solution of double the strength produces more than double
 the chemical action, they do not explain why it should produce exactly
 three times the effect, or why the ratio should be the same in all
 substitutions of this nature hitherto tried. The simplicity and wide
 range of the 2 : 3 law seem to indicate that it is a very primary one
 in chemical dynamics.

       March 8, 1871.— Joseph Prcstwich, Esq., F.R.S., President,
                                in the Chair.
     The following communication was read :~
      " On the Red Rocks of England of older date than the Trias." By
  Prof. A. C. Ramsay, LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
     The author stated that the red colour of the Triassic beds is dun to
  peroxide of iron, which incrusts the sedimentary grains as a thin
  pellicle.   This could not have been deposited in an open sea, hut
  rather in an inland salt lake or lakes.     The peroxide of iron, which
  stains the Permian, Old Red Sandstone and Cambrian rocks, is be
  lieved by the author to have been deposited iu the same manner, in
  inland waters, salt or fresh.
      Agreeing with Mr. Godwin-Austen, the Old Red Sandstone was
  of Lacustrine origin. The absence of marine shells helps to this con
  clusion.    The fish do not contradict it ; for some of their nearest
  living congeners live in African and American rivers.
     ^The life of the Upper Silurian deposits of Wales and the adjoining
  districts continued in full force up to the passage-beds which mark
  the change from Silurian to Old Red Sandstone.        In these transition
  strata, genera, species, and individuals are often few, and dwarfed
  in form. Near Ludlow and May Hill the uppermost Silurian strata
  contain seeds and fragments of land-plants, indicating the neighbour
  hood of land, and the poverty of numbers and the small size of the

         Prof. A. C. Ramsay       on the Red Rocks of England.        229
shells a change in the condition of tho waters/ The fish of the Old
Red Sandstone also indicate a change of condition of a geographical
kind.
    The circumstances which marked the passage of Silurian into Old
Red Sandstone were as follows : — First, shallowing of the sea, so
that the area changed into fresh and brackish lagoons, afterwards
converted into great freshwater lakes.         At the present day marine
species are occasionally found living in fresh water, as for example
in the Swedish lakes. The same may have been partly the case in tho
Old Red Sandstone period. The Old Red Sandstone waters at their
beginning are comparablc[to the Black Sea, now steadily freshening —
or the Caspian, once united to the North Sea, if by a change of
amount of rainfall and evaporation it freshened by degrees, and
finally became a freshwater lake.
     The Permian strata, to a great extent, consist of red sandstones
and marls in the greater part of England ; and the Magnesian Lime
 stone of the north of England is also in less degree associated with
red marls. These do not occur in the same districts of England,
excepting in Lancashire, where a few beds of Magnesian Limestone
 arc interstratified with the marls. The sandstones and marls being
red, the colouring-matter is considered to be duo to peroxide of iron,
possibly precipitated from carbonate of iron, introduced in solution
 into the waters.
     Land-plants are found in some of the Permian beds, showing tho
 neighbourhood of land.        No mollusca are found in most of the red
 beds, except   a  brachiopod in Warwickshire, and a few other genera
 in Lancashire, in marls associated with thin bands of Magnesian
 Limestone.
     Tho traces of amphibians are like those found in the Keuper Sand
 stone, viz. Dasyceps Butclclandi, and Labyrinthodont       footprints in
 the Vale of Eden     and  at Corncockle Moor, printed  on clamp surfaces,
 dried in the sun,     and   afterwards flooded in a way common in salt
 lakes. Pseudomorphous crystals of salt and gypsum help to this
  conclusion.
      Tho molluscous fauna of Lancashire, small in number, in this
 respect resembles the fauna of the Caspian Sea.         The fauna of tho
 Magnesian Limestone of tho cast of England is more numerous,
 comprising thirty-five genera and seventy-six species, but wonder
 fully restricted when compared with the Carboniferous fauna. The
  specimens are generally dwarfed in aspect, and in their poverty
  may bo compared to the Caspian fauna of the present day.           Some
  of tho fish of the Marl-Slate have strong affinities to carboniferous
  genera, which may be supposed to have lived in shallow lagoons,
  bordered by peaty flats ; and the reptiles lately described by Messrs.
  Howse and Hancock have terrestrial affinities.
      Besides tho poorness of the Mollusca, the Magncsiau Limestone
  seems to afford other hints that it was deposited in an inland salt
  lake subject to evaporation. Gypsum is common in tho interstra
  tified marls. In the open sea limestone is only formed by organic
  agency ; for lime, in solution, only exists in small quantities in such
  a bulk of water ; but in inland salt lakes carbonates of lime and

 230                       Geological Society : —
 magnesia might have been deposited simultaneously by concentra
 tion of solutions, due to evaporation.   Some of the Magnesian-Lime-
 etone strata have almost a tufaceous or stalagmitic aspect, as if de
 posited from solution.
    The Cambrian strata also show some evidence of not being true
 marine deposits.     They arc purple or red, like the other strata pre
 viously spoken of; and the surfaces of the beds sometimes exhibit
 sun-cracks and rain-pittings. The trilobite Palceopyge Itamsayi is
 considered by the author to bo an accidental marking, simulating
 the form of a trilobite ; and the fossils of St. David's are found in
 grey beds, which may mark occasional influxes of the sea, due to
 oscillations of level.
    The foregoing reasonings, in the author's opinion, lead to the con
 clusion that in the northern hemisphere a continental area existed,
 more or less, from the close of the Silurian to the end of the Triassie
 epoch, and that this geographical continuity of land implies probable
 continuity of continental genera.
    There is therefore no pakeontological reason why 'the Hypero-
dapedon, Telerpeton, and Stayonolepis of the Elgin country should
 bo considered of Triassie age, especially as the beds in which they
 occur are stratigraphically inseparable from the Old lied Sandstone.
    Finally, terrestrial and marine European epochs were rapidly
reviewed.
    1. The Cambrian epoch was probably freshwater.
    2. The Old Eed Sandstone, Carboniferous, Permian, and Trias
were formed during one long continental epoch.
    This was brought to an end by partial submergence during the
Jurassic epoch; and by degrees a new continental area arose,
drained by the great continental rivers of the Purbeck and Wealdeu
series, as shown in various parts of Europe.
    3. This continent was almost entirely swallowed up in the Upper
Cretaceous    seas.
    4. By subsequent elevation the Eocene lands were formed ; and
with this continent there came in a new terrestrial fauna. Most
of the northern half of Europe since then has been continental, and
its terrestrial fauna essentially of modern type.
    If, according to ordinary methods we were to classify the old
terrestrial faunas of North America, Europe, Asia, and probably of
Africa, a palaeozoic epoch would extend from Old lied Sandstone to
Wealden times, and a Neozoic epoch at least from the Eocene period
to the present day.      The Upper Cretaceous strata would at present
remain unclassified. The marine epoch would also temporarily be
divided into two, Palaeozoic from Laurcntian to the close of the
Permian times ; and all besides, down to the present day, would form
a Neozoic scries.      The generic gaps between the two begin already
to bo filled up. The terrestrial and the marine series at their edges
at present overlap each other.
    The groat life-gaps between the two terrestrial periods may some
day bo filled up by the discovery of the traces of old continents
containing intermediate developments of structure as yet undis
covered.

       March. 22. —Prof. John Morris, Vice-President,     in the Chair.
     The following communications were read : —
     1. "On the ' Passage-beds' in the neighbourhood of Woolhopc,
 Herefordshire, and on the discovery of a new species of Euryplerw,
  and some new Land-plants in them."           By the Eev. P. B. Brodie,
  M.A., F.G.S.
     The author described as the " passage-beds
                                                     " between the Silu
 rian and Old Red Sandstone formations near Woolhope, a scries of
 shales and sandstones, which at Perton attain a thickness of about
  17 feet.    Here the section includes, in descending order :— 1. Thiu-
 bedded sandstones ; 2. Dark brownish shales ; 3. Yellow Sand
 stone ; 4. Olive shales ; 5. Thin-bedded sandstone ; 6. Olive shales,
 similar to no. 4. At some localities vegetable remains (Li/copoditcs,
 and perhaps Psilopliyton) occur in the olive shales, which also con
tain several Crustacean fossils, including Pteriftjohis Banksii and a
now species of Etirypterus, named by Mr. Woodward E. Brodiel.
 Upon this species Mr. "Woodward presented a note supplementary to
 Mr. Brodie's paper.
    2. " On the Cliff-sections of the Tertiary Beds west of Dieppe in
 Normandy and at Newhaven in Sussex."             By "William Whitakcr,
Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    The author gave details of the sections of the Tertiary beds at
 the above places, and noticed the occurrence of London clay. Below
this formation, at Dieppe, is a mass of sand, the same as that of the
" Oldhaven beds " in East Kent, but here less markedly divided
from the clay above ; and beneath this sand come the cstuarine
shelly clays, »fec. of the Woolwich beds.
    In the older accounts of the Newhaven section a much less thick
ness of the Tertiary beds is chronicled than may now be seen ; indeed
the successive descriptions end upwards with higher and higher
beds, owing to the destruction of the coast and the wearing-back of
the cliff into higher ground, the highest point seeming to have been
at last reached.
    Hero the Oldhaven sand is absent, but the Woolwich clays are in
greater force ; and the ditch of the. new fort shows some very irre
gular masses of gravel, more or less wedged into those clays.
    Both sections show the comparatively wide extent of like condi
tions to those of the Woolwich beds of West Kent.
    3.  " On New Tree Ferns and other Fossils from the Devonian."
By Prof.     J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.ll.S., F.G.S.
    The author referred to the numerous species of ferns known in the
Upper and Middle Devonian of America, and to the fact that lie had
described several large petioles as probably belonging to arborescent
species, and also two trunks covered with ai.;rial roots, viz. Psaronius
erianus and P. te.vtllis.    He also referred to Caulopteris Peachii of
Salter as the only tree-fern known in the Devonian of Europe.
    He then described remains of four species of tree-ferns in collec
tions communicated to him by Dr. Newberry of New York. The
first of these, Caulopteris Loekwoodi, was found by the Eev. Mr. Lock-
wood at Gilboa, the locality of the Psuronitcs already mentioned,

 in rocks of     the Chemung group.        It is a fragment of a well-charac
 terized stem, with parts of five petioles attached to it, and asso
 ciated with remains of the leaves.           It must have been entombed in
 an erect position, and is not improbably the upper part of one of
 the species of Psaronivs from the same locality.
     Tho second species, Caulopteris antiqiia, Newberry, is of much
 larger size, but less perfectly preserved.          It is a flattened stem on a
 slab of marine limestone from the Corniferous formation in the lower
 port of the Middle Devonian (Erian) of Ohio.
     The third species, Protopteris peregrina, Newberry, is from the
 same formation with the last, and constitutes the first instance of
 the occurrence of the genus to which it belongs, below the Carboni
 ferous. The specimens show the form and arrangement of the leaf-
 scars, the microscopic structure of the petioles, and also the arrange
 ment of the aerial roots covering the lower part of the stem.
     The fourth species is a gigantic RJiac7iiojrteris, or leaf-stalk, evi
 dently belonging to a species quite distinct from cither of the above,
 and showing its minute structure.              It is no less than four inches
 wide at the base.         In the cellular tissue of this petiole are rounded
 grains similar to those regarded by Corda and Carruthers, in Carbo
 niferous and Eocene specimens, as starch-granules.
     In addition to these species, the paper described a new A'cet/fft-
 ratJiia (N. yllloensts), and noticed a remarkable specimen from
Caithness, in the collection of Prof. Wyvillo Thomson, throwing
light on the problematical Lyeopoilites Vanvxemil of America ;
also interesting specimens of Psilophyton and other genera seen by
the writer in the collection of Mr. Peach of Edinburgh.

       ON THE     VELOCITY      OF PROPAGATION       OF ELECTRODYNAMIC
                       EFFECTS.       BY DR. HELMHOLTZ.
 "JV/TAN
            Y investigators    have recently been occupied with the question,
 •*-•-•- how are
                   electrodynamic effects produced at a distance, — whether
 (according to W. Weber) by forces of the moved electric particles
themselves operating immediately on the distant point, but which
 depend on the velocities and accelerations of these particles in the
 direction of the line joining them, or (according to C. Neumann,
jun.) by forces which diffuse themselves through space with a finite
velocity— or whether (according to Faraday and Maxwell) they me
 occasioned only mediately, by a variation in the medium which fills
space.       It is indeed a question of prime importance for the founda
tions of physical science.           According to tire two last-mentioned
views the distant electrodynamic effects of electric currents will not
be produced instantaneously, but the impulse to them will he propa
gated through space with a finite velocity.              In the theories of Neu
 mann and Maxwell this velocity is supposed, from electrodynamic
measurements, to be nearly equal to that of light.               Nevertheless the
discussion lately published by me*, of electrodynamic theories,
showed that, according to what is accepted respecting the capability

of the air for magnetic and dielectric polarization, other values of
this velocity of propagation will agree with the rest of the facts.
    Meanwhile a long series of experiments have now been published
by P. Blaserna*, from which he concludes that the propagation, at
least of the inducing effects of electrical currents, in the air proceeds
with a very moderate velocity.          According to his experiments with
induction-discharges       from open circuits (which he considers the most
reliable), this velocity in air amounts to only 550 metres, in gum-lac
to not more than 330 metres, and is consequently, in the latter case,
about equal to the velocity of sound in air. From his experiments
with a closed induction circuit he deduced much smaller velocities ;
yet he has himself acknowledged that the reaction of the induced
upon the inducing spiral made the interpretation of the result of bis
experiments doubtful.
    It is to be remarked that in these experiments the distances be
tween the inducing and the induced spiral were very small, varying
between 1 and 3 centime. ; besides, the two spirals were wound flat.
The time corresponding to the propagation through the interval of
2 centims. amounted, in the experiments with open induction, to
only ., ., 1 o u of a second.   Neglecting the irregularities occasioned
in delicate measurements of time, by the contact between solid me
tals being always broken by successive leaps, it appeared to me
doubtful whether such minute differences of time might not be con
 ditional on the variable duration of the spark at the place of inter
ruption of the inducing current.           In my experiments hereinafter
described, I convinced myself that, even in much more unfavourable
conditions than were present in M. Blaserna's experiments, the in
terruption-spark may have a duration of :nru(nj °^ a secol)d ; MM.
Lucas and (Jazin recently found jfouTro' ^or larger electrical batteries
with 2'292 millims. striking-distance, Tf)^uo with 5 millims. striking-
distance t- While M. Blaserna employed several Bunsen's elements
for the production of the current, 1 used only one Daniell's element ;
and while his spirals contained close-pressed coils of wire, mine had
a very large periphery and few coils, and was therefore              much less
calculated to produce a strong extra-current : and yet the duration
of the spark reached the quantity stated.           Now, when we consider
that, as is well known, the approach of a second spiral, in which an
induction-current is produced, seriously diminishes the intensity of
the spark, because the induced current counteracts the inducing,
and that M. Blaserna's spirals were always proportionally very near
each other, the doubt occurs whether the longer duration of the
spark did not produce an apparent retardation of the operation with
a greater distance of the spirals.
    As 1 had for a long time been occupied with experiments on the
course of electric currents of very short duration, and had had appa
ratus manufactured for this purpose, it seemed to me before all things
necessary to prove whether the velocity of propagation of elcctrody-
namic effects has really so low a value as M. Blaserna has concluded.

  The experiments     I  have hitherto carried out refer to the propagation
  through air only.      The very note-worthy influence of electric insu
  lators shown in the Italian physicist's experiments required still
  further study.     That also in insulators electrical movements of very
  brief duration occur which in some circumstances may well operate
  inductively on their vicinity, similarly to the excitement of magnetism
  in iron, appears very probable from the influence which such media
  have as dielectrics.     For the time I did not prosecute this part of the
  inquiry.   The interruption-apparatus used by me for the conduction
  of the currents consisted of a heavy and solid iron pendulum, the
  support of which was let into the wall, and which was always let fall
  from the same height.        At the lower end it had two projections
  overlaid with plates of agate, which at the moment when the pen
  dulum passed through the position of equilibrium struck the steel
  ends of two light little levers, by the motion of which two current-
  conductions were interrupted.       One of these levers rested on a fixed
  support, the other on a slide which could be shifted by means of a
 micrometer-screw, so that the stroke on this moveable lever resulted,
 "by any small period chosen, now sooner, now later than that on the
 other. The interval of time was calculated from the micrometrically
 measured displacement of the striking-point and from the velocity of
 the full of the pendulum ; the latter was calculated from the time and
 arc of oscillation of the pendulum.       A division-mark on the head of
 the micrometer-screw corresponded to jxtVlTf °f a second.            With
 present arrangements it would have been useless to take more accu
 rate readings, on account of the inequality of duration of the spark.
     As it was important to have the distances between the spirals as
 great as possible, I gave to them the form of rings of about 80 cen-
 tims. diameter. The inducing spiral had only 12^ turns of copper
 wire 1 millim. thick, covered with          i millim. thickness of gutta
 percha. The induced spiral, on the contrary, had 5CO turns of cop
 per wire, spun round with silk, of ^ millim. diameter. This spiral
 could be placed at a distance of 170 centims. from the inducing one
 without the inducing effect ceasing to be evident. But even the
 nearest distance to which the two coils were brought amounted still
 to 34 centims., in order to make the reaction of the induced on the in
 ducing current imperceptibly small — which, so far as could be judged
 by time-measuring experiments, was accomplished.
     In the experiments the following was the arrangement adopted : —
     The circuit of the inducing current contained a Daniell's element,
 the smaller spiral, and the first- struck place of interruption.    By the
 stroke the current was stopped ; and its interruption operated indu-
cingly on the ulone remaining second circuit. This was not perfectly
closed, but its ends led to a condenser (after Kohlrausch) with two
gilt metal disks, which were brought to § millim. distance from one
another.     This circuit consisted of the larger wire spiral, one end of
which    was  connected immediately with the fixed plate of the con-
'denser, in communication with the earth.           The other end commu
nicated, through the second interruption-lever, with the insulated
moveable plate of the condenser.        The electricity put in motion by
induction    thus  flowed   into  the condenser   up to the moment when

the second interruption-place was struck.       Thenceforth the move-
able plate of the condenser was insulated, and retained the charge it
had received.
    Its quantity and kind were then measured by an electrometer con
structed on SirW. Thomson's principle, after removing the plates of
the condenser one from the other.
    The process which was thus submitted to observation is therefore
the series of electrical oscillations remaining, after the interruption
of the primary current, in the induced spiral connected with the
condenser.     Since these oscillations proceed from one plate of the
condenser to the other in an unbroken conduction without any issue
of sparks, they pass much more regularly and are much more nume
rous than those observed in the connecting arcs of Leyden batteries.
The length of my micrometer permitted the reading-off of 35 posi
tive and the same number of negative phases when the distance
 between the spirals was 34 centims. The time of an entire oscilla
tion (positive and negative together) amounted to .2s\ ) of a second ;
 the total duration of the 35 oscillations observed was therefore
                                                                   ^ of
 a second ; and when I was obliged to break off the observations, the
 oscillations were still by no means so feeble that, with a greater play
 of the micrometer, a long series of them could not have been
observed.
   The result of experiments in which I varied the distance of the
condenser-plates, and consequently the electric capacity of the con
denser, was, that the duration of the oscillations was but very little
affected by the capacity of the condenser.         I have, in a previous
communication*, pointed out that even a close-wound spiral itself
operates as a condenser, since the turns at one end become charged
positively, and those at the other end negatively, and are only sepa
rated from the less strongly charged positive or negative layers in
their vicinity by the very thin insulating layers of silk; hence au
electric coating is accumulated on both sides of the insulating layer.
Since the lessening of the capacity of the condenser has so little in
fluence on the duration of the oscillation, it follows that the conden-
satory capacity of the spiral must have considerably exceeded that of
the condenser.
   In order to discover the possible retardation of the distant effect,
it was necessary to discover a conspicuous point in the course of the
electric oscillations that could be very sharply determined. The first
moment of the commencement was unsuitable, since, apparently, the
current commences with a velocity rising from zero, and this only
gradually increases ; hence the strength of the current at first in
creases, at the most, proportionally to the square of the time.      The
reason of this is to be sought in the fact that the primary current
also, during the time of the spark, vanishes only gradually, and
hence the induced electromotive force in the secondary circuit is by
uo means suddenly developed there in perfection, but itself first
   * Verhandlunyen des naturh. med. Vereins zu Heidelberg, April 30, 1869.
In the earlier observations, with the aid of the current-testing leg of a
frog, I had verified as many as 45 oscillations, the total duration of which
amounted to   4'u of second.

grows continuously.         But in our case the duration of the spark is
about equal to the tenth part of the whole period of an oscillation,
and therefore by no means inconsiderable *.            Its average length is
determined by comparing the time between the stroke of the pendulum
which breaks the primary conduction and the first zero-point of the cur
rent, with the time between the successive zero-points.            The former
is longer, because, besides the period of half an oscillation, it com
prises also the duration of the spark ; and the amount of this can be
approximately found by means of such a comparison.
    On the other hand, the successive zero-points of the current can
be very sharply determined, even with the more distant position of
the secondary spiral.         As, even with such feeble electromotive
forces and spirals of so few turns as I used in the primary circuit,
the duration of the spark is never constant (the reason of which is
probably to be sought in the throvving-off of platinum particles by the
sparks), the deflections about the division-mark corresponding to
zero are, even with a good arrangement of the apparatus, sometimes
positive, sometimes negative ; on the contrary, at the preceding and
succeeding divisions they are either exclusively or preponderantly in
one definite direction.
    With the arrangement described, at which I had arrived after
many trials, it was shown that the greater distance of the two spirals
 (136 centims.) did not alter the situation of the zero-point of the induced
 current by one division of the micrometer     — that is to say, by ^ ^ ^ of
a second.     If,  then, the inducing effects arc actually propagated with a
 definable velocity, this must be greater than 31 4,400 metres, or about
 42'4 geographical miles [about 195 British statute miles] in asecond.
    I have hit upon preparations for a further refinement of these
 measurements. How far this can be carried, will, it appears to me,
 depend chiefly on how far the spark at the place of interruption can
 be reduced when a very small resistance and very small electromotive
 force are given to the primary circuit, and when the turns of wire
 forming it are removed as far as possible from one another. — jtfo-

ON THE       REVERSAL OP THE LINES OF THE SPECTRA OP METALLIC
                        VAPOURS.      BY M. A. CORNtT.
     In studying the spectrum of the spark of magnesium, which
 serves me as a monochromatic light for photographing the coloured
 rings*, I have been led to a series of observations which appear to
 have some interest in respect of the study of the solar spectrum.
     My purpose was to photograph the line, in the spectrum of the
 magnesium-spark, which produces by itself alone the greater portion
 of the photogenic energy.        This line is triplet ; it is situated beyond
 the violet, between H and L, but very near the latter ; it is the re
 petition (so to say, the sharp harmonic) of the line b of the visible
 spectrum, the wave-lengths being nearly in the ratio of 3 to 4.
     The experiment had succeeded a great number of times ; never
 theless I was desirous of repeating a series of measurements of refran-
  gibility and wave-lengths with a more powerful pile and a very
  effective induction-apparatus J.
      To my great surprise, the spark, really prodigious, produced
  scarcely any photographic impression, relatively to what I had ex
 pected to obtain ; it was also necessary to prolong the time of expo
  sure to two minutes, it having been estimated, from the strength of
  the spark, at two or three seconds.          The examination of the plate
  revealed an unexpected phenomenon : instead of the usual three
  lines, there were five ; the two least refrangible were distinctly
  doubled ; yet the lines were very broad, and their exterior contours
  ill defined. My first idea was to suppose an error in fixing the po
  sition of the apparatus (mise au point); but on substituting iron elec-

trodes for the magnesium ones, the lines of the iron-spectrum (espe
cially the one situated between the two doubled magnesium-lines)
photographed themselves with perfect distinctness , there was there
fore no error on this side.
    I then concluded that the doubling of the lines was n true reversal —
the analogue, in the invisible portion of the spectrum, of the reversal
of the line D, obtained by M. Fizeau on placing between the two
carbon points of the electric lamp a fragment of sodium.
    No hesitation would have been possible if the three lines had been
doubled simultaneously ; but it seemed strange that one of them
should escape this modification.             I successively took twenty-two
plates ;  and  in  none   did  the  most  refrangible line appear doubled.
    I then recollected an observation of Father Secchi on the spec
trum-analysis of a solar spot (May 1869)*, in which the able astro
nomer relates his having witnessed the reversal of one only (the
least refrangible) of the three magnesium-lines which constitute b.
This near resemblance induced me to persevere ; and I was fortu
nate enough to produce at will, on the same plate, the reversed or
the normal lines.        One can even compare the positions of the normal
and the reversed lines, just as the spectrum of an artificial light is
compared with that of the sun. It is only necessary to cause the
spark of a powerful induction-apparatus to issue between the mag
nesium electrodes, covering one half of the slit of the spectroscope,
then the spark from a very feeble apparatus f, prolonged a sufficient
time, and to cover the other half of the slit.        The exact coincidence of
the normal and reversed lines is easily ascertained.
    The reversal in the ultra-violet portion being beyond doubt, it was
necessary to obtain it also in the visible region of the spectrum.
The spark of the large induction-coil, even with 24 couples arranged
as 12 with a double surface, produced no effect on the magnesium-
line b ; but the experiment succeeded easily with the voltaic arc of a
pile of 50 couples. It can be effected thus : — For the positive pole a
disk of carbon 6-8 centims. in diameter is taken, in which are sunk
little capsules ; in each of these is placed a fragment of metal ; then
the negative carbon is lowered, and then raised as soon as the spark
has issued, so as to obtain an arc of 4 or 5 millims.           With the aid of
a lens the image of the arc is projected on the slit of the spectroscope.
 In the case of magnesium the triple line b appears bright and clean :
it is to be placed exactly in position. Then the upper carbon is
lowered by degrees ; the lines widen, become blurred, and very soon
a very fine black line appears on the least refrangible ; if the ap
 proximation of the carbons be continued, the second and at last the
 third line will be reversed.         Here, then, is the verification of the
 phenomenon      observed    photographically,     and the artificial reproduc
 tion, although in the opposite direction, of that described by Father
 Secchi.

     It  is remarkable that all the lines of the spectrum are not reversed
 simultaneously.         Thus the very bright violet line situated nearly in
 the centre of the space between the two triple lines shows no trace
 of reversal. In an early communication I will describe another series
 of experiments, which tend to class the lines of one spectrum in dif
 ferent categories.        It will be sufficient for me here to say that the
 only lines I have succeeded in reversing belong to the light emitted
 by the atmosphere of vapour which envelopes the incandescent
 metal*.
     After this first experiment,       I   tried the various metals I had at
 hand. The same phenomenon was reproduced in divers groups of
 lines ; and in general the reversal commences with the least refran
 gible line of the group, and only continues if the temperature is pro
 gressively raised.
     The following are, for the principal metals, the groups of lines
 which I have been able to reverse.              The metals are arranged nearly
 in the order of the facility of production of the phenomenon ; the
 lines are designated by their wave-lengths expressed inmillionths of
 a millimetre.

Iron, cobalt, bismuth, antimony,          and gold have given no appearance
of reversal. The alkaline salts, especially the chlorides, still more
easily produce the reversal of the bright lines. The chlorides of
sodium (X=589 and 422) and lithium (X=670 and 458) are the
 most remarkable.

    These experiments confirm the theory of the reversal of the lines
 by absorption ; for the condition of success is the bringing together,
as completely as possible, of the carbons, consequently the formation
 of a large quantity of vapour in a very small space.           In the centre
 the temperature is very high, the radiations very intense ; the cor
responding lines are at the same time bright and widened ; around
 the central focus the layers are cooler, they emit radiations less in
 tense, but clearer as the length of an undulation. Thus the reversal
line is very fine when the thickness is sufficient to produce absorp
tion ; it would become wider and wider, as happens in the case of
 sodn, if the temperature were still more raised.
    I will add a few words in order to set forth again the connexion
between these experiments and spectrum-observations of the sun.
    When Kirchhoff gave the explanation of the reversal of the lines,
his view was admitted, that the dark lines of the solar spectrum
•were due to a continuous atmosphere            enveloping the sun and ab
 sorbing certain radiations of the photosphere.          Nevertheless, in the
 chemical point of view, the constitution of this atmosphere, in which
 would be found pell-mell the vapours of so many different bodies,
 presents some difficulties ; besides, its existence is contradicted by
 the comparative observations          of the margin and the centre of the
 sun.     If the   absorbent    atmosphere had a sensible thickness, the ab
 sorption-spectrum         would  vary with the thickness traversed by the
rays which       reach   us, and  consequently would have a different aspect
 at the   centre    and   at the  margin of the solar disk. We know that
it is  not   so ;  and  hence    astronomers  have concluded that the emis
 sion   of luminous      radiations,  and the  absorption of certain of them,
 both take place on the photosphere itself. This hypothesis is veri
 fied by our experiments, and even precisely defined to a certain
degree ; for they show :
                                 —
     1st. That a very slight thickness of vapour can produce the re
versal of the lines — a thickness absolutely imperceptible at our dis
 tance from the sun ; and
    2ndly. That there is no advantage in supposing a continuous at
mosphere, however thin, the absorption being all local, and produced
spontaneously by the external cooling about each incandescent point.
    It will moreover be remarked that the experiment described above
is a genuine reproduction of the hypothetical constitution of the sun,
and a synthesis of the spectrum-phenomena presented by it, — the
incandescent carbon, on which is the metal, playing approximately
the part of the photosphere, with a layer of vapours above at a very
high temperature and emitting radiations which are partially absorbed
 by the exterior layer.
    In short, a new fact brought out by these experiments is the re
versal of a great number of metallic lines : hitherto success had
been obtained in reversing scarcely any besides the sodium-line.
 Moreover they confirm the observations (which at first appeared
very singular) of the partial reversal of n group of lines, by showing
that this apparent singularity is the general case.         And, lastly, they
justify, and even precisely define, certain hypotheses concerning the
constitution of the sun. — Comptes licndus, July 21, 1871.

    Ocean-currents.     By JAMES CROLL, of the Geological Survey
    of Scotland.
                     [Continued from vol. xl. p. 259.]
     Dr. Carpenter's Theory of      a General Oceanic Circulation.
           two great causes which have been assigned for ocean-
 THEcurrents      are the influence of the winds and the difference of
 specific gravity between the ocean in equatorial and polar regions.
But even amongst those who adopt the former theory, it is ge
nerally held that the winds are not the sole cause, but that, to a
certain extent at least, difference of specific gravity contributes -
to produce motion of the waters.           This is a very natural con
clusion ; and in the present state of physical geography on this
subject one can hardly be expected to hold any other view.             It
is only when we adopt the more rigid method of determining in
absolute measure the amount of the forces resulting from differ
ence of specific gravity that we become aware that this is a cause
utterly insufficient to produce the motions attributed to it. In my
last paper*   I  examined at considerable length Lieut. Maury's
theory,   and endeavoured     to show that difference of specific gravity
between the    sea in equatorial and polar regions could not, as he
supposed, be v.:e cause of the Gulf-stream and other currents.
Since the publication of that paper, an interesting and elaborate
memoir on ocean-currents has been read before the Royal Geogra
phical Society by Dr. Carpenter. In this memoir he states that my
objections do not apply to the slow movement, imperceptible to

ordinary observation, which he advocates. The conclusion at
which I arrived was that the motive force resulting from the
difference of specific gravity is equal to one fourth of a grain
on the cubic foot (63 Ibs.) ; and            I  also adduced evidence to
show that a force so infinitesimal            is not only insufficient to
move the water at the rate of several miles an hour, as in
the case of the Gulf-stream and other currents, but is actu
ally insufficient to produce any sensible motion whatever, — in
short, that Dr. Carpenter's theory of a general interchange of
Equatorial and Polar water resulting from difference of spe
cific gravity is quite as physically impossible as Lieut. Maury's
theory.      But as Dr. Carpenter, in the memoir referred to*, has
stated his theory with much fulness, and supported his positions
 with much ingenuity of argument, it will be necessary for me to
enter a little more minutely into some of the points under dis
cussion before considering the influence of the winds as a cause
of currents.       This will, undoubtedly, be best effected by an ex
amination     of Dr. Carpenter's arguments.          Until these are shown
to be insufficient to support the theory maintained by him, it is
needless to begin the consideration of the effects of the winds.
And as he has in his memoir done me the honour to discuss
at considerable length some of my objections to his theory,               I
trust that it will not be deemed either discourteous or presump
tuous in me that         I  should enter somewhat more fully into the
subject.
    There are three ways whereby it may be determined whether
or not the circulation of the ocean is due to difference in specific
gravity : viz. (1) the matter may be determined by direct expe
riment ; (2) it may be determined by ascertaining the absolute
amount offeree acting on the water to produce motion, in virtue
of difference of specific gravity, and then comparing it with the
force which has been shown by experiment to be necessary to the
production of sensible motion ; or (3) by determining the greatest
possible amount of work which gravity can perform on the waters
in virtue of difference of specific gravity, and then ascertaining if
the work of gravity does or does riot equal the work of the resist
ances in the required motion.           It is strange that Dr. Carpenter
nor any of the advocates of the gravitation theory have ever
adopted any of these methods.            Dr. Carpenter seems to take for
granted    that   a circulation   of the ocean similar to what he advo
cates  is  a
              "  physical necessity."      But this is the very point at
issue.    If the work of gravity so far exceeds the work of the re
sistances in such a motion of the waters as that supposed by Dr.
Carpenter, then, indeed, such a motion is a physical necessity ;

but, on the other hand, if the work of gravity falls short of
the work of the resistances (and Dr. Carpenter has nowhere
proved that it does not), the motion which he supposes is not
only not a physical necessity, but is actually a physical impos
sibility.
   Dr. Carpenter states that his doctrine of a General Oceanic
Circulation has been accepted as valid by some of the most dis
tinguished mathematicians and physicists of this country. This
is,no doubt,-true; but   cannot help thinking that those emi
                                 I
nent physicists who have given       general assent to the correct
                                           a
ness of his theory have done so without giving        special consi  it
deration — and that when they come to examine the question
more minutely they will be satisfied that the forces resulting
from difference of density, whether that difference be caused
 by difference of temperature or              by
                                       difference in saltness,    so                     is
infinitesimal as to be wholly insufficient to produce the great
currents of the ocean. With the exception of Dr. Colding, of
Copenhagen*,        am not aware that any physicist holding the
                      I
gravitation theory has attempted to determine the absolute
amount of the forces acting on the water so as to produce motion.
   Dr. Carpenter's experiment. — True, Dr. Carpenter has exhibited
an experiment to show the motion of the water.       But    presume        I
his experiment was intended rather to illustrate the way in which
the circulation of the ocean, according to his theory, takes place,
than to prove that      actually does take place.

termined with much labour and skill the influence of difference of specific
gravity and of the earth's rotation as causes of the Gulf-stream.        The fol

and rotation on the return current from the Arctic regions to the Gulf of
Mexico.
  Dr. Colding appears, however, to leave out of account molecular resist
ance to motion.    He says, " we do not know at present      the molecules
                                                                      if
of water or air move without resistance."      But, for reasons which will
come under our consideration, Dr. Colding appears to have greatly over
estimated the influence of gravity in the production of motion.

will circulate in consequence of difference of specific gravity re
sulting from difference of temperature. But this does not require
proof; for no physicist denies it. The point which requires to
be proved is this.        Is the difference of specific gravity which
exists  in  the ocean sufficient to produce the supposed circulation ?
Now his mode of experimenting will not prove this, unless he
makes the conditions of his experiment agree with what actually
exists in the ocean.        These conditions     I  have already stated at
considerable length in my last paper*.                If his trough be as
much as 1 inch in depth,         it will require   to  be upwards of 120
feet in length.      Let the surface-temperature of the water at one
 eud of such a trough be 80°, decreasing from the surface down
 wards till at the depth of half an inch it is as low as 30° or 32°,
 and let the water at the other end be kept at 32°, or as low as
 it can be kept without freezing.           If the experiment succeeds
 under these conditions, his point will be established.
          I
    But most decidedly object to the water being heated in the
 way in which it has been done by him in his experiment before
 the Royal Geographical Society ; for         I feel pretty confident that
 in this experiment the circulation resulted not from difference of
 specific gravity, as was supposed, but rather from the way in
 which the heat was applied.         In that experiment the one half of
 a thick metallic plate was placed in contact with the upper sur
 face of the water at one end of the trough ; the other half, pro
jecting over the end of the trough, was heated by means of a spirit-
 lamp.      It is perfectly obvious that though the temperature of
 the great mass of the water under the plate might not be raised
 over 80° or so, yet the molecules in contact with the metal would
 have a very high temperature.          These molecules, in consequence
 of their expansion, would be unable to sink into the cooler and
 denser water underneath, and thus escape the heat which was
 being constantly communicated to them from the heated plate.
 But escape they must, or their temperature would continue to
 rise until they would ultimately burst into vapour.              They can
 not ascend, neither can they descend, but will be expelled by the
 heat from the plate in a horizontal direction.           The next layer of
 molecules from beneath would take their place and would be ex
 pelled in a similar manner, and this process would continue so
 long as the heat was applied to the plate.            A circulation would
 thus be established by the direct expansive force of vapour, and
 not in any way due to difference of specific gravity, as Dr. Car
penter supposes.
    The case referred to by him of the heating-apparatus in the
London University is also unsatisfactory.             The water leaves the
boiler at 120° and returns to it at 80°.            The difference of spe-

  cific gravity between the water leaving the boiler and the water
  returning to it is supposed to produce the circulation. It seems
 to me that this difference of specific gravity has nothing what
 ever to do with the matter.     The cause of the circulation must be
 sought for in the boiler itself, and not in the pipes. The heat is
 applied to the bottom of the boiler, not to the top. "What is the
 temperature of the molecules in contact with the bottom of the
 boiler directly over the fire, is a question which must be consi
 dered before we can arrive at a just determination of the causes
 which produce circulation in the pipes of a heating-apparatus
 such as that to which Dr. Carpenter refers.         But, in addition
 to this, as the heat is applied to the bottom of the boiler and not
 to the top, convection comes into play, a cause which, as we
 shall find, does not exist in the theory of oceanic circulation at
 present under our consideration.

 Carpenter's experiments circulation is effected by difference of
 specific gravity, still     I
                            freely admit that difference of specific
 gravity will produce a circulation such as that supposed by
him. Neither do          I
                         deny that the thing can be shown expe
 rimentally. What I affirm           is,

      The Force exerted     Gravity. — Sir John Herschel, in proving
                             by
that difference of specific gravity could not be the cause of ocean-
currents, adopted the second of the three methods to which                   I
 have referred  ; viz. he showed that the force of gravitation, acting
on the waters of the ocean in virtue of specific gravity,            notis
sufficient to produce the required motion.       Sir John in his cal
culations had taken 39° as the temperature of maximum den
sity.     The temperature of maximum density, however,            much
                                                                    is
lower than this and as Dr. Carpenter maintained that all de

of difference of specific gravity in causing motion,         calculated

in my paper what would be the force of gravity, taking 32°
to be the temperature of the greatest density instead of 39°,
and found that the force of gravitation was about the same as
when the temperaturejwas taken at 39°, — the reason being, that
when we take 32° as the temperature of maximum density, we
have 18 feet as the height of the ocean at the equator above the
place of maximum density, but then this place                 the pole,

density, though we have only 10 feet as the height of the
ocean at the equator above the place of maximum density,
this place is at lat. 56° instead of at the pole.   Now a slope of
10 feet from the equator to lat. 56° is about the same in steep
ness as a slope of 18 feet from the equator to the pole.   It there
fore follows that Herschel, in taking 39° as the temperature of
maximum density, did not underestimate the effect of gravity.
   Dr. Carpenter nowhere, so far as 1 am aware, calls in question
my estimate of the height at which the surface of the ocean at
the equator stands above that at the poles.    He does not say that
the slope from the equator to the poles is greater than         have                      I
estimated it to be, nor does he say that I have underestimated
the force of gravity impelling the water down this slope, in con
cluding it to be only one fourth of a grain on one cubic foot
(63 Ibs.) of water.    Neither does he affirm that a force so infi
nitesimal could produce the necessary circulation.      On the con
trary, he admits that it would not*, and says that justly main               I
tain that a circulation could not be sustained by this means.
He appears to admit my results so far as      have gone, but mainI
tains that    I
             have not gone far enough.                           I
                                              have justly estimated
the effects of heat, but       have, he I
                                        says, entirely ignored the
agency of cold.
                     " Mr. Croll," he says, " in arguing against
the doctrine of a General Oceanic Circulation sustained by dif
ference of temperature, and justly maintaining that such a cir
culation cannot be produced by the application of heat at the
surface, has entirely ignored this agency of cold "*.     And this
agency of cold which I have ignored he considers is of far greater
importance than the one which I advocate.       The agency of cold
he regards as the primum mobile of the general oceanic cir
culation.
   But surely Dr. Carpenter is mistaken in supposing that                                     I
have entirely ignored the agency of cold.        In what have ad                 I
vanced, as much has been attributed to cold as to heat.         The
height  of the surface  of the ocean at the  equator above the  sur
                      is is,
face at the poles     in my opinion, as much due to cold as to
heat.   The slope     due to the difference of density between the
equatorial and polar waters.       Now this difference      just as
much the result of the contraction of the polar water        cold as              by is
of the expansion of equatorial water       heat.        by
   It evident that the agency of cold referred to
      is                                                   Dr. Car               by
penter, which    have ignored, must be something else than the
                  I
mere influence of cold in the production of the slope    the con                 by
traction of the polar waters.   The cold, according to him, must
exercise some power in the way of producing motion of the water
over and above what        derived in virtue of the slope; and
                                   is

 also this power, whatever may be the way in which it acts, is
 far more effective iu producing motion than the slope ; for he
 regards it as the primum mobile of the whole affair, whereas the
 tendency of the water to run down the slope is regarded as a
secondary matter.
                                              I
    It is perfectly true that have not iu my paper on the sub
ject taken into account any such agency as this supposed by
Dr. Carpenter, for the simple reason that I know of no such
agency.      With the exception of an exceedingly trifling force,
which      I
           did not deem worthy of being taken into account, and
to which       I
               shall have occasion shortly to refer, I know of no
possible agency arising from difference of specific gravity tend
ing to produce circulation other than the force impelling the water
down the slope.
    The Work performed by Gravity. — But in order clearly to
 understand this point, it will be better to treat the matter ac
cording to the third method, and consider not the mere force of
gravity impelling the waters, but the amount of work which
gravitation is capable of performing.
    Assuming, then, the correctness of my estimate, that the height
of the surface of the ocean at the equator above that at the poles
is 18 feet, a pound of water in flowing down the slope from the
equator to either of the poles will perform 18 foot-pounds of
work. Or, more properly speaking, in the descent of a pound of
water down this slope from the equator to the pole gravitation
performs 18 foot-pounds of work.             Now it is evident that
when this pound of water has reached the pole, it is at the bot
tom of the slope, and consequently cannot descend further.
Therefore gravity cannot perform any more work upon it; for
gravity cannot perform work unless the thing acted upon de
scend — that      moves under the force exerted. But the water will

upon the water of the polar basin will be to reduce the tempe

and light, by the time it reaches the pole becomes cold and
dense.      But unless it be denser than the polar water under
neath, it will not sink down through it*.           But why should it be
colder than the
                      " whole mass " underneath, which, according to
Dr. Carpenter, is cooled by polar cold ? He does not explain
how this becomes the case.            But that he does suppose it to sink
to the bottom       in  consequence of its contraction by cold would
aeem from the following quotation : —
    " Until it is clearly apprehended that sea-water becomes more
and more dense as its temperature is reduced, and that it con
sequently continues to sink until it freezes, the immense motor
power of polar cold cannot be apprehended.                   But when this
has been clearly recognized, it is seen that the application of
cold at the surface is precisely equivalent as a moving power to
that application of heat at the bottom by which the circulation of
water is sustained in every heating-apparatus that makes use of
it." (§    25.)
    Here he says that the application            of cold at the surface is
equivalent      as a motor     power   to the  application of heat at the
bottom.       But the way in which heat applied to the bottom of a
vessel produces circulation is by convection.             It makes the mo
lecules at the bottom expand, and they, in consequence of buoy
ancy, rise through the water in the vessel.            Consequently if the
action of cold at      the  surface in  polar regions  is  equivalent to that
of heat, the cold must contract the molecules at the surface aud
make them sink through the mass of polar water beneath.                  But
assuming      this  to  be  his meaning,    how  much     colder is this sur
face-water than the water beneath ? Suppose there is one degree
of difference.       How much work, then, will gravity perform upon
this one pound of water which is one degree colder than the
mass beneath supposed to be at 32° ?             The force with which the
pound     of  water   will  sink  will not be  proportional to its weight,
but to the difference of weight between it and a similar bulk of
the water through which it sinks.             The difference between the
weight of a pound of water at 31° and an equal volume of
Water at 32° is 2$Jn0 of a pound.               Now this pound of water
in sinking to a depth of 10,000 feet, which is about the depth
at which a polar temperature is found at the equator, would per
form only one third of a foot-pound of work. And supposing
it were three degrees colder than the water beneath, it would in
sinking perform only one foot-pound. This would give us only
   *  It is a well-established fact that in polar regions the temperature of
the sea decreases from the surface downwards ; and the German Polar Ex
pedition found that the water in very high latitudes is actually less dense
at the surface than at considerable depths, thus proving that the surface-
water could not sink in consequence of its greater density.

    Mr.     J.   Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.   249
18 + 1 = 19 foot-pounds as the total amount that could be per
formed by gravitation on the pound of water from the time that
it left the equator till it returned to where it started. The
amount of work performed in descending the slope from the
equator to the pole and in sinking to a depth of 10,000 feet or
so through the polar water assumed to be warmer than the sur
face-water, comprehends the total amount of work that gravita
tion can possibly perform ; so that the amount of force gained
by such a supposition over and above that derived from the slope
is trifling.
    But it would appear that this, after all, is not what Dr. Car
penter means, but something entirely different. What he means
seems to be this : when a quantity of water, say a layer one foot
thick, flows down from the equator to the pole, the polar column
becomes then heavier than the equatorial by the weight of this
additional layer.     A layer of water equal in quantity is therefore
pressed away from the bottom of the column and flows off in the
 direction of the equator as an undercurrent, the polar column at
 the same time sinking down one foot until equilibrium of the
 polar and equatorial columns is restored.     Another foot of water
 now flows down upon      the polar column and  another foot of water
 is displaced from below, causing, of course, the column to de
 scend an additional foot.     The same process being continually
 repeated,   a constant  downward    motion of the polar column is
 the result.    Or perhaps, to express the matter more accurately,
 owing to the constant flow of water from the equatorial regions
 down the slope, the weight of the polar column is kept always
 in excess of that of the equatorial ; therefore the polar column
 in the effort to restore equilibrium is kept in a constant state
                 Hence he terms it a " vertical
 of descent.
                                                 " circulation. The
 following will show Dr. Carpenter's theory in his own words.

 be exerted as follows : —

      (a) In diminishing the height of the polar column as com
 pared with that of the equatorial, so that a lowering of its

like that which exists in the water of a tall jar when an opening
is made at its bottom, and the water which flows away through
it is replaced by an equivalent supply poured into the top of

water down the slope) comprehends all the work that gravitation
can perform on         pound of water in making

from the equator to the pole and from the pole back to the
equator.
    This,I    trust, will be evident from the following considera
tions.     When       pound of water has flowed down from the equa
                         a
tor to the pole,        has descended 18 feet, and
                          it                                  then at the foot

of the slope. Gravity has therefore no more power to pull                                 it
 down to lower level.

 forit   is not denser than the water beneath on which                    rests.it
 But Dr. Carpenter will reply, Although               will not sink through

 the polar water,          has nevertheless made the polar column
                              it
 heavier than the equatorial, and this excess of pressure forces a
 pound of water out from beneath and allows the column to
 descend.      Suppose      quantity of water to flow down from the
                                 a
 equator so as to raise the level of the polar water by, say,
feet.     The polar column        now heavier than the equatorial
                                        is                                                by 2

                                 gravity in causing the water to fall
 down the slope from the equator to the pole, and, in addition
to this,  a  certain amount             is
                                  performed                by
                                                    gravity in the vertical
descent of the column.
 I     freely admit this to be sound reasoning, and admit that so
 much    is due to the slope and so much to the vertical descent of
 the water.      In my original way of looking at the problem,               re   I
 garded    the  entire force  as due  to  the  slope.     In   Dr.  Carpenter's
 way of looking at        thereit   also the slope, but there
                                            is                           in ad  is,
 dition to       the vertical descent of the water.
                  it,
     But here we come to the most important point, viz.                   there  is
 the full slope of 18 feet and an additional vertical movement                            ?
 Dr. Carpenter seems to conclude that there                          is,
                                                            and that this ver
 tical force      something in addition to the force which
                   is                                                    derive 1
 from the slope.       And here, venture to think,
                                             I                      the radical

 error into which he has fallen in regard to the whole matter.

      Mr.  J. Croll on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.      251
    But let the point at issue be here clearly and distinctly un
derstood.                       I
              In my last paper showed that the difference of tem
perature between the sea in equatorial and polar regions makes a
difference of level of 18 feet, and that the force of gravity derived
from a slope so small is insufficient to produce the circulation
which Dr. Carpenter supposes. Dr. Carpenter admits this, but
maintains that there is a vertical descent of the water at the
poles, and that the force derived from this vertical descent is the
primum mobile of the circulation, — in short, that though the force
derived from the mere slope is insufficient, nevertheless when we
take into account the force of the vertical descent of the water, a
thing which he supposes I have overlooked, we have a cause per
fectly sufficient to produce the necessary circulation.        This is
the general conclusion arrived at by Dr. Carpenter.        Now let it
be observed that     I  admit, when water circulates from difference
of specific gravity, this vertical movement is just as real a part
of the process as the flow down the slope ; but the point which
I   maintain, is that there is no additional power derived
                                                             from this
vertical movement over and above what is derived from the full
slope — or, in other words, that this primum mobile, which lie
 says  I  have overlooked, has in reality no existence.      Now, if I
 manage to establish this point,    I trust it will be obvious to the
 reader that Dr. Carpenter's theory is untenable.
     In Dr. Carpenter's way of looking at the problem, as in mine,
 gravity can perform only 18 foot-pounds of work per pound
 of water.     In his way of treating the problem, the amount
 of work performed by the pound of water in first flowing
 down the slope and then in descending vertically, when added
 together, amounts to exactly 18 foot-pounds.          The reason is
 obvious ; for whatever work is gained by vertical descent is
just so much deducted from the work of descending the slope.
 If the pound of water on reaching the pole descends verti
 cally 2 feet, it must have descended only 16 feet in coming
 down the slope.       Suppose water has flowed down upon the polar
 seas so as to restore the level by, say, 2 feet ; the polar column
 is now too heavy by the extent of 2 feet of water, and the slope
 is therefore reduced from 18 feet to 16 feet.          Suppose that
 while this condition of things remains, a pound of water leaves
 the equator and flows down the slope to the pole.        In perform
 ing this journey it descends only 16 feet, and consequently only
  16 foot-pounds of work is performed.         The pressure of the 2
 feet of water on the top of the polar column is supposed now to
 begin to act; water is pressed out laterally from beneath; the
 column descends 2 feet, and equilibrium between the equatorial
 and polar columns is restored.       The pound of water in this pro
  cess of course descends vertically 2 feet, and consequently 2

252     Mr.    J.   Croll   on the     Physical Cause        of Ocean-currents.
foot-pounds of work is performed.       But this 2 foot-pounds,
added to the 16 foot-pounds, gives simply 18 foot-pounds.
Therefore, so far as the amount of work is concerned, it is the
same whether the pound of water is supposed to descend through
the full slope of 18 feet, or to descend first through a slope of
16 feet and then vertically through the remaining 2 feet.
    Perhaps the following diagram will help to make the point
still clearer.
                                        Fig.   1.
    Let P (fig. 1) be the surface of the ocean at the pole, and E
 the surface at the equator ; P 0 a column of water at the pole,
 and E Q a column at the equator.         The two columns are of equal
 weight and balance each other ; but as the polar water is colder,
 and consequently denser than the equatorial, the polar column
 is shorter than the equatorial, the difference in the length of the
 two columns being 18 feet.           The surface of the ocean at the
 equator E is 18 feet higher than the surface of the ocean at the
 pole P ; there is therefore a slope of 18 feet from E to P. The
 molecules of water at E tend to flow down this slope towards P.
 The amount of work performed by gravity in the descent of a
 pound of water down this slope from E to P is therefore 18
foot-pounds.        This represents the state of things in the way in
which  I    have viewed the problem.       Dr. Carpenter does not ob
ject   to all this.   It is an essential part of his theory that there is
 a slope   from  the equator to the pole.     The amount of this slope
is,  in his way of looking at the question, as in mine, proportional
to the difference of density between the polar column and the
equatorial ;    and as he has not called in question my estimate of
the difference of density of the two columns,            presume that he
                                                              I
admits that the slope        isabout 18 feet.   And of course he will
admit that, in the descent of          pound of water down this slope,
                                         a
18 foot-pounds of work            is
                                 performed      gravity.by  But he repre
sents the operation as occurring thus — As the equatorial column
                                                    :
is  higher than the polar, when the two are in equilibrium water
tends to flow down this slope from the equator to the pole as                     a
surface-current.       He assumes this flow to continue till the level

       Mr.  J.  Croll  on the Physical  Cause of Ocean-currents.    253
is in whole or in part restored.       Take the latter supposition, and
suppose that water has flowed down till an addition of 2 feet of
water is made to the polar column, and the difference of level, of
course, diminished by 2 feet.         The surface of the ocean in this
case will now be represented by the dotted line P' E, and the
slope reduced from 18 feet to 16 feet.           Let us then suppose a
pound of water to leave E and flow down to P' ; 16 foot-pounds
 will be the amount of work performed.          The polar column being
now too heavy by the extent of the mass of water P'P 2 feet thick,
its extra pressure causes a mass of water equal to P' P to flow off
laterally from the bottom of the column.             The column there
fore sinks down 2 feet till P' reaches P.           Now the pound of
 water in this vertical descent from P' to P has 2 foot-pounds of
 work performed on it by gravity ; this, added to the 16 foot
 pounds derived from the slope, gives a total of 18 foot-pounds
 in passing from E to P' and then from P' to P. This is the
 same amount of work that would have been performed had it
 descended directly from E to P.            In like manner it can be
 proved    that  18  foot-pounds  is the  amount  of work performed in
 the descent of every pound of water of       the mass P' P.    The first
 pound which left E flowed down the slope directly to P, and per
 formed 18 foot-pounds of work.           The last pound flowed down
 the slope E P', and performed only 16 foot-pounds ; but in de
  scending from P* to P it performed the other 2 foot-pounds.          A
  pound leaving at a period exactly intermediate between the two
  flowed down 17 feet of slope and descended vertically 1 foot.
 Whatever path a pound of water might take, by the time that it
  reached P 18 foot-pounds of work would be performed. But no
 further work can be performed after it reaches P.
     But some will ask, in regard to the vertical movement, is it
  only in the descent of the water from P' to P that work is per
  formed ? Water cannot descend from P' to P, it will be urged,
  unless the entire column P 0 underneath descend also.          But the
  column P 0 descends by means of gravity. Why, then, it will
  be asked, is not the descent of the column a motive power as real
  as the descent of the mass of water P' P ?
     Does Dr. Carpenter suppose that motive power is derived from
  the descent of the polar column P O ? Unless he does so, it is
  difficult to understand what he means by saying that, according
  to his theory, " the deep efflux of polar water is considered as the
 primum mobile of the General Oceanic Vertical Circulation"
  (§ 29). Again, unless he considers that the descent of the water
  below the level of P is a motive power, what grounds can he have
  for asserting that    I have ignored the primum mobile of the whole
  affair ? Gravity cannot perform any more work upon the water
  above the level of P than what is derived from the slope ; and

 254       Mr.      J.   Croll     on the   Physical Catise of Ocean- currents.
  unless he can show that gravity performs work in the way of
  impelling the water in addition to what I have pointed out, it
  cannot be said that              I
                               have overlooked the influence of any force.
     That neither force nor energy can be derived from the mere
  descent of the polar column P 0 is easily proved.                     The reason
  why the column P 0 descends is because, in consequence of the

  are already at         P,
                         and therefore cannot perform any work.                 The
  mean distance through which the entire mass performs work                                            is
  therefore    1  foot.     One foot-pound per pound of water repre
  sents in this case the amount of work derived from tae vertical
  movement.
     That such       isthe case        further evident from the following
                                           is
  considerations.       Before the polar column begins to descend,                                it   is
  heavier than the equatorial                   by
                                           the weight of two feet of water;
  but when the column has descended one foot, the polar column
'is  heavier than the equatorial               the weight of only one foot of
                                                     by
  water; and,      as the   column     continues    to descend, the force with
  which   it descends continues to diminish, and when                     has sunk       it
  to  P   the force       iszero.    Consequently the mean pressure or
  weight with which the two feet of water P'                       descended was
                                                                            P

  each pound of water, taking the                mass   as     whole, descended
                                                                       a

  descending two feet performs one foot-pound so that whether              ;

       Mr.  J. Croll  on the  Physical   Cause  of Ocean-currents.     255
we consider the full pressure acting through the mean distance,
or the mean pressure acting through the full distance, we get the
same result, viz. one foot-pound as the work of vertical descent.
     Now it will be found, as we shall presently see, that if we cal
culate the mean amount of work performed in descending the
slope from the equator to the pole, 17 foot-pounds per pound of
water is the amount.         The water at the bottom of the mass P P'
moved, of course, down the full slope E P 18 feet.             The water
at the top of the mass which descended from E to P' descended a
slope of only 16 feet.        The mean descent of the whole mass is
therefore 17 feet.       And this gives 17 foot-pounds as the mean
 amount of work per pound of water in descending the slope ;
this, added to the 1 foot-pound derived from vertical descent,
 gives 18 foot-pounds as the total amount of work per pound of
 the mass.
     I  have in the above reasoning supposed 2 feet of water accu
 mulated on the polar column before any vertical descent takes
 place.     It is needless to remark that the same conclusion would
 have been arrived at, viz. that the total amount of work performed
 is 18 foot-pounds per pound of water, supposing we had con
  sidered 3 feet, or 4 feet, or even 18 feet of water to have accu
  mulated on the polar column before vertical motion took place.
      I have also, in agreement with Dr. Carpenter's mode of repre
  senting the operation, been considering the two effects, viz. the
 flowing of the water down the slope and the vertical descent of
  the polar column as taking place alternately.           In nature, how
  ever, the two effects take place simultaneously ; but it is needless
  to add that the amount of work performed would be the same
  whether the effects took place alternately or simultaneously.
      I have also represented the level of the ocean at the equator as
  remaining permanent while the alterations of level were taking
  place at the pole.      But in representing the operation as it would
  actually take place in nature, we should consider the equatorial
  column to be lowered as the polar one is being raised. We
  should, for example, consider the two feet of water P' P put upon
  the polar column as so much taken off the equatorial column.
  But in viewing the problem thus we arrive at exactly the same
  results as before, as we shall presently see.
      Let P (fig. 2), as in fig. 1, be the surface of the ocean at the pole,
   and E the surface at the equator, there being a slope of 18 feet
   from E to P.     Suppose now a quantity of water, E E', say, 2 feet
   thick, to flow from off the equatorial regions down upon the
  polar.     It will thus lower the level of the equatorial column by
   2 feet, and raise the level of the polar column by the same
   amount.      I may, however, observe that the two feet of water in
   passing from E to P would have its temperature reduced from

80° to 32°, and this would produce a slight contraction.                   But
as the weight of the mass would not be affected, in order to sim-
                                     Fig.   2.
                                                                           E
                                                                           B'
plify our reasoning we may leave this contraction out of consi
deration.     Any one can easily satisfy himself that the assump
tion that E E' is equal to P' P does not in any way affect the
question at issue — the only effect of the contraction being to
increase by an infinitesimal amount the work done in descending
the slope, and to diminish by an equally infinitesimal amount
the work done in the vertical descent.                  If, for example, 16
foot-pounds represent     the  amount   of    work    performed in descend
ing  the  slope, and  2  foot-pounds    the       amount    performed in the
vertical descent, on the supposition           that  E' E  does   not contract
in passing to the pole, then 16-0048 foot-pounds will represent
the work of the slope, and l-9952 foot-pound the work of ver
tical descent when allowance is made for the contraction.                  But
the total   amount  of  work    performed        is the  same   in  both cases.
Consequently, to simplify our reasoning, we may be allowed to
assume P' P to be equal to E E'.
    The slope E P being 18 feet, the slope E' P' is consequently
14 feet ; the mean slope for the entire mass is therefore 16
feet.   The mean amount of work -performed by the descent of
the mass will of course be 16 foot-pounds per pound of water.
The amount of work performed by the vertical descent of P' P
ought therefore to be 2 foot-pounds per pound.                     That this is
the amount     will  be  evident   thus   : —    The   transference of the 2
feet of water from the equatorial column to the polar disturbs
the equilibrium by making the equatorial column too light by
2 feet of water and the polar column too heavy by the same
amount of water.       The polar column will therefore tend to sink,
and the equatorial to rise till equilibrium is restored.              The dif
ference of weight of the two columns being equal to 4 feet of
water, the polar column will begin to descend with a pressure
of 4 feet of water ; and the equatorial column will begin to rise
with an equal amount of pressure.                 When the polar column

      Mr.   J. Croll on  the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.     257
 has descended 1 foot the equatorial column will have risen 1
foot.    The pressure of the descending polar column will now
 be reduced to 2 feet of water.       And when the polar column has
 descended another foot, P' will have reached P, and E' will have
 reached E ; the two columns will then be in equilibrium.           It
 therefore follows that the mean pressure with which the polar
 column descended the 2 feet was equal to the pressure of 2 feet
 of water. Consequently the mean amount of work performed
by the descent of the mass was equal to 2 foot-pounds per pound
 of water; this, added to the 16 foot-pounds derived from the
 slope, gives a total of 18 foot-pounds.
    In whatever way we view the question, we are led to the con
clusion that if 18 feet represent the amount of slope between the
equatorial and polar columns when the two are in equilibrium,
then 18 foot-pounds is the total amount of work that gravity
can perform upon a pound of water in overcoming the resistance
to motion in its passage from the equator to the pole down the
slope, and then in its vertical descent to the bottom of the ocean.
    But it will be replied, not only does the 2 feet of water P' P
descend, but the entire column P 0, 10,000 feet in length, de
scends also.       What, then, it will be asked, becomes of the force
which gravity exerts in the descent of this column ?         We shall
shortly   see  that this force is entirely applied to the overcoming
of the resistance offered by gravity to the motion of the water
in other parts of the circuit ; so that not a single foot-pound
of this force goes to overcome cohesion, friction, and other
resistances ; it is all spent in counteracting the efforts which
gravity exerts to stop the current in another part of the circuit.
This vertical descent is therefore, not as Dr. Carpenter concludes,
some power which I had omitted to take into account in my
former determinations.
    I shall now consider the next part of the movement, viz. the
under or return current from the bottom of the polar column
to the bottom of the equatorial.        What produces this current ?
It is needless to say that it cannot be caused directly by gra
vity. Gravitation cannot directly draw any body horizontally
along the earth's surface. The water that forms this current
is pressed out laterally by the weight of the polar column, and
flows, or rather is pushed, towards the equator to supply the
vacancy caused by the ascent of the equatorial column.          There
is a constant    flow of water  from  the  equator to the poles along
the surface, and this draining of the water from the equator
is supplied by the under or return current from the poles.
But the only power which can impel the water from the bottom
of the polar column to the bottom of the equatorial column
is the pressure of the polar column. But whence does the polar

258     Mr.   J.   Croll on     the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
column derive its pressure?    It can only press to the extent
that its weight exceeds that of the equatorial column.    That
which exerts the pressure is therefore the mass of water which
has flowed down the slope from the equator upon the polar
column. It is in this case the vertical movement that causes
this undercurrent.        The energy which produces this current
must consequently be derived from the 18 foot-pounds result
ing from the slope ; for the energy of the vertical movement,
as has already been proved, is derived from this source; or,
in other words, whatever power this vertical movement may
exert is so much deducted from the 18 foot-pounds derived
from the full slope.
     Let us now consider the fourth and last movement, viz. the
ascent of the undercurrent to the surface of the ocean at the
 equator.      When this cold undercurrent reaches the equatorial
 regions,   it ascends to the surface to where it originally started
 on its circuit.     What, then, lifts the water from the bottom of
 the equatorial column to its top ? This cannot be done directly,
 either by heat or by gravity.        When heat, for example, is ap
 plied to the bottom of a vessel, the heated water at the bottom
 expands and, becoming lighter than the water above, rises
 through it to the surface ; but if the heat be applied to the sur
 face of the water instead of to the bottom, the heat will not pro
  duce an ascending current.        It will tend rather to prevent such
  a current, than to produce one — the reason being that each
  successive layer of water will, on account of the heat applied,
  become hotter and consequently lighter than the layer below                         it,
  and colder and consequently heavier than the layer above it.
It    therefore cannot ascend, because            too heavy
                                                 it   is        nor can  ;            it
  descend, because        it too
                               islight.    But  the sea in equatorial re
  gions is   heated from above, and not from below            consequently
                                                                 ;
  the water at the bottom does not rise to the surface at the equa
  tor in consequence of the heat which              receives.
                                                      it            layer of A
  water can never raise the temperature of             layer
                                                           a  below     to       it   a
  higher temperature than itself; and since             cannot do this,
                                                           it                         it
  cannot make the layer under          lighter than itself.
                                         it                    That which
  raises the water at the equator, according to Dr. Carpenter's
  theory, must be the downward pressure of the polar column.
  When water flows down the slope from the equator to the pole,
  the polar column, as we have seen, becomes too heavy and the
  equatorial column too light          the former_ then sinks and the
                                         ;
  latter rises.     It     the sinking of the polar column which
                          is
  raises the equatorial one.       When the polar column descends,
  as much water      ispressed underneath the equatorial column as
     pressed from underneath the polar column.                  If
                                                              foot of water
is is

      pressed   from   under   the  polar column,        foot of water

    Mr.   J.   Croll   on the    Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.       259
pressed    under the equatorial column.          Thus, when the polar
 column sinks a foot, the equatorial column rises by the same
 extent.    The equatorial water continuing to flow down the
 slope, the polar column descends;           a foot of water is again
 pressed from underneath        the polar column and a foot pressed
under the equatorial.          As foot after foot is thus removed
from the bottom of the polar column while it sinks, foot after
foot is pushed under the equatorial column while it rises ; so
by this means the water at the surface of the ocean in polar re
gions descends to the bottom, and the water at the bottom in
equatorial regions ascends to the surface — the effect of solar
heat and polar cold continuing, of course, to maintain the sur
face of the ocean in equatorial regions at a higher level than at
the poles, and thus keeping up a constant state of disturbed
equilibrium. Or, to state the matter in Dr. Carpenter's own
words,
         " The cold and dense polar water, as it flows in at the
bottom of the equatorial column, will not directly take the place
of that which has been drafted off from the surface ; but this
place will be filled by the rising of the whole superincumbent
column, which, being warmer, is also lighter than the cold

    But the agency which raises the water of the undercurrent up
to the surface    is  the pressure of the polar column.         The equa
torial column cannot rise directly               by
                                               means of gravity.      Gra
vity,  instead   of raising  the  column,   exerts all its powers  to pre
vent its rising.        Gravity here        isforce acting against the
                                                 a
current.     It  is  the descent of the polar column, as has been
stated, that raises the equatorial column.             Consequently    the
entire amount of work performed                  by
                                              gravity in pulling down

Gravity performs exactly as much work in preventing motion
in the equatorial column as           performs

                        ;
Carpenter's circulation are concerned, gravity may be said
neither to produce motion nor to prevent it. And this re

Gravity then exerts more force in pulling the polar column down
than it does in preventing the equatorial column from rising ;
and the consequence is that the polar column begins to descend
and the equatorial column to rise.        But as the polar column
continues to descend     and  the  equatorial to rise, the power   of
gravity to produce motion in the polar column diminishes, and
the power of gravity to prevent motion in the equatorial column
increases ; and when P' descends to P and E' rises to E, the
power of gravity to prevent motion in the equatorial column is
exactly equal to the power of gravity to produce motion in the
polar column, and consequently motion ceases.            It therefore
follows that the entire amount of work performed by the descent
of P' P is spent in raising E' E against gravity.
    It follows also that inequalities in the sea-bottom cannot in
any way aid the circulation ; for although the cold undercurrent
should in its progress come to a deep trough filled with water
less dense than itself, it would no doubt sink to the bottom of
the hollow ; but before it could get out again as much work
would have to be performed against gravity as was performed
by gravity in sinking it.      But whilst inequalities in the bed of
the ocean would not aid the current, they would nevertheless
very considerably retard it by the obstructions which they would
offer to the motion of the water.
    We have been assuming that the weight of P' P is equal to
that of E E' ; but the mass     P P must be greater than E E7, be-
cause P' P has not only to raise E E', but it has to impel the
undercurrent — to push the water along the sea-bottom from the
pole to the equator.     So we must have a mass of water, in addi
tion to P' P, placed on the polar column to enable it to produce
the undercurrent in addition to the raising of the equatorial
column.
    It follows also that the amount of work which can be per
formed by gravity depends entirely on the difference of tempe
 rature between the equatorial and the polar waters, and is
 wholly independent of the way in which the temperature may
 decrease from the equator to the poles.      Suppose, in agreement
                                        '
 with Dr. Carpenter's idea (' Nature for July 6, 1871), that the
 equatorial heat and polar cold should be confined to limited
 areas, and that through the intermediate      space no great differ
 ence of temperature should prevail.       Such an arrangement as
 this would not increase the amount of work which gravity could
 perform ; it would simply make the slope steeper at the two
 extremes and flatter in the intervening space.         It would no
 doubt aid the surface-flow of the water near the equator and
 the poles, but it would retard in a corresponding degree the
 flow of the water in the intermediate regions.          In short, it

          Mr.    J.   Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.                   261
would merely destroy the uniformity of the slope without aiding
in the least degree the general motion of the water.
      I trust,
             from what has been already stated, it is obvious that
       " primum         "
the              mobile    of Dr. Carpenter has in reality no exist
ence,  and  that the energy derived from the full slope, whatever that
slope may be, comprehends all that can possibly be obtained from
gravity.     This being the case, there     according to Dr. Carpen
                                                       is,

which he assumes.
      Ifthis full slope, as has been proved             direct experi        by

ascending currents.
    The slope, according to Dr. Carpenter's data, ought to be less
than 18 feet.

            is                  slope of 18 feet

differences in the height of the two columns, as has been stated
on    former occasion, were made on the assumption that " the

temperature takes place within no very great depth from the

with me, that the principal part of the excess of temperature at
the equator      at the surface, and does not extend to any great

to reduce the temperature of its whole mass below the freezing-
point of fresh water" (§ 22). Here Dr. Carpenter not only
admits that the greater heating effect of the tropical sun is for
the most part confined to the
                                 " uppermost stratum," but he goes
further, and admits that its effect " may here be practically rfw-
regarded."      But it seems to me that if the heating of the upper
stratum be practically disregarded, then, so far as his theory
is concerned, every thing else may be also practically disregarded.
 For, according to his theory, difference of density is due to dif
ference of temperature; but, on the other hand, the temperature of
 the sea in intertropical regions differs from that of the sea in polar
regions only so far as the warm upper stratum is concerned.
 The tropical sea is warmer than the polar, just because it receives
 more heat from the sun than the polar. But the heat of the sun is
received on the surface of the sea ; it is " surface-heat."      If this
 warm upper stratum in tropical regions be left out of account,
 then there is actually no difference whatever between the tem
 perature of the sea in tropical and polar regions.       And if there
 is no difference in temperature, there can be no difference in
 specific gravity, and consequently nothing, according to Dr. Car
 penter's theory, that can possibly move the water.         Cold is not
 a something positive imparted to the polar waters giving them
 motion, and of which the tropical waters are deprived.           If  we
 dip one hand in a basin filled with tropical water at 80° and the
 other in a basin filled with polar water at 32°, referring to our
 sensations, we call the water in the one hot and the water in the
 other cold ; but so far as the water itself is concerned, heat and
 cold simply mean difference in the amounts of heat possessed.
 Both the polar and the tropical water possess a certain amount of
 energy in the form of heat, only the polar water does not possess
 so much of it as the tropical.
     But we have more than a mere statement that the excess of heat
 in equatorial regions is chiefly confined to the upper stratum of
 the ocean. Dr. Carpenter affords us positive evidence on the. sub
 ject. From a series of three observations made in the Mediter
  ranean, he found that the superheating produced by the direct
 action of the sun upon the surface " is almost entirely limited to
 a stratum fifty fathoms deep, the descent of the thermometer
  being most marked in the first twenty fathoms" (§ 40). Fortu
  nately one of the observations was made at a place where the
  temperature of the water at the surface was as high as 77°,
 which is within 3° of what    I have in my calculations assumed to
 to be the surface-temperature of the sea in equatorial regions.
 The following Table will show the rate at which Dr. Carpenter
 found the temperature to sink from the surface to the depth of
  100 fathoms :—

    Column II. shows the temperature as observed by Dr. Car
penter.      If  a similar rate of decrease takes place at the equator,
which is highly probable, then column                     III.
                                                       will show the tem
peratures    at   the  equator  to  the depth  of 100   fathoms.     Dr. Car
penter says that in the Atlantic            he  "found      that, after pass
ing through the heated surface-layer, there was a slow nearly
uniform descent of temperature down to the ' stratum of inter
mixture/ in which there was another sudden drop of 10°." We
may therefore in our calculations assume the decrease of tempe
rature to be uniform below 100 fathoms. We have now a means
of determining with more accuracy than before the actual height
of the surface of the ocean at the equator above that at the poles.
Taking, as before, Muncke's Table of the rate of expansion of sea-
water, it turns out that the height of the equatorial column above
 the polar amounts to little more than 8 feet.               But to give Dr.
 Carpenter's theory full justice,            I
                                          shall assume the temperature of
 polar water from the surface to the bottom to be not 32°, but
three degrees lower, viz. 29°.           This will make the slope from the
equator to the pole about 9 feet, or one half what                         I
                                                                  had made it
 in my former paper.          The distance from the equator to the poles
 is 32,758,000 feet.         But to simplify calculations, let us take
the distance in round numbers at 31,500,000 feet.                 This reduc
 tion  of the distance          is,
                               of course, so    far  in   favour  of Dr. Car

 feet in length and        9feet in height. The height of the plane to
its length     is  therefore as    to 3,500,000. According to the prin

considerable resistance to motion.       Now, if the resistance offered
by water to motion exceeds the pressure of -g^ of a grain per
pound, gravity will be unable to cause the water to flow down
the incline under consideration ; for were it to do so, the work
of the resistances would exceed the work of gravity — a thing
impossible.      If the resistances of the water to motion equalled
s J-0 of a   grain  per pound, the entire      foot-pounds of energy

would be expended in carrying the pound of water from the
equator to the pole, and no energy would remain to cause
the water to descend to the bottom of the ocean, to return to the
equator as an under current, and then to ascend to the surface.                   If
we assume, what certainly must be the case, that the total amount

whether or not 9 foot-pounds is sufficient to carry a pound of
water from the equator to the pole as a surface-current,        and
back from the pole to the equator as an undercurrent.
   Dr. Carpenter must either show that the total amount of work
that can be performed by gravity on a pound of water in its
entire circuit from the equator to the pole and back to where it
started exceeds 9 foot-pounds, or else that the mean force of the
resistances to the motion of the pound of water is under TO^O-
of a grain. Unless he can do this, he is not warranted to con
clude that the General Oceanic Circulation which he advocates
is even a physical possibility, far less a physical necessity.
   But this force of y^ff of a grain, infinitesimal as it      holds                  is,
true only in regard to the water at the surface.      The power of
gravity to produce motion decreases rapidly as we proceed down
wards    at
          ;   short distance below the surface
                   a                                 may be practi      it
cally disregarded.
   In determining whether certain slope be sufficient to produce
motion of the water, there             is a
                                  distinction of the utmost import
                                              a
ance which must be borne in mind; viz. we must consider
whether the slope be caused                   by
                                   difference of specific gravity or                          by
some other agency, such, for example, as the wind heaping up
the water. Suppose the ocean to be the same in density from the
equator to the poles, and that                     by
                                       some means or other the water
should be so heaped up or raised at the equator as to produce                                 a
difference of level of 18 feet between the equator and the poles.
It    more than probable that the force of gravity would in this
     is
case be sufficient to cause such       motion of the water as would
                                                   a
restore the level of the ocean      for the ocean would not be in
                                              ;                                               a
state of equilibrium when the water stood 18 feet higher at the
equator than at the poles, because the equatorial column would
exceed the polar           by
                      the weight of this 18 feet of water         conse               ;
quently the entire weight    of  this   mass  would be employed in
restoring the level.    But when the rise of 18 feet at the equator
is the result of specific gravity, the sea      in perfect equilibrium
                                                               is
and no pressure whatever        exerted
                                      is   the only thing in such
                                                        ;                                     a
case that could restore the level or produce motion         that almost      is
infinitesimal tendency that the molecules at the surface have to
roll down the slope.
 I   cannot but think that, on this account, Dr. Coldinghas very
much overestimated the power of gravity in the case of the Gulf-
stream.    He states that, in order to impel the waters of the
Gulf-stream through the Straits of Florida,        slope of    feet from
                                                                    a             9
the Gulf of Mexico to St. Augustine            necessity.    But differ
                                                        6 is
                                                            a
ence of specific gravity affords only        feet of slope    the addi        ;
tional three feet he assumes to be derived from the heaping up
of the water in the Gulf of Mexico under the influence of the

266       Mr.   J.  Croll on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents,
trade-winds. From these two causes he derives the necessary
slope of 9 feet.       But here a new agent is brought into play of
an entirely different character from that of the slope, viz. the
pressure of a mass of water 3 feet deep.          In consequence of this
the weight of a column of water in the Gulf of Mexico exceeds
that of a column in the North Atlantic by three feet of water.
Each square foot of the cross section of the Gulf-stream is thus
subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of about 190 pounds urging
the water forward.         The amount of work which this pressure is
capable of performing in a given time is proportionate to the
superficial area of the column ; but the superficial area of the
column is equal to that of the entire Gulf of Mexico ; we have,
therefore, in this three feet of water heaped up in the Gulf a
power sufficient of itself to produce a very considerable current
through such a narrow strait as that of Florida.           But were the
9 feet of slope wholly the result of difference of specific gravity,
the waters of the Gulf and the Atlantic would be in perfect
equilibrium, and there would then be no pressure from behind
impelling the water forward through the strait.          The only thing
which could then have any influence in producing a current
would be the force which gravity would exert on the mole
cules at the surface, tending to cause them to roll down the
slope, and which in the case of a slope so small would be but
trifling.     In the case of Dr. Carpenter's oceanic circulation,
this   force,  as we have just seen, amounts to only one five-hun
dredth of a grain on a pound of water.
    But there      are  other  causes  which  tend to reduce the slope
still further : — (1) There can be no permanent current while the
full slope of 9 feet remains.         A permanent current requires a
state of constant disturbed equilibrium between the equatorial
and polar columns ; and this again, as has been shown, neces
sarily implies a permanent reduction of slope. (2) Although the
polar waters are colder than the intertropical, yet they are not so
salt, and of course are, on this account, not so heavy.           (3) In
intertropical regions evaporation is in excess of precipitation ; but
in temperate and polar regions precipitation is in excess of eva
poration. This, to a certain extent, tends to lower the level of
the sea in intertropical regions, and to raise the level of the sea
in temperate and polar regions; so much water is removed from
the surface of the ocean in intertropical regions and poured
down as rain or snow upon the surface of the ocean in temperate
and polar regions.         In short, if there be any difference of level
between the surface of the ocean in equatorial and polar regions,
it must be trifling, indeed so trifling as to be absolutely incapable
of producing the motion supposed.
   It cannot be urged as an objection to what has been advanced

      Mr.  J.  Croll on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.     267
that   I have determined simply the amount of the force acting
on the water at the surface of the ocean and not that on the
water at all depths — that     I  have estimated the amount of work
which gravity can perform on a given quantity of water at the
surface, but not the total amount of work which gravity can
perform on the entire ocean.         This will not do as an objection,
because the surface of the ocean is the place where the greatest
difference of temperature, and consequently of density, exists be
tween the equatorial and polar waters, and therefore it is here
that gravity exerts its greatest force.      And if gravity be unable
to move the water at the surface, it is much less able to do so
under the surface.      So far as the question at issue is concerned,
any calculations as to the amount of force exerted by gravity
at various depths are needless.
    Dr. Carpenter, in proof of his theory, adduces the fact that
at a depth of 2000 fathoms or so the ocean, from the poles to
 the equator, has a temperature not above 32°.          He concludes,
 and that justly, that this low temperature at the equator is evi
 dence of the existence of an undercurrent from the poles to the
equator.      But he maintains, like Maury and others, that such
 an undercurrent could not result from the action of winds on the
 surface of the ocean, but must be due to difference of specific
 gravity. This opinion,      I find, is supported by no less authori
 ties than Sir William Thomson and Professor Stokes.          But with
 all due deference to these great physicists, I am, for the follow
 ing reasons, unable to accept such an opinion. Suppose, for
 argument's sake, that the Gulf-stream is caused by the winds,
 and that it flows into the Arctic seas.        It is evident that the
 water which is thus being constantly carried from the intertro-
 pical to the Arctic regions must in some way or other find its
 way back to the equator ; in other words, there must be a re
 turn-current equal in magnitude to the direct current. Now
 the question to be determined is what path must this return-
 current take ? It appears to me that it will take the path of least
 resistance, whether that path may happen to be at the surface
 or under the surface.      But that the path of least resistance will,
  as a general rule, lie at a very considerable distance below the
 surface is,   I think, evident from the following considerations.
 At the surface the general direction of the currents is opposite
 to that of the return-current.       The surface-motion of the water
  in the Atlantic is from the equator to the pole ; but the return-
  current must be from the pole to the equator.           Consequently
 the surface-currents will oppose the motion of any return-cur
 rent unless that current lie at a considerable depth below the
 surface-currents.     Again, the winds, as a general rule, blow in
 an opposite direction to the course of the return-current, because,

 268      Mr.  J. Croll on  the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
 according to supposition, the winds blow in the direction of the
 surface-currents.     From all these causes the path of least re
 sistance to the return-current will, as a general rule, not be at
 the surface, but at a very considerable depth below it.
    It is maintained also that the winds cannot produce a vertical
 current except under some very peculiar conditions.          We have
 already  seen  that, according to Dr. Carpenter's theory, the ver
 tical motion is caused by the water flowing off the equatorial
 column, down the slope, upon the polar column, thus destroy
 ing the equilibrium between the two by diminishing the weight
 of the equatorial column and increasing the weight of the polar
 column. In order that equilibrium may be restored, the polar
 column sinks and the equatorial one rises. Now must not the
 same effect occur, supposing the water to be transferred from the
 one column to the other, by the influence of the winds instead of
 by the influence of gravity ?      The vertical descent and ascent of
 these columns depend entirely upon the difference in their
 weights, and not upon the nature of the agency which makes
 this difference.     So far as difference of weight is concerned,
 2 feet of water, say, propelled down the slope from the equato
 rial column to the polar by the winds, will produce just the same
effect as though it had been propelled by gravity.          If vertical
 motion follows as a necessary consequence from a transference
 of water from the equator to the poles by gravity, it follows
 equally as a necessary consequence from the same transference
 by the winds; so that one is not at liberty to advocate a vertical
 circulation in the one case and to deny it in the other.
    Dr. Carpenter, as well as Maury, maintains that currents pro
duced by the winds cannot extend to any great depth.               It is
certainly true that sudden commotions caused by storms do not
generally extend to great depths.         Neither will winds of short
continuance produce a      current   extending far below the surface.
But prevailing winds which can produce such immense surface-
flow as that of the great equatorial currents of the globe and
the Gulf-stream, which follow definite directions, must commu
nicate their motion to great depths, unless water be frictionless,
a thing which it is not.        Suppose the upper layer of the ocean
to be forced on by the direct action of the winds with a constant
velocity of, say, four miles an hour, the layer immediately below
will be dragged along with a constant velocity somewhat less
than four miles an hour.        The layer immediately below this se
cond layer will in turn be also dragged along with a constant
velocity somewhat less than the one above it. The same will take
place in regard to each succeeding layer, the constant velocity of
each layer being somewhat less than the one immediately above it,
and greater than the one below it. The question to be determined

       Mr.      J.   Croll on   the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.                   269
is,              will all motion cease
       at what depth                     presume that at present
                                                      I
                                                      ?
we have not sufficient data for properly determining this point.
The depth depends upon the amount of molecular resistance
offered    the water to motion — in other words, on the amount
                by
of the shearing-force of the one layer over the other.      The
fact, however, that motion imparted to the surface will extend
to great depths can be easily shown                       by
                                               direct experiment.                          If
   constant motion be imparted to the surface of water, say,
in a   vessel, motion will ultimately be communicated
       a                                                          to the
bottom,    no  matter   how  wide  or  how  deep   the  vessel  may be.
The same effect will take place whether the vessel be                feet             5
deep or 500 feet deep.
    But      does not follow that though
             it                                 current, such as the
                                                          a
Gulf-stream, impelled                  by
                               the influence of the winds may not
extend to any great depth, the water which                conveys may  it
not descend to the bottom of the ocean. The water of the Gulf-
stream        much salter than the water of the North Atlantic.
                is
 Now        by
           the time that this salt water reaches the shores of, say,
 Iceland or the Shetlands, its temperature will be so far reduced
that though       may be 10° or 12° higher than the polar water
                      it
underneath, still, in consequence of its greater saltness,       may be          it
 actually denser, and on this account may sink to the bottom and
 displace the polar water.      In short, the difference in density
                                                                    is by
 between Ihe salt water of the Gulf-stream,            the time that                        it
 reaches our shores, and the cold polar water           so infinitesimal
 that    can exercise but little or no influence in determining the
           it
 position of the current. The fact pointed out                 Professor    by
 Wyville    Thomson     must  also  be  borne      mind,  viz. in
                                                                that the
 Gulf-stream flows    into an  almost  closed basin.

       If difference
                   of specific gravity fails in accounting for the cur
 rents of the  ocean  in general,    certainly fails in
                                            it            still more de a
 cided manner in accounting for the Gibraltar current.              The
 existence of the submarine ridge crossing between Capes Tra
 falgar and Spartel affects currents resulting from difference of
 specific gravity in     manner which does not seem to have sug
                                a
 gested itself to Dr.   Carpenter.    The pressure of water and other
 fluids    not like that of solid, say, the weight in the scale of
            is                          a
a   balance, simply      downward pressure.
                                a                  Fluids press down
 wards like the solids, but they also press laterally.         The pres
 sure  of water         is
                     hydrostatic.       we   fillIfbasin with water or
                                                               a
 any other fluid, the fluid remains in perfect equilibrium, pro
 vided the sides of the basin be sufficiently strong to resist the
 pressure.    The Mediterranean and Atlantic, up to the level of
 the submarine ridge referred to, may be regarded as huge

 270      Mr.  J. Croll  on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
  basins, the sides of which are sufficiently strong to resist all
  pressure.    It follows that, however denser the water of the
  Mediterranean     may be than the water of the Atlantic, it is
  only the water above the level of the ridge that can possibly
 exercise any influence in the way of disturbing equilibrium, so
 as to cause the level of the Mediterranean to stand lower than
 that of the Atlantic.       Suppose both basins empty, and dense
 water to be poured into the Mediterranean, and water less dense
 into the Atlantic, until they are both filled up to the level of the
 ridge ; still the heavier water in the one basin exercises no in
 fluence in raising the level of the lighter water in the other
 basin, the entire pressure being borne by the sides of the basins.
 But if we continue to pour in water till the surface is raised,
 say, 1 foot, above the level of the ridge, then there is nothing
 to resist the lateral pressure of this 1 foot of water in the
 Mediteranean but -the counter pressure of the 1 foot in the
 Atlantic.    But as the Mediterranean water is denser than the
 Atlantic, this 1 foot of water will consequently exert more pres
 sure than the 1 foot of water of the Atlantic.        We must there
 fore continue to pour     in  more water into   the Atlantic until its
 lateral pressure equals that of the Mediterranean.       The two seas
 will then be in equilibrium, but the surface of the Atlantic will
 of course be at a higher level than the surface of the Mediterra
 nean.    The difference of level will be proportionate to the differ
 ence in density of the waters of the two seas.          But here we
 come to the point of importance.        In determining the difference
 of level between the two seas, or, what is the same thing, the
 difference of level between a column of the Atlantic and a
 column of the Mediterranean, we must take into consideration
 only the water which lies above the level of the ridge.        If there
 be 1 foot of water above the ridge, then there is a difference of
 level proportionate to the difference of pressure between the 1
foot of water of the two seas.       If there be 2 feet, 3 feet, or any
number of feet of water above the level of the ridge, the differ
ence of level is proportionate to the 2 feet, 3 feet, or whatever
number of feet there may be of water above the ridge.             If, for
example,    13  should  represent  the  density of the  Mediterranean
water and 12 the density of the Atlantic water, then if there
were 1 foot of water in the Mediterranean above the level of the
ridge, there would require to be 1 foot 1 inch of water in the
Atlantic above the ridge in order that the two might be in
equilibrium.      The difference of level would therefore be 1 inch.
If there were 2 feet of water, the difference of level would be 2
inches; if 3 feet, the difference would be 3 inches, and soon. And
this would follow, no matter what the actual depth of the two
basins might be ; the water below the level of the ridge exer
cising no influence whatever on the level of the surface.

    Mr.   J.   Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.     271
     Now, in determining the actual difference of level between
the Mediterranean column and the Atlantic, we must leave out
of account the water under the level of the ridge.              This point
must be so obvious to every one familiar with hydrostatics that I
need not go into further detail in the matter.
     Taking Dr. Carpenter's own data as to the density of the
Mediterranean and Atlantic waters, what, then, is the difference
of density ? The submarine ridge comes to within 167 fathoms
of the surface ; say, in round numbers, to within 1 000 feet. What
are the densities of the two basins down to the depth of 1 000 feet ?
According to Dr. Carpenter there is little, if any, difference.
His own words on this point are these : — "A comparison of the&e
results leaves no doubt that there is an excess of salinity in the
water of the Mediterranean           above that of the Atlantic; but
that this excess is slight in the surface-water, whilst somewhat
 greater in the deeper water" (§ 7).           "Again, it was found by
examining samples of water taken from the surface, from 100
 fathoms, from 250 fathoms, and from 400 fathoms respectively,
 that whilst the first two had the characteristic temperature and
 density of Atlantic water, the last two had the characteristics
 and density of Mediterranean water" (§ 13).               Here, at least to
 the depth of 100 fathoms or 600 feet, there is little difference
 of density between the waters of the two basins.             Consequently
 down to the depth of 600 feet there is nothing to produce any
 sensible disturbance of equilibrium.           If there be any sensible
 disturbance     of equilibrium,  it  must  be  in   consequence of differ
 ence of density which may exist between the depths of 600
 feet and the surface of the ridge.        We have nothing to do with
 any   difference   which  may  exist  between     the water of the Medi
 terranean and the Atlantic below the ridge ; the water in the
  Mediterranean basin may be as heavy as mercury below 1000
 feet ; but this can have no effect in disturbing equilibrium. The
  water, to the depth of 600 feet, being of the same density in
  both seas, the length of the two columns acting on each other
  is therefore reduced to 400 feet— that       is,to that stratum of water
  lying at depth of from 600 to the surface of the ridge 1000
          a
  feet below the surface.      But, to give Dr. Carpenter's theory full
 justice, we shall take the Mediterranean stratum at the density
  of the deep water of the Mediterranean, which he found to be
  about 1'029, and the density of the Atlantic stratum at 1'026.
  The difference of density between the two columns           is   therefore
   •003.   Consequently,    ifthe height of the Mediterranean column
  be 400 feet,  it  will be balanced     by
                                          the Atlantic column of 401-2
  feet
     ;    the difference of level between the Mediterranean and the
   Atlantic cannot therefore be more than 1'2 foot. The total
  amount of work that can be performed               by gravity in the case

 of the Gibraltar current is little more than 1 foot-pound per
 pound of water, an amount of energy totally inadequate to pro
 duce the current.
                              The Baltic Current.
     The entrance to the Baltic Sea is in some places not over 50
or 60 feet deep.        It follows, therefore, from what has already
been proved in regard to the Gibraltar current, that the influ
ence of gravity must be even still less in causing a current in
the Baltic strait than in the Gibraltar strait.
Dr. Carpenter's Objections to my Estimate of the absolute amount
                   of Heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream.
     After giving a full exposition of his theory, he closes with the
following remarks : —
     " Having thus fortified my own position by showing that the
power I have invoked has a real existence and a most extended
and varied operation instead of being a figment of my own
imagination (as Mr. Croll represents it), I shall venture to
attack the stronghold of my adversaries by showing that the
                                                         '
Gulf-stream at the point of its greatest ' glory can by no means
claim the heating-power which they assign to it" (§ 39).                  He
then proceeds to criticise the data on which my estimate was
formed.       But surely in my paper on the subject             I  must not
have expressed myself with sufficient clearness, seeing that Dr.
Carpenter has on several important points misunderstood me.
     He begins with the following quotation from my paper in the
Philosophical Magazine, February 1870, p. 82.
                                                             " From an ex
amination of the published sections some years ago," says Mr.
 Croll, "   I  came to the conclusion that the total quantity of
water conveyed by the stream is probably equal to that of a
stream fifty miles broad and 1000 feet deep, flowing at the rate
of four miles an hour"*. He then assumes that all my con
clusions regarding the enormous amount of heat conveyed by
the stream, and from which my inferences as to his theory were
drawn, were based upon this estimate of the volume of the stream.
This, it is true, was the volume adopted in my former estimate
    * The above gives 5,575,680,000,000 cubic feet per hour as the volume
of the stream. Professor Wyville Thomson, in reference to this, says, " I
see no reason whatever to believe this calculation to be excessive" (' Nature'
for   July 27, 1871, p. 252). Dr. Colding, in his recent elaborate     memoir
" On    the Gulf-stream," estimates the volume at 5,760,000,000,000      cubic
feet per hour.     Maury, as we have seen, estimates it at 6,165,700,000,000
cubic feet, and Herschel at 7,359,900,000,000 cubic feet. But in my paper
the calculations were made on the assumption that the volume is only
2,787,840,000,000 cubic feet.

of the heating-power of the stream ; but it will be seen, by re
ferring to a page a little further on than the one from which he
quotes, viz. to page 89, that, as Mr. Findlay had maintained
that I had doubled the actual volume*, I reduced it to one
half of my former estimate.     My object for doing so was that                       I
might be enabled to show that, so far as my general conclu
sions regarding the influence of the Gulf-stream were con
cerned, it is a matter of indifference whether         adopt Mr.     I
Findlay's   estimate or   my  own.   The  inference drawn  in my
former paper regarding Dr. Carpenter's theory is therefore based
on the assumption that the volume of the stream is only one
half what he had supposed I had assumed it to be.
   He states that, in estimating the volume of the stream, I had
taken the velocity at the surface for the mean velocity.         am             I
unable to perceive on what grounds he was led to such a con
clusion.   I did not state that the Gulf-stream is anywhere fifty
miles broad and 1000 feet deep, and flowing at the rate of four
miles an hour.     What              I
                            stated was that the quantity of water
conveyed is probably equal to that of a stream fifty miles broad,
1000 feet deep, and flowing of course at every point from the
surface to the bottom at the rate of four miles an hour ; but I
never anticipated that any one would conclude from this that                          I
imagined the Gulf-stream actually flowed with the same velocity
at every point from the surface to the bottom.      Such an opinion
as this   I
          never held nor ever could have held.       Most certainly
the velocity of the Gulf-stream, like that of currents in general,
diminishes from the surface, or from near to the surface, down
wards.
    He states that          I
                     have also overestimated the mean tempera
ture of the stream.    I have taken the mean temperature of the
stream at the moment of its leaving the Gulf of Mexico at 65°;
and he says that this is too high an estimate.       He states also
that what has misled me on this point                          is,
                                                     that my esti
mate seems based on the assumption that in proceeding from
above downwards the temperature descends uniformly between
the different points of observation        40).   And in order to

                           is
 wards, he presents us with the Table of observations made in
the Mediterranean, to which reference has already been made.
And from this Table he concludes, and no doubt justly, that
the rate of decrease     greatest near to the surface of the stream
                                is
and diminishes as we proceed downwards.         But supposing    had          I
 adopted  Dr.  Carpenter's  Table  as representing  the law accord
 ing to which the temperature of the water diminishes from the
 surface of the stream downwards,       am still unable to perceive

274      Mr.   J.  Croll on the  Physical   Cause   of Ocean-currents.
 how this would have given a lower mean temperature than 65°.
 We might, by means of Dr. Carpenter's method, arrive at a
 pretty accurate estimate of the mean temperature of the cross
 section of the stream ; and it is quite probable that the mean
 temperature of the cross section would be found to be under
 65°.    But although the mean temperature of the cross section
 should be below 65°, it does not follow on this account that the
 mean temperature of the water flowing through this cross section
 must be below that temperature.             It is perfectly obvious that
 the mean temperature of the mass of water flowing through the
 cross section in a given time must be much higher than the
 mean temperature of the cross section itself.                Perhaps Dr.
 Carpenter   has   overlooked   this fact, and   hence  the reason  why he
 has arrived at so low an estimate of the mean temperature of
the stream.
    The reason why the temperature of the water must be higher
 than that of the cross section is this : — It is in the upper half of
 the section where the high temperature exists ; but as the ve
locity of the stream is far greater in its upper half than in its
lower half, the greater portion of the water passing through this
 cross section is water of high temperature.             If Dr. Carpenter
 would take this fact into consideration and again go over his
 calculations,   I feel persuaded he would arrive at the conclusion
 that the mean temperature of the Gulf-stream at the moment of
leaving the Gulf is not under 65°.
    But, be all this as it may, let us assume that the volume of the
 stream is but one half what he supposes           I  took it to be in my
calculations, and also that the quantity of heat conveyed per
pound of water is but 12^ units instead of 25 units, as in my
estimate ; in other words, let us assume the mean temperature
 of the stream to be 52 1° instead of 65°.           Surely these are con
 cessions that will satisfy not only Dr. Carpenter, but every one
 else.   Let us consider now what are the consequences to which
 we are still led in regard to his theory of a general interchange
of equatorial and polar water independently of the Gulf-stream.
    The area from which Dr. Carpenter derives his heat is the
area of the Atlantic, extending from the equator to the tropic
of Cancer, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.
By referring to my last paper (Phil. Mag. for Oct. 1870, pp.
255-257) it will be seen that, taking the volume of the Gulf-
stream at one-half of what Dr. Carpenter supposes            I estimated it
to be in my last paper, and assuming that the quantity of heat
conveyed into the Atlantic in temperate regions by means of his
general circulation is equal to that conveyed by the Gulf-stream
(whose heat he assumes does not pass beyond the temperate
regions), the amount of heat removed from the Torrid zone and

       Mr.   J. Croll on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.       275
 transferred over into the Temperate zone would be so enormous
  as to make the Atlantic in the temperate regions much warmer
 than the Atlantic in the torrid region.       The relative quantities,
 as will be seen by referring to my last paper, are these: 1124
 parts would represent the amount of heat in the temperate re
 gion of the Atlantic, and 570 parts the amount in the torrid
 region.
     But supposing we now take the mean temperature of the
 Gulf-stream at 52^° instead of 65°, in other words, that the
 amount of heat conveyed is but 12| units instead of 25 units, and
 assuming that the amount conveyed by his general movement is
 even not more than that conveyed by the Gulf-stream at this re
 duced rate, what are still the consequences ? By referring to the
  data afforded in my last paper (p. 257), it can be easily calculated
 that 202'5 parts of heat will be removed from the torrid region
 and transferred to the temperate region.            Consequently     the
 amount of heat possessed by the Atlantic in torrid regions will
 be 772 parts, and that possessed by the Atlantic in temperate
 regions will be as much as 940 parts.
     This conclusion alone,     I would venture to think, is decisive
 proof that, even supposiug such a motion of the ocean as that
 for which Dr. Carpenter contends were physically possible,
 still the amount of heat conveyed by means of his general circu
 lation must, as regards the Atlantic, be perfectly trifling in com
 parison with that conveyed by means of the Gulf-stream.             But
 this is not all ; it proves also that the quantity of heat conveyed
by aerial currents and all other means put together is but trifling
 compared with that conveyed by the Gulf-stream.
     Dr. Petermann has, by an entirely different line of argument,
shown in the most clear and convincing manner that the abnor
mally high temperature of the north-western shores of Europe
and the seas around Spitzbergen is owing entirely to the Gulf-
 stream, and not to any general circulation such as that advocated
 by Dr. Carpenter.     From a series of no fewer than 100,000 obser
vations of temperature in the North Atlantic and in the Arctic
seas, he has been enabled to trace with accuracy on his charts
 the very footsteps of the heat in its passage from the Gulf of
Mexico up to the shores of Spitzbergen*.

276     Mr.  J. Croll  on the Physical Came of Ocean-currents.
Mr. Findlay rose to make       some observations,      and, among    other
things, made the following remarks : —
    " When, by the direction of the United States Government
ten or eleven years ago, the narrowest part of the Gulf-stream
was examined, figures were obtained which shut out all idea of
its ever reaching our shores as a heat-bearing current. In the
narrowest part, certainly not more than from 250 to 300 cubic
miles of water pass per diem.        Six months afterwards that water
reaches the banks of Newfoundland, and nine or twelve months
afterwards the coast of England, by which time it is popularly
supposed to cover an area of 1,500,000 square miles.             The pro
portion  of  the water   that   passes   through    the  Gulf  of Florida
will not make a layer      of  water   more   than   6  inches  thick  per
diem over such a space.          Every one knows how soon a cup
of tea cools ; and yet it is commonly imagined that a film of
only a few inches in depth, after the lapse of so long a lime,
has an effect upon our climate.           There is no need for calcu
lations; the thing is self-evident."
    About two years ago Mr. Findlay objected to the conclusions
which I had arrived at regarding the enormous heating-power
of the Gulf-stream on the ground that I had overestimated
the volume of the stream.         He stated that its volume was only
about the half of what I had estimated it to be.               To obviate
this objection in future, in my last paper on the heating-
power of the stream, published in the February Number of the
Philosophical Magazine for 1870, I reduced the volume to one
half of my former estimate.        But taking the volume at this low
estimate, it was nevertheless found that the quantity of heat
conveyed into the Atlantic through the straits of Florida by
means of the stream was equal to about one fourth of all the
heat received from the sun by the Atlantic from the latitude of
the Strait of Florida up to the Arctic Circle.
    Mr. Findlay, in his paper read before the British Association,
stated that the volume of the stream is somewhere from 294 to
333 cubic miles per day ; but in his remarks made at the close
of Dr. Carpenters address, he states it to be not greater than
from 250 to 300     cubic   miles per day.       I am unable to recon
cile any of those   figures   with   the  data  from    which he appears
to have derived    them.      He   stated  in  his  paper to the British
Association that   " the Gulf-stream at its outset is not more than
                                                  " From all attainable
39^ miles wide,    and 1200 feet deep."
data," he says,  " he computes the mean annual rate of motion to
be 65'4  miles  per day ; but as the rate decreases with the depth,
the mean velocity of the whole mass does not exceed 49'4 miles
per day.    But when he speaks of the mean velocity of the Gulf-
stream being so and so, he must refer to the mean velocity at

      Mr.   J.  Croll on the  Physical  Cause  of Ocean-currents.      277
some    particular place. This is evident ; for the mean velocity
 entirely depends upon the sectional area of the stream. The
place where the mean velocity is 49'4 miles per day must be the
place where it is 39£ miles broad and 1200 feet deep ; for he
is here endeavouring to show us how small the volume of the
stream actually is.       Now, unless the mean velocity refers to the
place where he gives us the breadth and depth of the stream, his
figures have no bearing on the point in question.            But a stream
39|    miles   broad  and  1200  feet deep  has  a sectional  area of 8'97
square    miles,   and  this, with  a mean   velocity   of 49'4  miles per
day, will give 443 cubic miles of water.         The amount, according
to the estimate taken in my last paper, is 459 cubic miles per
day; it therefore exceeds Mr. Findlay's estimate by only 16
cubic miles.
    Mr. Findlay, so far as      I  am aware, does not consider that      I
have overestimated the mean temperature of the stream.                  He
 states (Brit. Assoc. Report, 1869, p. 160) that between Sand
 Key and Havanna the Gulf-stream is about 1200 feet deep,
and that it does not reach the summit of a submarine ridge,
 which he states has a temperature of 60°.            It is evident, then,
that the bottom of the stream has a temperature of at least 60°,
 which is within 5° of what       I regard as the mean temperature of
 the mass.       But the surface of the stream is at least 17° above
 this mean. Now, when we consider that it is at the upper parts
 of the stream, the place where the temperature is so much above
65°, that the motion is greatest, it is evident that the mean tem
 perature of the entire moving mass must, according to Mr. Find-
 lay, be considerably over 65°.        It therefore follows, according to
 his own data, that the Gulf-stream conveys into the Atlantic an
 amount of heat equal to one fourth of all the heat which the
 Atlantic, from the latitude of the Straits of Florida up to the
 Arctic regions, derives from the sun.
     But even supposing we were to halve Mr. Findlay's own esti
 mate, and assume that the volume of the stream is equal to only
 222 cubic miles of water per day instead of 443, still the amount
 of heat conveyed would be equal to one eighth part of the heat
 received from the sun by the Atlantic.               But would not the
 withdrawal of an amount of heat equal to one eighth of that re
 ceived from the sun greatly affect the climate of the Atlantic ?
  Supposing we take the mean temperature of the Atlantic at, say,
 56°; this will make its temperature 295° above that of space.
 Extinguish the sun and stop the Gulf-stream, and the tempera
  ture ought to sink 295°.        How far, then, ought the temperature
  to sink, supposing the sun to remain and the Gulf-stream to
  stop ? Would not the withdrawal of the stream cause the tem
  perature to sink some 30° ? Of course, if the Gulf-stream were
  withdrawn and every thing else were to remain the same, the tern

278       Mr. J.  Croll  on the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
peratnre of the Atlantic would not actually remain 30° lower than
at present; for heat would How in from all sides and partly
make up for the loss of the stream.           But nevertheless 30° re
presents   the  amount    of temperature   maintained   by means of the
heat from the stream.         And this, be it observed, is taking the
volume of the stream at a lower estimate than even Mr. Findlay
would be willing to admit.          Mr. Findlay says that, by the time
the Gulf-stream reaches the shores of England, it is supposed to
 cover a space of 1,500,000 square miles.           "The proportion of
water that passes through        the Straits of Florida will not make,"
says Mr. Findlay,
                       " a layer of water more than 6 inches thick
per diem over such a space."           But a layer of water 6 inches
thick cooling 25° will give out 579,000 foot-pounds of heat per
square foot.     If, therefore, the Gulf-stream, as Mr. Findlay as
serts, supplies 6 inches per day to that area, then every square
 foot of the area gives off per day 579,000 foot-pounds of heat.
The amount of heat received from the sun per square foot in
latitude 55°, which is not much above the mean latitude of
Great Britain, is 1,047,730 foot-pounds per day, taking, of
course, the mean of the whole year ; consequently this layer of
water gives out an amount of heat equal to more than one half of
all that is received from the sun. But assuming that the stream
should leave the half of its heat on the American shores and
carry to the shores of Britain only 12|° of heat, still we should
have 289,500 foot-pounds per square foot, which notwithstand
ing is more than equal to one fourth of that received from the sun.
If   an amount of heat so enormous cannot affect climate, then
what can possibly do it f
    I shall just allude to one other erroneous notion which pre
vails in regard to the Gulf-stream ; but it is an error which          I
by no means attribute to either Mr. Findlay or to Dr. Carpen
ter.                           I
        The error to which refer is that of supposing that when
the Gulf-stream widens out to hundreds of miles, as it does
before it reaches our shores, its depth must on this account be
much less than when it issues from the Gulf of Mexico. Although
the stream may be hundreds of miles in breadth, there is no ne
cessity why it should be only 6 inches, or 6 feet, or 60 feet, or
even 600 feet in depth.        It may just as likely be 6000 feet deep
as 6 inches.
   The reason why such diversity of opinion prevails in regard to
                             Ocean-currents.
    In  conclusion   I venture to remark that more than nine tenths
of all the error and uncertainty which prevail, both in regard to
the cause of ocean- currents and to their influence on climate, is
due, not, as is generally supposed, to the intrinsic difficulties of the

been employed in its investigation — that                         is,

subject according to the rigid methods adopted in other depart
ments of physics. What           most particularly allude to
                                    I                              the dis            is
regard paid   to  the   modern    method   of  determining    the  amount
of effects in absolute measure.
    But let me not be misunderstood on this point.                       no           I        by
means suppose that the absolute quantity               the thing always
                                                                   is
required for its own sake.         It in most cases required simply
                                                is
asa   means to an end and very often that end
                              ;                            the knowledge    is
of the relative quantity. Take, for example, the Gulf-stream.
Suppose the question          asked, to what extent does the heat con
                                  is
veyed   by that stream influence the climate of the North Atlantic?
In order to the proper answering of this question, the principal
thing required         to know what proportion the amount of heat
                      is
conveyed      bythe stream into the Atlantic bears to that received
from the sun        that area. We want the relative proportions of
                    by
these two quantities.       But how are we to obtain them              The                 ?
only way we can obtain them            by determining first
                                            is                the  absolute
quantity of each. We must first measure each before we can know
how much the one          greater than the other, or, in other words,
                             is
before we can know their relative proportions.           In regard to the
absolute amount of heat received from the sun                   given area   by   a
at any latitude, we have        the  means of determining this with
tolerable accuracy.       The same cannot be done with equal accu
racy in regard to the amount of heat conveyed                   the Gulf-        by
stream, because the volume and mean temperature of the stream
are not known with certainty.           Nevertheless we have sufficient
data to enable us to fix upon such            maximum and minimum
                                                        a
value to these quantities as that every one will admit the truth
must lie somewhere between them.            In order to give full justice
to those who maintain that the Gulf-stream exercises but little
influence on climate, and to pjit an end to all further objections as
to the uncertainty of my data^         have taken
                                            I        minimum to which
                                                                  a
none of them surely can reasonably object, viz. that the volume
of the stream       not over 230 cubic miles per day, and the heat
                    is
conveyed per pound of water not over 12£ units.                Calculating
from these data, we find that the amount of heat carried into
the North Atlantic         equal to one eighth of all the heat received
                             is
from the sun         by
                     that area.     There are,    presume, few who will

not admit that the actual proportion             much higher than this,

the method    I  have pursued, could ever have come to the conclu

280               Archdeacon    Pratt  on the Thickness  of
fluence of the Gulf-stream as a heating-agent has been so much
underestimated.
    The same remarks apply to the gravitation-theory of the cause
of currents. Viewed simply as a theory it looks very reasonable.
There is no one acquainted with physics but will admit that the
tendency of the difference of temperature between the equator
and the poles is to cause a surface- current from the equator
towards the poles, and an under-current from the poles to the
equator.       But before we can prove that this tendency does actu
ally produce such currents, another question must be settled,
viz. is this force which tends to produce the motion sufficiently
 strong to overcome the resistance of the water to go into motion?
 Dr. Carpenter has never attempted to prove that it is ; he has
 simply taken it for granted.         But when we apply the method
             I
 to which refer, and determine the absolute amount of the force
 resulting from the difference of specific gravity, we find it to be
 not that powerful thing which the advocates of the gravitation-
 theory suppose it to be, but a force so infinitesimal as not to be
 worthy of being taken into account when considering the causes
 which produce currents.

         XXX.      The Solid Crust of the Earth cannot be thin.
                 By ARCHDEACON PRATT, M.A., F.R.S.
     To  the Editors of   the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
                             considers that the Solid Crust of the Earth
 MDELAUNAY
        •
             may be thin —and      that, if it be so, the fluid nucleus
 moves exactly as the crust does in precession and nutation, in
 consequence of the viscosity of the fluid and the extreme slow
 ness of the motion — and that, in consequence, the late Mr. W.
  Hopkins's argument from precession that the crust is thick, at
  least 800 or 1000 miles, does not stand examination.             I   have
  already forwarded two letters to you on this subject ; and now
  ask you to publish a third, to show why the slowness of the mo
 tion has nothing to do with the question.
     The particles of the earth's mass have much more to undergo
 than performing this slow motion.               They have during the
 twenty-four hours of the earth's rotation to undergo a varying
  strain which no fluid, even viscous, could sustain.          The force
  producing     the  slow  motions    of precession  and  nutation   is the
  result of the near balance of a multitude offerees acting through
  out the mass, almost equal and opposite to each other.         Suppose
  of two fluid molecules in contact one only is acted on by a minute

                     the  Solid Crust of  the Earth.               281
force equal to one millionth of a grain weight.          No doubt its
neighbour, by friction and viscosity, might be induced to move
on with it.     But suppose one were acted on by a force of one
whole grain plus one millionth of a grain, and the other by one
grain in the opposite direction.         If the particles were rigidly
connected the pair would move on as before, as the difference of
forces is the same. But if they are fluid particles, however vis
cous, they would part company.          Now this represents the con
dition to which the particles of the earth's mass are perpetually
being subjected, as 1 propose now to show.
    2. Let S be the mass of the sun, c its distance from the earth's
centre ; let the axis of x be drawn through the sun from that
centre as origin, the plane of xy being the ecliptic.
    The attraction of the sun on any particle of the earth's mass
is S -i- (distance)2 towards the sun.       The disturbing force of the
sun on this particle relatively to the earth's centre is the resultant
of this force and a force S 4- c2 acting on the particle parallel to
the axis of x, away from the sun.          When these two forces are
resolved parallel to the axes of coordinates, very small quantities
of the second order being neglected, and S -s- c8 put = /M, and
forces tending from the earth's centre reckoned positive, the three
disturbing forces on the particle parallel to the axes are
                       2/t .x,   -p. y, -p      . z.
    3.  I will take the first of these first, viz. ZJMK parallel to x.
 On the sun-side of the plane yz it is always positive ; on the op
posite side it is always negative.     The aggregate of the forces oil
 all the particles on the one side will produce a resultant force
 drawing the earth's mass towards the sun, and the resultant on
 the opposite side will be an equal force drawing it in an oppo
 site direction.   These two equal and opposite forces would act
 at the same point in the plane yz (viz. the earth's centre) if the
 earth's masswere symmetrically arranged about its centre. Owing
 to the slight deviation from that arrangement, the first resultant
 force will act at a point extremely near the centre, but not at the
 centre ; and the other force parallel to it at an equal distance on
 the opposite side; so that the two forces will produce a mecha
nical " couple," with a very short " arm," the moment of which
 will be a very small quantity, although the two forces are not so
 small.    I at present assume the earth's particles to be all rigidly
 connected together.       The couple will tend to make the earth
revolve round a diameter at right angles to the plane of the
 couple and lying in the plane yz.
    The effect of the sun's action will therefore be to put the
 earth's mass in a state of tension in the direction of the line
joining the earth and sun, tending every instant to separate the

 282                Archdeacon         Pratt    on the Thickness           of
 two unsymmetrical hemispheroids into which the plane yz sepa
 rates it.   The disturbing forces parallel to y and z will, on the
 other hand, produce compression in directions parallel to those
 lines. These also will produce two couples, of small moment,
 tending to make the earth rotate round diameters perpendicular
 to their planes and lying in the planes xz and xy respectively.
    4. It is not difficult to calculate these forces and their mo
 ments about the axes.             I
                             will do this, first, supposing the earth's
 mass to be homogeneous.

 ecliptic, a the mean radius of the earth, e the ellipticity.    Then
 the equation to the surface is

     9. Were the material of the earth not highly rigid, the par
 ticles would yield to the strain which I have shown would be per
petually coming upon them, going through its changes every
 twelve hours, and would describe reentering curves on the sur
faces of infinitesimal ellipsoids.        The result would be that the
 strain could not be transmitted through the mass, and preces
 sion and nutation would not occur.
     Observation makes the annual precession =50". And the
result of the above calculations, viz. 51"'36, is very near this.
This near coincidence shows how highly rigid the earth's mass
 must be.
     10. But it may be thought that if the interior is fluid, and
the solid part only of a certain thickness t, the crust to be moved
being a less mass than the whole earth, the observed precession
might still coincide with what calculation would bring it out, as
the action of the sun and moon on the solid crust would be less,
and the pressure of the fluid would perhaps compensate for any
difference.     This  I propose now to examine.           I will, however,

   11. Now I must consider the action of the sun and moon on
the fluid, and so on the crust by pressure.    I shall suppose that
at the instant under consideration the fluid       as M. Delaunay        is,
supposes     to be, arranged and moving just as
                it                                      were part of       if  it
the solid mass of the earth, but capable of communicating pres
sure.   The forces acting on the fluid are the centrifugal force
arising from the earth's rotation, the attraction of the sun and
moon, and the attraction of the crust and fluid.     These last and
the centrifugal force cannot disturb the position of the axis,
owing to the symmetry of the crust.        Nor can any constant
pressure, the same on every part of the inner surface of the crust.
Hence    Ishall reject all constant terms in the expression for                                     p
at the surface.   The equation of equilibrium, then, taking only
the sun at present,              is

near symmetry of the figure, and therefore the near balance of

                                   increased by 0-012115.
    The effect of the fluid would thus be greatly to increase the
precession.    This increase would, moreover, take place if we
allowed any reduction in the pressure in consequence of visco
sity. The friction of the fluid in contact with the solid crust
would be a minute quantity not comparable with the effect of the
fluid pressure.
    12. Hence, finally, from paragraphs 8, 10, and 11,
     Calculated     Precession for solid earth               ...            = 51"-36

From both causes, the thinness of the crust and the action of
the fluid pressure, the Precession would be increased by a quan
tity so perceptible as to show that, even if at any instant the
crust and the fluid revolve alike, this could not continue.     It
also confirms the previous conclusion in paragraph 9, that the
earth's mass can be neither elastic nor fluid to any great extent,
but must be highly rigid — as Sir William Thomson has already
shown from independent calculations regarding the tides.
   If the advocates for a thin crust say that the pressure at any
point in the interior is so enormous, owing to the weight of ma
terials above the point, as to hold the particles firmly together
and enable even the fluid portions to sustain unaffected the
strain to which they are perpetually being subjected,      say that           I
the interior must have lost its fluid properties, and is actually
solid, and that with such a high degree of rigidity as to bear
and communicate the strain whjch comes upon it ; any yielding
would be fatal to this effect. Pressure has in that case turned
what was liquid at a certain temperature into a solid rigid mass,
now at a lower temperature; and the result                        is,
                                                   that the interior
is solid, not  fluid which ;   all  am  contending for.

   13.  I  have shown in this communication that the slowness of
the motions of precession and nutation can in no way justify the
supposition that the interior of the earth, were      viscous fluid, it a
would move exactly as the solid crust does for in the produc  ;
tion of those motions, slow as they may be, the mass has to un
dergo   a strain which no fluid, even   viscous, could sustain.
                                                     if
   It may be thought, perhaps, that nevertheless the latter part
of my paper may allow us to suppose that the interior          fluid,             is
and the crust, though solid, yet   not rigid, but possessing     cer                   a

   that if the material of the earth yielded as little as even a globe

   of the sun and moon, the effect on both the tides and the preces

         XXXI.    On the Action of Light on Chlorine and Bromine.
              By Dr. E. BUDDE, of the University of Bonn*.
           the course of an investigation on the combustion of explo
    IN     sive gaseous mixtures and on catalytic action in which              I
    am engaged,     I frequently had to apply the well-known propo
    sition of Favre and Silbermann and Clausius, according to
    which the molecules of most elementary gases consist of two
    atoms ; and in the experimental prosecution of deductions drawn
    from this hypothesis     I have arrived at some rather remarkable
    results with regard to chlorine and bromine.                Assuming the
    hypothesis   to be  true  (and certainly   it is as  probable as Avoga-
    dro's theorem and the equality of specific heats of gases for equal
    volumes), it naturally leads to the conclusion that the so-called
    combination of two elementary gases must in general be pre
    ceded by a splitting up of their molecules into isolated atoms,
    and that consequently such a combination will be promoted by
    any influence which induces a separation from each other of
    equal atoms without hindering the combination of the unequal
    ones.
        Now it is known that in chlorine, through insolation, there is
    induced a higher degree of chemical activity. This fact might be
    accounted for in two ways — (1) by assuming that light increases
    the attraction between the atoms Cl of ^'irine and the atoms k
    of the respective other body, and (                     "ming that light
    tends to resolve, or actually does resolve, the chlorine molecule
    into its constituent atoms.     Of these two hypotheses the former
    docs not appear very probable — the less so, as, for instance, in the

action of light on chloride of silver we observe a direct severing
of the connexion between Ag and Cl, — while the latter, a priori
at least, does not provoke any objections. Adopting it for the
moment, there remains the open question, whether we are to
imagine that the rays of the light actually split up the molecules
Cla, or only that they loosen their bonds of union, so as to faci
litate a complete separation by the affinity to Cl of the foreign
 atom k. Theoretically speaking, the one kind of action would
 appear as probable as the other; in fact I see no reason against
 their coexistence.    But the former one, if it be true, must
 have some remarkable consequences, which may easily be tried
by experiment.      Hence I was induced to pursue it more closely.
   I  assume that light in general diminishes the force uniting Cl
with Cl, and that occasionally, through the cooperation of light
and internal motion (heat), a molecule, Cl9, is actually split up
into   its constituents         Cl' + Cl1.
   If the  chlorine is mixed, say, with hydrogen, it is easily seen
that these free atoms will readily combine with the atoms of the
latter, and may even        their number rapidly increase) induce
                                  (if
an explosion.     But     the chlorine be pure, then the isolated
                            if
atoms Cl will         fly
                    about like independent molecules between the
undecomposed      molecules Cls; occasionally two of them will
 meet and reunite, so that finally, in case of constant intensity
                                                       a
 of light and constant temperature, there will be reached state     a
 of dynamical equilibrium, where in any given moment the num
 ber of molecules split up will exactly equal the number of mo
lecules  reformed.     In other words, insolated chlorine always
contains certain proportion of free atoms (increasing, no doubt,
             a
with the intensity of the light) and this, together with Avo-
                                              ;
gadro's theorem, leads to the conclusion that free chlorine,
through insolation, increases in specific volume, the more so the
more intense the active portion of the rays falling upon it.
   Moreover      it extremely probable that the reunion of isolated
                      is
chlorine-atoms involves       production of heat
                                    a                  so, the rays of

high refrangibility   would   do    kind aof  work   which   ultimately
leads to    (be
             a    ever so small) stationary increase of tempera
                  it
ture.   Hence the final conclusion to be drawn from our assump
tion   is,
         that chlorine when exposed to "chemical" rays must ex
pand, but when brought back into the dark recontract to its original
normal volume.

 were closed by simply scaling them up, subsequently by means
 of soldered-up         glass stopcocks.        Concentrated sulphuric acid
 previously saturated with chlorine served as index-fluid.                    The
 viscosity of this liquid renders the thermometer rather unsensi-
 tive ; yet    I preferred it to any other on account of its stability
 aud its small vapour-tension.            Only in a few confirmatory expe
 riments I used chloride of carbon, CC14, as indicator, in order to
 show that the phenomenon observed was not caused by the action
 of the sulphuric acid, and also to form an idea on the duration
 of the reaction (vide infra). The bulbs were so placed that either
 of them could be exposed to any portion of the solar spectrum ;
 their distance from the prism varied from 1 to 2 metres ; and
 their shadows, according to their position, covered from one third
 to one sixth of the visible part of the spectrum.               The index was
illuminated with gas-light, and its position observed with respect
to one of the cross wires of a telescope.
     Equilibrium of temperature having been established, the cross
 wire was made to coincide with the end of the index, the light
then made to act, and the variation in the position of the index
observed and estimated.              Let us designate one of the bulbs by
A, the other by B, and call positive any motion of the index
from A towards B ; then the results of one of the series of ob
servations may be stated as follows : —

individual chlorine which produced the effect. In order to get
further conviction, control experiments were made.
     (1) An ordinary but very sensitive differential thermometer
(with an indicator probably consisting of coloured spirit) was
treated quite as the former one         in the more refrangible part
                                          ;

 and ether as an indicator behaved in the blue light like the one

bulbs should absorb heat far more largely than chlorine does.

vitriol) was kept in        water-bath and exposed to direct sun

bulbs  I   produced displacements of the index amounting to seve

the action of the chemical rays, because

    294    Mr.        J. W. L.       Glaisher on a Class         of Definite Integrals.
      As to the theoretical                   interpretation of the experiments, it
    seems to me that three views chiefly are                  worthy of being taken
    into consideration, viz. : —
       (1) The assumption which suggested the investigation, that
•
    light actually decomposes chlorine molecules into chlorine atoms.
       (2) One might assume that highly refrangible light, in acting
    upon chlorine, was doing a peculiar unknown kind of work,
    which in its turn was changed into heat and thus caused the
    expansion.
        (3) One might say that the distinction made since the time
    of Seebeck and Melloni, between heating and non-heating but
    chemically active rays, had no sufficient foundation in fact, and
    look upon the phenomenon above detailed as a direct proof of
    the existence of bodies which are heated more strongly by violet
     than by red light.   It is true, indeed, that that distinction is
    founded almost entirely upon the behaviour of rays towards a
    thermopile covered with lampblack, and therefore, strictly speak
    ing, applies solely to lampblack as light-absorber.         for in           If,
    stance, red light did not happen to heat this particular sub
    stance, we should perhaps not know those rays to bethermically
    active.
        Of the above assumptions, the second appears to me the least
    plausible   while the first, on the other hand,      no little sup    is
    ported     by ;
                 the coincidence of the rays which make chlorine
    expand with those which are known to render             chemically      it
    active.
     I    have projected additional experiments for the further elu
    cidation of the subject     but as    have no electric lamp, and
                                          ;           I
    hence the possibility of their being carried out depends entirely
    on the state of the weather,      considered  I best, in the mean
                                                                    it
    time, to publish my present observations as they are.
        Bromine, according to few preliminary experiments, behaves
                                              a
    like chlorine other substances than these two have not as yet
                          ;

                          :
    are not, as   rule, studied.

      Mr.  J. W. L.  Glaisher on a Class  of Definite Integrals.   295
title are devoted to the evaluation of Integrals by different iso
lated methods, which, though well adapted for the purpose and
interesting,- are not connected together as parts of a theory.        A
similar want of system holds with regard to the integrals them
selves.     Many have been evaluated on account of their use in
physics, a greater number on account of their intrinsic interest
or elegance, more still as examples of different and frequently
highly ingenious modes of evaluation ; while in not a few cases
it is hard to see what inducement tempted their authors to
 spend time over them.        The subject of Definite Integrals, re
 garded as a science, is still rather in the observational than the
 theoretical state; i. e. the results have more resemblance to
 detached facts observed than to a chain of facts connected by a
theory; and so it must for a long time remain.
     Any one who takes up a memoir or work on the subject (such
 as Meyer's Theorie der bestimmten Integrate, published          during
 the present year) must at once notice that, except in a few cases
 such as the Elliptic Functions, the Gamma Function, &c., which
 are usually considered separately, a number of definite integrals
 are proved equal to certain quantities, without any indication
 being apparent why those given should have been preferred to
 others omitted, or, in the absence of any properties of the func
 tions, for what purpose they were evaluated.        The fact seems to
  be that every definite integral, not so complicated or unsymme-
  trical in form as to be absolutely destitute of interest, which
  admits of finite expression, or of expression in a tolerable simple
  series, has been evaluated ; and the gaps which occur are due to
  the integrals omitted not being so expressible.         Thus, for ex-
  sible in terms of ordinary functions. The number of what may be
  called principal integrals evaluable is not large ; and that this
  is the case is not remarkable, when it is considered that there is
  scarcely a function which cannot be thrown into the form of a
  definite integral, while for the evaluation of the latter we can
  only employ combinations of algebraical, circular, logarithmic,
  and exponential quantities.        For the advance of the subject,
  therefore,   the introduction   of  new fundamental functions is a
  necessity ; and Schlomilch, in order to evaluate the second of the
  integrals written above and some few others of allied form, made
  use of the functions known as the sine-integral, cosine-integral,
   and exponential-integral.     As soon as it appeared that these were
   suitable primary functions, a large number of definite integrals,
   previously inexpressible, were reduced to dependence on them,
   their properties were investigated, and Tables constructed of
   their numerical values.

296       Mr.     J.   W. L. Glaisher   on a Class   of Definite Integrals.
   This procedure was truly scientific, and has extended the
limits of the science ; and a similar course must continue to be
pursued, not only with the view of increasing the number of in
tegrals which, if need be, could be calculated numerically, but
also for the sake of making the subject more systematic and ho
mogeneous in form, as well as connecting the different results
with more completeness and unity.
   The fact also, previously alluded to, of the power of definite
integrals as a means of expressing other functions (such as solu
tions of algebraical and differential equations &c.), points to the
value of a good classification accompanied by full numerical
Tables.
   The chief point of importance, therefore, is the choice of the
elementary functions ; and this is a work of some difficulty. One
                                                /-« CO
function, however, viz. the integral            I    e-^dx, well known for
its use in physics, is so obviously           suitable for the purpose, that,
with the exception of receiving              a name and a fixed notation,        it
 may almost be said to have already become primary.        propose,   I
therefore, in the present communication to investigate some of
the most important integrals evaluable by its means, and several
 connected results — and in a subsequent communication,         after
noticing  a few  of the principal physical results involving       to     it,
describe the Tables that have been calculated of its numerical
values, and supplement them             by

XXXIII.         On a new Method of solving some Problems in the Cal

   Professor CHALLIS,          M.A., F.R.S.*
        an article    in the Number of the Philosophical Magazine
IN for September,           Professor Cayley has expressed his dissent
from the new method of solving certain problems in the Calcu
lus of Variations which is contained in my communication to
the Number for July.             On carefully considering all that he has
                       •
                         Communicnted       by the Author.

                     Problems in the Calculus        of Variations.             303
said, I    find that no argument is adduced which does not rest on
the assumption that the equations Ap = 0 and A=0 are necessa
rily identical. To this assumption, which is made without the
support of any reasoning,           I
                                    oppose the general argument, that
as the two equations differ symbolically (the former being of a
 degree superior by one to that of the other), they cannot be ne
cessarily equivalent, inasmuch as in that case the symbolic dif
ference between them would have no signification, which is con
tradictory to the principles of analysis.        This a priori reason I
proceed to confirm by the following particular considerations.
     There are instances in which Ap = 0 and A=0 are both in-
 tegrable per se, and the two integrals are identical.          The Pro
 blem     I., solved in my article in the July Number, presents one
 such instance.        In other cases, as that of the problem proposed
 by Mr. Todhunter in p. 410 of his History of the Calculus of
                                                 '
 Variations/ only Ap =          0   integrable per se, but the integral
                                    is
 satisfies A=0.        In these two classes of solutions the Calculus
 gives for each problem         aunique result.
     There are also instances in which solution      a     effected is an       by
 integral of Ap=0 which does not satisfy              = 0. This
                                                            A         the      is
 case with respect to the problem of the greatest solid of revolu
  tion of given superficial area, the surface being subject to the
  condition of passing through two given points of the axis. The
  discontinuous solution of this problem obtained             Mr. Airy in
                                                                      by
  the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for July 1861,                            is
  deduced exclusively from the equation A^ = 0.             In the Num
  ber for June 1866 Mr. Todhunter has completed this solution
 by    proving that      it
                          actually gives     maximum
                                                 a       but in so doing
                                                                ;
  he has expressly excluded the equation A=0.            In short, in this
  instance the equation Ap —            treated as
                                        0   is          were independent
                                                           if  it
  of the equation A = 0.         I  am entitled,    believe, to say that
                                                         I
   Professor Cayley assents, as do, to the solution in question.
                                         I
  Why, then, does he object to treating = independently of A    0
  Ap=0? The result which he accepts proves that the two equa
  tions are not necessarily equivalent.
      In the July Number have deduced solutions of Problems II.
                                I
  and III.      by an independent treatment of the equation A=0,
  and have thus obtained, in the case of Problem III., the conti
  nuous solution of the problem of which, as stated above, the
  Astronomer Royal gave           discontinuous solution.
                                  a                           The novelty
   of the process     I have adopted consists         in
                                                 deriving from the equa
  tionA     =   0,regarded as the differential equation of      curve, the a
   equation of the corresponding evolute, and then employing one
   of the involutes to satisfy the conditions of the proposed problem.
   In the case of Problem II. the equation of the evolute was ex
   plicitly obtained, and the appropriate involute could consequently

  304     On solving some Problems in the Calculus          of Variations.
  be immediately determined.           With reference to this point, Pro
  fessor Cayley says, "after the evolute ia obtained, we must take
  not any involute, but the proper involute of such evolute." But,
  as Professor Cayley well knows, there is no proper involute of
  any evolute, because the number of the involutes of a given evo
  lute is unlimited.      What he calls " the proper involute " is the
  curve given by integrating the equation Ap = 0; and on the
 before-mentioned gratuitous assumption that this equation and
 A = 0 are identical, he refuses to recognize any involute derivable
 from the latter equation other than that curve.              Of course I do
 not admit that this is an argument, because, for the reasons
 already urged,     I  maintain that there is no ground for the initial
 assumption.
     The equation of the involute which gives the solution of Pro
 blem II. contains three arbitrary constants, because it involves
 the arbitrary length of the cord which, by unwinding from the
 evolute, describes that involute.         By eliminating the three con
 stants a differential equation of the third order is obtained, which
 is evidently not identical with the equation A=0 of the second
order.      Neither is it identical with    -r- =0,   because it cannot be
                                            ax
 satisfied  if A =   & constant.     But it   is found   that that equation

            I.   On the Reduction     of Phosphor yl Trichloride.
        his first memoir on Vanadium, Dr. Roscoe described                  a
  IN series of oxychlorides        obtained from vanadyl trichloride by
 the%action    of reducing-agents.      When the vapour of vanadyl tri
 chloride is passed together with hydrogen through a heated tube,
a bright grass-green crystalline sublimate of vanadyl dichloride,
VO Cl2, is produced in the anterior portion of the tube ; after
 wards a layer of vanadyl monochloride, VO Cl, is deposited as an
exceedingly light, flocculent, brown powder ; whilst at the ex
treme end of the tube beautiful bronze-coloured .plates of the
 divanadyl monochloride, V2 O2 Cl, are formed, which have the
appearance of mosaic gold.            In this memoir Dr. Roscoe clearly
pointed    out   the intimate   analogy which exists between the com
pounds of vanadium and those of phosphorus, arsenic, antimony,
and nitrogen ; and in his subsequent researches on this subject,
he has so far elaborated this view of its chemical relationship,
that there is no longer room to doubt that vanadium is virtually
a member of the trivalent group.pf elements.
    It must be confessed, however, that the triatomic nature of
vanadium is not very apparent in the oxychlorides derived from
the vanadyl trichloride if the simplest formulae derived from their
analysis are retained ; but if these formulae be doubled, the diffi
culty at once vanishes. The supposition that these oxychlorides
possess a greater molecular weight than the vanadyl trichloride,
may derive some support from the fact of the change of physical
state which accompanies their formation, the lower oxychlorides
being all solid.                        I
                        Beyond this am not aware that any fact is
known to establish such an assumption, unless it be the coin
cidence between the atomic volume of the vauadyl trichloride
and that of the vanadyl dichloride with the formula doubled.

    So far as I am aware, there is nothing to disprove such a me
thod of representation ; it has at least the merit of preserving
the triatomic nature of vanadium in these compounds, and shows
in a simple manner their relation to the vanadyl trichloride.
    Assuming, then, that the triatomic nature of vanadium is
established, analogy points to the existence of other oxychloridcs
among the trivalent group than those at present known to us.
To fulfil the relationship, we ought to have TOC18, T*0«C14,
T*0*,C12 and T404C1S, where T represents a member of the
triatomic group of elements.       The following Table represents
these analogies  so  far as they are complete : —

    The  V2 O2 Cl4 was also prepared by Roscoe by heating VO Cl8
in  a sealed   tube with fragments of metallic zinc to a temperature
above the boiling-point of mercury ; in this way the compound
was obtained in quantity ; and it was easily freed from a small
quantity of adhering VO Cl3 by heating to 130° C. in a current
of dry carbon dioxide.        I have attempted to repeat this reaction
with phosphoryl trichloride. A quantity of the pure liquid was
sealed up together with zinc filings in a tube and heated to about
400°.     The zinc was slowly acted upon, and a transparent glassy
mass was formed at the bottom of the tube.                  No evolution of
gas occurred on opening the tube.             The small quantity of liquid
remaining was submitted to distillation ; it commenced to boil
at about 80°, and the thermometer gradually rose to 105°, by
which time the whole of the liquid had passed over.                  This be
haviour appeared to indicate the presence of phosphorus trichlo
ride, PCI3 ; and a few drops of the liquid decomposed by water
yielded the reactions of phosphorous acid.               The quantity was
too small to admit of fractional distillation, even if the perfect
separation of the two liquids had been practicable by this method.
    Accordingly three portions of the distillate were weighed out
for determination of the chlorine, total phosphorus, and amount
of phosphorus yielding phosphoric acid on decomposition with
water.
    I. Determination of chlorine. — The weighed quantity of liquid
was decomposed by water in a stoppered bottle, a quantity of
 nitric acid added, and the chlorine precipitated with silver nitrate.
    0-6032 grm. gave 1-7764 AgCl and 0-0075 Ag.

    II.  Determination of total phosphorus. — The mixed chlorides
were decomposed by water in the manner above described, nitric
acid added, and the liquid concentrated.                The fluid was then
made strongly alkaline by ammonia, and the phosphorus preci
pitated as the magnesium ammonium compound.

    The vitreous mass remaining in the tube fused on gently heat
 ing, and was decomposed ; it was probably a combination of one
 of the above chlorides with zinc chloride, possibly the ZnCl9 +
 PO Cl3, already described by Casselmann*, mixed with zinc oxide
 or zinc oxychloride.
     The action of zinc at a high temperature on phosphoryl tri
 chloride is therefore sensibly different from the action of this
 metal on the corresponding vanadium compound : in the former
 case the reaction is mainly attended with the abstraction of
 oxygen, in the latter with the abstraction of chlorine.
     II.  Note   on the Preparation   of Phosphorus Sulphochloride.
     This compound was first prepared by Serullas, who obtained
 it by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen upon the pentachloride
  of phosphorus,
                        PC1S+H2S =
     This reaction, however, affords only an impure product.
  Baudrimont states that this compound is more easily prepared
  by the action of pentachloride of phosphorus on antimony tri-
 sulphide,
                           SbsS8=2Sb
     It  has long   been  known that phosphoryl trichloride may be
  easily obtained in a state of complete purity by the action of
  pentachloride of phosphorus on phosphoric anhydride,
                    P*05+3PC1S=5POC18.
      It occurred to me to try whether the sulphochloride might
  not be produced by the analogous reaction with phosphorus
  pentasulphide,
                        sP4Sa+3PCl5=5PSCl3.

           XXXV. On the Existence of Sulphur Dichloride.
      By JOHN DALZELL and T. E. THORPE, Ph.D., F.R.S.E.*
                 dry chlorine in   excess is passed through molten
  WHEN      sulphur,  a dark  red fuming liquid slowly distils over.
 This, on renewed distillation, commences to boil at about 50° or
 60°, and the thermometer slowly rises to 136° or 137°, at which
 point it remains stationary, and the orange-yellow disulphide
 Cl2 S9 passes over.      The fraction boiling below 136° frequently
 amounts to three fourths of the original quantity of liquid ; on
 again submitting it to distillation the same order of things is
 repeated, and but a comparatively small portion distils over
 above 136°.       At each distillation the liquid becomes lighter in
 colour, until at length, by long-continued boiling, it assumes the
 bright yellow of the disulphide, and boils constantly at 136-137°.
 This behaviour would seem to indicate the existence of some
 compound of chlorine and sulphur, which slowly undergoes de
 composition on distillation, ultimately forming the disulphide;
and the observations of Dumas and Soubeiran, and of Mar-
 chand, Davy, and Hose, point to a body richer in chlorine
 than the disulphide; and their analyses lead to the formula
 S Cl*.    On the other hand, Carius denies the existence of sul
phur dichloride in the dark-red liquid obtained by heating
sulphur in chlorine, and asserts that the compound analyzed
by Dumas and others was a mixture in atomic proportions
of the disulphide with a tetrachloride of sulphur hitherto un-
isolated (C19SS + SCI4 = 3C1*S).           According to Carius, the
amount of chlorine contained in the liquid, over and above that
required by the formula S8 Cls, is altogether dependent on
the temperature.         But the fact of the protracted distillation
required      to break  up the product into a liquid boiling con
stantly at 136-137° implies that the excess of chlorine is held
by some other force than that of mere solution ; and at the
same time we are not altogether without facts more directly
indicating the existence of the dichloride. Rose has obtained

and according to Guthrie, it yields with the olefines compounds

lately made an observation which tends also to support the idea
of the existence of this body*. A quantity of the pure chloride,
S*C12, was placed in a strong freezing-mixture, and a current of
dry chlorine passed through it for some time, the excess of this
gas (that         is,
               that existing merely in solution) being displaced                                                by
a stream   of dry carbon dioxide passed through for three or four
hours.   Whilst still in the freezing-mixture,    small quantity of                 a
the chloride was withdrawn and analyzed, when numbers were
obtained exactly agreeing with those required          the formula                       by
C12S.

  r I TAKE       on a sphere (in the northern hemisphere)         two points,
    J-     A, B, whose longitudes differ by 90°, and refer them to
  the equator by the meridians A E and B C respectively ; join
  A, B by an arc of great circle, and take in the southern hemi
  sphere the pole D of this circle ; and join D with E and C re
  spectively by arcs of great circle. We have a spherical pentagon
 ABODE,           which is in fact the " Pentagramma mirificum," con
  sidered by Gauss, as appearing vol. iii. pp. 481-490 of the Col
 lected Works.         Among its properties we have
                                                               J

 the quantities may be expressed in terms of the remaining two.

     Projecting from the centre of the sphere upon any plane, we
 have a plane pentagon which is such that the perpendiculars let
fall from the summits upon the opposite sides respectively meet
in a point. This (as easily seen) implies that the two portions
into which each perpendicular is divided by the point in question
have the same product.
     Conversely, starting from the plane pentagon, and erecting
from the point of intersection a perpendicular to the plane, the
length of this perpendicular being equal to the square root of
the product in question, we have the centre of a sphere such
that the projection upon it of the plane polygon is the penta-
gramma mirificum.

 Text-books     of Science. Elements of Plane and Solid Geometry.         By
      H. W. WATSON, M.A., some time Fellow of Trinity College,          Cam
      bridge.    Small 8vo, pp. 285.    London: Longmans, 1871.
 TT       is scarcely possible to take an elementary treatise on geometry
 -^-
         in hand without comparing it with Euclid's Elements ; and we
 shall most readily convey to our readers a notion of the contents of
 this volume by stating that it covers very nearly the same ground as
 a good school edition of Euclid ; that is to say, it contains, in sub
 stance, the first six books and the first twenty-one propositions of
  the eleventh book, with such additional propositions and remarks as
  are commonly given in the form of notes.           On the other hand, the
  demonstrations of the propositions are in most cases not the same as
  Euclid's, and the order in which they are arranged is materially dif
  ferent. The work, in fact, is not in any sense an edition of Euclid,
  but a distinct and independent treatise on geometry, every page of
  which shows that a great deal of care and thought have been be
  stowed on its composition.         It would not be easy in a short notice
  to mention the various points of difference, which in many cases
  extend to minute details ; but the following may be particularized : —
  The propositions relating to areas, corresponding to Euclid I. 35-48
   and II., form a separate book ; the problems are kept distinct from
   the theorems, and form separate sections ; the subject of proportion
  is treated algebraically ; Loci are introduced at the end of the first
   book ; in several parts Limits are employed ; and all the books are
   subdivided into sections : e. g. the book on Planes and Lines in Space
   (a subject which is treated very elaborately) is subdivided into four
   sections, under the head of Miscellaneous Propositions, Perpendi
   culars and Obliques to Planes, Dihedral Angles, and Polyhedral
   Angles. Exercises, about 200 in all, are added to most of the
   sections.
       The first section of the first book is on triangles ; and the starting-
   point is an axiom equivalent to the familiar statement that " a straight
   line is the shortest distance between its extreme points."          In Mr.
   Watson's hands, however, the axiom takes the following form : — " The
   length of the straight line joining any two points is less than the
                                                                              "
   length of any broken line whatever joining the same two points

                     Notices respecting New Books.                    313
(p. 5).     On turning to p. 93, the reason for adopting this unusual
form of statement becomes apparent ; and as the point is of some in
terest we will let Mr. Watson speak for himself : —
     " When we speak of one straight line as being equal to another,
or more accurately as being equal in length to another, we have a
very exact and precise idea of what is meant, viz. that the one line
can be applied to the other so that the extremities and every inter
mediate point of the one may coincide with the extremities and some
intermediate point of the other.       So, again, when we speak of one
circular arc as being equal to another circular arc of equal radius, we
mean that the one arc can be applied to the other so that the extre
mities and every intermediate point of the one may coincide with the
extremities and some intermediate point of the other.        But our ideas
 of equality of length are not confined to lines which may be super
posed upon one another in this manner, and in practice we speak
familiarly of the lengths of curves or of circular arcs, meaning thereby
 the lengths of straight lines equal in length to these curves or cir
 cular arcs, although a straight line and the arc of a circle cannot of
 course be superposed     one upon the other.      It is well therefore to
 have an accurate definition of the length of a curved line, which we
 will now proceed to investigate."
     The whole of Mr. Watson's remarks on this point will well repay
 perusal.    It might not occur to the reader that there is any difficulty
 about the conception of the length of a curved line.        He might say
 that we are made familiar, by our everyday experience, with threads
 that are flexible and sensibly inextensible, and that in consequence
  we have no more difficulty in forming the conception of a perfectly
  flexible and inextensible line, than in forming the conception of a line
  devoid of breadth or thickness.     Moreover we are familiar with such
  phenomena     as the  unwinding   of cotton from a reel, or the paying
  out of a rope.    Such experiences, he might say, suggest the notion
  of a curved line pulled straight (or rectified), and that these concep
  tions could be easily embodied in a definition.     In the present work
  the question is thus treated : the nature of a rolling motion is first
  explained, and the result embodied in the following definition: — " If a
  straight line be made to roll upon a curved line, the length of the
  straight line between its first and last points of contact with the
  curved line is defined to be the length of the curved line between its
  first and last points of contact with the straight line."
      The only objection to this way of looking at the matter is that
  the notion of a rolling motion is less familiar than that of a flexible
  line pulled straight.     What, however, is of most importance from
  the mathematician's point of view, is how the result of the recti
  fication is to be determined ; and this, after the necessary explana
  tions, Mr. Watson states thus : — " If a number of points be taken
  between the first and last points on any finite curved line, and the
  chords between each pair of points in succession be drawn, and if the
   number of such points be indefinitely increased, and the length of
   each chord be indefinitely diminished, the ultimate sum of the lengths
   of these chords is the length of the curved line."     In this, we sup

pose,   all will agree ; but we do not quite see why Mr. Watson
should call this statement a definition.       If any distinction is to be
made between definitions and axioms or postulates, surely the above
statement is a sort of compound axiom or postulate consisting of nt
least two propositions: viz. (1) that the sum of the chords when
their number is indefinitely increased will have a determinate finite
limit ; (2) that this limit will be the length of the curve defined as
above.
   Although there are some other points on which we are not inclined
to adopt Mr. Watson's views, we willingly allow that his views are
in all cases well worth consideration, and that his book is an excel
lent treatise on the elements of geometry. When a second edition
is called for, we would suggest that some of the diagrams should be
drawn again. In a book of this kind obvious inaccuracy in the dia
grams ought to be avoided, for the learner's sake ; and this has not
always been done.        E. g. p. 132, A F is obviously not a square ;
p. 138, A B CD E is obviously less than P G ; p. 219, the pentagon
is regular only by courtesy ; and so on in several other cases.
Select  Methods in Chemical Analysis (chiefly Inorganic).        By WIL

   don : Longmans.        8vo, pp. xvi and 468.
   It has been the intention of the author to provide the student with
a laboratory companion containing information not usually found in
ordinary works on analysis.        The methods here placed at the stu
dent's disposal have all appeared during the last twelve years in the
' Chemical News,' of which Mr. Crookes is the well-known editor ;
but in this work they are systematically arranged, and the compiler
assures us that he has tested most and improved some of them
(p. iii).
                     "
   The " contents       are divided into chapters ; and in each chapter a
group of the simple bodies is discussed, modes of separation from
all the preceding bodies being then given. Attention is very pro
perly paid to the rarer elements,           whose presence is unjustly
ignored in most treatises of this kind.       But the work of systemati-
zation spoken of in the preface does not proceed very far; it is
limited, as in most other manuals, to natural-history grouping.
Even here the results are occasionally open to question.             Does
magnesium, for example, as closely resemble barium, strontium, or
calcium as they resemble each other ? Yet all four metals are classed
together in Chapter II. An entire chapter intervenes between glu-
cinum and aluminium.           Iron is divorced from manganese, silver
from lead.     It would probably be better to reject the natural-history
method altogether, and follow the order of the atomic weights ; at
any rate, we should then be proceeding on an intelligible principle,
open to little dispute, "and conducive to fresh comparison.
   The " preparations        incidental to analytical work are noticed
here and there.     Thus very good methods are given for making pure
sulphuric acid, pure lead, zinc, &c. ; on the other hand, the way of
making phosphorous acid (p. 337) leads to no useful result.          Moat

of the " processes    promise well, and appear to have been selected
with considerable care ; not a few of them have been repeatedly ve
rified by the constant use of chemists. Terrell's inaccurate method
for determining cobalt (p. 151), however, is a decided blemish.
Chapter XIV., on gas-analysis, is too short and deficient by leaving
out of mention many of the great improvements in the measurement
of gases that have been introduced of late years.     To the few pages
devoted to organic analysis, an account of Ladenburg's method ought
certainly to have been annexed. We may add, also, that the author
does not, as a rule, by any means sufficiently mark the nature and
extent of his own contributions ; and he has given to American
methods a prominence which is peculiar and very noticeable.
    Mr. Crookes's book is not without its defects ; but it is the first
attempt of its kind, and on that score alone would deserve much
allowance.     But the extensive verification to which he has subjected
his material renders it much more valuable and meritorious.        The
possession of such a treatise cannot fail to economize the time of
the general, but especially of the technological analyst.

       1. " On a new Chimseroid Pish from the Liaa of Lyme Regis."
By Sir Philip Grey Egerton, Bart., M.P., F.R.S., V.P.G.8.
    This fish, for which the author proposed the name of Ischyodus
orthorhinus, was represented by a specimen showing the anterior
structures imbedded in a slab of Lias.         It exhibited the charac
teristic dental apparatus of the Chimsroids, surrounded with sha
green, a very large prelabial appendage (six inches long, and termi
nating in a hook abruptly turned downwards), and a process which
the author regarded as representing the well-known rostral appen
dage of the male Chimeeroid, but in this case attaining a length of
5£ inches, and covered more or less thickly with tubercles, bearing
recurved central spines somewhat tooth-like in their aspect.       This
appendage is attached to the head by a rounded coudyle, received
into a hollow in the frontal cartilage. The dorsal spine, which
measured 6 inches in length, was articulated by a rounded surface
to a strong cartilaginous plate projecting upwards from the noto-
chordal axis, and was thus rendered capable of a considerable amount
of motion in a vertical plane.        This structure also occurred in
Callorhynchus and Chimcera.

   The age of the rocks was shown to be included in the Tertiary
period by the position of the volcanic masses above the Chalk, and
by their including beds containing Miocene plants.
   As an illustrative district, the author described the volcanic geo
logy of the Island of Eigg, one of the Inner Hebrides, and brought
out the following points —       :
  1.  The volcanic rocks of this island rest unconformably upon

sive masses of quartziferous porphyry, like some of those which in
Skye traverse or overlie the lias, likewise intersect the bedded dole-
rites and basalts of Eigg.
   4. At least two widely separated epochs of volcanic activity are
represented by the volcanic rocks of Eigg. The older is marked by
the bedded dolerites and by the basalt veins and dykes which, though
strictly speaking younger than the bedded sheets which they inter
sect, yet probably belong to the same continuous period of volcanic
"ction.    The later manifestations of this action are shown by the
pitchstone of the Sour.   Before that rock was erupted, the older do-
leritic lavas had long ceased to flow in this district. Their succes
sive beds, widely and deeply eroded by atmospheric waste, were here
hollowed into a valley traversed by a river, which carried southward
the drainage of the wooded northern hills. Into this valley, slowly
scooped out of the older volcanic series, the pitchstone and porphyry
coulees of the Scur flowed.    Vast, therefore, as the period must be
which is chronicled in the huge piles of volcanic beds forming our
 dolerite plateaux, we must add to it the time needed for the excava
tion of parts of those plateaux into river-valleys, and the concluding
period of volcanic activity during which the rocks of the Scur of
Eigg were poured out.
   5. Lastly, from the geology of this interesting island we learn,
what can be nowhere in Britain more eloquently impressed upon
us, that, geologically recent as that portion of the Tertiary period
may be during which the volcanic rocks of Eigg were produced, it is
 yet separated from our own day by an interval sufficient for the
removal of mountains, the obliteration of valleys, and the excavation
of new valleys and glens where the hills then stood. The amount
of denudation which has taken place in the Western Islands since
Miocene times will be hardly credible to those who have not ade
quately realized the potency and activity of the powers of geological
waste. Subterranean movements may be called in to account for
narrow gorges, or deep glens, or profound sea-lochs ; but no sub
terranean movement will ever explain the history of the Scur of
Eigg, which will remain as striking a memorial of denudation as it
is a landmark amid the scenery of our wild western shores.

   The paper described a number of these remarkable recesses, which,
though not restricted to the limestone districts of the Alps, are best
exhibited in them. The author gave reasons why he could not
suppose them to have been formed either as craters of upheaval, or
by the action of the sea, or by glacial erosion.    With regard to the
last he showed that, even if glaciers had been the principal agents
in excavating valleys, there were some cirques which could not have
been excavated by them ; and then went on to argue, from the fact
that glaciers had occupied cirques, and from the relation between
them and the valleys, that they could not be attributed to different

  agents.    He also showed that commonly the upper part of a valley,
  where the erosive action is perhaps least, is very much the steepest,
  and urged other objections to the great excavatory powers often
  attributed to glaciers. He then described one or two cirques in
  detail, and showed that they were worked out by the joint action of
 many small streams, and of the usual meteoric agents working upon
 strata whose configuration was favourable to the formation of cliffs.

           ON THE SPECTRA OF SULPHUR.           BY M. G. SALET.
 '"PHE employment of instruments and        methods the delicacy and per-
  •*•
        fection of which greatly surpass those of our organs has often
 entailed difficulties and errors. When spectral analysis is applied to
 the minute quantities of matter which fill the Geissler tubes, we
 often find ourselves in the presence of impurities which can only be
 revealed by the spectral method itself; hence uncertainties.       These
 impurities may proceed not merely from the primitive gas, but also
 from that operated on previously with the mercurial air-pump, from
 the mercury of the pump, from the grease of the stopcocks, from the
 sulphuric acid used as desiccating agent, from matters deposited on
 the surface of the glass, and from the metallic electrodes, which pos
 sess the property of absorbing and afterwards diffusing a certain
                                                             o
number of gases.         One can easily conceive how M. Angstrom, by
indicating these impurities, recently arrived at the suppression, as
 not belonging to the pure gas, of all the supplementary spectra of
hydrogen described by M. Wiillner.         But it seems to me that the
 discovery of M. Pliicker is not shaken by these facts, or that, at
least as regards sulphur, which I have studied, there really exist
two perfectly distinct spectra— one composed of lines, the other of
bands, and both characteristic to the same degree.        The first is ob
tained by the disruptive discharge ; the second can be produced by
discharges of less tension, by the incandescence of sulphur in the
 hydrogen-flame, and, finally, though with less distinctness, by the
 absorption of sulphur vapour alone.
     1. The Electric Spectrum. — I enclose the sulphur in a glass tube
similar to M. Pliicker's, but not presenting metallic electrodes. Each
extremity of the tube is surrounded by a brass sheath, which is
heated by means of a lamp in order to vaporize the sulphur.        When
we wish the electricity to pass, we connect the sheaths with the
poles of a coil or a Holtz machine ; and by influence the tube be
comes as intensely luminous as if the electrodes penetrated the inte
rior.    When an excellent vacuum has been made in the apparatus
during the vaporization of a large portion of the sulphur, which di
stilled outside, there need be no fear of the presence of a foreign
gas ; besides, when such a tube is cold, the electricity no longer cir
culates; and, on employing metallic electrodes, even a Geissler's
tube in which a vacuum has been made over boiling sulphur arrests
the spark perfectly.        The following are the wave-lengths of the
middle of each band observed in the spectrum obtained in this manner
by heating moderately, and employing electricity of feeble tension ; —

similar to the preceding, but some of which are brighter than the
corresponding bands of the electric spectrum, so as at first sight to
present a somewhat different appearance. Their wave-lengths were : —

     8. I examined by transparency a layer of sulphur vapour heated
 to dull redness.      When a very powerful light is employed, such as
 that of magnesium, in the blue some black bands are perceived which
 nearly correspond to the following wave-lengths : —
           471     465      462 very faint.   456     445     437
 Here there may be some uncertainty, because magnesium furnishes
 some lines in this portion of the spectrum ; nevertheless,         as these
 bands are only observed with sulphur, I think they are due to the
 reversal of the preceding spectrum.
     All these results were obtained with a spectroscope with only one
 prism, as the band spectra, unlike the line spectra, will not bear much
 dilatation ; therefore one cannot absolutely depend on the number
 which expresses the millionths of a millimetre.

 M. Wurtz's laboratory.—       Comptes Rendua, 1871,     No. 9.
       ON SOME    LUMINOUS TUBES WITH EXTERIOR ELECTRODES.
                          NOTE BY M. ALVERGNIAT.
     The presence of metallic electrodes (which sometimes become
  strongly heated) in Geissler tubes may occasion numerous miscon
  ceptions when the light is analyzed in the spectroscope.             Those
  electrodes absorb and emit gases, may cause cracks in the glass ;
  and they partly volatilize, so as to tarnish the interior surface of the
  latter.    Now it is not necessary to place the electrodes inside the
  tubes, since these can be charged by influence (as we have seen in
  the preceding note) without their brightness being much diminished.
     Besides, the exterior electrode need not be a collar ; it may be

formed by a glass tube open outside and entering the interior of the
apparatus ; it is into this tube that the metallic electrode is intro
duced which serves for the passage of the discharge.
  The phenomenon of stratification can thus be observed very distinctly.
When the coil is in operation, the production of a large quantity of
ozone around the apparatus is observed ;         I
                                              intend to take advantage
of this peculiarity in order to construct an apparatus suitable for the
production of that gas. — Comptes Rendus, 1871, No. 9.
ON THE   AMOUNT OF TIME NECESSARY FOR VISION.   BY OGDEN
    N. ROOD, PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS IN COLUMBIA COLLEGE.
    In the celebrated experiment of Wheatstone on the duration of
the discharge of a Leyden jar, the conclusion was drawn that distinct
vision is possible in less than one millionth of a second.       The in
correctness of the data on which this conclusion rested was after
ward pointed out in an admirable investigation by Feddersen, who
remarks on this point : — " One cannot hereafter assume in optical
and physiological experiments that the discharge of a Leyden jar is
an instantaneous act ; but at the same time, by the determination
of the greatest suitable resistance, it will be possible to limit the
                                            "
discharge to its least possible duration *.      The smallest measured
duration obtained by Feddersen was one millionth of a second.
                                                                   I
    In an article in Silliman's Journal for September 187 1 show how,
by the use of a much smaller electrical surface, I obtained and mea
sured sparks the duration of whose main constituent was only forty
billionths of a second.     With their light distinct vision is possible ;
thus, for example, the letters on a printed page are plainly to be
seen ; also, if a polariscope be used, the cross and rings around the
axes of crystals can be observed with all their peculiarities, and
errors in the azimuth of the analyzing prism noticed. There seems
also to be evidence that this minute interval of lime is sufficient for
the production of various subjective optical phenomena — for ex
ample, for the recognition of Loewe's rings (using cobalt glass); also
 the radiating structure of the crystalline lens can be detected when
 the light is suitably presented to the eye.
    Hence it is plain that forty billionths of a second is quite sufficient
 for the production on the retina of a strong and distinct impression ;
 and as the obliteration of the micrometric lines in the experiment
 referred to could only take place from the circumstance that the
 retina retains and combines a whole series of impressions whose
joint duration is forty billionths of a second, it follows that a much
 smaller interval of time will suffice for vision.       If we limit the
 number of views of the lines presented to the eye in a single case to
 ten, it would result that four billionths of a second is sufficient for
human vision, though the probability is that a far shorter time would
answer as well, or nearly as well.   All of which is not so wonderful
if we accept the doctrines of the undulatory theory of light ; for ac
cording to  it,in four billionths of   second nearly two and
                                          a                       half a
millions of the mean undulations of light reach and act on the eye.

infinites! m ally different, stationary motion, which may take place
in a different but likewise closed path, with another velocity, and
under the influence of another force.        In comparing these two
motions, we will name the difference between a quantity relative
to the original motion and the corresponding quantity relative
to the altered motion the variation of the quantity, and denote it
by a prefixed 8 ; so that, for instance, Si will be the variation of
the time of revolution i. But with respect to the quantities which
 are variable in the course of every motion, it is necessary to settle
which values are to be regarded as corresponding values of the
 quantity. This may be done in the following manner. We first
 take, in the two paths, two places infinitely near each other as
 corresponding places, and reckon the periods of motion from the
moments when the point passes through these places.            Then,
denoting by / the time of motion till any other place in the path
is reached, with the original motion we put
                                     t=i<f>,
and with the altered motion we put
in which    <f>    variable which
                  is   a              have named the phase of the

tion. Thence follow further the corresponding places in the two
paths, and the corresponding values of all the other quantities
which refer to the two motions.
   From these explanations the following equation (which            the      is
simplest  form  of the  one  above  mentioned) will be intelligible: —

 must not at once be regarded as the variation of the ergal, and
 hence, if the signification of U be extended so that it shall re
present the crgal not only for the original, but also for the altered
motion, cannot at once be denoted by SU.             The preceding equa
tion holds good, namely, as already intimated, also for the cases
in which the force operating on the point has undergone a varia
tion which can be supposed to be mathematically expressed
thus : — that one or more quantities contained in the ergal, con
stant during one stationary motion, have different values in the
two motions.      In such a case, of course, in the determination of
the variation SU the difference of the constants must be taken
into account in addition to the difference of the coordinates.
   But we will now assume that, in the two motions whjch we
have now to compare, such a difference does not occur — the ergal
in both being represented by one and the same function of the
coordinates, with unaltered constants.         In this case the above
sum is the complete variation of the ergal and can be denoted
by SU ; and accordingly the left-hand side of equation (2) is the
mean value of the variation of the ergal, or (which is the same
thing) the variation of its mean value, which is represented by
SU.    For this  case, therefore,   equation (2) passes into
                           vn
                                                                      (3)
   To this equation we will now give a somewhat simpler form.
We will first transform it in the following manner : —
                       = ma8 Slog («\/t>s).
   For the product here standing under the logarithm,             we will
introduce a single sign, putting
                              \=»VP'.                                 (4)
Then our equation is transformed into
                              SU=»j^SlogX                             (5)
   As the left-hand side of this equation is a variatioin, the right-
hand side must be so too. Hence it follows that mv* is a func
tion of X ; and accordingly U must then be also a function of X.

                                                          ......
By inserting here the expressions from (6) and (7), we obtain

 the time of a revolution, and the energy.   It is of course under
 stood that we eliminate X from each two of these equations, and
 can thereby obtain relations between each two of the four quan
tities named.    Let us suppose this carried out by combining
each of the first three equations with the last ; we thus obtain
three equations, which determine the mean ergal, the mean vis
viva, and the time of a revolution as fuuctions of the energy.
This method of determination is peculiarly convenient for appli
cation, inasmuch as in every motion the energy has a constant
value, which can be at once given, if only the velocity of the
moving point in any position is known.
    We now require only to find the form of the function f(\) .
This, of course, depends on the law under which the force ope
rates on the point.     The determination of this function is espe
cially easy when the force is an attractive force proceeding from
a fixed centre, and is represented by any function of the distance;
and this case we will now consider*.
    The distance of the moving point from the centre of attraction

may be denoted by r, and the function which represents the
quantity of the force by F'(;~).         If
                                      we then put
                             /F'(r)rfr=F(r),                                   (10)
F(r) is the ergal; and by introducing this function in the place
of U, equation (6) is transformed into
If now     for any specialcase of the motion the form of the func
tion which satisfies this  equation can be found, the same form
will also hold good universally.     Such a case is when the point
moves round the centre of attraction in a circular path,       r is
                                              .......
then constant, and we need not take the mean value of F(r), but

Further, in this    case the velocity also is constant     :   and hence in
equation (4)           in the place of the mean value
                 we can,                                                 v*,    put

     Applying this to equation (11), which has taken the place of

 following equations    : —

    The four equations here found are of the same form as the
equations (19) to (22) — which might have been expected, since the
motion first considered is only a special case of the one last dis
cussed — namely, the limiting case, which is arrived at by assu
ming that one of the masses is so large in proportion to the other,
that during the motion round their common centre of gravity it
can be regarded as at rest.         Hence it will not be necessary to
develope the special forms which the equations here found
assume when the force is proportional to a power of the distance,
because they perfectly correspond to the forms previously de
veloped.

                 has criticised some remarks of mine upon        the be
haviour of ice-planks under strains produced by their own gravi
tation.    The remarks in question were contributed to the Alpine

                       upon Glacier-motion.
Journal for February, and to 'Nature'         for March 24, 1870,
where it was pointed out that an ice-plank 6 inches wide and 2
inches thick, or thereabout, when supported upon horizontal
bearers 6 feet apart, became gradually deflected, even under a
temperature constantly below freezing, and was just as rigid in
its altered as in its original form.   I  regarded this experiment
as absolutely subversive of the Canon's theory, that the descent
of glaciers by their weight alone is a mechanical impossibility,
and in the article in ' Nature expressed myself as follows : — " I
                                 '
shall not now attempt to discuss the nature of the molecular
displacements to which the change of form is due. Their occur
rence is indisputable, and whether or not they are dignified by the
name of shearing is a mere verbal question of little moment."
" If the conclusions drawn from the experiments above described
are legitimate, plasticity must be admitted by the side of sliding
and fracture and regelation, as one of the constituent elements
of the theory of glacier-motion, and a more important place in
that theory must be assigned to the views of the late Principal
Forbes than has for some years been conceded to them."
                                                          I
   It was not, therefore, without some surprise that read the
following passages in the Canon's recent paper: — "Mr.Mathews,
however, and M. Heim after him, as well as Mr. Ball, deny that
glacier-ice shears at all.    They say that it bends."
                                                            " The idea
present in common to the minds of these gentlemen seems to be
that in bending so as to take a set, ice does not shear.            In
this I   venture to think there is a misapprehension.           In the
bending of a plate of ice every particle, except those at the points
of support, is made to move in the direction in which the plate
is bent — those particles which are at the point of greatest inflec
tion being made to move furthest, and those nearer to it being
always made to move further than those more remote ; so that
every particle moves over that which is alongside towards the
nearest point of support; and being assumed to have taken a set,
it must have sheared over it."
   If the Canon will do me the favour to reperuse the para
graph from the Alpine Journal quoted in support of the lan
guage which he puts into my mouth, he will see that it has an
opposite significance to that which he attaches to it.          I have
hesitated, it is true, to identify the molecular displacements of
the ice-plank with the shearing described by Canon Moseley ; but
I should be the last to deny that his account of the former pheno
menon is a possible hypothesis.       Let us by all means adopt    it,
for the sake of argument, and see to what       itleads us.
   The cross section of the ice-plank      is12 square inches.      In
order that a   slice of the plank may move over the next alongside,
it must be subjected to   a   pressure equal to twelve times the unit

 900 Ibs. The problem        how    is,

                                                       is
 out of the gravitation of an ice-plank the entire weight of which
is   less than 32 Ibs.         am curious to see the mathematical rea

 soning    by   which the Canon will perform this feat of mechanical
  legerdemain.       If he declines may invite him to consider the

  inverse problem, and to calculate the shearing-force of ice from
  the behaviour of an ice-plank under strain                      ?
      My own mathematical resources are not adequate to the task                         ;
  but venture to submit the following as an approximate solution.
     I
  If the whole weight of the plank were employed in shearing                             it,
  and in shearing        only along the supporting edges, two surfaces,
                          it
 each with an area of 12 square inches, would be sheared                            by   a
  force of 32 Ibs., or         ly
                              Ib. per square inch.      But, of the whole
 weight    of  the plank, one portion        employed in exerting
                                                       is             pres      a
  sure upon the bearers,          second in exerting
                                    a                      stress upon the
                                                                      a
 upper half of the plank and          strain upon the lower, leaving only
                                             a
a    third portion available for producing shear. And this third
 portion  is   exerted, not merely at the supporting edges, but in
 shearing successive slices of the plank continuously from end
 to end.      The shearing-force therefore must be less, probably
 very considerably less, than           Ib. per square inch.

      In the Philosophical Magazinefor January 870 Canon Moseley  1
 has given us        ashearing-force varying, in round numbers, from
 119 to 98 Ibs. per square inch.            In subsequent experiment,

 described in his recent paper, he has sheared ice with            force of a
 63'6 Ibs. per square inch. Surely,                          by
                                                judicious management, he
 may make still further progress in the same direction.                The
 whole of his experiments on shearing, as hitherto conducted, are
 irrelevant to the problem of glacier-motion.          In an actual glacier
 the dislocated masses of which              composed are subject to lon
                                                  it    is

 plank.   It    is possible that under this condition the resistance to
 shearing may be largely decreased            and this condition was ex

XLII.      On the Effect of small Variations of Temperature on Steel
    Mat/nets.     By J. E. H. GORDON and WILLIAM NEWALL,
    lately Students in the Laboratories of King's College, London*.
             Astronomer Royal, in speaking of the effect of tempe
THE     rature  on magnets             on Magnetism, p. 68), says: —
" The ratio of change (Treatise
                           ....  is very different with different mag
nets; it probably depends on the quality of the steel, possibly
on the mode of magnetization ; but on this point nothing is
known with certainty."        We have been for some time engaged
in investigating this subject, and have arrived at a result which
we venture to hope will not be considered altogether devoid of
interest.      Our plan of proceeding was as follows. We took five
steel bars procured from different makers, each bar about 5 mil
limetres in diameter and 80 millims. in length.          We observed,
     1st. The fall in magnet power for 1° C. between 20° and 50°.
     2nd. The specific gravity of each bar at two temperatures ;
and from this we deduced the expansion rate.
     3rd. The chemical composition, t. e. the percentages of iron
and of impurity.
     To ascertain the variations in the magnetic power, we used a
magnetometer of Mr. Becker's make.                The scale is about 2
 metres long j it is curved to a radius of 2 metres, and is placed
 at that distance from the suspended magnet. • The scale is di
 vided into millimetres, each of which corresponds to 51'5 seconds
 of arc. It is illuminated either by a lamp or by sunlight re
 flected from a mirror.      The magnetometer was firmly clamped
 down upon a table of brickwork. The scale stood on the boarded
 floor.     Its three legs were firmly screwed to the floor ; and one
 end was wedged against the wall.            A curtain of black linen
 with a hole for the telescope to come through was suspended
 behind the scale so as to form a background.           On the base of
 the magnetometer, near the opposite end to that at which the
 mirror is suspended, is screwed a plate of ivory about 12 cen-
 tims. square by 6 millims. thick.         On this lies the box which
  contains the disturbing magnet.          The ivory is to prevent the
 heat of the box expanding the base and altering the distances.
 The box (which is of brass) is about 85 millims. long, 50
  high, and 100 broad as the instrument lies. At each end is a
  circular hole 20 millims. in diameter.         In these holes are in
 serted disks of cork with holes in them, in which the magnet is
 fixed. When the magnet is fixed in position the corks are coated
 with shellac varnish ; and while it is still wet, slips of glass
 warmed over a spirit-lamp are placed over them.             This makes
 a perfectly water-tight joint.       In the top of the box are fixed
                       *

336     Messrs.     J.   E. H. Gordon and W. Newall                  on the   Effect
two small tubes for water, and one larger one for a thermometer.
The connexions from the water-tubes to the supply and waste-
pipes are made by means of india-rubber tubing, so that no jar
can be transmitted to the box. On the base, at each end of the
ivory plate, is fixed a brass upright with a horizontal set-screw.
The ends of these screws press on the glass clips just over the
ends of the magnet, and keep the box in its place.            The water
supply is conveniently arranged so that by turning          one  tap hot
water is made to circulate through the box, and by turning aa-
other cold water is sent through.
   The thermometer is by Casella, divided on the stem ; and on
its scale the division representing 1° C. is about 1 millim. long.
In the earlier experiments the readings were taken at 20°, 25°,
30°, and to 50°C.; afterwards it was found more accurate and less
troublesome to take readings alternately at 20° and 50° C.           The
bars were hardened by heating them to dull redness              e. about  (t.
530° to 560° C. (Daniel)) and plunging them into cold water.
They were then magnetized               by
                                    being placed in    helix belonging
                                                                 a
to an electromagnet containing 35 Ibs. of insulated wire.            The
helix was excited        by
                        from     to 4 pint Grove's cells.
                                         6                   After being
magnetized, each bar was dipped alternately three or four times
into basins of hot (about 80°) and cold water.              This was to
remove any magnetism which would be permanently lost                                  by   a
rise of 20° to 50°. C.     The specific gravities were taken in the
ordinary way    ; the  balance,   however, was not good enough to
 make it  worth while to correct for the buoyancy of the air. The
apparent specific gravities in water at 15°-5 C. (60° F.) and at
37°-7 C. (100° F.) were taken.          They were multiplied          the        by
specific gravity   of water at. those  temperatures.      These   specific
gravities were calculated from data given         Dalton (see Miller's

     We hardened our bars by plunging them into water when
they were at a red heat, just visible in daylight in the darkest
corner of a room. When tempered there is a slight difference,
 though we cannot say in which direction.           When hardened at a
 full red or approaching a white heat, the magnet power increases
 and the value of F diminishes considerably.

  of the hardness to make it of universal application.
      Almost all the quantities concerned are absolute, the only
 measures referred to being the Centigrade scale, and the assump
  tion that the specific gravity of water at 4° C. =1'000.
      We are only beginners in scientific work, and by no means
  wish our measurements to be received as absolutely correct;

  have been able to attain.

                         By HENRY HUDSON, M.D.*

PREVOST'S
    an "Emission       Theory of Heat,"   and, having regard to the
then existing state of knowledge, was undoubtedly a most inge
nious mode of explaining the apparent " radiation of cold."
   The objections to     in connexion with Leslie's discovery of
                            it,
the influence of surface on radiation, have not,        think, been   I
sufficiently attended to  and;after briefly considering the matter
theoretically,  shall adduce, as believe, conclusive experimental
                 I                     I
evidence against it.
   There can be no doubt that the ingenious speculations of
Professor Balfour Stewart and others have contributed to the
advancement of the doctrine of exchanges in no small degree,
as being immediately connected with the well-known parallelism
(or equality) of the
                      " radiating and absorbing powers " of the
same body for heat.      But to my mind these qualities are essen
                                                 "
tially due to the " different capacities for heat of the surfaces.
Thus, if  two bodies, in   common medium, are equally above (or
                               a
below) the temperature of that medium, the tendency of each body
to attain the temperature of the medium will be perfectly equal.
Each therefore tends to radiate (or absorb) the same                      (say      intn)
portion of its excess (or deficiency) of temperature, and conse
quently each body will radiate (or absorb) quantities of heat pro
 portional to its " capacity for heat." Hence radiation and ab
sorption (being both due to the same quality in bodies) must be
proportional to each other.
   Assuming      " wave-theory " of heat, let us suppose body
                 a                                                 (A)    a
placed  in   medium of the same temperature as itself
             a                                                 e. both    (f.
body and medium being in          state of perfect equilibrium as to
                                       a
molecular and aetherial vibrations).   How        possible to conceive
                                                         is

that this body can lose any portion of its vibratory motion so
long as that of the surrounding medium continues undisturbed                           ?

 vibration ; and hence the idea that the temperature of the earth's
 surface can fall (by radiation) below that of the atmosphere im
 mediately resting on it (as is assumed in the received theory of
 dew-formation)       I  hold to be utterly untenable.          Again, if we
 imagine    such  a  body,  at any temperature,     to exist alone in bound
 less space, it appears to follow (on Prevost's theory), whatever be
 the temperature of the medium, that the vibrations of the mole
 cules of the body must ultimately cease altogether in consequence
 of its receiving no return for its own wasted radiation.
                           Experimental     evidence.
    Let A B represent a metallic mirror, in whose focus (C) one
of the balls of a differential thermometer is placed, E a cubic
canister (two of its adjacent sides being bright metal, the other
two varnished), F representing a large tin screen.             Suppose E to
be filled with ice-water, and its metallic surface facing the mirror.
The focal ball will be chilled, by an apparent "radiation of cold"
from the canister, which is reflected by the mirror to its focus.
The admirers of Prevost say that E (being colder than A B) can
no longer radiate so much heat to it as it received (and reflected
to C) when E was of its own temperature, and therefore the tem
perature of C is reduced.          Well — let the varnished surface of E
be turned towards the mirror, and we find as a result that C is
more chilled than it had been by the metallic surface ; thus a
more powerful
                    " radiation of heat," which ought at least to di
minish the previous chill, causes the reflection of more cold to
the focal ball.      I have always considered the above simple expe
riment    of Leslie's   to be fatal to Prevost's theory of exchanges;
for the radiation (from either A B, or C) is assumed to be wholly
independent of the radiation of E, and consequently                 we have
only   to consider    the  effect  of the latter as  a radiator.
    There are many variations of Leslie's experiment, all leading
to the same conclusion.           Thus, having gilt one of the balls of
his differential thermometer, he denominated it a " pyroscope."
Now, in repeating the above experiment with this instrument, the
results correspond with those already related, whether the gilt
or the glass ball be placed in the focus; in every case the var

nished canister produces the greater chill; and it is obvious that
what might appear & plausible explanation with one ball in the
focus must be an utter failure in the case of the other focal ball,
lu fact, however, when canister, mirror, and thermometer are all
at the same temperature as the air, it appears unaccountable (on
Prevost's theory) that the " superior radiative energy " of the
varnished canister does not heat the focal ball when concentrated
upon it by the reflection of the mirror.
    There is a very pretty experiment of Professor Tyndall's with
a thermomultiplier, which (although I have never tried            will,
                                                                   it)

               several internal reflections, reach the pile and pro

experiment)     acold canister as the radiator, and the chilling         in
fluence of the varnished side will doubtless show its superior
efficiency.
    Seeing that the scientific world generally admitted Prevost's
theory,I    brought forward at the first Dublin Meeting of the
British Association (in 1835) what considered an " experimen-
                                       I
tuni crucis."   I  heated the surface of the mirror (by filling    with
                                                                   it
hot water) to about 170° Fahr., and (keeping one ball in the
focus) shifted the differential thermometer until its liquid stood
at zero, both balls being then equally heated                 by
                                                            the mirror.
The temperature of the air in the room was 55° Fahr. the            ;
cubic canister (containing water, at 67°), being placed just              in

and the varnished side was most efficient.           On moving the
canister nearer to the mirror, the effects diminished and at length
ceased, the thermometer remaining at zero whether the varnished
or metallic side of the canister faced the mirror       but on moving
                                                        ;
the canister still nearer to the mirror,        began to act as
                                                it                 cold

body,   and  the varnished   side produced  the  greater  chill.
I     trusted at the time that this experiment (supplementary to
those of Leslie already referred to) would have satisfied scientific
physicists that Prevost was in error and that there could be no
phenomena of radiation so long as         body was of the same tem

I  did not enter into the rationale of the experiment, which             I
believe to be as follows.
   The heated mirror produces        a  gradation of temperature in
front of itself (of course an unstable equilibrium) and when the

will   be no radiation  from either side of the canister        but, accord
                                                                   ;

side will be most efficient.
    This apparent " radiation of cold "            would call

meaning     clear.   Thus,       at one end of

                                ;
the wave will evidently be depressed below the equilibrium-level.
This, therefore,    I   would call       negative wave, being
                                          a                          wave of

 and, notwithstanding the experiments of Forbes, Melloni, and
others in reference to the supposed polarization of heat,               con    I
fess to having grave doubts, being inclined to believe that the
 distinction between waves of light and of heat will be found to
 be due to the " setherial vibrations
                                            " of the former being always
 in plane perpendicular to the progress of the wave, whilst
   a
 those of the latter take place in the direction of wave-propaga
 tion; thus these effects would be due to different functions of
 the aetherial vibrations.         Hence the proportionality of light to
 heat     not to be expected
         is                          and

  and unalterable     in its working than the spring gauges now com
  monly    used  for steam-boilers.
      In the first place, it is a great defect in the common air-mano-
. meter that the divisions on the manometric tube diminish rapidly
  at high pressures, and consequently the reading becomes less
  and less accurate the higher the pressure. The new steam-gauge,
  on the contrary, possesses the same degree of accuracy at all
  pressures, and even enables us to make the accuracy of reading
  greater at high pressures.
      Another serious defect of the air-manometer is the liability to
  rupture of the narrow column of mercury, consequent upon the
  sudden shutting off or turning on of the steam.            This is entirely
  avoided in the present instrument by the use of two closed ves
  sels communicating with each other only by very narrow capil
  lary tubes.      Finally, the small column of mercury enclosed in
  the glass tube of common air-manometers is subject to capillary
  depression, and to the disturbing effects of heat upon the air-
  bulb and upon the mercury.           In the instrument now to be de
  scribed, it is sought to avoid these defects by not using capil
  lary tubes for the manometer, and by disposing the air and mer
  cury in such a way as to make the effect of heat sensible.
      The construction of the apparatus will be plainly seen from
  the annexed diagrams*, representing the apparatus in three dif
  ferent sections.       The air-tube of the manometer consists of a
  series of tubes of equal lengths but different diameters, melted
   together before the lamp, and ending at the top in a glass bulb.
  The lower end is connected by an air-tight screw-joint with the
  first of two iron vessels containing mercury or some other liquid,
  and communicating with each other only by a very narrow capil
  lary channel.       The manometric tube is sealed at the bottom ;
  but there are two fine capillary openings through the side at
  points belowthe surface of the mercury or other liquid contained in
  the two iron vessels. Hence the communication of pressure from
  the steam or other compressed gas whose pressure is to be mea
  sured, and which presses directly upon the surface of the liquid
  in the second iron vessel, can only take place through a system
  of two successive capillary channels ; and the resistance which
  these channels oppose to the motion of the mercury by which
  they are filled makes it impossible for sudden changes to occur
  in the height of the manometric column, and thus entirely pre
  vents the division of the column or the entry of steam or gas
  into the manometer.
      The capacities of the globe and of the several tubes which com
  pose the manometer are so adjusted that they decrease in the

 same ratio as that  in which the pressure increases, which is evi
 dently what is required by Mariotte's law in order that an in
 crease  of pressure of one atmosphere   may cause the first tube to
 be filled by the enclosing liquid, and that a further increase of
 pressure of the same amount may cause the second tube also to
be filled, and so on, each equal increment of pressure causing
 the same rise of the liquid in the manometer-tube.         This ad

     To prevent the accidental       breakage of the manometer, it is
 fastened to the graduated brass plate, and with it screwed to a
 glass cover, | of an inch thick, capable of supporting a pressure
 of 20 atmospheres.        The glass cover is pressed by a screw at
 the top upon a plate of india-rubber, thus entirely preventing the
 entrance of dust or damp.
     The apparatus has already been at work for eighteen months
 in several manufactories in Austria ; and it has been found, by
 comparative experiments with it on the Northern and State rail
  ways of Austria, that it is steadier and more accurate than the
  standard spring and piston manometers used by the companies
  for graduating their own manometers.              Two of these instru
  ments were placed side by side on the same steam-boiler, with
  a new spring manometer by MM. Bendenberg and Schaffer, of
  Magdebourg ; but up to the time of my leaving Prague (that is
  to say, during 1£ year) they remained in strict accordance all the
  time, not £ pound difference of pressure being indicated by
  them, although the temperature of the engine-room varied
  greatly, and one of the air steam-gauges was placed directly on
  the boiler (on direct steam), and quite near the fire, where the
  temperature reached 30° or 35° C.
     The elasticity of air not being subject to alterations like the
  elasticity of a spring, which is greatly affected by heat and by
  rapid variations of pressure, the new gauge is more steady and
  requires less attention than spring gauges of any kind.            It also
 possesses   a  still greater advantage    in being   much   more   sensible
  to small changes of pressure, and indicating them instanta

   The price of the new manometer being no higher than that of
the spring manometer, but permitting greater certainty and ac

   It is important to observe tliat the indeterminateneas of the
function 7 is due not to our ignorance of the conditions of the
motion of the liquid in the pipe, but of its antecedent motion in
the reservoir.   Whenever the conditions of the latter shall be
expressed mathematically, 7 will be determined and the solution
of the problem will be complete.        Meanwhile there is an im
portant case in which the value of y is necessarily unity, and in
which the solution may be completed.        It is that of an open in
clined channel in which the liquid has attained a uniform depth
and a steady equable motion.       Before it has reached the point
where this begins to be the case, the work U i has been already
communicated to        and the work U2 has been already done

formly through a circular pipe.           The sections of the coaxial films
are shown by the parallel lines          in  the figure, and the parts of
these lines included in the space C D c represent those portions
of the films which would have fallen off from the pipe in one
unit of time if they had not moved on (as they are here supposed to
do) in the same directions and with the same velocities after they
had passed the end of the pipe as they had when they came to it.
     Also let C B b c be the space which on the same supposition
would have been filled with liquid in one unit of time if there
had been no resistance of the internal surface of the pipe, and
therefore no differences in the velocities of the films ; and, lastly,
let A. da be the space which would be left vacant in a unit of
 time at the upper end of the pipe if none were admitted there,
and the surrounding liquid did not flow into the vacancy.               The
resistance of the internal surface of the pipe —
     1st. Slops back in every unit of time as much of the liquid as
 would fill the space B C D c A, and therefore destroys as much of
 the work which would otherwise be done by the weight of the
 liquid in each unit of time as is represented by h multiplied by
the weight of the liquid so stopped back.
     2ndly. It causes the coaxial films of liquid to slip over one
 another, which otherwise they would not, and thus it creates the
 resistances of these in their motions over one another, nnd de
 stroys as much of the work which would otherwise be done by
 the weight of the liquid effluent per unit of time as is represented
 by the aggregate work of those resistances.
     Taking, therefore, U3 to represent the work per unit of time
 of the resistance of the internal surface of the pipe, as before*,

    These equations were communicated in a letter to Professor
 Stokes, of date (probably January) 1858, and they were referred
 to by Professor Rankine, in his first paper on Stream-lines,
 communicated to the Royal Society of London*, July 1863.

 burgh, and the following proof is added: —

 let its coordinates relatively to axes OX, OY, OZ, fixed in space,
 be x, y, z.     Let PA, PB, PC be three rectangular axes fixed re-

      These equations will be very conveniently called the Eulerian equa
 tions of the motion.    They correspond precisely to Euler's equations for
 the rotation of a rigid body, and include them as a particular case.        As
 Enler seems to have been the first to give equations of motion in terms of
 coordinate components of velocity and force referred to lines fixed relatively
 to the moving body, it will be not only convenient, but just, to designate
    " Eulerian equations " any
 as                             equations of motion in which the lines of
 reference, whether for position, or velocity, or moment of momentum, or
 force, or couple, move with the body, or the bodies, whose motion is tlie

S72          Sir W. Thomson           on the Influence   of Wind
Observation shows the sea to be ruffled by wind of a much
smaller velocity than this. Such ruffling, therefore, is due to
viscosity of the air.
                                                                   W. T.
            Postscript    to   Part   IV. (October 17, 1871).
    The influence of viscosity gives rise to a greater pressure on
the anterior than on the posterior side of a solid moving uni
formly relatively to a fluid. A symmetrical solid, as for example
a globe, moving uniformly through a frictionless fluid, experi
ences augmentation         of pressure in front and behind equally;
and diminished pressure over an intervening zone. Observation
                                                                      " pres
 (as for instance in Mr. J. R. Napier's experiments on his
sure log," for measuring the speed of vessels, and experiments
by Joule and myself*, on the pressure at different points of a
solid globe exposed to wind) shows that, instead of being increased,
the pressure is sometimes actually diminished on the posterior
side of a solid moving through a real fluid such as air or water.
Wind blowing across ridges and hollows of a fixed solid (such
as the furrows of a field) must, because of the viscosity of the
air, press with greater force on the slopes facing it than on the
sheltered slopes.        Hence if a regular series of waves at sea con
sisted of a  solid  body moving with the actual velocity of the waves,
the wind would do work upon             it,or it  would do work upon the
air, according as the velocity of the wind were greater or less than
the velocity of the waves.          This case does not afford an exact
parallel  to  the   influence   of  wind  on waves, because the surface
particles of water do not move forward with the velocity of the
waves as those of the furrowed solid do.            Stillit may be expected
that when the velocity of the wind exceeds the velocity of pro
pagation of the waves, there will be            a  greater pressure on the
posterior slopes than on the anterior slopes of the waves and       j
vice versd, that when the velocity of the waves exceeds the velo
city of the wind, or     is  in the direction opposite to that of the
wind, there will be      a    greater pressure on the anterior than on
the posterior slopes of the waves.           In the first case the tendency
will be to augment the wave, in the second case to diminish it.
The question whether          a series of waves of   a   certain height gra
dually augment        witha   certain   force  of  wind   or gradually sub
side through the wind not being strong enough to sustain them,
cannot be decided offhand.            Towards answering       it Stokes's in
 vestigation    of  the   work   against   viscosity  of  water  required to
 maintain wavef, gives

rnent.       But no theoretical solution, and very little of experi
mental investigation, can be referred to with respect to the eddy-
ings of the air blowing across the tops of the waves, to which, by
its giving rise to greater pressure on the posterior than on the
anterior slopes, the influence of the wind in sustaining and main
taining waves is chiefly if not altogether due.
      My attention having been called three days ago, by Mr. Froude,
 to Scott Russell's Report on Waves (British Association, York,
 1844),     I  find in it a remarkable illustration or indication of the
leading idea of the theory of the influence of wind on waves,
that the velocity of the wind must exceed that of the waves, in
 the following statement : — " Let him [an observer studying the
 surface of a sea or large lake, during the successive stages of an
 increasing wind, from a calm to a storm] begin his observations
 " in a perfect calm, when the surface of the water is smooth and
 " reflects like a mirror the images of surrounding objects. This
 " appearance will not be affected by even a slight motion of the
 " air, and a velocity of less than half a mile an hour
                                                                 (8£ in. per

      surface.    A gentle zephyr flitting along the surface from point
   '
      to point, may be observed to destroy the perfection of the mir-
   ''
      ror for a moment, and on departing, the surface remains po-
   '
      lished as before ; if the air have a velocity of about a mile an
   '
      hour, the surface of the water becomes less capable of distinct
  " reflexion, and on observing it in such a condition, it is to be
  " noticed that the diminution of this reflecting power is owing
  " to the presence of those minute corrugations of the superficial
  " film which form waves of the third order. These corrugations
  " produce on the surface of the water an effect very similar to
  " the effect of those panes of glass which we see corrugated for
  " the purpose of destroying their transparency, and these corru-
  " gations at once prevent the eye from distinguishing forms at a
  " considerable depth, and diminish the perfection of forms re-
  " fleeted in the water. To fly-fishers this appearance is well
  " known as diminishing the facility with which the fish see their
  " captors. This first stage of disturbance has this distinguishing
  " circumstance, that the phenomena on the surface cease almost
  "
      simultaneously with the intermission of the disturbing cause,
  " so that a spot which is sheltered from the direct action of the
  " wind remains smooth, the waves of the third order being inca-
    '
      pable of travelling spontaneously to any considerable distance,
    '
      except when under the continued action of the original disturb-
   '
      ing force. This condition is the indication of present force,
   '
       not of that which is past.      While it remains it gives that deep
    '
       blackness to the water which the sailor is accustomed to regard
   ' as an index of the
                           presence of wind, and often as the forerunner
  " of more.

374        Sir W. Thomson     on Waves under motive power
     "The second condition of   wave motion is to be observed when
"   the velocity of the wind acting on the smooth water has in-
"   creased to two miles an hour.     Small waves then begin to rise
" uniformly over the whole surface of the water ; these are waves
" of the second order, and cover the water with considerable re-
" gularity. Capillary waves disappear from the ridges of these
" waves, but are to be found sheltered in the hollows between
" them, and on the anterior slopes of these waves.          The regu-
" larity of the distribution of these secondary waves over the
" surface is remarkable ; they begin with about an inch of am-
" plitude, and a couple of inches long; they enlarge as the ve-
" locity or duration of the wave, increases ; by and by contermi-
" nal waves unite ; the ridges increase, and if the wind increase
" the waves become cusped, and are regular waves of the second
"order.      They continue enlarging their dimensions; and the
" depth to which they produce the agitation increasing simulta-
" neously with their magnitude, the surface becomes extensively
" covered with waves of nearly uniform magnitude."
     The " Capillary waves " or " wavea of the third order " re
ferred to by Russell are what I, in ignorance of his observations
on this branch of his subject, had called
                                              " ripples." The
                                                              velocity
of 8J inches (21^ centimetres) per second is precisely the velo
city he had chosen (as indicated by his observations) for the
velocity of propagation of the straight-ridged waves streaming
obliquely from the two sides of the path of a small body moving
at speeds of from 12 to 36 inches per second ; and it agrees re
markably with my theoretical and experimental determination of
the absolute minimum wave-velocity (23 centimetres per second;
see Part V.).     Russell has not explicitly pointed out that his
critical velocity of 8£ inches per second was an absolute mini
mum velocity of propagation.        But the idea of a minimum velo
city of waves can scarcely have been far from his mind when he
fixed upon 8^ inches per second as the minimum of wind that
can sustain ripples.     In an article to appear in 'Nature' on the
26th of this month, I have given extracts from Russell's Report
  (including part of a quotation which he gives from Poncelet and
 Lesbrosin the memoirs of the French Institute) for 1829, show
 ing how far my observations on ripples had been anticipated.
 I need say no more here than that these anticipations do not
 include any indication of the dynamical theory which I have
          and that the subject was new to me when Parts III.,

through very smooth water, the surface of the water is marked
with an exquisitely fine and regular fringe of ripples, in which
several scores of ridges and hollows may be distinguished (and
probably counted, with a little practice) in a space extending 20
or 30 centimetres in advance of the solid.          Right astern of either
a steamer or sailing vessel moving at any speed above four or
five knots, waves may generally be seen following the vessel at
exactly its own speed, and appearing of such lengths as to verify
as nearly as can be judged the ordinary formula

for the length of waves advancing with velocity w, in deep
water.     In the well-known theory of such waves, gravity is as
sumed as the sole origin of the motive forces. When cohesion
 was thought of at all (as, for instance, by Mr. Froude in his im
portant nautical experiments on models towed through water, or
 set to oscillate to test qualities with respect to the rolling of ships
 at sea), it was justly judged to be not sensibly influential in
waves exceeding 5 or 10 centimetres in length.              Now it becomes
apparent that for waves of any length less than 5 or 10 centi
 metres cohesion contributes sensibly to the motive system, and
 that, when the length is a small fraction of a centimetre, cohesion
is much more influential than gravity as " motive

    The following extract from part of a letter to Mr. Froude,
 forming part of a communication to 'Nature' (to appear on the
 26th of this month), describes observations for an experimental
 determination of the minimum velocity of waves in sea-water : —
    "About three weeks later, being becalmed in the Sound of
 " Mull, I had an excellent opportunity, with the assistance of
 " Professor Helmholtz, and
                                    my brother from Belfast, of deter-
 " mining by observation the minimum wave-velocity with some
 " approach to accuracy. The fishing-line was hung at a distance
 " of two or three feet from the vessel's side, so as to cut the
 " water at a point not sensibly disturbed by the motion of the
 " vessel. The speed was determined by throwing into the sea
 " pieces of paper previously wetted, and observing their times of
 " transit across parallel planes, at a distance of 912 centimetres
 " asunder, fixed
                      relatively to the vessel by marks on the deck
 " and gunwale. By watching carefully the pattern of ripples
 " and waves    which connected the ripples in front with the waves
" in rear, I    had seen that it included a set of parallel waves

378       Prof. C. A. Young's Preliminary Catalogue of      the
those which have been seen twice at least; a number observed
on one occasion (September 7) still await verification.
    The spectroscope employed is the same described in the
Journal of the Franklin Institute for November 1870 ; but cer
tain important modifications have since been effected in the in
strument.     The telescope and collimator have each a focal length
of nearly 10 inches, and an aperture of         \  of an inch.    The
prism-train consists of five prisms (with refracting angles of 55°)
and two half-prisms.      The light is sent twice through the whole
series by means of a prism of total reflection at the end of the
train, so that the dispersive power is that of twelve prisms. The
instrument distinctly divides the strong iron line at 1961 of
Kirchhoff's scale, and separates B (not b) into its three compo
nents.    Of course it easily shows0every thing that appears on the
spectrum-maps of Kirchhoff and Angstrom.          The adjustment for
"the position of minimum deviation" is automatic; i. e. the
different portions of the spectrum are brought to the centre of
the field of view by a movement which at the same time also
adjusts the prisms.
    The telescope to which the spectroscope is attached is the new
equatorial recently mounted in the observatory of the College by
Alvan Clark and Sons.        It is a very perfect specimen of the
admirable optical workmanship of this celebrated firm, and has
an aperture of 9-^ inches, with a focal length of 12 feet.
    In the Table the first column contains simply the reference
number.      An asterisk denotes that the line affected by it has no
well-marked     corresponding    dark line in the ordinary solar
spectrum.
    The second column     gives the position of the line upon the
scale  of Kirchhoff's map, determined by direct comparison with
the map at the time of observation.       In some cases an interred
                                     '
gation-mark is appended, which signifies not that the existence
of the line is doubtful, but only that its precise place could not
be determined, either because it fell in a shading of fine lines,
or because it could not be decided in the case of some close
double lines which of the two components was the bright one,
or, finally, because there were no well-marked dark lines near
enough to furnish the basis of reference for a perfectly accurate
determination.                                                  0
   The third column      gives the position of the line upon Ang
strom's normal atlas of the solar spectrum.       In this column an
occasional interrogation- mark 0 denotes that there is some doubt
as to the precise point of Angstrom's scale corresponding to
Kirchhoff's.     There is considerable difference between the two
                                                          o
maps, owing to the omission of many faint lines by Angstrom,
and the want of the fine gradations of shading observed by

times difficult, and makes the atlas of Kirchhoff far superior to
the other for use in the observatory.
    The numbers in the fourth column are intended to denote the
percentage of frequency with which the corresponding lines are
visible in my instrument.        They are to be regarded as only
roughly approximative; it would, of course, require a much
longer period of observation to furnish results of this kind
worthy of much confidence.
    In the fifth column the numbers denote the relative brilliance
of the lines on a scale where 100 is the brightest and 1 the faint
est.    These numbers also, like those in the preceding column,
are entitled to very little weight.
    The sixth column contains the symbols of the chemical sub
stances to which, according to the maps above referred to, the
lines owe their origin.
    There are no disagreements between the two authorities ; in
the majority of cases, however, Angstrom alone indicates the
element; and there are several instances where the lines of more
than one substance coincide with each other and with a line of
the solar spectrum so closely as to make it impossible to decide
between them.
    In the seventh and last column the letters J., L., and E. de
note that, to my knowledge, the line indicated has been observed
and its place published by Janssen, Lockyer, or Rayet.         It is
altogether probable that a large portion of the other lines con
 tained in the catalogue have before this been seen and located by
 one or the other of these keen and active observers; but if so,   I
 have as yet seen no account of such determinations.
    I  would call especial attention to the lines numbered 1 and
 82 in the catalogue ; they are very persistently present, though
 faint, and can be distinctly seen in the spectroscope to belong to
the chromosphere as such, not being due, like most of the other
lines, to the exceptional elevation of matter to heights where it
does not properly belong.        It would seem very probable that
both these lines are due to the same substance which causes the
D3 line.
    I do not not know that the presence of titanium vapour in
 the prominences and chromosphere has before been ascertained.
It comes out very clearly from the catalogue, as no less than 20
of the whole 103 lines are due to this metal.

TT     is much to be regretted that the Oxford Delegates gave Mr.
-*-
      Hiley permission to use their questions. By doing so they have
given a sort of informal authority to a very poor book.                   Several
parts    of the   subject  are  included     that   are  very   ill adapted    for
boys    whose   knowledge    of mathematics       is  limited   to  arithmetic —•
such as the Mensuration of Segments of Spheres, Frustums of
Wedges, &c. But this is by no means the worst point of the book.
Mr. Hiley's statements and explanations are frequently awkwardly
expressed and inexact.        Thus he defines a right-angled triangle as
one " that contains a right angle" (p. 3).           He classifies lines in the
following queer fashion : — " Lines may be either straight, curved, or
parallel" (p. 1). He lays it down that "The circumference of any
                                                           "
circle is divided into 3GO parts called degrees               (p. 6), instead of
"360 equal parts." If an arc ACB subtends at the centre of a
circle an angle A E B, he tells us that " the arc A C B bears the same
ratio to the circumference of the circle that the angle A E B does
to 360°" (p. 70), instead of " the number of degrees in the angle
AEB;" and so on in many other cases.
    Occasionally his inexactness wanders into inaccuracy, as in the
                              "
following case (p. 80) : — To find the circumference or perimeter
of the ellipse.     Multiply half the sum of the two diameters [he
                                           22
means     the two principal   axes']   by  —  ."   If Mr.   Hiley will apply his
rule to the case in which the minor axis is indefinitely small,
when the perimeter will equal twice the major axis, he will easily
deduce the curious arithmetical theorem that
                                    14  = 11,
or, in accordance    with the rule provided       " when greater accuracy        is
desirable"    (p. 81), that
                                 4=3-1416.
    Mr. Hiley's account of the prismoid is given in such a form that
no one who comes fresh to the subject could apply it to the deter
mination of the volume of a portion of a railway-cutting ; yet three
of his examples contemplate this application.                He is particularly
unfortunate in these examples.             One of them (which is due to
the Oxford Delegates) is correctly set, and the answer is correct.
The two other examples were apparently drawn up by Mr. Hiley
himself.     But if he made a model of the solids referred to in his
questions, he would find that one or both of the slant facets of the
cuttings would be not planes hut curved surfaces of some kind or
other, and, as these curved surfaces are not defined, the questions do
not admit of answers.

       We   have by no means exhausted the list of Mr. Hiley's inaccu
  racies.     We have, however, said enough to warn teachers from
  adopting it in middle-class schools. We fear that it may be adopted ;
  for it is cheap, it will probably be puffed by ignorant writers, and
  it comes out with an apparent sanction from the Oxford Delegates.
  But if it is adopted, many an intelligent boy will have all the train

  it might have been had his teacher put into his hands a well-written
  treatise on "Explanatory Mensuration."

           "On    the Measurement of the Chemical Intensity of Total Day
   light made at Catania during the Total Eclipse of December 22,
   1870."       By Henry E. Roscoe, F.R.S., and T. E. Thorpe, F.R.S.E.
        The following communication contains the results of a series of
   measurements       of photochemical action made at Catania in Sicily,
   on Dec. 22nd, 1 870, during the total solar eclipse of that date, with
   the primary object of determining experimentally the relation exist
   ing between this action and the changes of area in the exposed
   portion of the sun's disk.        The attempt to establish this relation
   has already been made by one of us from the results of observations
   carried out by Captain John Herschel, R.E., F.R.S., at Jamkandi,
   in India, during the total eclipse of Aug. 18, 1868.        Unfortunately
   the state of the weather at Jamkandi at the time of the eclipse
    was very unfavourable, and the results were therefore not of so
   definite a character as could be desired, and it appeared important
   to verify them by further observation. The method of measurement
   adopted is that described by one of us in the Bakerian Lecture for
    1865 ; the observations were made in the Garden of the Benedictine
    Monastery of San Nicola, at Catania, the position of which, accord
   ing to the determination of Mr. Schott of the United States' Coast
    Survey, is lat. 37° 30' 12" N., long. 1" 0' 18" E.     In order to obtain
    data for determining the variation in chemical intensity caused by
    the alteration in the sun's altitude during the eclipse, observations
    were made on the three previous days, during which the sky was
    perfectly cloudless.
        In the following Table the observations taken at about the same
    hours are grouped together : —

    The above numbers confirm the conclusion formerly arrived at, viz.
that the relation between total chemical intensity and sun's altitude
is represented by a straight line, or by the equation
                            CIa=CI0+const. x    a,
where CI« signifies the chemical intensity at any altitude a in circular
measure, C10 the chemical intensity at 0°, and const, a a number de
rived from the observations.
    The observations on the day of the eclipse (the 22nd) were com
menced about nine o'clock A.M., and up to the time of first contact
were made regularly at intervals of about an hour.              The sky up to
this point was cloudless, and the measurements almost absolutely
coincided with the mean numbers of the preceding day's observa
 tions.     As the eclipse progressed, and the temperature of the air
 fell, clouds were rapidly formed, and from lh 40' up to the time of
 totality it was impossible to make any observations, as the sun was
never unclouded for more than a few seconds at a time.             As the illu
 minated portion of the solar disk gradually increased after totality,
the clouds rapidly disappeared, the amount falling from 9 (overcast
 = 10) to 3 in about fifteen minutes. The observations were then
regularly continued to within a few minutes of last -contact.
    Although the disk and by far the largest portion of the heavens
were completely obscured by clouds during totality, rendering any
 determination of the photochemical action perfectly valueless for our
 special object, it was yet thought worth while to attempt to estimate
 the chemical intensity of the feebly diffused light at this time, which
 certainly is capable of producing photographic action.
     Immediately after the supposed commencement of totality the slit
was opened, and the sensitive paper exposed for ninety-five seconds.
 Not the slightest action, however, could be detected on the paper ;
and we therefore believe that we are correct in estimating the inten
sity of the chemically active light present at certainly not more than
0-003 of the unit which we adopt, and probably much less.

made during the eclipse, obtained from the graphical mean, and

   From these observations we conclude that the diminution in the
total chemical intensity of the sun's light during an eclipse is di
rectly proportional to the magnitude of the obscuration.
   The question of the variation of (1) the direct and (2) the dif
fused radiation is next discussed.        On comparing the curve repre
senting the   chemical   intensity of diffused light with the curve of solar
obscuration, it is found that the rate of diminution in chemical action
exerted by the diffused light is up to a certain point greater than cor
responds to the portion of eclipsed sun, whilst from this point up to
totality the rate of diminution becomes less than corresponds to the
progress of the eclipse.      The same rapid diminution in the chemical
action of the diffused daylight during the early periods of the eclipse
was also observed at Jamkandi ; it is doubtless due to the dark body
of the moon cutting off the light from the brightly illuminated por
tion of sky lying round the solar disk.
   The results of the observations at Catania are then compared with
those made at Moita, near Lisbon, and communicated to the Society
in 1870.     This comparison shows a striking coincidence between the
two sets of observations.      In each case it is seen that the relation
between solar altitude and total chemical intensity is represented by
a straight line, although the Catania observations slightly exceed, by
a constant difference,     those made at Moita, in conformity with the
slight difference in latitude, and with the fact that the former deter
minations were made at a greater elevation above the sea-level.
   The Catania observations further confirm the fact which we for
merly announced, that for altitudes below 50° the amount of che

mical action effected in the plane of the horizon by diffused daylight
is greater than that exerted by direct radiation, and also that at alti
tudes below 1 0° direct sunlight is almost completely robbed of its
chemically active rays.

    Prof. Duncan described, under the name of Solenastrcea Prestwiehi,
 a small compound Coral obtained by Mr. A. Bell from Waldringfield,
 and stated that it was particularly interesting as belonging to a
reef-forming type of corals which has persisted at least from the
 Eocene period to the present day.      The single specimen consisted of
 several small crowded corallites, having calices from -^ to
 in diameter, united hy a cellular epithecal ccenenchyma.

 much rolled and worn before its deposition in the Red Crag, and
 hence the author regarded it as a derivative fossil in that formation ;

     2.  " Notes on the Minerals of Strontian, Argyllshire."    By Robert
  H. Scott, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The paper stated that the existing lists of minerals to be found
  at Strontian were incorrect.      The discovery of apophyllite, talc,
  and zircon seemed to be hardly sufficiently confirmed.           On the
  other hand, Mr. Scott named several species which he had himself
  observed in situ, and which are not noticed in any of the books, viz. :—
  two felspars, orthoclase, and an anorthic felspar in the granite ;
  two varieties of pyroxenic minerals in the granites and syenites,
  neither of which have as yet been analyzed ; natrolite in the trap-
  dykes, muscovite or margarodite in very large plates, lepidome-
  lane and schorl.
     Specimens of these minerals and of the others found at the mines
  were exhibited ; but it was stated that, owing to the fact that the
  old workings at the mines in Glen Strontian had been allowed to
  fall in, it was now no longer possible to ascertain much about the
  association of the species.
     The one is galena, containing very little silver.      The gangue is
  remarkable for the absence of fluor and the comparative rarity of
  blende and heavy spar.        Harmotome is found principally at a
  mine called Bell's Grove, both in the opaque variety and in the
  clear one called morvenite. Brewsterite occurs at the mine called
  Middle Shap ; and at the mine Whitesmith strontianite is found
  with brewsterite, but without harmotome.          Calcite is also very
  common.

 Corrantee, which is in the gneiss, whereas the other mines lie on
 the junction of the granite and gneiss.         At this mine several fine
 specimens of calcite have occurred, many of them coated with twin
 crystals of hannotome, similar to those from Audreasberg, whereas
 the crystals found at the old mine are not so clearly macled.
     Associated with these were found a number of small hexagonal
 prisms, perfectly clear, and exhibiting a very obtuse dihedral ter
 mination.      They gave the blowpipe reaction of harmotome, and, on
 analysis by Dr. J. E. Eeynolds, proved to be that mineral.
     Descloiseaux has already described a quadrifacial termination to
 harmotome, with an angle of 178° 20'.
     Mr. Scott submitted that possibly the crystals which he ex
 hibited might bear faces which had a close relation to those described
 by Descloiseaux.
     He concluded by stating that Strontian promised as rich a harvest
 to the mineralogist as any locality in these islands.

 China and Eastern Asia."         By T. W. Kingsmill, Esq., of Shanghai.
     The   author  stated that the Baron von Eichthofen had lately ap
 plied   the  term  " Loess " to a light clay deposit covering immense
 tracts in the north of China.         The author regarded this formation
 as in great     measure    corresponding to the Kunkur of India, and
 thought that it probably extended far into the elevated plains of
 Central Asia.      Bichthofen considered that this deposit had been
 produced by subaerial action upon a surface of dry land ; the author
  argued that it is of marine origin, having been deposited when the
 region which it covers was depressed at least 6000 feet, a depression
 the occurrence of which since the commencement             of the Tertiary
 period   he considered   to  be proved by  the  mode  of  deposition of the
 Upper Nanking        Sandstones    and  Conglomerates,   the  bold escarp
 ments of the hills on either side of the Yangtsze, and other pecu
 liarities of the country.

    In the Promontory of St. David's the rocks upon which the con
 glomerates and purple and greenish Sandstone, forming the aeries
usually called the " Longmynd" and " Harlech Groups," repose, are
highly quartziferous, and in many spots so nearly resemble syenite
that it is at first difficult to make out their true nature. The appa
rent crystals, however, are for the most part angular fragments of
quartz, not possessing the true crystalline form of the mineral. The
matrix does not exhibit a crystalline arrangement, and contains a
very large proportion of silica, much exceeding that which is ob
tained from rocks of a syenitic nature.         These quartziferous rocks
form an E.N.E. and W.S.W. course. The arrangement of these rocks,
which seem to be quartziferous breccias, is somewhat indistinct.

   In the immediate neighbourhood of St. David's they have asso
ciated with them irregular bands of hard, greenish, ashy-looking
shales, much altered in character, but often presenting distinct
traces of foliation.      In a ridge running from the S.E. of Kamsey
Sound in a north-easterly direction the greenish shales are more
compact, and resemble earthy greenstones.
   The quartziferous breccias and their associated shales form two
anticlinal axes, contiguous to each other, and have on their S.S.E.

   The discovery of a fauna (specially rich in trilobites) among these
rocks of the St. David's Promontory, affords very important informa-
tion concerning the earlier forms of life of the British Isles.             Until
the discovery of this fauna, these rocks and their equivalents in
North Wales were looked upon as all but barren of fossils. We have
now, scattered through about 3000 feet of purple and green strata,
a well-marked series of fossils, such as have nowhere else been ob
tained in the British Isles.       In the Longmynds of Shropshire the
only evidence of the existence of life during the period of their
deposition is in the form of worm-burrows, and in the somewhat
indistinct impressions which Mr. Salter regards as trilobitic, and to
which he has given the name of Palceopyge liamsayi.               If we assume
the purple and green shales and sandstones, with               their  associated
quartz rocks of Bray Head and the drab shales of Carrick M'Eeily,
county Wicklow, to represent the old rocks of St. David's, they
afford only very meagre evidence of the occurrence of life during the
period of their deposition, in the form of worm-burrows and tracks,
and in the very indeterminate fossils which have been referred to
the genus Oldhamia.
   One very prominent feature about the palaeontology of the ancient
rocks of St. David's is the occurrence of four distinct species of the
 genus Paradoxides ; and this is in strong contrast with the entire

absence of the genus Olenus.      On a comparison of the palaeontology
of the St. David's rocks with those of the continent of Europe and of
America which seem to occupy nearly the same horizon, we have
like features to a very great extent presenting themselves.
    With reference to the distribution in time of some of the earlier
genera of trilobites, it would appear that the genus Olemis is repre
sented in Britain and Europe by twenty-two species, confined to the
Lingula-flags and Tremadoc rocks, and not occurring so low as the
Menevian group. The absence of this genus from the Menevian
group, and its occurrence throughout the whole of the Lingula-flags,
 and in the Tremadoc rocks, along with the fact that, so far as pre
sent observations go, no species of Paradoxides ranges higher than
the Menevian group, have afforded good palaeontological grounds for
placing the line of demarcation between Upper and Lower Cambrian
at this spot, and for including the Menevian group in the Lower
 Cambrian, to the bulk of which it is intimately united palseonto-
 logically.

 rocks of Sinai, had been identified with the " Nubian Sandstone

 described by Russegger as occurring in Egypt, Nubia, and Arabia
 Petraea.    In the absence of palseontological evidence, this sandstone
 has been referred to the Mesozoic group, having been regarded by
 Russegger as Lower Cretaceous, and by Mr. Bauerman and Figari-
 Bey as Triassic, the latter considering an intercalated limestone-bed
 to be the equivalent of the Muschelkalk.       The author has detected
 Orihis Michelini in a block of this limestone from Wady-Nasb, which
 leads him to refer it to the Carboniferous epoch, as had already
 been done by the late Mr. Salter from his interpretation of certain
 encrinite-stems obtained from it. The author mentioned other fossils
 obtained from this limestone, and also referred to species of Lepido-
 dendron and Sigillaria derived from the sandstone of the same
 locality.   He regarded the Adigrat Sandstone of Mr. Blanford as
 identical with the Nubian Sandstone.

 By W. Boyd Dawkins, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author in this paper described a lower jaw of the Glutton,
 which     had been obtained by Messrs. Hughes and Heaton from a
 cave at Peas Heaton, where it was associated with remains of the
 Wolf, Bison, Reindeer, Horse, and Cave-Bear.         He remarked that
 he could detect no specific difference between the Qtdo spelcms,
 Goldfuss, from Germany, and the living Gulo luseus, except that the
 fossil Carnivore was larger than the living, probably from the com
 parative leniency of the competition for life in postglacial times.
 He referred to the distribution of the Glutton in a fossil state, and
 argued that its association with the Reindeer, the Marmot, and the
 Musk-sheep, would imply that the postglacial winters were of

of the British Fossil Lamellibranchiata."        By J. Logan Lobley, Esq.,
F.G.S.
    In this paper the author showed, by means of diagrammatic
tables, what appears to be the present state of our knowledge of the
general Stratigraphical distribution of the fossil Lamellibranchiata
in Britain. As a class, the Lamellibranchs are sparingly repre
sented in the Lower, and more numerously in the Upper Silurian
group, and fall off again in the Devonian ; they greatly increase in
number in the Carboniferous, become scanty in the Permian and
Trias, and attain their maximum development in the Jurassic rocks.
They are also largely represented in the Cretaceous and Tertiary
series.    The Stratigraphical distribution of the two great subordinate
groups, the Siphonida and the Asiphonida, corresponds generally
with that of the class ; the Siphonida predominate over the Asipho
nida in Tertiary formations, whilst the reverse is the case from the
Cretaceous series downwards.          Nearly all the families of Lamelli
branchs are represented in the Jurassic and Carboniferous rocks,
and in the former very largely. The author remarked especially on
the great development of the Aviculidse in Carboniferous times.

Geological Survey of that colony.         He described the rocks met with
during excursions in the Pomeroon district, along the course of the
Cuyuni and Mazuruni rivers, on the Demerara river, on the Essequibo
and its tributaries, on the Rupununi river, and among the southern
mountains.       The rocks exposed consist of granites and metamorphic
rocks, overlain by a sandstone, which forms high mountains in the
middle part of the colony, and is regarded by the author as probably
identical, or nearly identical, with the sandstone stretching through
Venezuela and Brazil, and observed by Mr. Darwin in Patagonia.

        ON THE TRANSMISSION          OF ELECTRICITY IN LIQUIDS.
            ABSTRACT OF A PAPER BY DR. D. MACALUSO*.
 IN    the first part of this paper the author describes an experimental
     investigation of the changes in the resistance opposed by a liquid,
relatively to the variations of its transverse section, when this section
is greater than the surfnce of the electrodes immersed in the liquid.

In the    second part he shows, also experimentally, that two currents,
proceeding from the same pile and travelling together in a liquid,
exercise an influence on each other, both becoming weaker, and
that no such influence is exerted between two currents furnished by
independent piles — an important fact, which offers a strong analogy
to the phenomena of the interference of light, and appears to merit
further investigation.
     Fechner and Matteucci experimented upon the resistance of liquids
to electric currents, but in an incomplete manner and with inexact
 means of measurement ; so that the results obtained by them cannot
 be considered accurate ; and they are at variance in some cases with
 those given by Dr. Macaluso.
     The method followed by the author is similar to that adopted by
 Becquerel in his researches on the electric conductivity of liquids ;
 but he uses an indicating instrument very much more sensitive and
 accurate than that of Becquerel — that is, a Weidmann's reflecting
 galvanometer.       He divides the current furnished by the pile into
 two portions, passing in contrary directions through the two coils of
 the galvanometer, and regulates the resistance so as to maintain the
 mirror on the zero of the scale.      One of the two circuits is kept con
 stant ; the other is variable, and comprehends the liquid and various
 resistance coils, previously compared with one another and graduated
  to a common scale.       In experimenting, the apparatus was arranged
  so that the mirror of the galvanometer stood at zero when the liquid
  resistance was entirely removed by placing the electrodes in contact :
  the liquid was then interposed, with various lengths and various
  transverse areas ; the mirror of course moved from its zero position,
  and in order to bring it back a portion of the resistance of the coils
  had to be removed ; this portion of resistance removed was equal to
  that opposed by the liquid in the circumstances of the experiment.
  With a view to simplifying the conditions, he adopted as electrodes
  plates having only one face metallic and naked, the remaining sur
  faces being varnished ; they were of copper, and the liquid adopted
  was a solution of sulphate of copper.
      The length of the liquid conductor was varied by placing the
  electrodes at different distances apart ; and its transverse section was
  narrowed or widened by means of glass plates placed in a series of
  grooves made in the bottom and sides of the trough containing the
  liquid, so as to form a channel of various cross section between the
  two electrodes.
      The author also experimented upon the case of the two electrodes
  having different widths.       And he gives Tables of the resistance op
  posed by the conducting liquid in the various circumstances ; which
  resistance he has also expressed by means of curves, in which the di
   mensions of the liquid section are represented by the abscissse, the
   resistances by the ordinates. He arrives at the following conclusions.
      1 . Even when the electrode has only one face in metallic contact
   with the liquid, the electrical resistance of the liquid depends not
   only upon the dimensions of the electrodes, but also upon the section
   of the liquid itself at the sides of the electrodes.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 391
    2. That the parts of the liquid having most influence upon its con-
ducting-power are those nearest to the straight line joining the centres
of the electrodes.
    3. That beyond certain dimensions relatively to certain distances
between the electrodes, the cross section of the liquid has no further
influence ; and that the portion of liquid traversed by the current
increases with the distance interposed between the electrodes.
    4. That the resistance offered by the liquid, as shown by experi
ment, does not agree with that calculated according to the law of
the resistance of circuits relatively to the length and cross section of
the conductor, supposing the conductor to be represented              by the
liquid prism having      the  electrodes as bases  ; and   the  discrepancy
becomes greater as the length of the liquid increases for a given cross
section.
    From these experiments it follows that whea an electric current
travels through a liquid whose cross section is much greater than the
surface of the electrodes, it tends to diffuse itself laterally.    It would
be interesting to examine if this happens also when only a section of
the liquid is narrowed — if when a diaphragm pierced with a small
aperture is interposed, the current diffuses itself in the liquid on
either side of it. Dr. Macaluso's experiments show not only that
the diffusion takes place, but also that the narrowing of the passage
by a diaphragm has comparatively little influence on the resistance,
as, by reducing the width of the passage from 14 inches to an inap
preciable interval (that remaining between the edges of two plates
of glass ground together), the liquid resistance was |not quite qua
drupled, the resistances in the two cases being as 100 to 378, not
withstanding the very great reduction of the area through which the
 current had to pass.       The experiments showed further that when
 the conducting liquid was equal in section to the surface of the elec
trodes, and was made to take the shape of concentric cylindrical
shells, its resistance followed the ordinary law of transmission
 through metallic circuits.
    After describing these experiments, Dr. Macaluso, by a theoretical
 investigation based upon the known law of the resistance of solid
 and liquid circuits (viz. that such resistance varies inversely with
 the cross section when, in the case of liquids, the section is equal
 to the surface of the electrodes), and upon the fact that the resist
 ance diminishes when the cross section of the liquid is made greater
 for a given surface of the electrodes, comes to the conclusion that
 two currents travelling side by side in the same liquid exercise an
 influence upon each other which weakens them both ; and gives
 the following experiments relative to this inquiry : — The electrodes
 were formed of a series of copper points immersed in the conducting
 solution ; these points could be made to approach or recede from
 each other at will, remaining always in the same plane, perpendi
 cular to the direction of the current in the liquid, so that the dis
 tance between the pair of electrodes remained constant.              It was
 found that upon successively separating the points forming each

terposing a greater space between the lines of currents travelling
together through the liquid), the resistance diminished in a certain
proportion —showing evidently a mutual interference between the
various currents emanating from the points and traversing the liquid
together.      Similar experiments were made with electrodes consist
ing of a group of small plates with varnished backs; and it was also
found that the resistance of the liquid decreased as the plates com
posing each electrode were set at a greater distance apart ; such di
 minution of resistance was more marked when the plates of these
compound electrodes were close together, relatively to the distance
between the electrodes themselves, and became inappreciable after a
certain limit had been attained.
    In another experiment a glass plate, immersed in the liquid, was
interposed between the electrodes, and the current passed through a
rectangular aperture, made in the plate ; after observing the resist
ance, the plate was replaced by another, in which two apertures
•were made, but of only half the width, so as to divide the current
into two branches preserving the same area of passage.                This expe
riment was repeated with apertures of various widths ; and it was
found in all cases that, upon splitting the current into two branches
without diminishing the transverse section, the resistance diminished,
proving that two currents travelling side by side in a liquid weaken
each other by mutual interference.              But other experiments, made
by Marianini, showed that two currents, furnished by two indepen
dent piles, traverse a liquid together without interfering with each
other. Dr. Macaluso repeated these experiments with greater exact
ness and with means of noting and measuring the derived currents
resulting from the mutual influence of the two circuits, and found
Marianini's conclusions to be true.            It follows, therefore, that cur
rents travelling together through          a liquid do not interfere when fur
nished by independent piles,        and  that  they do interfere when furnished
by   the  same    pile — as  in the case  of  two  rays of light, which can be
made    to  interfere   only  when   emanating    both   from the same source.
    From these various researches the author draws the following in
                "
ferences : — The facts so far known regarding the passage of electric
currents through liquids lead us to imagine that the transmission
takes place chiefly by electrolysis.          According to Grotthus's theory,
which seems the most probable, electrolytic decomposition occurs in
such a manner that if a particle M A of a salt is decomposed at one
of the poles, for instance the positive pole, such decomposition pro
pagates itself all along a line of particles to the other pole ; the por
tion M of the molecule remaining free at the positive electrode
completes itself by decomposing its neighbouring particle, taking
from it and appropriating a portion of matter similar to that of which
it has been deprived by the electrode ; the second particle so decom
posed acts similarly upon a third, and so on, until at the other elec
trode the part M is obtained free.               if,

    " As   the liquid area acted upon by the current becomes greater and
greater when its distance from the poles increases, and as, conse
quently, the lines of chemical action become longer, it appears pro
bable that these lines of action exercise a repulsive influence upon
each other ; so that, on their being forced closer together, an increase
of resistance or diminution of electric motion follows.
     " Electrical motion must therefore be of such a nature that two
equal and coincident undulations (that is, undulations proceeding
from a single pile) travelling close together, must weaken each other
reciprocally, perhaps through a transformation of electrical into
thermic motion.           Further, there must be a certain difference between
the various successive motions, as two equal and coincident undula
tions proceeding from two independent piles travel together side by
side without the least mutual interference."

Mr. Burden, " Boiling-points of Organic Bodies" (Phil. Mag. June
1871, Supplementary Number), contains a mistake ; for the author
supposes that the velocity of gas-molecules              having the temperature
of t° C. is to be found by multiplying the velocity at 0° C. by
1  + O-Q'        ^u*    ^is velocity     is really found by multiplying         by

  OBSERVATIONS ON THE COLOUR OF FLUORESCENT SOLUTIONS. BY
     HENRY MORTON, PH.D., PRESIDENT OF THE STEVENS INSTITUTE
     OF TECHNOLOGY.
    As the result of a series of experiments to be presently described,
I  have come to the curious conclusion that all the familiar fluorescent
solutions, such as the tincture of turmeric, of agaric, of chlorophyl,
and the solution of nitrate of uranium, emit light of the same colour
by fluorescence,       namely, blue identical with that developed         by acid

  salts of quinine.    This blue, however, as is well known in the case
  of quinine, is not of a single tint or refrangibility, but yields a con
  tinuous spectrum in which the more refrangible rays predominate.
      My attention was first drawn to the subject by observing that a
  specimen of mixed asphalt, which is here largely used in the prepa
  ration of pavements, yielded a light-yellow solution with alcohol
  which fluoresced blue, and an orange solution with turpentine which
  fluoresced green. It at once occurred to me that the green colour
  was simply due to the absorptive action of the coloured solution,
  and not to the development of green rays.             Examined with the
  spectroscope,   the seemingly green fluorescence showed no increase
  in the green or yellow part of the spectrum as compared with the
  blue fluorescence, but only an absorption of the red and violet ends.
  When, however, a piece of fluorescing canary glass or solid nitrate
  of uranium was examined, the green light was (as is well known)
  largely augmented.       I also found that when, by filtration through
 animal charcoal, the solution in turpentine was reduced in colour,
  the green tint of the fluorescence      disappeared   in a corresponding
 degree.     This alone, however, would have proved nothing, as a
 green fluorescing matter might have been absorbed by the charcoal;
 but in connexion with the spectroscopic result it was of interest.
     I next took up for examination the tincture of turmeric. This is
 set down in standard works, such as those of Du Moncel and Bec-
 querel, as fluorescing red.      This solution, when concentrated, has a
 rich orange-red colour ; and the jacket of a Geissler tube being filled
  with it, all the light reaching the eye from the electric discharge
  within is of a deep orange or red colour. If, however, the solution
  is simply diluted until its colour is reduced to a rich yellow, the
  fluorescence appears green.       The same result follows from filtration
 through bone-black, with a marked increase in the amount of fluo
 rescence visible as the light-absorbing colouring-matter is removed.
 By continuing the decoloration until the liquid is colourless or of a
 very light tint, its fluorescence is distinctly blue.
     The results with the spectroscope when it was applied to this
 substance were the same as with the solution of asphalt.          Such also
 is the case with tincture of chlorophvl, which, when fresh and
 green, gives apparently a green light, and when old and brown a
grey colour.
     Finally, I took up the nitrate of uranium, about which such con
 tradictory statements have been published.           This salt in its solid
 state gives a brilliant green fluorescence whose spectrum is figured
 by Becquerel and abounds in green rays; hut in solution it gives a
 very feeble fluorescence, far inferior to that of turmeric, and of no
 more green tint than would be due to its yellow colour.           So in fact
says also the spectroscope.
     From these results it would seem that the molecules of fluorescent
bodies in solution are not capable of restricting their vibrations to
limited ranges, but move at rates corresponding with all refrangibi-
lities, having simply an excess of the higher ones, though the same
substances    in the solid state may act quite differently,   as in the case

of nitrate of uranium, and possibly the fluorescent material in the
asphalt, which may be related to the solid hydrocarbon fluorescing
green which Becquerel mentions (La Lumiere, tome i. p. 382).
   In this general connexion let me mention that I have observed
that while the acid salts of quinine generally are fluorescent, the
chloride is not, and that hydrochloric acid will decompose the acid
sulphate so as to destroy its fluorescence.
   There are several other points in connexion with this and the
foregoing subject, which I must leave for a subsequent discussion.
    P.S. — August 1. I have just obtained results with turmeric
which seem to indicate that its fluorescence is due to the presence
of a substance not yet observed, soluble in water, and without any
colour. — Silliman's American Journal, September, 1871.
                ON THE SPECTRA OF THE        SIMPLE   GASES.
                          BY  M. A.-J. ANGSTKOM.
    In  the   Recherches sur le Spectre solaire which I published in
 1868,   I already announced that the spectrum-observations to which
I had devoted myself had not convinced me of the correctness of the
opinion of Pliicker that one and the same gas, in the state of incan
descence, could give spectra varying with its temperature.        I rather
believed that in the appearance of the spectra a modification may be
observed which consists in the elevation of the temperature bringing
about a greater abundance of lines, and that the relative luminous
intensity of these lines may also undergo some changes, but that
nevertheless the spectrum preserves its character unaltered.          It is
 true that in disruptive discharges it happens, when the tension of the
 gas is increasing, that the spectral lines spread, and even end by
 uniting so as to form a continuous spectrum ; but even then one
 cannot say that the result is a new spectrum.
    Several distinguished physicists, however, are of the opposite
 opinion ; and probably the researches of M. Wiillner (according to
 which hydrogen would have no less than four spectra, oxygen three)
 have strengthened this conviction in the minds of many savants.
 M. Dubrunfaut has expressed his doubts of the correctness of these
 results : he remarks that the multiple spectra of oxygen and hydro
 gen may be due to nitrogen or mercury-vapour introduced by the
 pump into the tubes.        M. Wiillner, however, has shown (Comptes
 Rendus, Jan. 17, 1870) that this explanation is inadmissible.
    .Yet, as the question of the multiple spectra of the gases is a vital
 one for spectral analysis, and in this light M. Wiillner's observations
 are truly important, perchance the following analysis of the pheno
 mena observed will not be without interest.           Permit me to com
 mence with a preliminary remark.        According to the experience ac
 quired, at least by me, the results obtained concerning the spectra
 of the gases are not absolutely sure when the rarefaction is carried
 to its utmost limits.      In proof of this I cite the following fact: —
 On one occasion, when I rarefied as much as possible, by means of
 a mercurial pump, the atmospheric air in a Geissler's tube, at the
 same time causing the discharge of a Ruhmhorff coil to pass in the

396                Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
tube,                           the following spectra : — 1, the ordi
         I obtained in succession
nary air-spectrum ; 2, the  fluted  spectrum of nitrogen : 3, that of
carbonic oxide; 4, when the rarefaction was at its maximum, the
lines of sodium and chlorine.       If
                                   to this we add that when a mercu
rial pump is employed the mercury-lines may present themselves,
just           of sulphur may when sulphuric acid is used to dry the
        as those
gas,  the result may easily be a multiplicity of spectra which it would
be wrong to attribute to one and the same gas.
   As far as I know, I was the first to observe (in 1853) the spec
trum of hydrogen.      Using on that occasion a Leyden jar to produce
incandescence of that gas, which was at the pressure of the atmo
sphere, I obtained a spectrum consisting of an intense line in C not
clearly limited, and two maxima of light in F and G ; the third maxi
mum, in h, was only observed later.         Afterwards Pliicker found
that by operating with rarefied hydrogen a spectrum is obtained
with clearly determined lines. It may thus be regarded as a fact
long known, that the spectrum-lines of hydrogen spread when the dis
charge becomes disruptive, and that they end, when the tension of the
gas is augmented, by forming a continuous spectrum.       M. Wiillner's
spectrum No. 4, then, is only the ordinary spectrum of hydrogen.
  Pliicker was the first who indicated a second spectrum for hydrogen,
principally characterized by a multitude of lines on both sides of D
and towards C. This spectrum generally appears simultaneously with
the preceding, but is distinguished from it by several important cha
racters. By causing the discharge of a Ruhmkorff coil to pass in a
Geissler's tube containing rarefied hydrogen, in a revolving mirror
two images of the incandescent gas are obtained, which correspond
to the two spectra : one of them appears as an isolated line, indica
ting that   the light there is of very short duration ; the other, on the
 contrary, widens into a zone traversed horizontally by striae alter
nately bright and dark.       It is necessary, in this experiment, to re
 gard the Geissler's tube and the axis of rotation of the mirror as
placed vertically.      The duration of the last image, in one experi
ment, was from 5 to 6 thousandths of a second *.
   This image disappears immediately the discharge is made disrup
tive by the addition of a condenser. This property, as well as the
stratification of the light which accompanies         it,
                                                        indicates that we
have here    a combination of hydrogen, either with itself or    a foreign
body; the latter       the most probable.
                      is                      M. Berthelot has published,
in the Comptes Bendus, some observations on          aspectrum which he
obtained by means of combination of hydrogen and benzole.
                           a                                            He
submits that this spectrum belongs to acetylene, and that         has not
                                                                 it
been previously observed.       This, however,  is not the case  ; having
repeated    M.   Berthelot's  experiments   with  some   benzole, I ascer
tained that the spectrum obtained         isno other than M. Wiillner's
hydrogen-spectrum No. 2.         Still,   (as M. Berthelot has shown)
                                         if
 *
     To determine the duration of an image,    I used M. Kcenig's flames.
By projecting simultaneously on the revolving mirror the flame agitated by
the pipe, we have    scale by means of which we can easily determine the
                     a
duration of the luminous phenomena when that duration       very short.

acetylene mixed with a sufficient quantity of hydrogen remains un
altered in a Geissler's tube, so that a decomposition, if produced, is
always accompanied by a corresponding combination, there is nothing
to prevent us from admitting that the hydrogen-spectrum No. 2
belongs to acetylene.
     I pass now to the third of the spectra which M. Wullner thinks
he has found for hydrogen.                This spectrum, which would be quite
new if it belonged to the gas in question, is in all probability only
that of sulphur. This, I believe, is most positively demonstrated by
the following Table, which contains the wave-lengths of the vapour
of sulphur and those determined by M. Wullner for this third spec
trum of hydrogen. The differences met with in the two series are
easily explained by this consideration — that the wave-lengths cited,
both for sulphur and for M. Wiillner's spectrum, have not all the
accuracy desirable.                                                     Sulphur-

    I  persist, therefore, in the opinion that hydrogen has only one
spectrum — the one found in the light of the sun and of the stars.
    Beside the known spectrum of oxygen, M. Wullner has observed
two new ones, which, for brevity, we will designate by the numbers
 2 and 3.      According to the description given of No. 2, it is com
posed principally of four shaded bands with clean edges on the side
towards the red field of the spectrum.                In order to obtain a more
 exact idea of the position of the bands, I constructed the spectrum
itself with the aid of the minima of deviation given by M. Wullner.
I   found that it presented much analogy with the spectrum of the
oxide of carbon.         I afterwards determined the wave-lengths of the
four bands, by construction and with the aid of the wave-lengths
 already calculated by M. Wullner. The following Table gives the
values obtained, and the wave-lengths for the oxide of carbon : —
      Supposed Spectrum of Oxygen, No. 2.

     As is seen, the agreement is perfectly satisfactory ; let us add
that it is equally so in the details, such as the presence of a fainter
 shaded line between 1 and 2, and of two shaded bands in the red
 field. Hence it is impossible to doubt that the spectrum No. 2 be
longs to the oxide of carbon.
    There now remains spectrum No. 3. This no more than the other
belongs to oxygen.           Perhaps some lines of the known spectrum of
oxygen     are found    in    it ; but most of the lines belong to chlorine.
This assertion is put beyond doubt by the following Table, which
contains the wave-lengths of the chlorine-spectrum and those of
spectrum No. 3.

    The result of the above examination will therefore be, that we
know not yet any other oxygen-spectrum than the one observed by
me in 1853, and which has subsequently been studied with great
care by Pliicker.
    I ask permission to add a few words on the action exerted by
magnetism on the spectra of gases; these considerations have an
intimate connexion with what precedes.                        Under the influence of this
action the spectrum assumes, according to M. Trfeve, a quite differ
ent aspect ; so that we should be able to produce not merely by a
rise of temperature, but also by magnetism, the multiple spectra
which, in the opinion of divers savants, present themselves with
gases.     This is correct in several respects ; but the explanation of
the phenomenon appears to me to be different from that which has
been given of it.        In fact the modification in the appearance of the
spectra depends simply on this — that the action of magnetism causes,
at the incandescent state, the occurrence of other substances or other
combinations.       In certain cases the effect of magnetism may be com
pared almost to that which is produced by the addition of a condenser
to the Kuhmkorff coil ; but magnetism appears also to exert a sort
of chemical action, obstructing the production of certain combina
tions, and facilitating the production of others.

    Thus    a  Geissler's tube has given, between the poles of an electro
magnet,       the ordinary spectrum of carburetted hydrogen, whereas,
without the intervention of magnetism, it gave the carbonic-oxide
spectrum without the lines of hydrogen being visible.
    In another tube, filled with hydrogen obtained by the decomposi
tion of water and dried with sulphuric acid, which gave Plucker's
two hydrogen-spectra, under the influence of magnetism there ap
peared those sulphur-lines which M. Wiillner has regarded as form
ing the hydrogen-spectrum No. 3, while the spectrum of carbonic
oxide was shown on the polar wires.
    It would doubtless be premature to endeavour to formulate a law
according to which these changes take place ; but a positive fact is,
that they do not appear to introduce any new spectrum peculiar to
the action of the magnetic forces. — Camples Rendus, August 7, 1871.
ON     THE TESTIMONY OF THE SPECTROSCOPE TO THE TRUTH OP
     THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.              BY PROFESSOR DANIEL KIRK-
     WOOD,      OF   BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA.
     In March      1846 the partial resolution of the great nebula in Orion
 was    announced by Lord Rosse.          In September of the following
 year   the   late  Professor  W. C. Bond,  of Harvard University, stated,
 in confirmation of this interesting discovery, that the part of the
 nebula about the Trapezium " was resolved into bright points of
        "                                              " It should be borne
 light     by the great refractor of Cambridge.
 in mind," continued Professor Bond,         " that this nebula and that of
 Andromeda have been the last stronghold of the nebular theory —
 that is, the idea, first thrown out by the elder Herschel, of masses
 of nebulous matter in process of condensation into systems."
     These grand achievements were regarded by the majority of astro
  nomers as fatal to the claims of the nebular hypothesis.          It is not
 to be denied, however, that this celebrated         theory has more than
 recovered from the shock which it then received, that it has, in
 fact, been materially strengthened by the researches and discoveries
 of the last twenty years.        The truth of this remark is strikingly ex
 emplified by the revelations of the spectroscope.         The man who at
  the middle of the nineteenth century would have been bold enough
 to predict the discovery of the physical constitution of the heavenly
  bodies, or the determination of the elements of which they are com
  posed, would have been generally deemed a scientific enthusiast.
 This, however, and more than this, has been actually accomplished.
  In the hands of Huggins, Secchi, Young, and others the spectro
  scope, that marvel of modern science, has yielded satisfactory testi
  mony, not only in regard to such stars as are reached by our unas
 sisted vision, but even respecting the telescopic nebulee, apparently
  on the outskirts of the visible creation.      A detailed account of these
  wonderful achievements would not comport with our present pur
  pose.     Such results, however, as bear directly upon the theory of
  Laplace will be briefly noted.

    1. The ring nebula in Lyra, the Dumbbell nebula, the great ne
bula in Orion, and others which might be named, are not, as was
but recently believed, extremely remote sidereal clusters ; but their
light undoubtedly emanates from matter in a gaseous form.
   2. " According to Lord Rosse and Professor Bond, the brighter
parts near the trapezium [in the nebula of Orion] consist of cluster
ing stars.   If this be the true appearance of the nebula under great
telescopic power, then these discrete points of light must indicate
separate and probably denser portions of the gas, and that the whole
nebula is to be regarded rather as a system of gaseous bodies tban

   3. Progressive changes in the physical condition of certain nebula
are clearly indicated by the fact that nuclei have been established
which, as shown by their spectra, are not wholly gaseous, but have
passed, at least partially, to the solid or liquid form.
   4. The spectroscopic analysis of the light of several comets reveals
a constitution similar to that of the gaseous nebulae.
   The spectroscope, then, has demonstrated the present existence
of immense nebulous masses, such as that from which Laplace sup
posed the solar system to have been derived.       It has shown, more
over, a progressive change in their physical structure, in accordance
with the views of the same astronomer. In short, the evidence
afforded by spectrum analysis in favour of the nebular hypothesis is
cumulative, and of itself sufficient to give this celebrated theory a
high degree of probability. — Silliman's American Journal, September

 LI.   On the Connexion   of certain Phenomena with the Origin of
    Mineral Veins.    By  J. ARTHUE PHILLIPS, F.C.S., M. Inst.
    C.E., $c*
                             [With  a Plate.]
           origin of mineral veins is a subject which has long oc
 THE     cupied the attention of writers on natural history ; and
 numerous theories have at different times been framed with the
 object of explaining the nature of the causes by which they are
 supposed to have been produced.
    An enumeration and classification of those which had been
 brought forward previously to 1838 is given by Baron von
 Herder in his work on the Meissen adit, published in that year.
    This may be briefly summarized as follows : —
    1st. Theory of contemporaneous formation. — According to this,
lodes are not mineral matter occupying previously existing fis
 sures, but were formed either contemporaneously          with the
enclosing rock, or were subsequently produced by metamorphic
action.
    2nd. Theory of lateral secretion. — Lodes are fissures filled
by various mineral substances derived from the rocks enclosing
them.
    3rd. Theory of descension, by which veins are explained as
being produced by the filling of fissures by materials introduced
from above.
   4th. Theory of ascension. —This teaches that veins are the
result of deposits of mineral substances which have been intro
duced into fissures from below.
    Four distinct modifications of the last theory may be divided
into as many sub-classes.

402         Mr.  J.  A. Phillips on the Connexion   of certain
    a. Infiltration. — The     material was   introduced    by aqueous
solution.
    b. . Aqueous  vapours. — The fissures were filled with mineral
matter introduced by the agency of steam.
    c. Sublimation. — The substances constituting mineral veins
were introduced in a gaseous condition by sublimation.
    d. Injection. —The materials forming veins have, according to
this view of the question, been introduced in a state of igneous
fusion.
    The formation of veins has been the subject of much specula
tion since the date above referred to ; and various authors have
either advanced new theories, or have advocated more or less
important modifications of those before promulgated.
    Among the most worthy of consideration may be cited the
researches of Mr. R.W. Fox, who, after ascertaining the existence
of electric currents in many of the metalliferous veins of Corn
wall, suggested the probability of this force having acted on the
various metallic sulphides and chlorides, dissolved in the hot
water traversing fissures, in such a way as to determine the pe
culiar mode of their distribution.       He has also endeavoured to
account for the prevalence of an east and west direction in the
principal Cornish lodes by their position at right angles to the
earth's magnetism.
    Weighty objections to this theory, however, have been pointed
 out byW.J. Kenwood, as well as by other experienced miners; and
 observed facts would indicate that the general direction of veins,
 in different mining-districts, varies so entirely, that it probably
 depends rather on lines of fracture than on the action of voltaic
 currents.     In fact Von Beust, in his criticism on Werner's theory
  (1840), appears to have conclusively demonstrated that the ma
jority of lode-fissures have been produced by volcanic or plutonic
 agency.
     It is well known that mineral veins are usually found in re
 gions in which igneous rocks are abundant, and in situations
 where they have burst through crystalline or other stratified de
 posits.    Lodes also more frequently occur in rock-formations of
 great age than in recent ones ; and certain classes of them (as,
 for instance, those of oxide of tin) are only found in the oldest
 rocks.
     Sir Charles Lyell, when speaking of chemical deposits in
 mineral veins, remarks, " We know that the rents in which ores
 abound extend downwards to vast depths, where the temperature
 of the interior of the earth is more elevated. We also know that
 mineral veins are most metalliferous near the contact of plutonic
 and stratified formations, especially where the former send veins
 into the latter — a circumstance which indicates an original proxi

              Phenomena with the Origin     of Mineral Veins.            403
 mity of veins, at their inferior extremity, to igneous and heated
 rocks.     It is moreover acknowledged that even those mineral
 and thermal springs which, in the present state of the globe, are
far from volcanoes, are nevertheless observed to burst out along
great lines of upheaval and dislocation of rocks"*.
     It is generally admitted by geologists that igneous causes have
been in active operation in all past ages of the world.        They have
 been constantly changing their areas of activity on the earth's
 surface ; and those districts which are now great centres of vol
canic action were, at remote geological epochs, in a state of
perfect tranquillity ; on the other baud, districts in which vio
lent eruptions took place at former periods have often been
entirely free from volcanic eruptions during later geological
times.      It would appear that the last expiring efforts of volcanic
 action frequently manifest themselves in the form of geysers or
 boiling springs, which, in addition to pouring forth steam and
water holding various salts and minerals in solution, give off
carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and other gases.
     Hot and boiling springs are exceedingly numerous in some of
 the mining regions of the Pacific States of North America, and
 present phenomena possessing the highest degree of interest to
the geologist t-
     The Steamboat Springs, seven miles north-west of Virginia
 city in the state of Nevada, are probably the most remarkable of
 those yet discovered.      They are situated at a height of 5000
feet above the level of the sea, near the foot of the eastern
declivity of the Sierra.        In this locality the granite is tra
versed by numerous parallel fissures, which either give out highly
 heated water or simply eject steam.           The principal group of
 crevices, of which the direction is nearly north and south, com
prises five longitudinal openings, extending nearly in a straight
line for a distance of more than 1160 yards.             These are often
full of boiling water, which sometimes overflows and escapes in
 the form of a considerable rivulet, whilst at others it does not
reach the surface, although violent ebullition is heard to be
taking place below.         These waters are slightly alkaline, and
contain sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate, and common salt.
There is along the whole line an escape of carbonic acid, sul
phuretted hydrogen being also evolved from certain points in
notable quantities.
    Silica, sulphur, and oxide of iron are deposited} and the fissures
are lined on either side (sometimes to the thickness of several
feet) by incrustations of more or less hydrated silica. This is con-

404        Mr.   J. A. Phillips  on the Connexion   of certain
stantly accumulating on the sides, whilst a longitudinal central
crevice affords a passage for the escape of steam and boiling
water. This silica forms a series of semi-crystalline bands parallel
with the walls of the fissure, and often presents the comby ap
pearance peculiar to the beds of deposition so frequently observed
in mineral veins.
    At some distance to the west of the line of fissures now in a
state of activity, is another group of longitudinal siliceous de
posits, also presenting a central crevice, from which steam and
carbonic acid still escape, although no longer traversed by hot
water.      The silica from this locality contains oxides of iron and
 manganese, together with traces of copper, and minute crystals
of iron pyrites.      It has also been stated to be sometimes slightly
 auriferous ; but    I was unable to detect this metal in any of the
 specimens selected for examination.
     The granite in which the fissures occur is covered, both on the
 eastern and western sides of the valley, by a compact basalt.
     On analysis the deposited silica was found to contain from
 4'72 to 6 per cent, of water ; and on being boiled, in a finely di
 vided state, with a strong solution of caustic potassa, 6'68 per
 cent, of its weight was dissolved.
     Thin sections of this substance examined under the micro
 scope show the reniform structure of chalcedony, with patches of
 amorphous silica, stains of oxide of iron, and geodes of crystal
 line quartz.      Some few specimens also contain minute crystals
 of pyrites.     An attempt to give an idea of the appearance of a
 section of the deposit from Steamboat Springs, when magnified
  75 diameters, is made in Plate I. fig. 1.      The crystals of quartz
 lining cavities filled with amorphous silica become very distinct
 when examined by polarized light ; but the chalcedonious mark
 ings then almost entirely disappear.
     At the " Sulphur Bank " on the shores of Clear Lake, Cali
 fornia, is a solfatara some six or seven acres in extent, where
 a much decomposed volcanic rock is traversed by innumerable
 fissures, from which steam, together with carbonic and boracic
  acids, is continually issuing.        Sulphur is deposited on the
 sides   of  the  crevices ; and   gelatinous silica is found coating
  chalcedony and opalescent silica in various stages of formation,
 from the gelatinous state to that of the hardest opal.            This
  indurated silica is sometimes nearly colourless, but is more
  frequently permeated by cinnabar and iron pyrites, or blackened
  by a tarry hydrocarbon.        Cinnabar is also found in striae, and
  occasionally in veins, as well as in concretionary masses of consi
  derable size.
     Sections of chalcedony and semi-opal from this place, when
  examined under the microscope, are often found to enclose crys

              Phenomena with the Origin       of Mineral Veins.        405
 tals of pyrites, together with crystalline cinnabar, although the
  latter mineral has generally been deposited in an amorphous
 state*. A specimen of chalcedony taken from one of the fis
  sures in the sulphur bank, which on being first broken was ex
 teriorly so soft as readily to receive an impression of the nail, had
 on reaching this country become hardened, and had assumed the
 ordinary characteristics of that mineral.            Thin sections of this
 specimen show a structure resembling fine-grained fortification
 agate, and are traversed by numerous fissures filled by opaque
 oxide of iron.      Fig 2 is intended to show the appearance of a
 section of this substance magnified 30 diameters.               When ex
 amined between crossed prisms, brilliant colours are obtained,
 and the crystalline structure becomes exceedingly distinct.
      The vein-matter of lodes on the Pacific Coast of North Ame
 rica has generally so many characteristics in common with de
 posits produced by solfatara action, that various geologists, who
 have examined that region, have arrived at the conclusion that
 the two are the result of similar causes.
      Von Richthofen remarks that " the process which immediately
 follows the opening of fissures at or near active volcanoes, is the
 violent emission of steam. A crevice in this state is called a sol
fatara.      It has been proved by Bunsen for the volcanoes of Ice
 land, by Boussingault for those of the South American Andes,
 by St. Claire-Deville for those of the Canary Islands, and by
 myself for the tertiary volcanoes of Hungary and Transylvania,
 that every solfatara, in the course of time, passes through two
 stages, in the first of which the steam is accompanied by gaseous
 combinations of fluorine and chlorine, in the second by those of
 sulphur, while a third one is ordinarily marked by the emission
 of carbonic acid and combinations of hydrogen and carbon ; at
 which time the term solfatara is no longer applicable. We have
 in the elements evolved during the first two periods, all the con
ditions required for filling the Comstock fissure with such sub
 stances as those of which the vein is composed "f.
     W. P. Blake describes the lodes at Bodie Bluff, nine miles
west of the town of Aurora, as being of a character favourable
for the production of gold, and then goes on to say : — " They
are all alike in this respect, and doubtless had the same origin.
The quartz, instead of being a solid homogeneous mass, is formed
in thin layers or coats, one over the other, like sheets of paper
or pasteboard, with irregular thin seams or openings between.
This structure, with other peculiarities, indicates that the veins
were deposited gradually in the fissures by thermal springs,

similar perhaps to those now existing at various points along
the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada, as, for example, at Steam
boat Springs, Washoe"*.
    Daubree observes that veins can have been but very rarely
filled either by fusion or sublimation, but that, on the contrary,
the materials of which they are composed have beeii deposited
from solution in highly heated waters f-
    The late M. de Senarmont has shown that the principal mi
nerals found in veins may be produced in a crystalline form by
the aid of water heated to temperatures varying from 130° to
800° Centigrade.            Among the minerals which were thus ob
tained may be enumerated quartz, spathose iron, the carbonates
of manganese and zinc, sulphate of baryta, sulphide of antimony,
mispickel, red silver ore, &c.J
     In the present state of our knowledge we are unable to ex
plain all the various phenomena which have been observed in
connexion with the origin, composition, structure, and mineral
constitution of veins ; but a careful consideration of ascertained
facts would appear to lead to certain general conclusions, forming
a sort of skeleton map, of which the details remain to be filled in
by the aid of further research.
     First. Metalliferous lodes are more numerous and productive
jn the vicinity of igneous rocks than elsewhere.
     Secondly. There is abundant evidence of volcanic eruptions
 having taken place during all periods of geological time§.
     Thirdly. Solfatara action and thermal springs are often the
 latest active evidences of volcanic disturbance.
     Lastly. Crystalline quartz, iron pyrites, sulphide of mercury,
 and various other minerals are at the present time being depo
 sited by solfatara action, in veins possessing many of the charac
 teristics of ordinary lodes.

    § Kecent microscopical investigations have also shown that eruptive rocks
 of very different geological ages completely agree in composition, texture,
 and mode of occurrence.          S. Allport, in a paper " On the Relative Ages
 of Igneous   Rocks,"    published in the Geological Magazine (October 1871),
 •ays,
        " I have abundant evidence that melaphyres of undoubted                Car
 boniferous age, and basalts of Tertiary age, have not only the same mineral
 constitution, but also that both present the same structural variety."

             Phenomena with the Origin      of Mineral Veins.           407
    Is it then unreasonable to suppose that true mineral veins
have originally been fissures, often produced by volcanic disturb
ances, which have subsequently become filled during the ensuing
periods of solfataras and hot springs ?          This view of the subject
would appear to indicate the nature of the connexion existing
between such veins and eruptive rocks, and also to explain why
ihey should generally be of more frequent occurrence in the
older rocks than in formations of comparatively recent date.
    Carefully conducted analyses, executed on large quantities of
the waters issuing from active solfataras and thermal springs,
might probably afford valuable information on this subject ; but
it must not be forgotten, as observed by M. E. de Beaumont,
that we cannot expect the contents of hot springs and mineral
veins to be identical.      The more insoluble of the bodies in solu
tion, both simple and compound, will be deposited in proportion
as the temperature and pressure decrease; the more soluble
only being discharged in the waters issuing from the surface*.
    The occurrence in lodes of minerals exhibiting pseudomorphic
forms, apparently produced by their deposition in moulds left
by the removal of crystals of other substances, and the presence
in drusy cavities of stalactites of calcite, quartz, pyrites, &c.,
indicate that a partial decomposition and re-arrangement of some
of their constituents has been effected by the action of water at
comparatively low temperatures.          There can also be little doubt
that fissures and cavities have sometimes been filled by infil
tration from the enclosing rocks, as well as by the percolation
of meteoric waters from the surface.             The operation of these
agencies is perhaps, in most instances, extremely slow, although,
according to R. B. Smyth, even gold, under certain conditions,
may be deposited in appreciable quantities within comparatively
short periods.       This author states that, in the gold-fields of
Victoria, pieces of highly mineralized fossil wood, taken from the
deeper workings, as well as timber used for supporting galleries,
which had remained in the mine for some years, have exhibited,
under the microscope, particles of gold adhering to and intermixed
with crystals of iron pyrites, all through the central parts of the
woodf. This is confirmedby Mr.Ulrich,who says that in the gold-
drifts pyrites is often found incrusting or replacing roots and
driftwood, and that samples, assayed by Messrs. Daintree, Latta,
and Newbery, have yielded amounts of gold varying from a few
pennyweights to several ounces per ton. According to Mr. H. A.
Thompson, a specimen of pyrites from the centre of an old tree-
trunk gave by assay above 30 oz. of gold per ton J.

 408         Mr.   J. A. Phillips on     the Connexion    of certain
      On examining pyrites forming the substance of fossilized
  trees found in the deep diggings at French Corral, California,
  I was unable to detect any decided traces of gold; but assays
  of several specimens of the cementing pyrites of an auriferous
  deposit of tertiary age, and probably belonging to the later Plio
  cene period, invariably afforded a small amount of that metal.
 A microscopical examination of the gold in this pyrites showed
 that the fragments were frequently angular, and apparently un-
 waterworn.
     In order to ascertain whether waters traversing mineral veins
 contain an appreciable quantity of any of the constituents of the
 lodes through which they pass,               I  subjected three specimens,
 obtained from deep Cornish mines, to careful analysis.                   I  am
 indebted for the samples operated on to Mr. Francis Oats, of
 Botallack, a member of the Miners' Association of Cornwall, who
 in each case collected about six gallons of the water issuing
 from the bottom of a level, where the lode beneath remained
 intact, in clean and carefully stoppered glass bottles.
     Water from Balleswidden Mine. — This was collected from the
 bottom of a sink below the 50-fathom level on the " Pye Lode,"
 which is one of a series of veins having a south-easterly direction
 occurring in granite, and which are chiefly composed of quartz,
 mica, schorl, and oxide of tin.           The nearest known junction of
 granite    with  clay-slate is at  a  distance     of about one and a. half
 mile from the point from which the water was collected.

    It will  be observed that the amount         of soluble matter in the
first two specimens is small, and that the constituents do not
 differ materially from those which might be expected to occur
 in ordinary well-water from the same district. The third sample
 evidently consists of a mixture of sea-water with water derived
 from other sources.
    The solid contents, however, are considerably less thau in
 sea-water, and consequently, in order to institute an approxi
 mate comparison between them, we will suppose sea-water to
 have been diluted with distilled water until the total amount of
 fixed constituents has been reduced to that contained in the
 water from Botallack.
    For the purposes of this comparison I have selected an ana
 lysis of water from the Irish Sea by T. E. Thorpe and E. H.
 Morton, in which the fixed constituents amounted to 33-8385
 grammes per litre*.       The water from Botallach afforded 14-3047
 grammes of solid matter per litre ; and therefore, if we multiply
 the several estimations       of Messrs. Thorpe and Morton by

   In  the above Table a general accordance will be observed be
tween the figures obtained by analysis of the Botallack water
and those calculated on an assumed mixture of sea-water with
distilled water; it will be remarked, however, that lithium and
large quantities of lime and carbonic acid have been taken up.
A comparison of the figures in the two columns also renders
it evident that magnesia has been in some way abstracted from
solution, although the rocks in which the lode is enclosed have
been found to contain much larger quantities of magnesia than
of lime*.
    Copper, zinc, lead, tin, &c. were carefully sought for by the
 usual tests without success ; but the spectroscope was only em
 ployed for examining the alkaline chlorides with the flame of
 an ordinary Bunsen gas-burner.       It                 is,
                                            however, probable that

    A difficulty in all investigations of this class must necessarily
arise from the impossibility of determining the distance which
the waters, in each case, have passed through the several lodes.
It is consequently quite possible that samples of water may
have been examined which, after passing for long distances
through the enclosing rocks, may have ultimately entered the
veins a few feet only from the point at which they were collected.
    Should, however, one specimen of water be found to contain
appreciable amounts of the constituents of the vein from which
it issued, whilst another is comparatively, or entirely, free from
them, it might be inferred, all other conditions being the same,
that the first had traversed a greater extent of vein-matter than
 the second.
    It is evident that much time must be expended and numerous
 analyses made before reliable conclusions can be arrived at; and
 should waters containing appreciable quantities of the consti
tuents of the veins from which they have issued be discovered,
 an important question will still remain unanswered, — Is the
 water ascending through a metalliferous vein ever the medium
 from which fresh deposits of mineral matter are being produced
 at the present time ? or does            it,
                                    on the contrary, take up and carry
 away some of the constituents of the lode, giving rise to new
 combinations and       re-arrangement of its elements
                           a                                That both?
 these actions may sometimes be going on simultaneously does
 not appear improbable.

        a by

that of    Daniell's cell, the ratio of the power produced being as

 constituent elements of the body, it occurred to me that sulphur
 and phosphorus might be those to which             I
                                                 should look. Acting-,
 then, from the fact that in the brain there was a very considerable
 proportion of phosphorus, that in the liver there was present a
 large proportion of sulphur, while between the two there was in
constant circulation an alkaline fluid, the blood acting on these
facts, and having in my mind the idea that nerve-power and an
 electrical current, if not identical, were closely related to each
other, I   constructed the cell already mentioned, with the above
result.    Having, then, by this experiment determined that an
electric current was produced in the cell containing the sulphur
and phosphorus in alkaline solution, I turned my attention to
the actual conditions (the conditions found to exist in the living
 animal), and by the following experiment proved the existence
between the brain and liver of an electric current.
    In the first place, the hind leg of a frog was prepared as a gal-
vanoscope, according to the directions first given by Galvani, and
which were followed out so carefully and successfully by Aldini
and Matteucci; then to a rabbit 21 oz. in weight chloroform was
administered till complete anaesthesia was produced.          An inci
sion was then made through the abdominal walls in the right
hypochondriac region, and through this aperture a properly in
 sulated copper wire was passed into the substance of the liver;
the eyeball was then pierced, and a similar piece of copper wire
 brought into contact with the brain by forcing it through the
optic foramen.      The free extremities of the copper wires were
then brought into contact with the exposed sciatic nerve of the
frog's limb, when powerful convulsions were induced in the
muscles receiving their nervous supply therefrom.
    Having, then, by this experiment proved that between the
brain and the liver there exists an electric current, it         is,
                                                                 think,
                                                                  I

of this current      due to the action of the alkaline medium on
                      is
the sulphur and phosphorus contained respectively in the liver
and brain, which current we have already found to be produced
in the sulphur-and-phosphorus cell. That in the animal economy
other sources of electricity do exist     should be the last to deny
                                           I                              ;

phate of soda, potash, lime, and ammonia, amounting on an
average to rather more than 72 grains per diem, and of sulphuric
acid, as sulphate of soda and potash, amounting to nearly 100
grains, the oxidation-products     of sulphur and phosphorus being
in the main derived from the two organs in which they in the
greatest proportion        abound.

     Taking, then, for granted that we have here arrived, in part
at   least, at a solution of the source of nervo-motor power, I look
upon the sympathetic nerve, its branches and ganglia, not as a
separate or isolated system, but merely as a constituent part of
the general nervous system — a part, however, to which is assigned
the function of guiding and regulating the movements of invo
luntary muscular fibre, receiving from the common source its
nervo-motor power, but moulding it to its own purposes and re
quirements ; while        I
                         think it not at all impossible that in the
great  serous   cavities of the body (the peritoneum, pleura, peri
cardium, and     in  those of the enccphalon) we may find an ar
rangement to exist in many respects analogous to Leyden jars.
   These ideas may appear to many crude and imperfect ; but the
subject is still being investigated, and in a future Number ad
ditional facts shall be communicated.

        LIII.    On Canon Moseley's views upon Glacier-motion.
       By WILLIAM MATHEWS, President of the Alpine Club*.
           argument by which Canon Moseley attempts to prove
THEthat       the descent of glaciers by their weight alone is a
mechanical impossibility, as contained in his communication to
the Royal Society, read January 7, 1869, may be stated in the
following propositions : —
   1 . In every transverse section of a glacier every particle of ice
is, at the same moment of time, moving over and alongside its
neighbours.
   2. The absolute motion of any point       the surface of glacier
                                                in                 a
is  proportional to its distance from the nearest side, and to its
height from the bottom of the channel.
   3. This differential motion can only take place            by
                                                          the process
which,   in  mechanics,   known
                              is  by the name   of shear.
   4. The resistance which ice offers to shearing, or its shearing-
force, as ascertained          by
                           experiment in the shearing-apparatus
devised     byCanon Moseley,      not less than 75 Ibs. per square
                                    is
inch.
  5. But in order that the Mer de Glace may descend           its      by
own weight, at the rate at which Professor Tyndall observed                 it
descending at the Tacul, its shearing-force per square inch can
not be more than T3193 Ib.
I    propose in the present communication to examine these pro
positions.

416         Mr. W. Mathews      on   Canon Moseley'a views
   The first has been challenged more than once in the course
of the controversy, without eliciting any rejoinder from Canon
Moseley, no doubt from the absence of any materials available
for the support of the hypothesis.        The fact   is, that while we
have numerous observations of the absolute motion of various
points of the surfaces of glaciers, observers do not appear to have
been sufficiently alive to the importance of attending to the dif
ferential motion, of determining the law of its variation from
molecule to molecule, and of ascertaining whether          it   conti
                                                                is

   Observations of this kind are         by
                                        no means easy to make, and
require to be conducted with great care and delicacy, errors which
might safely be disregarded in      determination of average daily
                                     a
velocity becoming    serious when  relative  and not absolute motion
is the object of investigation.   These   errors  arise from the diffi
culty of boring with the augur vertical holes in the ice, of driving
the stakes vertically into the holes that have been bored, of re
newing the holes in the same vertical when the glacier has melted
away from the stakes, and from the constant tendency of the
stakes to heel over to the southward in consequence of their
heated faces enlarging the holes in the direction of the sun.
   During short tour in the Alps in the autumn of 1870,
            a                                                            I
attempted, in concert with my friend Mr. A. Adams Reilly, to
 make some observations upon differential motion, and selected
 the side of the Great Aletsch Glacier as the field of our ope
 rations.
    By means of well-defined station on the right bank of the
                    a
 glacier, and a  well-defined object on the left bank, we ranged out
a  line between 60 and 70 yards long. We drove our first stake
 into the ice 20 feet from the station, as near to the edge of the
 glacier as we could conveniently get it.     I shall denote this stake
 by  0. We had intended to stake out the line every ten yards            ;
 but, from certain local difficulties, we were obliged to drive in
stake 1   at
           a   distance of nine yards from 0.      Stake   2was eleven
yards from     1;  and the remaining four stakes were placed at
successive distances of teu yards each.       The line between      and
                                                                     0
1  was staked out into nine subdivisions of three feet each, and
the space between       5and6  into five subdivisions of six feet.
    Our work was completed     in the afternoon of Monday, the 22nd
of August and the line was reexamined on Wednesday, the 24th,
          ;
after an interval of forty-eight hours.
    In the first place, the spaces between the stakes were carefully

   We were surprised to find that during the two days' interval
the space between 0 and 1 had been shortened by two inches.
It is not probable that this was due to an error of observation,
as the difference was found to be distributed over most of the
subdivisions.   The elongation of the space between 3 and 4 was
due to the widening of a crevasse which crossed the line obliquely
in that part.

   These figures show an increase of differential motion in pro
ceeding from the edge of the glacier to a point about thirty yards
distant, and a subsequent decrease in proceeding towards the
centre ; with a relative regression of the ice in the neighbour
hood of stake 4, as indicated by the negative sign.                 The
greatest  differential   motion   is  between   stakes  3  and   4.   It
amounts to no more than '875 inch in twenty-four hours over a
distance of 360 inches, or about 4        of an inch in twenty-four

418            Mr. W. Mathews         on Canon Moseley's views
 being obliged to return home, Mr. Reilly devoted three weeks
to this purpose, and has generously placed his notes at my
 disposal.
    The spot selected for his first operations was a part of the
 Glacier of Bionassay, where the stream is very slightly inclined,
 and the central portion nearly level from side to side and free
 from crevasses.       The width of the glacier at this part was 320
 yards, for 200 yards of which, measuring from the left bank, the
 surface was composed of "avalanche-ice without veined struc
 ture," the remaining 120 yards being ordinary glacier-ice.
    Mr. Reilly bored the first hole about 70 yards from the right
bank of the glacier, and ranged, with a theodolite, a line 170
yards in length, terminating about 80 yards from the left bank.
 This line was divided into seventeen equal spaces by holes bored
 10 yards apart ; the line was ranged and staked on the 7th of
 September.       The holes were deepened from time to time as
the glacier-surface melted, and the final measurements made on
the 27th, after an interval of twenty days.
    The results are exhibited in the following Table — the motion
on each side of No. 10, where the velocity was greatest, being
exhibited in parallel columns, the negative                  signs indicating

    Here we have a superficial area of ice 170 yards in width
moving through a space of nearly 12 feet in twenty days, with
an advance of the centre during that interval only 10 inches in
excess of the sides, the differential motion at the side being 7
inches, and at the centre 1 inch in a width of 360 inches ; so
that two points an inch apart would in twenty-four hours move
past each other to the extent of a little less than the fo^o of an
inch at the sides, and the 7^0-5 of an inch at the centre of the
area under consideration.

                         upon Glacier-motion.                     419
     Mr. Reilly has not supplied me with any note of the motion
of the edge of the glacier during the interval ; but as the edge
of the Great Aletsch was found to move at the rate of only an
inch and a quarter in twenty-four hours, it probably did not ex
ceed 2 feet. We shall therefore be justified in saying that while,
in the right-hand moiety of the glacier, a differential motion of
10 inches is distributed over a width of 100 yards from the line
of maximum velocity, a differential motion of at least 100 inches
must be distributed over the remaining 70 yards up to the edge
of the glacier.
     Two of the 30-feet spaces were staked out into subdivisions of
2 feet each.    Each of the intermediate stakes exhibited a differen
tial motion, with occasional negative signs — the greatest relative
 displacement observed being 2'25 inches in the twenty days, equi
valent to 'the 3^-5 of an inch in twenty-four hours for points 1 inch
 apart.
     During the intervals of his labours on the Glacier of Bionassay
 Mr. Reilly ranged a line across the Mer de Glace, on the Cha-
 monix side of the Montanvert.          His measurements on this
 line during a period of nineteen days indicate a motion very
 similar in its character to that of the Glacier of Bionassay.
 The length of this line from the left-hand edge of the glacier
 to the point of maximum velocity was about 1000 feet.             The
 central 500 feet had an absolute motion of 18 feet 7'75 inches
 at its left-hand extremity, and of 21 feet 2 inches at its right,
 equivalent to a mean daily motion of about 12 inches.              Its
 total differential motion was 28'25 inches, equivalent           to a
 mean daily differential motion of about 1'5 inch, or — '— of an
 inch for points 1 inch apart.     The nearest station to the edge of
 the glacier was about 165 feet distant from it ; and at this sta
  tion the absolute motion in nineteen days was found to be 10 feet
  ll-25 inches. This would indicate a marginal motion of about
 4 feet, and would leave us 14 feet 6 inches of differential motion
 to distribute over the lateral 500 feet of the line, or six times as
  much as that of the central moiety.
     The law of variation of the differential motion indicated by
  the observations above described is not new.      It appears clearly
  from the measurements made by Professor Tyndall on the Mer
  de Glace, described in a communication to the Royal Society,
  read May 20, 1858, and published in vol. cxlix. of the Philoso
  phical Transactions. But nowhere is it brought out with more
  striking prominence than in the observations made by Agassiz
  upon the Unter-Aar Glacier, from/1842to 1845, as described in
  Chapter XII. of the Nouvelles Etudes, and in plate 4 of the
  accompanying atlas, where curves showing the motion, for three
  consecutive years, of a series of points originally in a straight

420              Mr. W. Mathews      on Glacier-motion.
line, are plotted to scale. The diagram exhibits the very small
motion of points close to the side, whence the curves extend
with their concavity downwards as far as the point of maximum
differential velocity, where they become convex, and gradually
increase in curvature up to about one fourth of the width of the
glacier, whence they sweep across to the corresponding point on
the opposite side in a curve so flattened as to be scarcely distin
guishable from a straight line.
    The above considerations lead to the following conclusions
upon the five fundamental propositions of Canon Moseley.
     1. It is probable that every molecule of a glacier moves with
 a very slow differential motion, which, whenever the ice is con
tinuous, is continuous from molecule to molecule, and from
 moment to moment of time.
    2. The hypothesis that the differential motion is uniform
 from centre to side is wholly contrary to fact.            The semi-
 surface of every glacier may be roughly divided into two equal
 longitudinal strips, through the lateral of which from 80 to 90 per
 cent, of the differential motion is distributed, while the central
 strip moves downwards almost like a rigid body, with a large
 reserve of gravitating force capable of affecting the sides.
     Canon Moseley is of opinion that this divergence between
 theory and fact greatly strengthens his position ; but he has not
 made good this part of his case.
     3. 4. The Canon has failed, as it seems to me, to establish any
 analogy between the disruption of adjacent surfaces of a solid
 body in a shearing-machine and the slow relative displacements
 of the molecules of a glacier. He has yet to prove that, because
 he was obliged to employ a force of 75 Ibs. per square inch to
 shear asunder adjacent surfaces of a solid cylinder of ice through
 a space of 1 inch in half an hour, it would require as great a
 force to produce the relative displacements which occur in au
 actual glacier, — the latter having been shown, from the observa
 tions above described, to range for molecules the tenth of an
 inch apart, and an interval of twenty-four hours, from the y-f-gq
 to the „ — L— - of an inch*.
     5. On the other hand, the slow continuous displacements of
 the molecules of a glacier are undistinguishable in kind from the
 displacements of the molecules of an ice-plank, supported at its
 extremities and allowed to subside under the influence of its
 weight, displacements which require for their production, as           I
 have shown in the Philosophical Magazine for November 1871,
 a force considerably less than 1£ Ib. per square inch — less, there
fore, than the very force which the Canon considers sufficient to
 shear the Mer de Glace if it descends by its own gravitation.
    * This objection has been forcibly urged by Mr. Ball iu the Philoso
phical Magazine for  July 1870,

gation.       On page 285      f  Laplace investigates the continued
 fraction (56).
    To give in a short space any account of the applications of the
 function to the Theory of Probabilities would be impossible;
 but the results are so well known that a detailed description of
 them would be superfluous.          In the Theory of Errors of Obser
 vations the function is of paramount importance ; and this fact
 is the justification of the name and symbol by which it has been
 here denoted.       Laplace's great work on the subject, the Thforie
analytique des Probabilltes, was published in 1812 ; but most of
 the results had previously appeared in various memoirs.                The
 law of facility to which Laplace's, Poisson's, Gauss's, in fact all
 investigations lead, is represented by e~cl3, so that the probability
 of a single error of observation lying between x and x + dx is
  ( - }  e~ cx*dx, and the chance of an error lying between p and q is
                   Vf            = 7r-i(Erf ;> Vc— Erf q ^c) .
     It is unnecessary to notice the papers in which the theory of
 errors and the method of least squares are discussed.              De Mor
 gan's treatise in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana contains an

Table does not go beyond #=3, and that in                 few eases the a
function might be wanted for larger arguments; he therefore

p. 269 of the Jahrbuch Encke says that Table I. was deduced
from Bessel's Table of             in the Fundamenta.      Bessel, as
                          §e-**dx
we have seen, tabulated log,0(e*a Erfff); and if Encke's Table
was derived from Bessel's, it must have been by interpolation
from his Table II. It is more probable, however, that it was
derived from Kramp's Table               I.,
                                     from which     can be deduced
                                                               it
at once.    Table II., Encke states,   was formed                   by
                                                       interpolation,•*
and     probably founded on Table

   The Table accompanying the present paper gives Erf x from
a:=3'00 to #=3'50 to eleven places, from #=3-50 to a?=4'00
to thirteen places, from a?=4'00 to x = 4' 50 to fourteen places,
subject to certain qualifications with regard to the accuracy of
the last figure, which will be stated further on.         The values
were calculated           by
                      means of the same difference-formula, viz.
(60), that Kramp used.      Separate Tables of log,0 e~x*(— —x*p.,

were    formed.   The second of these Tables was differenced
throughout,   and the gradual change of the differences from
•0000430 to -0000427 afforded        very good test of its accuracy.
                                          a
A Table of Erf + — Erf x was then deduced from the two
                      (x       A)
subsidiary Tables, and was differenced throughout as far as A3                   ;
and the regularity of these last differences proved the correctness
of the Table.   Erf was calculated, as previously mentioned,
                           3
from the continued fraction and the differences subtracted from
it,tillErf3-5 was obtained ='0000006585487... The correct
value obtained from the continued fraction was
                     Erf 3-5 = -000 000 658         553   76..      .,
so  that eleven figures are the same      both in    probable, there
                                                          ;   it   is
fore, that  the last figure in the values  from #=3-00 to #=3'50
is nowhere in error             by
                            so much as        unit. As an additional
                                                    a
verification, Erf 3-2 was calculated from the continued fraction
and found =-000005 340 191 . .        which agrees with the num
                                           .   ,

 fraction and foun d = -000 000      01 3 663 1 89 . . . ; the differences
  corresponding to argument between 4-0 and 3'5 were then added,
  and Erf 3-5 was obtained ='00000065855374..., agreeing
 with the value found by direct calculation for Erf 3'5 as far as the
 thirteenth figure. The values from #=3'5 to #=4'0 were there
 fore entered in the Table to thirteen decimal places ; and it is not
 probable that any is in error by more than a unit in the last place
 in any of the values. Starting again from 4'0, the differences cor
 responding to arguments between 4-0 and 4'5 were subtracted,
 and Erf 4-5 was thus obtained = -000 000 000 174 250 ... By
 direct calculation from the continued fraction Erf 4'5 was found
 = •0000000001742376...              As these values only differ by
unity in the fourteenth place, the portion of the Table from
#=4'0 to ar=4'5 was given to fourteen places, it being un
derstood that the last figure may be in error to the extent of one
or even two units.
    From the above description it will be seen that the mode of
 verification adopted formed a very perfect test of the accuracy of
the Table.     I                           I
                  rather regret now that did not tabulate e*Q Erf x
in preference to Erf a?. When a function whose value is numeri
cally small enters into analysis, the term involving it can usually
 be neglected, unless it contains also a very large factor, which is
 usually an exponential.      It is also a matter of observation that
 when a function is expansible in a descending series multiplied
by an exponential, this factor points out the factor which it will
be convenient to multiply the function bypreviously to tabulation;
thus from (55) we see that e^Erfjr is a function which only
becomes infinitely small for very large values of x.            Similarly
when x is large, it is preferable to tabulate "e~*Ei x and e* Ei(— x)
in place of Ei x and Ei (— #). This deficiency in the case of the
error-function I hope to supply by forming a Table of e*2 Erf #
for arguments above 3.
    Since Erfc ar = £ >Jir— Erf a?, the value of ^VT to fourteen
 places of decimals is printed on the same page as the Tables, to
 facilitate the deduction of Erfc a; from Erf a?.

              LVI.      On a Problem in the Calculus of Variations.
                          By ISAAC TODHUNTER, F.R.S.
    To theEditors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
       the Philosophical Magazine for July Professor Challis has
IN    discussed three problems in the Calculus of Variations.
He states, in connexion with the first problem, that a certain
conclusion obtained by Lcgendre and Stcgmann, and tacitly .ac
cepted by myself, is erroneous.
   There         is,
              however, no error.       Professor Challis does not un
derstand the problem in the same sense as Lcgendre and Steg-
mann.       have enunciated the problem thus: — required to con
            I
nect two fixed points               by
                              curve of given length so that the area
                                         a
bounded          by
              the curve, the ordinates of the fixed points, and the
axis of abscissa; shall be    maximum.   a                        It
                                                     intended that the    is
curve should    be confined between  the indefinite straight lines which
coincide in position with the extreme ordinates.           The enuncia
tion involves this condition; for otherwise nothing would be
gained         by
             introducing the ordinates of the fixed points.         And
the investigation given    would  show,     there  were
                                                      if any doubt, that
this    the precise mean ing intended.
      is is
   It in fact this condition which constitutes the chief interest
of the problem     and there can be no doubt that the solution of
                         ;
Legendre   and   Stegmann       correct.  isStcgmanu's investigation

        On the Connexion between two Physical Magnitudes,                 441
seems  to have been independent of Legendrc's ; and             I
                                                               had my
self arrived   at the same result before        Ihad seen what these
mathematicians had written on the subject.           See pages ix and
             '
427 of my History of the Calculus of Variations.'
   The problem as discussed by Professor Challis is free from
this condition ; it may be enunciated thus : — required to connect
the ends of a fixed straight line by a curve of given length so
that the area bounded by the curve and the straight line may be
a maximum.        The result is well known, namely that the curve
must be an arc of a circle.       The given length must, of course,
be greater than the length of the fixed straight line ; Professor
Challis by a misprint has less instead of greater.        The problem
as thus enunciated is one of the oldest and most familiar in the
subject ; and   I   believe there has never been any doubt or diffi
culty  as to  the  result, which may be obtained by various unex
ceptionable methods ;      I  have indicated one of these methods at
                  '
page 69 of my History.'
   I do not accept the results at which Professor Challis arrives
with respect to the other two problems he discusses ; but I have
not leisure to enter into details.       I have,    I
                                                   believe, fully solved
these problems in an Essay which will be published in the course
of the present mouth.

LVII.   On a Correction sometimes required in Curves professing to
   represent the Connexion between two Physical Magnitudes.    By
   the Hon. J. W. STKUTT, M.A.
            nature of the correction which is the subject of the
THEpresent          paper, and of not infrequent application in ex
perimental inquiry, will be best understood from an example, as
it is a little difficult to state with full generality.    Suppose that
our object is to determine the distribution of heat in the spec
trum of the sun or any other source of light.            A line thermo
pile would be placed in the path of the light, and the deflection
of the-galvasometer noted -for a series of positions.           But the
observations obtained in this way arc not sharp — that              is,
                                                                    they
do not correspond to definite values of the wave-length or refrac
tive index.      In the first place, the spectrum cannot be absolutely
pure; at each point there      is  a certain admixture of neighbouring
rays.    Further,    evenif   the spectrum   were pure,    would still be
                                                           it
impossible     to  operate   with   a mathematical  line  of it; so that
the result, instead of belonging to      a  simple definite value of the
                        Communicated    by the Author.
                    *

 442    The Hon.    J. W.   Strutt  on Curves professing to represent
 independent variable, is really a kind of average corresponding
 to values grouped together in a small cluster.
    For the sake of simplicity, let us suppose that the spectrum
 is originally pure, and that the true curve giving the relations
 between the two quantities is P Q R. Also let M N be the range
 over which the independent variable changes in each observation
 — in our case the width of the thermopile.         Then the observed
 curve is to be found from the true by taking m, the middle point
 of M N, and erecting an ordinate p m, such that
                  p m . M N = area of curve P Q N M.
The locus of p will give the curve expressing the result of the
observations.     It remains to find a convenient method of passing
from the one curve to the other.
   In  the figure  P R Q represents the true     curve, M N the range
as before;   M  wi=mN=A;          p is the point on the observed curve
found in the manner described; Qm=z0, Rm=y0,
Now

for practical purposes the following interpretation is important :

so that
                             y>=y0-$KS.
     In passing from the observed to the true curve, the curvature
is everywhere to be increased instead of diminished, and
     It may be remarked that while it is always possible to pass
accurately from the true curve to that derived from it with any
 prescribed range, the inverse problem is not determinate unless
 it be understood that the range is small, so that its fourth
 power may be neglected.          The practical utility of the solution
 obtained is scarcely affected by this consideration; indeed it is
 only when the curvature of the curve is considerable that the
 correction itself is of much importance.
     It often happens that the connexion between the two curves
 is not so simple, at least at first sight.     Suppose, for example,
 that in the case taken as an illustration the spectrum is impure
 from the sensible width (2«) of the image of the slit.         The ob
 served curve is then connected with      true  by a double integration,

      The rules remain just    as before, except that instead of A we

414             Mr.  J. E. H. Gordon    on   Measuring the
now have     Vtf + K*.     Similarly, when the want of sharpness is
due to more than two causes, we must replace h by {2AS}*.
"When, as often happens, the product of the quantities JIK . . . is
to be considered as given, the experiments are best arranged so
as to make the independent quantities equal ; for then the agree
ment between the two curves is the closest.
   The practical rule to which we are led by the considerations
explained in this paper is therefore as follows : —
    Construct the curve representing the immediate results of the ob
servations in the ordinary way.       Let R m be any ordinate.     Draw
                                           h
parallels   PM, QN       at distances equal to h, or {2ha} , and join
 P Q cutting R m in S. The point p on the true curve cotrcsponJ-
 ing to the abscissa 0 in is to be found by taking p R equal to one
 third of R S, and so that p and S lie on opposite sides of R.

    Electricity in Liquids," in    the Philosophical. Magazine for No

        the abstract    of Dr. Macaluso's paper given in the Phi
 IN     losophical Magazine for November 187J, p. 389, it is
               " when an electric current travels through a liquid
 stated that
 whose cross section is much greater than the surface of the
 electrodes, it tends to diffuse itself laterally."    About two years
 ago   I  made some experiments in the physical laboratory of
 King's College, on the lateral diffusion of the current in con
 ductors.    Instead of liquids, however,     I used sheets of tinfoil of
 various shapes.
    I was not only able to experimentally detect the lateral diffusion,
 but also to arrange a method by which its direction and amount
 may be measured.        The outline of the method was suggested to
 me by a friend.      I do not know whether it is new ; but as    I have

   The law of the diffusion of the current in     solid conductor                          is
of course perfectly well known.     In this paper merely propose      I
to describe   method of experimentally verifying this known law,
                a
and to suggest     modification of
                      a                                   by
                                          means of which the (ap
                                                     it
parently) unknown law for the diffusion of the current in liquid                      a
may probably be determined.
   The object of the method was, on       surface of tinfoil through
                                                           a
which     current was flowing, to determine
           a                                     number of groups a
of points of equal tension, and to draw equipoteutial lines through
them.    From these lines the positions of the currents can be
easily deduced.
    My plan was as follows — sheet of tinfoil of any desired
                                       :     A
shape was pasted on to          hard mahogany board.
                                   a                         At the two
points chosen for the electrodes holes were drilled, through
which screws were passed so that their heads (about               millinis.       7
in diameter) rested on the tinfoil their stems passed through
                                                     ;
the board into binding- screws on the underside.              little mer      A
cury was placed under the heads to make better contact. Wires
from   a battery passed through        contact-breaker to these screws.
                                                 a
Two cells of Grove's battery were at first used but the power           ;
was afterwards reduced to one, owing to the great heating-effect
of two cells.
    The contact-breaker was arranged so that two circuits could be                              .
broken or made simultaneously, namely the battery and galvano
meter circuits.         current
                          A         produced simply
                                           is               difference of    by
tension.     Therefore,     two poles of sufficiently sensitive galva
                              if                          a
nometer were placed in such          position on the tinfoil that there
                                            a
was no deflection when the current passed, these two points were
in the same equipotential line.
     The beautiful reflecting galvanometer belonging to King's
College was used, and was found to be so delicate that, after                               a
little practice,    deviation of less than
                     a                         millimetre from the right

position on the tinfoil could be easily detected on the galva
nometer.
    The same plan can be used for determining the lines in
liquid conductors         by
                          insulating the wires up to their points, and
having each galvanometer-terminal         fixed on little stage to slide
                                                                  a
on the top of the trough, which must be divided so that from the
position of the stage the horizontal coordinates of the point of
the wire can be determined, while the wire slides through the
stage and       divided to give the vertical element.

given, the second half would lie lower down on the page.    The
slight irregularities in the curves are no doubt produced by va

   The method of making contact with the tinfoil and marking
the centre of the place of contact was follows : — The wires from
the terminals of the galvanometer were attached to two thin brass
rods with blunt conical points 3 millims. in diameter.         « was

to trace an cquipotential line, so that the whole of the blunt

                       By FREDERICK GUTHRIE*.
A       STRIP of tinfoil 4     feet long and 8 inches wide is placed
          upon a strip of vulcanized caoutchouc 4 feet long and
1 foot wide, in such a way that along both sides there is a mar
gin of two inches of caoutchouc, at one end (say the right) a
margin of four inches of caoutchouc, and at the left a margin of
four inches of tinfoil.       A second piece of caoutchouc exactly
similar to the first is placed exactly over the first upon the foil.
A second piece of tinfoil of the same width as the first, but four
 inches shorter, is placed on the second caoutchouc above the
first foil, with its right-hand end above the right end of the first
 foil. Its left end, of course, falls four inches short.         A brass
wire carrying a knob is laid across the end of the upper foil.
 The whole is rolled up from the right end and bound. What
 was the lower of the two foils projects between the two layers of
 caoutchouc, and may be prolonged around the circumference of
 the roll.     It forms the outer coating or earth-surface. What
 was the upper coating of foil now forms what corresponds to the
 inner coating of the ordinary jar, and is entirely covered, except
 ing where it is prolonged as the wire and knob at the centre of
 the roll.    If  the sheet caoutchouc be an eighth of an inch in
 thickness, a jar of very great electrical capacity is obtained in a
 very compact form, and one which is free from the risk of frac
 ture, and less impaired than the ordinary jar by atmospheric
 moisture.
     A very serviceable modification of this form of jar has been
 constructed for me by Mr.W. Peters f. The insulating material is
 sheet ebonite.       The construction is similar to the above. The
 ends    of the   spiral roll are capped with dry mahogany disks.
 The earth-foil is connected with a brass girdle around the centre
  of the cylinder, and does not itself appear on the outside.        The
  electric capacity is between four and five times as great as that
  of a glass jar of the same volume.      It has been in use for several
  months, and appears almost incapable of receiving injury.

      LX.   On the Equilibriumof Vapour at a Curved Surface of
            Liquid.   By Sir WILLIAM THOMSON, F.R.S.*

IN
        a closed vessel
        at one temperature, the liquid rests, with its free surface
  raised or depressed in capillary tubes and in the neighbour
  hood of the solid boundary, in permanent equilibrium according
  to the same law of relation between curvature and pressure as
  in vessels open to the air.    The permanence of this equilibrium
  implies physical equilibrium between the liquid and the vapour
  in contact with it at all parts of its surface.    But the pressure
  of the vapour at different levels differs according to hydrostatic
  law.    Hence the pressure of saturated vapour in contact with a
 liquid differs according to the curvature of the bounding surface,
 being less when the liquid is concave and greater when it is con
 vex.    And detached portions of the liquid in separate vessels all
  enclosed in one containing vessel cannot remain permanently
 with their free surfaces in any other relative positions than those
  they would occupy, if there were hydrostatic communication of
  pressure between the portions of liquid in the several vessels.
  There will be evaporation from those surfaces which are too high,
  aud condensation into the liquid at those surfaces which are too
 low — a process which will go on until hydrostatic equilibrium,
 as if with free communication of pressure from vessel to vessel,
  is attained.   Thus, for example, if there are two large open
 vessels of water, one considerably above the other in level, and
 if the temperature of the surrounding matter is kept rigorously
 constant, the liquid in the higher vessel will gradually evaporate
 until it is all gone and condensed into the lower vessel. Or            if,

of another liquid at a lower level. With air at any thing ap
proaching to ordinary atmospheric density to resist the pro
cess, it is probable it would be too slow to show any results
unless in very long-continued experiments.       But if the air be
removed as perfectly as can be done by well-known practical
methods, it is probable that the process will be very rapid ; it
would indeed be instantaneous, were it not for the cold of eva
poration in one vessel and the heat of condensation in the other.
Practically, then, the rapidity of the process towards hydrostatic
equilibrium through vapour between detached liquids depends
on the rate of the conduction of heat between the several sur
faces through intervening solids and liquids.     Without having
made either the experiment or any cal
culations on the rate of conduction of
heat in the circumstances,            I
                                 feel con
vinced that in a very short time water
would visibly rise in the capillary tube
indicated in the diagram, and that,
provided    care is taken to maintain
equality of temperature all over the
surface of the hermetically sealed ves
sel, the liquid in the capillary tube
would soon take very nearly the same
level as it would have were its lower
end open — sinking to this level if the
capillary tube were in the beginning
filled too full, or rising to it if (as in
dicated in the diagram) there were not
enough of liquid in it at first to fulfil
the condition of equilibrium.
    The following formula? show pre
cisely the relations between curvatures,
differences of level, and differences of
pressure with which we are concerned.
    Let p be the density of the liquid and a that of the vapour,
and let T be the cohesive tension of the free surface per unit of
breadth, in terms of weight of unit mass as unit of force.         Let
h denote the height of any point P of the free surface above
a certain plane of reference, which                   I

450             Sir W. Thomson      on the     Equilibrium of Vapour
Xow, in the space occupied by vapour, the pressure is less at the
higher than at the lower of two points whose difference of levels
is h, by a difference equal to ah. And there is permanent equi
librium between vapour and liquid at all points of the free sur
face.   Hence the pressure of vapour in equilibrium is less at a
concave than at a plane surface of liquid, and less at a plane
 surface than at a convex surface, by differences amounting to
          per unit difference of curvature.           That is to   say,   if v denote
f—r*
the pressure of vapour in equilibrium at a plane surface of liquid,
and p the pressure of vapour of the same liquid at the same tem
perature presenting a curved surface to the vapour, we have
- and      -j   being the curvatures          in the principal sections of the
surface bounding liquid and vapour, reckoned positive when con
cave towards the vapour.
   In strictness, the value of a- to be used in these equations, (1)
and (2), ought to be the mean density of a vertical column of
vapour extending through the height h from the plane of refer
ence.    But in all cases to which we can practically apply the
formulae, according to present knowledge of the properties of
matter, the difference of densities in this column is very small,
and may be neglected.       Hence, if II denote the height of an
imaginary homogeneous fluid above the plane of reference, which,
if of the same density as the vapour at that plane, would pro
duce by its weight the actual pressure w, we have
                                     _   -a
 Hence, by (1) and (2),
      For vapour of water at ordinary atmospheric temperatures, H
 is about   1,300,000 centimetres.     Hence, in a capillary tube
 which   would  keep water  up  to a height of 13 metres above the
 plane level, the curved surface of the water is in equilibrium with
 the vapour in contact with             it,
                                 when the pressure of the vapour                    is
 less     by

Hence,     if A= 1300      centims.,  r='00012 centim., there can          be
no doubt that Laplace's theory is applicable without serious
modification, even to a case in which the curvature is so great
 (or radius of curvature so small) as this.           But in the present
state of our knowledge we are not entitled to push it much fur
ther.     The molecular forces assumed in                      theory to be

in ordinary solids and liquids, not merely the distances of sen
 sible intermolecular action, but the linear dimensions of the
molecules themselves, and the average distance from centre to
 nearest centre*, are but very moderately small in comparison
 with the wave-lengths of light.           Some approach to a definite
estimate of the dimensions of molecules is deducible from Clau-
 sius's theory of ten of the average spaces travelled without colli
 sion by molecules of gases, and Maxwell's theory and experi
 ments regarding the viscosity of gases.            Having perfect confi
 dence in the substantial reality of the views which these grand
 investigations have opened to us, I find it scarcely possible to

point of the surounding atmosphere.             But although the energy

great that it might almost claim recognition from chemists as
 due to a "chemical affinity," and resulting in a "chemical

  LXI.    On the Reflection and Refraction           of Light by thin Layers
                         of Metal.     By E. JOCHMANN*.
               optical properties of thin metallic lamellae have recently
  THEbeen subjected             by Quincke to a series of careful and ia
 many ways varied experimental investigations-^.                  The remark
 able and in part unexpected results of these investigations make
 sensible a deficiency in the theory of reflection, in that the theory
 of the interference-phenomena of thin transparent lamellae has
 not hitherto been extended to metallic media.                   Starting from
 the principles of Cauchy's theory of reflection,               I  arrived at a
 system    of   formula;     which  represent    the phenomena of reflection
 and   refraction      of  light by   thin  metallic  lamellae with the same
 degree of mathematical accuracy as the formulas of Cauchy for
 metallic reflection on the supposition of a considerable thickness
 of the metallic layer.           Cauchy's formulae for the intensity and
 phase   of   light polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence
 include, as is known, the simplifying presupposition that the
 coefficient of ellipticity e (originating from the influence* of the
 longitudinal waves) may be put equal to 0. We know that the
 influence of this coefficient with transparent media is always but
 very little, except in the vicinity of the angle of polarization.
 With metals there is no polarization-angle in the same sense as
 with transparent media; and indeed the comparison of Cauchy's
 formulae with experiment teaches that the influence of the coeffi
 cient of ellipticity may, without sensible error, be neglected, even
 with metallic media.            So much the more will this presupposition
 be justified when the theory is applied to thin metallic lamellae,
 in which manifold causes cooperate diminishing the accuracy
 attainable by the measurements.               Although the method which
 I  have used for the derivation of the following formulae permits
 the carrying out in full rigour the solution of the problem, yet
 it appeared useful, in the case of light polarized perpendicular to
 the plane of incidence, to introduce that simplifying presuppo
 sition, in order to give to the formulae a form applicable to the

neither in the refracted nor in the reflected light can there be
maxima or minima of intensity; for the maxima of a'* and A1*
would necessarily corespond to the minima of atlf and a,wa, and

But the second term in this        independent of the thickness

layer of variable thickness, would not exhibit, either in the re
flected or in the transmitted light, an interference-phenomenon
analogous to Newton's colours of transparent bodies.
    For the transmitted ray this assertion may be at once gene

pression for a;//2 divided                 by

pendent  of the   thickness, and the denominator takes the form

increases, and so can never become 0, and therefore that, in the

the intensity continuously diminishes as the thickness increases.
    For the reflected ray, on the contrary, the condition for the
maxima and minima assumes the form

    For greater values of A the influence of the term multiplied

tallic layer increasing in thickness from the centre to the circum
ference, the middle appears bright or dark.     For A = 0,
   This expression is positive or negative, according to whether
the third medium is optically denser or rarer than the first.
Thus, for example, with a metallic coating of this kind, of vari
able thickness, adhering to glass, the middle in reflected light
must appear dark or bright, according to whether the reflection
takes place in air or in glass.  If the third medium is identical
                                                                                                 "2* '5J

   The discussion of the expressions for a'2 and ft,,,9 leads to per
fectly analogous results.
   As regards the comparison of the given results with experi

gold, and platinum, have proved capable of being obtained in

       When, further, we set up the actual intensity-expression   for
    the ray which has passed through the system of silver and flint
    glass, in which the loss of intensity in the passage through the
    uncoated surface of the glass also comes into consideration, we

462        M. E. Jochmahn       on the Reflection and Refraction
find that the value of D8 with perpendicular incidence is to be
multiplied by a numerical factor which, as the thickness increases,
approaches the limiting value 1'747 for Fraunhofer's line D, and
2'2556 for the line H ; so that the greater transparency for rays
of higher refrangibility is thereby rendered more apparent.
   Quincke found (Opt. Unters. § 52) that silver of 0'09 millim.
thickness, gold of 0-16, and platinum of 0'40 still appeared
transparent.     The succession of degrees of transparency     with              is,
regard to the optical constants of these metals, that which, from
the theory, was to be expected      and the value O09 for silver
                                       ;
may    be regarded as   limiting
                         a       value satisfactorily in accordance
with the theory, since the extinction at this thickness has pro
ceeded to about 2Jjj of the original intensity.
    Although the phenomena hitherto discussed have revealed de
viations from the theory which could only be explained           the              by
assumption of certain molecular differences in the metallic sur
faces, occasioning a variation in the optical constants, yet the
general character of the phenomena was in accordance with the
theory.     On the contrary,      fundamental
                                   a             difference between
theory and experiment occurs in the Newton's colour-rings ob

for which therefore,     as was above shown,in the transmitted light
generally no maxima and minima can occur.            As regards the
maxima and minima of the reflected light, there are of course
an infinite number of them, which yet, as may easily be shown,
escape observation through their small intensity.       Considering
that, for O'l millim. thickness of silver, only variations of inten
sity of the order of about xfoj of the total can be expected, only
the number of maxima and minima which as far as this thickness
are, according to the theory, to be expected need be counted.

   As far as this thickness, therefore, the periodic terms of the
function have not yet run through one fifth part of their period,
and, independently of the bright or dark centre, in the favour
 able case perhaps only one maximum or one minimum will have
been observed.
     More remarkably,        the breadth of the bright and dark streaks

                 of Light by thin Layers of Metal.                        463
observed by Quicke was not essentially influenced cither by the
colour or the angle of incidence.          If, however, they are to be
regarded     as Newton's    interference-lines,   it will thence follow
that Cauchy's theory of reflection cannot, without essential mo
dification, be applied to such thin metallic lamellae ; considerably
different values must be assigned to the optical constants; particu
larly the constant e must have a considerably smaller value than
for opaque metals, in order to be in accord with experiment.        But
thence will necessarily    result  the further  consequence that, even
in opaque metals, the arrangement, of the aether in a superficial
layer of measurable thickness is essentially different from that in
the interior of the metal, so that the quantities /2 and e lose their
character as constants, and that, as Quincke has assumed, the
reflection takes place not in a geometrical bounding surface, but
 within an intermediate layer of finite thickness.
     The middle of the system of fringes observed by Quincke, cor
 responding to A=0, appeared dark in silver lamella; when the
 reflection took place in air, bright when in glass —which agrees
 with the above-developed result of the theory.           The action of
 gold and platinum was somewhat anomalous.
     I refrain for the present from a closer discussion of the expres
 sions for the phases, and merely refer to an easily controllable
 result of experiment which likewise stands in contradiction to
 the theory.     M. Quincke found (Gott. Nachr. Dec. 1870) that
 the difference between the directions of the rays transmitted
 through air and through metal amounted to nearly +TT for dif
  ferent thicknesses of metal < 0-04 millim.          For minute thick
  nesses of metal, the condition of a constant direction-difference
  between metal and air cannot generally be fulfilled by the theory.
  For greater thicknesses, the phase din approximates, as before
  mentioned, to the limiting form L—                     •\jr,
                                                and the quantity      in  L,
  creasing with the thickness, would be equal to the corresponding
  quantity for air,if   the direction-difference were to assume the
  constant value ->Jr. The condition thence following            is
                                                         m

                                                          c2
     This cannot be fulfilled for any angle of incidence.       Let            it
 hold good for perpendicular incidence, and approximately .for
 small angles of incidence,        will be reduced to
                                   it                       cos  6l=      e    l,
 whereas for silver   0,cos e=0'5373 was found above.        But even
 in the case of its being fulfilled the constant direction-difference
 would not be found equal to +TT, because the angle             always^
 lies in the first quadrant.

       ON HARMONIC               RATIOS IN SPECTRA.            BY   J.   L. SORET.
        idea of seeking harmonic relations between the different lines
THE
  of the     spectrum of one and the same body is doubtless not new,
several savants having already occupied themselves with this ques
tion*; but the article which has just been analyzed           as well as
Mr. Stoney's previous note, appears to us to present special in               a -f,
terest — 1st, by the extreme precision with which the calculated
       :
wave-lengths coincide with those deduced from experimental deter
minations which are capable of inspiring great confidence         2ndly,              ;
by the high order of the harmonics which are indicated — such that
the ratios of the numbers of vibrations are by no means very simple.
The complication of these ratios, particularly for chlorochromic acid,
as well as the absence of the greater number of the harmonics in the
case of hydrogen,      even of
                          is      nature to excite doubts of the correct

ness of the hypothesis which       to be controlled.

   Nevertheless the coincidence of the calculated with the observed
values  is too exact for    to be possible to attribute

not due to the existence of harmonics,         must proceed from some

other determinate cause. It seems, then, to us that here are motives
for urging the study of this interesting subject. By taking into
account the ultra-violet lines, of which     great number have already

much more extensive field than           we confined ourselves 'to the

question.

nearly identical with the ratio between the wave-lengths of the hy

and 27th harmonics of one and the same fundamental vibration.
The first two groups of magnesium also might therefore be regarded
as the 20th and 27th harmonics of a fundamental group of vibrations,
of which the wave-length, for the least-refrangible line, would be
0-0103660 millim.     As to the third group,     would not represent

                                        is
very nearly, the 31st.
    Facts of the same kind are found also for the lines of cadmium
which have been determined by M. Mascart*.         Thus the ratio of
the wave-length of the 1st line (X=0'00064370)    to that of the 18th
(X=:0'00025742)       exactly as
                          is        to 2. Further, between the 2nd
                                             5
line of cadmium (X=-0'0005377) and the 8th (X=0'00039856) the
        27
ratio
        HQ
             is    found, with an approach        to accuracy very near the        limit
of the errors of observation.  These two lines might, then, be re
garded as the 20th and 27th harmonics of one and the same funda
mental vibration.   The 32nd harmonic      not found but, as in the
                                                      is               ;
case of magnesium, the 31st harmonic nearly coincides with the 10th
line (X= 0-00034645).      The 6th line (X=0'00046765) represents
very exactly the 23rd harmonic of the same fundamental.    Finally,
                                                                                  27
the 6th and 10th lines are also connected               by the same ratio of      ^.
  It seems difficult to admit these coincidences to be fortuitous                       ;
and probably others still would be discovered on       closer examina
                                                                   a

 ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE                   FORCE OF INDUCTION IN LIQUID CON
                         DUCTORS.       BY DK. L. HERMANN.
   On the occasion of experiments on the excitation of the nerve by
induction in itself, which   shall elsewhere communicate, the ques
                                    I
tion suggested itself whether the electromotive force of the induction
demonstrated by Faraday in liquid conductors was the same as that
in metallic ones, other conditions being the same.        Since under

the latter the inducing force is independent of the nature of the metal,
the question arises, does this independence of the nature of the in
duced conductor also extend to liquids, and therefore to all conduc
tors ? Experiments on this point have not been made, so far as I am
aware.
     1  made three experiments with           three different arrangements, of
which      I shall only communicate the         most successful, as they all led
to the same result.
     In a metallic contact connected with the compass apiece of caout
 chouc tubing 179 centims. in length was inserted ; its external dia
 meter was 13 millims., its internal 7 millims.              In both ends amal
 gamated zinc cylinders were firmly tied ; and the tubing was entirely
 filled with saturated solution of zinc vitriol.          The intensities of the
 induced current werejiow to be compared according to whether the
 liquid part, or a corresponding one of the metallic circuit, or both
 simultaneously were exposed to inducing action.
     A powerful Ruhmkorff s electromagnet was used as inductor, of
 the kind which serves for investigating the action on the plane of
 polarization.       The current was furnished by two adjacent series,
 each of four Bunsen's elements.             The two coils were provided with
 cylindrical poles      of  65  millims.  diameter   and plane faces, and were
  so arranged that the two poles formed a cylinder between                   the
  spirals 55 millims. in length.          About these the caoutchouc tubing
  was first of all coiled in six turns, then, in a further series of expe
  riments, simultaneously with it a part of the metallic conduction, also
  in six turns, of approximately equal radius ; the caoutchouc tube was
  finally removed and only the coils of wire left. The continuity of
  the induced circuitwas unbroken during the whole of the experiments.
      The compass was one of Wiedemann's, extremely sensitive, with
  the magnet made aperiodic by a sufficient degree of astatizing. The
  very slight inequality of the zinc electrodes in the tubing produced
  a plight deflection, which was almost constant during the entire ex
  periment, which produces no disturbance, because the induced cir
   cuit is always closed.        The electromagnet was removed as far from
   the compass as my laboratory permitted; it was in another room,
  at a distance in a straight line of 14'6 metres.             The openings and
   closings were effected by my assistant, at bell signals given by an
   observer sitting at the telescope.            The electromagnet was turned
   about the vertical until the action of its opening and closing was
   without any influence on the mirror of the compass when the
   circuit of the latter was open.         The primary current was alternately
   passed through      the   electromagnet in the two directions, which I will
   call  A  and  B.
       The following are the deflections, exactly in the order in which
   they were obtained.           Before Experiment 1 the electromagnet had
   been   traversed   by   the  current  in the direction A.

   These experiments show with certainty, since the resistance in the
induced circuit is in all cases the same, that the electromotive force
of the induced current is, in the widest sense of the word, entirely inde
pendent of the nature of the induced conductor.        The induction in
Series I. and IV. is approximately equal, in Series II. approximately
twice as great, and in Series III. approximately null.        That these
relations should be quite exact could not be expected, since induction
takes place on other parts of the conduction besides the coils, and
these parts change their positions somewhat during the arrangement
of the experiments, and, lastly, the convolutions cannot be exactly
limited to six complete turns.
   After each alteration of the direction of the current in the electro
magnet, the first closing regularly produces an uncommonly strong
induction-current (the corresponding numbers are marked with *
and are not taken into account in calculating the mean).       This phe
nomenon doubtless has its origin in the fact that the electromagnet,
after the opening of the current, retains a high degree of permanent
magnetism ; so that in altering the direction of the current there is
not only a magnetization, but also an inversion of the poles, which
must, of course, produce a more powerful induction.         Inasmuch as
the latter amounts to more than double the ordinary one, it follows
that the magnet on opening retains more than a third of its mag
netism.     Moreover it is observed that in by far the most numerous
cases the induction-current on closing is a little stronger than that
on opening, and that the intensity of the former is subject to some
what stronger variations.      This also can be readily explained : on
opening, the magnet always loses the same quantity of magnetism ;
this sudden decrease is followed by a further slower one.          The in
crease of magnetism at the moment of closing will therefore always
be somewhat greater than the decrease at the moment of opening,
and will be greater the longer the pause between two experiments.
   Exactly the same phenomena were observed in the two other
series of experiments. In one the electromagnet was again used as
inductor ; between its poles, however, an iron cylinder 149 mil-
lims. in length and 16 millims. in diameter was inserted. This was
surrounded by a glass spiral of fourteen turns, width of coil 30 mil
lims., filled with solution of zinc sulphate. In the other I used an in
ductor, to be described elsewhere, which I have constructed for nerve
induction, and which is calculated for very short induced conductors ;
in this case a simple straight glass tube or a metal wire was used
for induction. — Poggendorff's Annalen, No. 4, 1871.
