I.  On the Temperature      attainable by Rock-crushing   and its Con
             sequences.    By ROBERT MALLET, F.R.S.*
                   the          of volcanic heat and
INin developing         theory                        energy embraced
       his paper “ On the Nature and Origin of Volcanic Heat and
         "
Energy      (Phil. Trans. Part 1., 1873), the main object of the
author was to prove that the annual work of secular contraction
in our globe, when transformed into heat, was more than ade
quate for the supply of volcanic activity existing upon our planet.
While indicating generally the circumstances which must attend
as results of the descent of the exterior shell upon the more
rapidly contracting nucleus, it was not necessary to his argument
to follow into detail the mechanism of local dislocation and crush
ing due to such descent. Nor would the limits of his paper admit
of his entering into much detail as to the circumstances attending
subterranean dislocation and crushing of rocky matter, or point;
ing out how some of these must greatly tend to exalt the tempera
tures due to the transformation of the mechanical work locally
done. It was necessary to a truthful examination of the question
whether or not the annual supply of heat transformed from the
work of secular contraction were su<U+FB01>icient to meet the demands of
existing volcanic action, that he should not overrate the work so
transformed; and accordingly, in determining by experiment a
measure for the amount of that work, the author viewed the work
of crushing of uncon<U+FB01>ned or unsupported masses alone as the
source of heat, this method being that only which could a<U+FB02>'ord
perfectly trustworthy experimental results.         He paid no regard
to the additional work that must attend the collision and friction

2         Mr. R. Mallet    on the Temperature attainable
of already crushed  masses  in the further progress of their defor
mation and forced transport to points more Or less distant from
those at which the crushing had taken place.          The work of
crushing in, free air was capable of rigid determination; the
work of subsequent deformation and transportation can only
admit of estimation upon assumed data, and these necessarily of
a somewhat arbitrary character, seeing how little we know accu
rately of the nature and disposition of the rocky materials of our
earth’s crust, except at the most inconsiderable depth from its
surface.   Nor Were any of the circumstances pointed out by
which high temperatures are capable of being attained locally
in rocky masses crushed beneath our surface and which we
must assume as those actually occurring in nature.              The
writer’s object here is to point out, 1st, that, taking the annual
supply of heat from transformed work of contraction, by expe
riment in the way he has done, the result, though more than
suf<U+FB01>cient to sustain his theory, a<U+FB01>'ords alone no complete mea
sure of the highest temperature that may through its means be
locally developed; 2ndly, to answer some doubts which have
been raised as to whether the temperature to which subter
ranean rocky masses can become raised by the heat evolved in
their crushing and transportation of particles can, be suf<U+FB01>cient to
bring more or less of these at such foci of crushing and disloca
tion to the fusing-point of such materials, which the author in
his original paper assumes to be 2000° Fahr.
   Professor Hilgard, occupying the chair of geology in the Uni
versity of Michigan, U. S., in an able paper published in the
American Journal of Science, vol. vii. June 1874*, has, in terms
as clear as they are courteous, pointed out these lacunae in the
author’s original paper in the following passage :—
   “ One point, however, must strike every reader of the
                                                            original
memoir, viz. the preeminence given by Mallet to the crushing of
solid rock as the means of producing heat and fusion. One
would naturally look to the results of his experiments on this
                                             '
subject for the proof of the ef<U+FB01>ciency of this agency.     But we
<U+FB01>nd that the maximum temperature resulting from the crushing
to powder of the hardest rock is something over 217° Fahr.
This, then, represents the maximum increment of temperature
that can be rendered ef<U+FB01>cient toward the fusing of rocks by the
crushing process under the most favourable circumstances, viz.
upon the supposition that it takes place instantaneously, or;
under such circumstances that the heat cannot be conducted
away, and, further, that the resistance of the rock has not been
materially diminished by the downward increase of hypogeal
temperature. At the most moderate depths at which volcanic phe
                   “'

                 by Rock-crushing    and its Consequences.            3
nomeua     can be supposed to originate the last-mentioned factor
must exert a very considerable in<U+FB02>uence, reducing materially the
available heat-increment.        Hence the numerical results of Mal
let’s laborious experiments on rock-crushing, however interesting
and useful as affording a de<U+FB01>nite measure of the thermal effects
producible by this means, yet fail to carry conviction as to the
ef<U+FB01>cacy of this particular modus operandi in reducing large masses of
 solid rock to fusion, unless essentially supplemented by friction,
not so much of rock walls against each other, but
                                                         more probably
 by the heat produced within more or less comminuted detrital or
 igneoplastic masses by violent pressure and deformation.
     “ It
          may be doubtful what would be the physical and thermal
 effect of enormously great pressures upon rock powder such as was
 produced in Mallet’s experiments ; but it would seem that if made
 to yield,the frictional effect must produce very high temperatures.
 A fortiori, solid detrital masses of variously sized fragments in
 termingled (such as, rather than powder, would be likely to
 result from steady pressure), yielding rapidly under great pres
 sures, might, under the combined in<U+FB02>uence of friction and rock
 crusll-ing, well be supposed to reach the temperature of fusion,
 which a simple crushing of a solid mass by pressure would have
 failed to produce.      Mallet mentions the probable in<U+FB02>uence of
 friction and of the squeezing of igneoplastic masses, but does not
 attach to these agencies such importance as they seem to me to
 deserve.
     “ Of the complex thermal      effects of the movements of detrital
  masses    under great pressure Mallet’ s <U+FB01>gures of course offer no
  measure whatsoever; nor is this, or even the thermal coef<U+FB01>cients
  resulting from his rock-crushing experiments, at all necessary
  to the establishment of the postulates of his theory.”
     Subsequently the Rev. 0. Fisher, in a paper read before the
  Geological Society of London, May 1 2, 1875, entitled
                                                             “ Remarks
  upon Mr. Mallet’s Theory of Volcanic Energy,” has repeated the
  observations of Professor Hilgard, and extended his objections
  to the author’s theory in general in a way which appears not
  warranted.     It will be suf<U+FB01>cient here to quote the following from
  Mr. Fisher’s paper :-—-“ Indeed the form in which the objection
  to Mr. Mallet’s reasoning suggested itself to my mind on <U+FB01>rst
  reading his paper was simply this.         If crushing the rocks can
  induce fusion, then the cubes experimented upon ought to have
  been fused in the crushing; and I still adhere to this simple mode
 of expressing my objection.”         Again :—“ He considers that the
 heat so developed may be localized, and that the heat developed
  by crushing, say 10 cubic miles of rock, may fuse 1 cubic mile.
 But I ask why so? The work is equally distributed throughout;
 why should not the-heat be so also? or if not, what determines
                                    B 2

  4            Mr. R. Mallet  on the Temperature attainable
   the localization ? For example, suppose a horizontal column
   10 miles in length and 1 in sectional area to be crushed by pres
   sure applied at its ends, which of the 10 cubic miles is to be the
   one fused? But if no cause can assign one more than another,
   it is clear that they will all be heated by 1700 and none of them
   fused.”
       If a cube of rock, which in free air is found to crush under a
   certain pressure, be imagined situated deep within a mass of
   similar rock and there crushed, it does not admit of dispute that
   the work necessary to effect crushing must be largely increased;
   the particles of the cube and of the entire mass of surrounding
   rock are under the insistent pressure of the superincumbent
   rock in a state of elastic equilibrium. It follows, therefore, that
   the pressures of the surrounding rock produce the same effect
  upon the cube as regards resistance to crushing as if they were
  cohesive forces acting within the cube; and the work necessary to
  crush the cube by its <U+FB01>nally giving way, in whatever direction
  this encastrement by pressure may be least, will be increased over
  that which would crush it in free air nearly in the ratio in which
  the imaginary cube is exposed to external pressure greater than
  that in air. Thus, if the cube of Guernsey granite (N0. 12, Table
  1. Phil. Trans. part 1, 1873, p. 186) which required 4,336,712 lbs.
  per square foot to crush it in air, equivalent to a superincumbent
  column of the same rock of the mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity 2858, or
  weighing 178'3392 lbs. per cubic foot, be supposed situated at a
  depth of ten to twenty statute miles, it will require rather more than
  2'14, or, at twenty miles, 4'28 times as much pressure upon two
  opposite faces to crush it that it did when in air; and if we assume
  the displacement of the crushed particles after crushing to be
  the same as in the case of the cube crushed in air, then the work
  and the heat due to its transformation will be also 2'14, or 4'28
  times as great.     And as in the case of the cube crushed in air
  the heat developed was su<U+FB02>icient to fuse (at 2000° Fahr.) 0-108
  of its 'own volume, or, in other words, the crushing of 10
  cubic feet of the rock would be required to raise to that point
 one cubic foot, then in the case of the imaginary cube situated at
the depth of ten miles enough heat would be evolved by the
 work of crushing each cubic foot to fuse 0'231 cubic foot, or, at
 twenty miles, to fuse 0'462 cubic foot of the same rock, or nearly
 half the volume crushed,—and this assuming that the initial
 temperature of the rock at 10 or 20 miles depth was only 57°
 Fahr. as in the author’s experiments, instead of from 500° to
 1000° Fahr. or more as it may be at 10 to 20 miles depth.
Therefore, under the pressure due to a depth of 20 miles and an
initial temperature of 1000° Fahr., the heat developed by the
work of crushing each cubic foot of rock will be su<U+FB02>icient to

                 by Rock-crushing and its     Consequences.              '5
fuse its own volume.         Thus also if we assume the fusing-point
of the rocks not to be 2000° Fahr., as indicated by the author’s
experiments on the cooling of slags, but considerably higher,
 say 2500° or more, we have still a suf<U+FB01>cient supply of heat due
 to crushing alone to bring 08 of the entire volume to the fusing~
point.
     These considerations, apart from all others yet to be adverted
 to, appear fully suf<U+FB01>cient to refute the Rev. 0. Fisher’s <U+FB01>rst ob
jection above quoted; indeed the statement that if under any
circumstances and in the rock-masses of nature “ crushing can
 induce fusion, then the cubes experimented upon ought to have
 been fused in the crushing,” seems as unsupportable as it would
 be to af<U+FB01>rm that no heat is developed by the slow oxidation (ere
macausis) into water and carbonic acid of a pound of wood, which
when burned develops a well-known amount of heat.
     The depths above assumed do not widely differ from those at
 which the foci of earthquakes have been found by the author
 (Report on Neapolitan Earthquake) in 1857, and by others since
that time, and which may be presumed to indicate in some
degree the possible depth of volcanic activity.                    v
     The writer now proceeds to reply to the second objection of
 the Rev. O. Fisher as above quoted, which appears to him based
 entirely on a misconception of the physical conditions involved.
 Let us consider what will happen in the case of a prism or
 column of rock crushed against the face of an unyielding mass.
 If the prismatic mass be not homogeneous throughout, crushing
 will commence at the weakest place; if it be perfectly homoge
 neous, crushing will commence and continue where the prism is
 in contact with a <U+FB01>xed mass, and that whether the prism be
 crushed at one or both ends—because it is at such surface of
 contact that the compression of the particles of the prism is
 greatest, and where therefore the elastic limit of their cohesion
 is <U+FB01>rst and successively overpassed.       This may be seen illustrated
 in the stonework of buildings the material of which is overloaded,
 where crushing or spalling off of the ashlar stones only occurs
 at and near the joints *. In either case, whether the prism
 be homogeneous or not, the crushing must be localized either to
 the end or ends of the prism, or to the plane of weakness where
 it <U+FB01>rst yields, and which then becomes the crushing surfaces of
 two opposed prisms.          It is these physical conditions which
 “ determine the localization ” of crushing in the prism, and
 which conditions have been disregarded in the Rev. 0. Fisher’s
 objection.     Let us now consider the subsequent effects of the
    *  See also E. Hodgkinson’s experiments on the directions of fracture
of   crushed materials, Brit. Assoc. Report, vol. vi.; and Tredgold on Cast
 Iron, by Ilodgkinson, part 2, p. 319, and plate 1.

 6           Mr. R. Mallet   on the Temperature attainable
  successive crushing 'of a column or prismatic mass of rock, one
 extremity of which is continually urged against the face of a
 <U+FB01>xed mass of rock which does not yield, a case which approxi
 mates to that which most frequently occurs in nature, and which,
 to <U+FB01>x our ideas, we may suppose presents a face for crushing of one
  square foot; and being continually urged forward, and the pres
 sure being greatest where the pressing column comes into contact
  with the <U+FB01>xed mass of rock, the extremity of the column sup
 posed homogeneous, or the parts adjacent thereto, are continu
  ally crushed by a succession of per saltum movements.           The
 <U+FB01>rst cubic foot of the column that is crushed has its temperature
  raised, let us suppose, by the minimum of 217°.        The crushed
 fragments at this temperature are pushed aside by the advan
 cing column, whose extremity is thus surrounded by crushed
 material at a temperature of 217°, and the second foot in length
 of the column becomes crushed.               But the material of this
 second cubic foot is at a higher temperature before it is crushed
 than was the <U+FB01>rst cubic foot; so that the heat due to the trans
 formed work of crushing of each successive cubic foot of rock
 raises its temperature to a higher point than that of the prece
 ding one, because each successive cubic feet at the instant before
 crushing is at a temperature already higher than the preceding
 ones, resulting from the heat taken up by the uncrushed column
 from the hotter portions of material surrounding it that have
already been heated by crushing; so that, if T be the tempera
ture produced in the <U+FB01>rst cubic foot crushed, and t be the tem
 perature of the crushed material which communicates a portion
of its heat to the next cubic foot crushed, the temperatures of
successive cubic feet crushed may be illustrated by some such
series as the following :—
                        Cubic                  -

     We have here supposed the column crushed at atmospheric
pressure; but if crushed under an insistent column of 20 miles,
then the temperature T would be 4'28 times 217°=928°, and
the subsequent temperatures correspondingly increased.
    No limit arises to this continual augmentation of temperature
while the rock retains its rigidity; after that has been seriously
impaired or lost, any further exaltation of temperature apart from
the detrusion or transport of fragmentary matter, as hereafter re.
ferred to, becomes dependent upon the deformation and detrusion
of a more or less plastic mass. It is well ascertained, however,
by observation on a great scale, that granite remains rigid at a

               by Rock-crushing     and its Consequences.                  7
temperature nearly approaching the softening point of cast iron*;
so that a large range of rigidity must exist for the exaltation or
its temperature in the way above suggested; and in the state
of aggregation which we are warranted in supposing rocky
masses to exist at considerable depths, it is probable that this
range of rigidity would be even further extended than in the
case of granites found at or near the present surface of our globe.
     There is a close analogy between the conditions of gradual
 exaltation of temperature above sketched, and those by which
 aérolites, <U+FB02>ying at an immense velocity through our atmosphere,
 are heated from the temperature of the stellar spaces to that of
 incandescence or even fusion of those bodies.          The aérolite,
 which, according to Schiaparelli, may in some instances be forced
through our atmosphere with a relative velocity exceeding 3500
 feet per second (one enormously exceeding that at which air can
 rush into a vacuum), compresses the stratum of air immediately
 in advance in almost the same manner as if at the <U+FB01>rst instant of
 contact the air were a rigid body.     The temperature developed is
 greater as the velocity of compression is so, and as the volume
 compressed is less; the most highly heated air is therefore the
 stratum directly in contact at any instant with the stone ; and
 the latter licks up more or less of the heat as it passes through a
  succession of such compressed strata, and so receives continual
  accessions of heat until the temperature of the meteoric stone
  itself reaches the limit given by that of the stratum of compressed
  air in immediate contact with it at any instant.       If a body as
  mobile and compressible as air can thus by suf<U+FB01>ciently rapid
  compression be raised above the temperature of I incandescence,
  we may readily conceive how great an exaltatiou of temperature
  may be produced in the rigid materials of our earth’s crust when
  exposed to a pressure which may be viewed as limitless in refer
  ence to the resistance opposed to      it,
                                          and which, in consequence
  of the conditions of elastic resilience hereafter referred to, may
  give rise to motion and crushing with velocities even exceeding
  .those with which acrolites traverse our atmosphere. >                   .

  againstit   isanother example.     The heat developed at the work

                                                                 is
   * The observations upon which these statements are founded have been
 made after various great con<U+FB02>agrations of store or warehouses at London,
 Liverpool, and Dublin, into the construction of which granite blocks and
 cast iron in columns, girders, &c. largely entered. The cast “on was
either melted or softened to the consistence of soap; the granite heated to
 like temperature, except being split in various directions, was found un
valtered, except more or less in colour, after having been again cooled.

carried off and dissipated by its rotation, and it thus remains
cool enough to be touched by the hand, although the heat de
veloped by it and accumulated at and near the working-point in
the <U+FB01>le is suf<U+FB01>cient to raise that to the temperature at which cast
steel becomes softened and approaches fusion.
   The cutting of steel railway bars across when at a very low
red heat by a rapidly revolving circular saw, which revolves par
tially immersed in cold water, and from whose action a torrent
of incandescent fragments of steel is discharged, is a like case.
   Besides the heat transformed from the work of compression
and crushing, a large amount of heat must also be generally
produced by transformation        of the work expended in friction
                   ‘
and detrusion.        N0 experiments have as yet, to the author’s
knowledge, been made upon the amount of heat developable in
fragmentary pulverulent masses, such as sand, by the forcible
transposition of more or less of the particles ; nor do we know
with certainty the conditions under which external mechanical
pressure is transmitted through sand or like discontinuous
matter.    As in rigid solids exposed to unequal mechanical pres
sures there exist planes or surfaces within the mass such as have
been denominated by Moseley “planes of easiest shearing,” or
sliding, so in masses of pulverulent matter, whatever be the shape
or size of the particles, provided these be small in relation to the
whole mass, and their mutual adhesion        (ifany) small also, such
planes must        byunequal mechanical pressure be brought into
existence.    Along any such plane we may imagine the sand or
other pulverulent matter forced to move over itself in opposite
directions at opposite sides of the plane; that    is to say, we may
suppose the sand forced along such       a  plane much in the same
way that  a   mass of sandstone or of granite would be forced along
such a   shearing plane as had been produced in     it  previously by
mechanical pressure.     If   this reasoning be admitted, we must
suppose that heat would be developed along such         aplane and at
short distances from    it  in way more or less analogous to that
                              a
produced      byforcing one rough surface of stone over another.
What the coef<U+FB01>cient of friction in this case would be can only be
determined     byexperiment   ; but we may justi<U+FB01>ably conclude that
the amount of friction per unit of surface would increase propor
tionately to the pressure applied externally to the entire mass—
exposed to more or less of which, motion at any such sur
face of friction must take place.       Coulomb, Morin, and others
have found the friction of some sorts of rough stone upon other
rough stone to reach as much as three fourths the pressure    ;   and
should this coe<U+FB02>icient increase proportionately      under the enor
mous pressures to which      a  discontinuous mass at several miles
depth may be subjected, we can readily see that the trans

                by Rock-crushing        and its Consequences.                     .‘9
formed heat  of friction produced by internal movements taking
place in such materials after crushing has occurred, must be the
source of a large amount of heat over and above that originally
due to the crushing itself.        Thus, for example, if we assume a
surface of such disintegrated material sliding over a similar sur
face, or over a rough surface of coherent rock, and under the
pressure of ten miles of rock of the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of granite, at
the rate of one foot per second, and if we take the coef<U+FB01>cient
of friction as low as 05, we have 4,326,600 foot-pounds of fric
                                                       J
tional work per second, which, divided by (=772), gives 5604
units of heat evolved per second from each square foot of sur
face ; and to this development there is no limit while the circum
stances continue the same, except that of the distance that one
surface is forced over the other.           And great as is this evolu
tion of heat under such enormous pressures, it would be further
increased in the event of the fragmentary particles being heated
 so as to present incipient viscosity of surface and more or less
of mutual agglutination.                                    .

      Temperature with respect to any given solid material is depen
 dent upon the units of heat present in a unit of mass or of
 volume of the substance.         If for the same total heat we dimi
 nish    the  mass   or volume, the temperature is proportionately
 increased.     When the material is surrounded by matter capable
 of carrying off heat by conduction, or evection, or radiation, and
 the heat is evolved within the mass by work done upon               then   it,

                                   is
  elicited by   abrasive friction, or collision between hard bodies.

10            Mr. R. Mallet         on the Temperature attainable
spark struck from the steel of a gun-lock by the <U+FB02>int.        In the
case of small masses of rock, such as the lé-inch cubes of the
author’s experiments, crushed between two opposite surfaces of
steel, the actual temperature of the crushed particles can never
be found to reach that due to the work of crushing; for the heat
of the relatively small mass of the crushed cube in close contact
with far larger masses of cold steel of high conductivity is car
ried o<U+FB02>' almost as fast as it is evolved; and as the total amount
of heat evolved from the crushing of such a cube of the hardest
rock experimented upon by the author (namely number 12,
Table I. Phil. Trans. part 1, 1873, p. 186) could only raise its
own mass through 217°, if the temperature of fusion of the rock
may be taken at 2000", it is obvious that such a cube could
not be fused by the work of crushing alone, even though all the
heat due to the crushing work remained in the cube, none being
dissipated to surrounding objects.
   In the case of a cube such as this losing heat by dissipation,
the temperature of the crushed mass depends upon the time in
which the work of crushing is done.        In the author‘s experi
ments the crushing of each cube in column 12 occupied a mean
time somewhat greater than that in which a heavy body could
fall freely through a space of 0'09 foot (No. 12, Table I. l. c., col.

experiments been a cubic foot in place of an inch and a half
cube, the time of crushing must have been greater than '249
second (or nearly a quarter of a second), or the crushing would
have been performed with nearly a velocity of 2 feet per second,
and that would be less than 3665 of the velocity with which
the same would have been crushed if circumstanced as in the
shell of our globe. And if we extend our view from the crushing
 of a cubic foot or two to that of a cubic mile or more, we see
 that there would be very little of the total heat evolved lost by
 dissipation, there being scarcely any time in which that could
occur, the possible rate of crushing of a cubic mile being less
 than half a second.
     In the case of a very large mass of rock crushed simultanea
 ously, or nearly so, as every portion of the rock evolves heat pro
 portionate to the crushing-work done upon            so the heated it,
 portions of crushed material situated near the exterior of the
 entire mass act as “jacketing,” so as to preserve the deeper
 seated portions of the heated mass almost absolutely from any
 dissipation of heat for     considerable length of time, that time
                                 a
 depending, cateris parib'as, on the conductivity of the crushed
 material and the difference in temperature between the crushed
 material and the uncrushed rock adjacent to it.           There are
  some experimental     grounds for concluding that the absolute
  crushing-force per unit of volume in any given rock increases as
  the absolute volume of the mass simultaneously crushed becomes
  greater; thus      has been found

                                          Rondelct that large cubes
  of stone required      proportionately larger crushing-force than
                           a
  smaller ones; much stress, however, cannot be laid upon this,
  as we cannot assume with any certainty what are the precise
  conditions under which rock-surfaces in our earth’s shell are
  forced together, and the distribution of the crushing-pressure
  may be inde<U+FB01>nitely varied.
      In the author’s experiments the cubes crushed       pressure on     by
  two opposite faces were free upon the other four;        cannot be      it
   doubted that, had only two opposite faces been free and the
  pressure applied simultaneously upon the four other faces, two
  and two respectively, the pressure necessary for crushing or the
  work thereof would have been considerably increased.       Further,
if     none of the faces were free, and all those except the two
   opposite faces to which the crushing pressure   supposed applied,

  as has been already pointed out.
     Another and further source of heat arises after crushing and
  detrusion of the fragmentary matter, and after the latter has
  arrived at a temperature at which the fragments have become
  more or less viscous and adherent by reason of the further work
  expended in the deformation and detrusion by forcing forward
  through highly irregular or constricted rock-channels of the
  heated and now viscous mass.         There do not exist at present
  sufficient data by which to calculate the amount of work neces
  sary to a given amount of deformation in viscous masses; and
  hence we cannot calculate the amount of heat that in nature
  might arise from it. Hirn, however, has shown that in the case
  of plastic bodies such as lead the heat developed is proportionate
  to the work done in deformation ; so that, if we knew the pressure
  per unit of surface necessary to produce a certain deformation
 in an already heated mass of given viscosity, we could calculate
 how much its temperature would be exalted by the work of the
  assigned deformation.
     Examples, however, are not wanting which prove that a very
 large exaltation of temperature can thus be produced—as, for
 example, in the old-fashioned method by which blacksmiths were
 accustomed to light their <U+FB01>res.      A thin square rod of very good
 tough iron was hammered at its extremity by a succession of
 rapidly given blows from a light hand-hammer.         Aftera minute
 or so the rod, for the portion of its length hammered at the extre
 mity ; became red, and in a second or two more of distortion of
 its form by continuance of the hammering, the iron could be
 made nearly white hot.                                  .
    A similar example, on a much larger scale, occurs in the pro
 cess of rolling iron or steel.      When a heavy billet of iron or
 steel, heated to a brilliant yellow heat, is passed between the
rolls of the iron mill, and the massive lump is rapidly elongated
into a bar, its temperature, notwithstanding that it is rapidly
and constantly losing heat by radiation and evection, is observed
visibly to increase, so that the mass becomes at a certain stage
white or welding hot by the transformation into heat of the
work of deformation so rapidly and powerfully applied to it.
    The action of the machine employed in the arsenal at Wool
wich for making lead rods to be afterwards pressed into bullets
affords another striking example.        In this machine a cylindric
block of lead, maintained at a temperature of 400° Fahr., is by a
steady pressure upon the end, which is 8”'5 in diameter, of 16,700
lbs. per square inch of its surface, forced through an aperture at
the other extremity into a rod of O”'525 diameter, at such a rate
that <U+FB01>ve inches in length of the cylindric block becomes a rod

of about 100 feet in length of the above diameter per minute.
We have thus 393,906 foot-pounds of work done upon the lead
per minute, dividing which by         J
                                 we have 5102 British units of
heat developed per minute from the transformed          work.   In the
actual  machine    the  whole  of  this is ultimately dissipated and
lost; but if none of it were dissipated, as the cylindric block of
lead of 8'5 in. diameter by 0'416 ft. (5 inches) weighs 1163 lbs.,
and the speci<U+FB01>c heat of lead is=0'029 (or perhaps a little
 more at 400° Fahr.), it follows that the heat developed by its
deformation from the short cylindric block of 5 inches length
to a rod of about 100 feet length, is enough to raise the tem
perature of the lead through 151° Fahr., or, were no heat lost, to
raise its temperature from 400°- to 551° or thereabouts—that                is,
within about 50° of its melting point.        If, therefore, we could
 by   reverse process squeeze the 100-foot rod back into the
      a
original block of 8"‘5 x 5”, we should <U+FB01>nd the lead in the latter
not only liquid, but considerably above its temperature of fusion,
or at nearly 700° Fahr. It        obvious, therefore, that any viscous
                                 is
or plastic body  such  as lava, continually forced through apertures
varying in area and form and suffering continual deformation, as
when forced through      a volcanic tube or vent, must have its teme
perature continually exalted so long as          continues thus to be

                                               is
nature, that an extremely small proportion of the heat developed
in the process can be dissipated          by
                                        conduction to the walls of the

   These advantages have been obtained by modifying the posi
tions and focal lengths of the lenses usually employed in table
polariscopes, so that the rings of a crystal are best seen when
there is a space of 1} inch between the two lenses, one on either
side of the crystal.   Into this space is introduced a central piece,
consisting  of a circular box with deep plano-convex lenses <U+FB01>xed,
one in the bottom and the other in the top of the box, in such a
position that their curved surfaces have a common centre of cur
vature, with their <U+FB02>at faces turned towards one another and en
closing the crystal between them.      The box can turn about an
axis passing through the common centre of curvature.
The form and position of Mirror and Lenses for the Polariscope.
    A is a concave mirror about 112* inch in diameter, such as is
ordinarily employed for illuminating microscopes, and mounted
in the same manner.         A double-concave lens, B, 1 inch in dia
meter,   is placed  so  as to have its focus at the same point as the
principal focus    of the_n1irror.   The rays coming from the mirror
will then be parallel after passing through the lens. To dimi
nish aberration as much as possible, the radius of curvature of
the <U+FB01>rst face of the lens should be about six times the radius of
its second face. The parallel rays then fall on a tourmaline or
other polarizer, C, the diameter of which should be nearly equal
to that of the lens.      They then fall on a double-convex crossed
lens I), the <U+FB01>rst face of the lens having the greatest curvature,
so as to diminish the aberration as much as possible.         This lens   '
is 1 inch in diameter and 1% inch focal length.
                     i
    At a distance of of an inch from this lens is placed a convexo
plane lens E, g of an inch in diameter and 1 inch focal length.
    These three lenses, B, D, and E, may be <U+FB01>xed in the same
piece; and with the above arrangement, rays which are parallel
before falling on the mirror will be brought to a focus at a distance
of half an inch on the outside of the last lens E. The rays then
fall on the central piece MN, consisting of two plane-convex
lenses, which are nearly hemispheres, enclosing the crystal be
tween them.      The <U+FB01>rst of these lenses, M, is 5 millims. in thick
ness,  and   the radius    of its spherical surface is 6'4 millims., or
71;of an inch; the other lens, N,           millims. in thickness, and
                                     is is
                                             7'
the radius of its spherical surface       9'6 millims., or
                                                        %   of an inch;
and they should be so placed that the two centres of curvature
are accurately at the same point 0.        The distance between them
will then be 4    millims., which  is    very nearly the thickness of
most specimens of crystals.        If lenses with the same curvatures
 but of thicknesses 41% and 6% millims. respectively be used in
 place of M and N, there will be breadth of
                                    a             5   millims. between
 them when they are in the best position.           This central piece

lenses; but when a crystal is introduced, the rays may be sent
through it in any desired direction on turning the axis, so that
either of the optic axes of a biaxal crystal may be brought into
the centre of the <U+FB01>eld.   Thus the angle between the optic axes
may be measured.     The central piece M N is made in the form
of a box, so that a liquid may be introduced into it for mea

   The advantages to be obtained by the use of this central piece
are    :—
      (l) The extension of the <U+FB01>eld of view. If the angle in air cor
responding to the <U+FB01>eld of view is 74° without the central piece,
then the angle will be increased to about 128° when the central
piece is introduced, the central piece giving the same angle in
glass that is given without it in air.  The <U+FB01>eld of view may be ‘
made to include both optic axes of topaz of Brazil.
   (2) When the plane containing the optic axes is at right
angles to the axis P Q, either of the optic axes of a biaxal crystal
or any ring may be brought into the centre of the <U+FB01>eld of view
where the spider-lines cross one another, and the angles between
them accurately measured.     Instead of employing a lens for an
eyepiece, the centre of the <U+FB01>eld may be determined by <U+FB01>xing
crossed spider-lines at a point halfway between the lenses 1)
and E. These lines will be brought to a focus by the system of
lenses E, M, N, F, and G at a distance to the right of G equal to
about one tenth of an inch; and at this focus another set of
crossed spider-lines should be placed, so that the two sets may by
their coincidence determine the centre of the <U+FB01>eld of view. The
spider-lines should be in the focus of the lens H, so that they
may be seen on looking through the Nicol’s prism.

 keeping for 19 months, the fusion-point, as ascertained by a
 small number of special observations, had risen to 69°‘6 nearly.

of work, and has the greatest solubility.               Its fusion-point is
nearly identical with that prepared, though with more dif<U+FB01>culty,
from toluol itself; but this second modi<U+FB01>cation shows a dimi
nished solubility. The third modi<U+FB01>cation is made from solid
mononitrotoluol, with the greatest expenditure of energy; it has
an unmistakably higher fusion-point, but a lower

the shifting fusion-point of the product from liquid nitrotoluol,
the di<U+FB02>icultly observed fusion-point of the product from toluol
itself, and the impracticability of determining the solubility of
either of these isomers in alcohol, I cannot quite decide whether
the toluol- and liquid nitrotoluol-products are distinct. Judging
from their obvious mimicry of the trinitrotoluols, I should
presume that they are.

           problem is brie<U+FB02>y noticed by Professor Cayley in the
THISBritish     Association Report, 1862, p. 186.      Speaking of
rectilinear motion, he says :—-“ The problem   thus becomes a par
ticular case of that of central forces; and it is so treated in the
Principia, Book I. § 7; the method has the advantage of ex
plaining the paradoxical result which presents itself in the case
Force on (Dist.)-2, and in some other cases where the force
becomes in<U+FB01>nite.      According to the theory, the velocity becomes
in<U+FB01>nite at the centre, but the direction of the motion is there
abruptly reversed ; so that the body in its motion does not pass
through the centre, but on arriving there, forthwith returns to
its original position.   Of course such a motion cannot occur in
nature,   where  neither  a force nor a velocity ever is actually
in<U+FB01>nite.    . . .   .   Force   0c   (Dist.)-’, =      5,,   which     is   the case above

 lie wholly in the primary plane ; and its actual section of the com
 plete cone at the limit is seen in <U+FB01>g. 2a.
     To sum the whole argument, Professor Cayley’s solution is
 based on, “ what is true up to the limit will be true at the limit ;”
 but he has overlookod the 00ndition, “provided there be no dis
 continuity at the limit.” In the passage of an ellipse with po
 sitive radius vector through a parabola with vanishing latus
 rectum to an ellipse with negative radius vector there is discon
 tinuity ; yet it is thus that elliptic motion from positive trans
 Verse initial motion passes to elliptic motion from negative trans
 verse initial motion.        The di<U+FB02>iculty arises from the discontinuity
 in direction of the transverse initial motion in its passage through
 zero.
      No remarks on (4) are needed, further than that it states one of
 the manyproblems of which rectilinear motion through an attract
 ing centre is the limit.       I prefer it on account of the investigation
 by means of the hodograph.               An examination by that method
 of the various proposed limit-problems and solutions will well
 repay making it.

     A fragment of the substance to be tested, whether charcoal,
coke, anthracite, or other form of carbon,-is held between the
jaws of a pair of tongs formed by bending a strip of sheet zinc
 into a horseshoe form, and immersed in a solution of eupric sul
 phate.     If  the carbon is a non-conductor, the copper salt is de
composed, and deposit of copper only takes place on the immersed
 surface of the zinc ; but when it possesses a high degree of con_
 ductivity a zinc-carbon couple is formed, and deposit of cOpper
 takes place on the surface of the carbon as in ordinary electro
 typing.
      Of the different forms of carbon experimented upon, the most
 rapid results have     been obtained with some American anthracites,
  and coals that have been subjected to the action of intruded
 igneous rocks.        The most remarkable of these is an anthracite
  from    Peru,  which contains a large amount of sulphurin organic
  combination, and is found in a nearly vertical position, interstra
  ti<U+FB01>ed in quartzite, in the high plateau of the Andes, about 13,000
  feet above the sea-level, near Truxillo. It is probably of secondary
  age, the metamorphism having taken place at the time of the
  great trachytic outbursts which form the gold- and silver-bearing
   rocks of the adjacent mining-district.       This is coppered b ima
   mersion almost as readily as graphite.        The anthracite of enn
   sylvania possesses the same property, but not in quite such a
   high degree.      The Heathen coal of South Statfordshire, when

                                                      trap, is more slowly
   coppered   ;  but  this is probably due  to  the resistance  interposed
   by the numerous laminae of calcite <U+FB01>lling the fractures in the
   mass of the coal, which renders the conductivity less perfect.
   Aspecimen of coal from Bengal, altered in the same manner by in
    trusion of igneous rock, behaves much in the same way as coke,
    being coppered directly.      This is rather remarkable, as this coal
   is a very impure one, and contains such alarge quantity of water
   very intimately combined, probably as a hydrated silicate inter
    spersed through the mass, as to decrepitate explosively when
   suddenly heated.
       The ordinary Welsh anthracite does not appear to be a con
    ductor by this method; but after having been heated to a full
   red heat it conducts electricity freely.       The lowest temperature
    at which this change takes place appears to be somewhere be
    tween the melting-points of zinc (430° C.) and silver (1000° C.),
    as fragments of anthracite packed in a thin clay crucible and
    plunged into molten zinc were not found to be altered, but were

  26        Prof. R. Clausius     on the Theorem     of the Mean Ergal,
  changed when heated in a bath of melted silver.                  These limits,
  although 'considerably        wide   apart,   are  interesting as giving a
  possible clue to the temperature at which anthracitic metamor
  phism of coals has been effected in different districts. Mr. W. C.
  Roberts has recently shown that the alloys of silver and copper
  have very de<U+FB01>nite melting-points ; it will be possible therefore
  to determine more nearly the lowest temperature necessary to
  produce the change.
       In the South Wales anthracite district it is well known that
  no great amount of disturbance has taken place in the position
  of the coal-seams, while in North America and Peru the change
  has been accompanied with much more violent action, as evi
  denced by the greater disturbance of the rocks; and probably a
  correspondingly higher degree of heat was developed in the mass.
  The evidence afforded by the coals that have been actually altered
  by intruded rocks, and must have been highly heated, appears to
  bear out this view.        On the other hand, long-continued exposure
  to a lower temperature might possibly produce the same effect,
'
  and further experiments upon this point would be desirable.
  VI.     On the Theorem      of the Mean Ergal, and its Application          to
           the Molecular Motions of Gases. By R. CLAUSIUS*.
  § 1.           a memoir published       in 18701‘, for the elucidation of
           IN the     second proposition of the mechanical theory of
  heat,    I employed an equation which referred to a motion of a
  material point in a closed path; and in one which appeared in.
  18731, I advanced an equation of greater generality, expressing
  a new and, as       I  believe, more fruitful proposition in relation to
  stationary motions.
       Given any system whatever of material points which, under
  the in<U+FB02>uence of forces that possess a force-function or ergal,
  move in a stationary manner.             In order to determine the posi
  tion taken by the points at the time t, rectangular coordinates,
  or polar coordinates, or other suitable quantities can be employed.
  We will admit universally for this purpose the introduction of
  arbitrary variables, which may be denoted by q,, qg, . . . (1,. Then
  the ergal U is also to be considered as a function of these vari
  ables.      Further, according to Lagrange, the vis viva T of the

    We may now suppose that another, in<U+FB01>nitesimally different
stationary motion takes the place of the one previously considered.
The difference may be occasioned either                       by
                                                 the initial positions
and velocities of the points not being precisely identical with
those in the original motion, or by the function U, representing
the ergal, having     slightly different form.
                        a                         In order to express
the latter more simply, we will assume that the function           con                  U
tains, besides the variables q,, 9,,     q", also one or more quan

tities which are constant during each of the two motions, but
have not quite the same values in the one motion as in the other.
The primitive values may be designated                            by
                                                  cl, 0,, &c., and the

    If we now suppose the mean value of the ergal to be formed
during each of the two motions, one of these two mean values                                     is
somewhat different from the other; and we call their difference
the variation of the mean ergal.      It this variation which        to                     is
be determined by my equation, as                     it is

be <U+FB01>rst presupposed that both in the original and in the altered

increases that it is sensible only in proximity to the side ; while
it may be neglected at greater distances, and especially in the
centre of the parallelepipedal space.
    In order to determine the position of the point, let rec
tangular coordinates 2,, .2'2, $3, be introduced, the origin of
which coincides with the centre of the parallelepipedon, and their
directions are parallel to its edges.
     If
      we now consider any one of the coordinates (which may be
designated by a: without index), and if 0 denote the distance of
the two sides perpendicular to this coordinate’s direction from
the centre, the distances of the movable point from these'two
 sides will be c—a' and c+ar.      The forces exerted by the two

one coordinate-direction      depends only on that coordinate and
not on the two others, we can again, as in the former case, con
sider the motion in each of the directions separately.      further              A
simpli<U+FB01>cation    results from the fact that, on account of the
smallness of the factor a" with every position of the point, we

   § 8. In order now to form those differential coe<U+FB02>icients of k, h,
and h—w with which we have to do in the theorem of the mean
ergal (of which we select h for consideration <U+FB01>rst), we must in
quire in what relation the two partial differential coef<U+FB01>cients ob
tained when h is represented asafunction u and 0 stand to those
which are obtained when h is exhibited as a function of w and c.
I  wish, however, to premise a few remarks on the notation.
   In cases like the present, where a quantity is represented as
a function of mm variables, while, from the nature of the subject,
we do not always employ the same two, but sometimes change
the variables, and where, consequently, partial differential coef<U+FB01>
cients occur which only differ from one another by the fact that
the quantity which in the differentiation was presupposed con
stant is different in one of them from what it is in another, it is
convenient to indicate this in the formula, in order that it may
not be necessary always to state it verbally.                  I
                                                     have therefore,
in a previous memoir*, used a notation which is also adopted by
various other authors in treating the same subject; that                             is,I
have added as an index the quantity which in the differentiation
is regarded as constant.     The external form, however, in which
this was done can be simpli<U+FB01>ed           if,
                                     instead of putting the index
with the entire differential coef<U+FB01>cient (in which case the latter
must be enclosed in brackets, and also confusion may arise with
other indices possibly occurring in this place, unless the index
be furnished with      distinguishing mark), we put
                       a                                  with the it                   d
in its numerator; and this        the form in which we will here
                                    is
employ that notation.
   If, for example, the quantity       regarded, <U+FB01>rst, as function
                                         h   is                          a

              c                                     (when u0    con          is
sidered    constant), and, second, as
             a                             function of w and
                                                  a              and             c
so differentiated according to      (when w
                                         a        considered
                                                      is        con          a

   When the construction of the sensitive <U+FB01>lm is taken into
account, the cause of irradiationtor blurring of the image) is
not far to seek.
    It is these small particles that cause the <U+FB01>lm to be translucent
 and prevent its being transparent.                Where there is transparency
 there must be a scattering of the incident rays.
    These particles are quite measurable; hence we, cannot treat
 the question as if they were small fractions of a wave-length.              In
 fact they are several times larger in diameter than the greatest
 wave-length ; and as we have to deal with the smaller wave
 lengths, we may treat the question as a case of simple geometrical
 re<U+FB02>ection.     At any rate, the dispersion caused would not inter
 fere with the general result.
    The physical forms which the particles take are not quite ap
 parent.     Being in an amorphous state, it will not be unfair to
 assume that they are generally of the shape of a spheroid.                 For
 the sake of calculation, we may also assume that each particle
 re<U+FB02>ects a de<U+FB01>nite proportion of light.                 This hypothesis will be
 found not to affect the aspect of the problem, if the refracted
 rays be traced after transmission through the sphere, in a similar
 manner to that in which it is proposed to trace the re<U+FB02>ected
 rays.    In any case it is only assumed that an approximate solu
 tion can be obtained.
     Let us consider the action of one particle, and, for the sake of
 simplicity, let us take it to be one in contact with the surface of
 the glass plate on which the <U+FB01>lm rests.                    The case where the
 minimum irradiation will be produced is that in which the inci
 dent ray falls perpendicularly on the surface. First, on these by
 potheses let us examine the intensity and duration of the light
 that would fall on the plate.
    As the general direction of the light is perpendicular to the
surface, it is evident that by far the largest proportion of it must
fall in the same direction on the particle under consideration.

           for each angle less than the critical angle, we get the curve which
           bounds the shaded part of the <U+FB01>gure.          The area between the
           two curves shows the amount that would pass through.             The
           refractive index   has been taken as 1'5.
              An examination of the <U+FB01>gure shows that if a ray of light fall
           on the <U+FB01>lm, on development a ring might be formed round
           the image at a distance from it equal to 2t cot x, where x is the
           critical angle ,' on the inside it would be shaded off more abruptly
           than on the outside.      If then a cylindrical pencil of rays strike
           a <U+FB01>lm perpendicular to its surface, a similar detached annulus
           would result, provided the diameter were <2t cot x.

Magazine for September 1874,                I
                                obtained two curves which, when
                                           Fig.   3.
the sun’s diameter was taken into account, as also the irradiation
due to the cause which        I shall presently explain, gave a near
coincidence to that obtained by this theor . It should be noted
that the image obtained on the bottom <U+FB01>lm was that due to the
light refracted and not re<U+FB02>ected.       In the <U+FB01>lms employed, about
9-“; of the actinic rays were transmitted through the <U+FB01>rst plate, and
the amount of re<U+FB02>ection from the sensitive <U+FB01>lm itself was nearly

     (iv) With dry plates    I  also made other experiments.        cut              I
small holes and slits in platinum foil.       Placing these in contact
with the 'plate,       was exposed to direct sunlight.

former, the rings were obtained as before; with the latter,
parallel lines joined with semicircles.          This gave suf<U+FB01>cient
evidence that nothing in the lens used in (i), (ii), and (iii) could
cause the effects produced.

though the plane of maximum re<U+FB02>ection will not pass through
the centre of the particle. Thelight re<U+FB02>ected horizontally would

where z is the distance along the <U+FB01>lm measured from the point
of incidence.
    If the relative effect on the sensitive <U+FB01>lm could be represented
by IT, where T is the length of exposure, then it would be easy
to calculate exactly the distance to which the irradiation from
this cause would extend. Experiment has shown that this simple
relation does not hold good, the practical results having been
giVen in the above-quoted paper.         There it will be seen that the
shorter the exposure the less proportional irradiation there must
be.     If, however, we take this relation to hold good, the effects
of irradiation in any example we may work will be in excess of
the truth.      In the experiment           was found that the limit

     the light from the sky.      The sky-light would also equally
 act on that part of the <U+FB01>lm which would be affected          the light          by
 scattered parallel to the plate. The thickness of the <U+FB01>lm was '004:
 inch     hence #:750 nearly for each inch.

    From other experiments taking images on opaque surfaces,                              it
 was found that, with similar exposure and under similar con—
 ditions, the extent of developable irradiation was nearly "005.
    By taking the mean intensity of the light passing through
 the <U+FB01>lm, we can <U+FB01>nd approximately the proportion of light
 which      scattered parallel
              is                  surfaces to that re<U+FB02>ected from the

cient of absorption is so large.     In the case of the late Transit
of Venus this has an important hearing, as the actinic intensity
of the sun diminishes from the centre to the limb, the highest
estimate given for it being from about 1 to 111-.       The increase
in diameter of the sun and decrease in that of Venus will be
measurably the same.
   To diminish irradiation due to the <U+FB01>rst cause pointed out, three
methods are open :--<U+FB01>rst, to coat the back of the plate with
some non-actinic colour ; secondly, to increase the opacity of the
<U+FB01>lm ; thirdly, to connect the particles of bromo-iodide of silver
with a body of as nearly as possible the same density. The <U+FB01>rst
is the usual method adopted by photographers in dry-plate pro
cesses.    This diminishes the irradiation from the back of the
plate,  but does not completely eliminate           it,
                                                as will be understood
when the nature of the resulting re<U+FB02>ection         considered.
                                                          is      The
second method    is easily carried out, and      more effective than
                                                    is
the <U+FB01>rst method.      The last    aplan adopted in certain dry-plate
                                   is
processes. With albumen preservative particularly, the amount
of irradiation   is  reduced materially,    even though the <U+FB01>lm
appears nearly transparent.      One  other method may be noticed,
viz. staining the collodion itself with an adiaetinic colour. This
does not seem to commend itself, as the sensitiveness of the plate
must be reduced in proportion to its e<U+FB02>icacy.
   To diminish irradiation due to the second cause, Nos.                      1,   2,
& 3  methods are effective.

                                    believe has not .published, the
fact that irradiation  is most marked at     distance corresponding

VIII.   On an Apparatus to illustrate the Formation                  of   Volcanic

      SHORT      time ago   Ispent some weeks in Central France,
        and had many opportunities of studying the character of
the volcanic cones which are so abundant in that district.       The
many sections of these cones that may be seen at Graveneire
and other places, where the scoriae     obtained for industrial pur
                                           is

truth and simplicity of the theory accounting for their forma
tion.   The theory     so obviously correct that
                      is                              has not, so far

     Soon after my return I tried an experiment at some Iron-works
to make such a cone.          A large sheet of iron with a hole in the
centre was placed over a pipe proceeding from the blast.                  A
quantity of cinders and ashes were supplied to the pipe, and in a
short time a cone was built up.         For the purpose of lecture-illus
tration the apparatus about to be described is convenient, and
shows very clearly the formation of volcanic cones.            It consists
of a wooden trough about 18 inches long, with sloping sides; at
the bottom of the trough there is a bladed screw to carry forward
the ashes, sawdust, or other material used, to an opening through
which air from a powerful bellows is forced upward in a vertical
stream.      A board 3 or 4 feet square with a hole in the centre is
placed over the air-jet, so that on turning the screw the sawdust
is carried into the stream of air; it is then thrown vertically up
ward through the hole in the upper board, and on falling down
builds up a cone having many of the peculiarities of a natural
Onc.     Thus, the angle of slope is almost identical 5 the sorting
 of materials is similar, the heaviest portions being near the
 crater, while the'<U+FB01>ner particles and dust are carried to a great
 distance.     If, while the miniature eruption is going on, the oxy
 hydrogen light be directed horizontally on to the cone, it will be
 seen that the dust is carried to a distance of many feet.           Using
 alternately sawdust of different colours, the structure of the cone
 is well seen on making a section of it.         This is easily done by
 cutting vertically through the cone with a sheet of cardboard
 and sweeping off one half of the mound into a tray.             If the jet
 of air be vertical and the air of the room is still, the lip of the
 crater is horizontal; but if the apparatus be near the door or
 where there is a draught, the materials are carried to one side,
 and the cone is built up much higher on one side than the other.
 The same thing, of course, will occur if the jet is not vertical;
 and as from accidental circumstances the jet frequently changes
 its direction, a considerable variety of cones is sure to be obtained
in a series of experiments.

       IX.   On Friction and Heat-conduction in rare<U+FB01>ed Gases.

            knowledge of the properties of gaseous bodies has of

54           MM. A. Kundt            and   E. Warburg   on   Friction
vered by Maxwell, in regard to the friction, conduction of heat,
and diffusion of gases, have been con<U+FB01>rmed by the experiments
of Maxwell, 0. E. Meyer, Loschmidt, Stefan.        Only with respect
to the absolute value of the coef<U+FB01>cient of heat-conduction of air
as calculated by Maxwell does a deviation appear, according to
Boltzmann; but the law that this coef<U+FB01>cient is independent of
the pressure has been experimentally proved by Stefan betWeen
% and 1 atmosphere.
                         The con<U+FB01>dence excited by these results
has induced us to pursue the theory to further consequences.
   As is well known, so far as it has yet been worked out, this
theory necessarily presupposes that the so-called mean length of
path of the molecules is a quantity that may be neglected against
the linear dimensions of the space <U+FB01>lled with the gas.        But as
the mean length of path is inversely proportional to the density,
that is equivalent to saying that the density of the gas in a given
space must not be too little.    We do not know that the theory
has yet been developed for cases in which the above supposition
falls ; the experiments have always been so arranged that it holds
good.     The aim of our investigation (of which We take leave to
lay the following brief abstract of the results before the Academy)
is to trace the properties of gases beyond the limits of density
mentioned.
                                      Friction.
   Let us <U+FB01>rst consider the following simple case. A layer of air
of the thickness d is between two solid plane partitions, of which
the one is at rest, while the other moves with the velocity u".
When the gas is more and more rare<U+FB01>ed, the mean length of
path I more and more increases; an easy calculation shows that
the gas of the layer has still sensibly the same properties in
regard to friction as the same gas in thicker layers, so long as
     f-l<    Up to that point the retarding force exerted upon the
moved partition will be, to    thousandth part of its value, con
                                      a
stant, and, as calculation shows, rapidly diminish when the cor
responding degree of rarefaction             is
                                     exceeded.
   We are here struck           by
                           an apparent contradiction to this result
of the theory        for we found that      even when    5,:     33—0,       perceptible

diminution of the retarding forces commences, becoming greater
as the pressure diminishes.   The contradiction, however,    only                is
apparent; the phenomena     observed may be  deduced from (a pro
position which we have derived from the theory. viz. that there
is sliding of gas on solid partition, and that the coef<U+FB01>cient of
                 a          a
sliding    inversely proportional to the pressure.
            is
   Indeed the velocity uo of the layer of gas adjacent to the moved

partition is equal to the mean velocity of translation of the mole
cules passing through it in both directions.        But one half of
these come from the partition, and have consequently a mean
velocity of translation iu'o ; the other half come from the inte
 rior of the gas, and therefore have a mean velocity of translation
 <u'o.   Consequently uo<u'0.
    A closer investigation, to be given in detail in another place,
 has led to the following results.
    1. The sliding-coef<U+FB01>cient for a gas and a solid partition has
 sensibly a determined value dependent on the nature of the gas,
 so long as the latter is present in layers thicker than fourteen
 times the mean length of path; and it is inversely proportional
 to the pressure.
    2. The absolute value of the sliding-coef<U+FB01>cient is obtained by
 admitting that the gas-molecules are reflected from the partition
 with its velocity of translation, to 1'4 5,—consequentlywfor air,

 namely, in round numbers, to 00001
 we may conclude that on the collision              of the molecules with the
 partition the velocities of translation of the two are not perfectly
 balanced. By means of this value,           easy to satisfy ourselves
                                               it   is
 that in Maxwell and Meyer’s experiments the effect of the sliding
cannot have become sensible.
    Our experiments on friction were conducted according to
Maxwell’s method; for we measured the logarithmic decrement
of the torsional vibrations executed            by
                                           disk between two <U+FB01>xed

disk (diameter. 159 millims., weight     61‘!)  grammes) so small
that it  was borne   bytwo very thin silver wires (diam. =O'0630
millim.)   in
            a  bi<U+FB01>lar suspension, we succeeded in making the dis
turbing damping moments so slight that they might be neglected:
with the smallest decrements measured they only amounted to
a little over1  per cent., and with nearly all the measurements
employed for   calculations much less than     per cent., of the total
                                                         1

   Passing now to the experiments which were made for testing
the above theory, we remark that the chief dif<U+FB01>culty in them
consisted in placing in       given space gases of small density as
                                           a
pure as possible.    It was soon found that here nothing could be
effected with eaoutchouc connexions         and hence all the junc   ;
tions used were made of glass; while, in order to secure the ap
paratus against fracture                         by
                                 expansion of the glass, at suitable
places thick, wide,  elastic,  glass tubes bent in three directions at
right angles   to one   another    were inserted, which gave to the

     A glance at these Tables shows, <U+FB01>rst, that, in accordance with
the theory  of sliding, the less the thickness of the layer of air
engaged in friction, the greater is the decrease per cent. of the
logarithmic decrement with the pressure fora given gas. Further,

   To test these laws, we calculated one set of series of experi

   On proceeding, further, to investigate the laws of gas-friction
below the before-mentioned                    limit of rarefaction                            ,       we
could not succeed, even with the most careful drying, in remo
ving with suf<U+FB01>cient       completeness the last traces of aqueous
vapour,   which,  insensible  in the above eXperiments, with the low
pressures here employed distorted the results.         The presence of
aqueous vapour was shown inter alia                       by
                                              this—that the damping
moment for       vacuum (so we name
                      a                      space <U+FB01>lled with
                                                          a      gas of                   a

           a         pressure  mixed  with  vapour)  rose considerably
when the apparatus was left to itself.          This arose from water
separating   from   the solid parts and evaporating into the vacuum.
In consequence of this, the theory cannot be quantitatively tested
on the results obtained.        Nevertheless the following series of
experiments shows how far we were able to reduce the loga
rithmic decrement                   by

by  traces of gaseous matter.
                                     Heat-conduction.
     If   we contemplate       the simplest case of heat-conduction, in
which     a      layer of gas without weight     included between two
                                                          is

                 and Heat-conduction in rare<U+FB01>ed             Gases.             59
plane solid sides having the constant temperatures 0 and t, we
see that, if with decreasing density the mean length of path in
 creases, the heab<U+FB02>ow must here change according to laws similar
 to those which govern the retarding force in friction.         As in
 friction the velocities, so here the temperatures of a partition and
  the contiguous layer of gas differ by a <U+FB01>nite value.     A diminu
  tion, therefore, of the heat-<U+FB02>ow   must at <U+FB01>rst  appear, as soon as
   this difference of temperature commences to exert a perceptible
   action.    On further rarefaction a point is reached from which,
   onward, the idea of a coef<U+FB01>cient of heat-conduction loses its
   meaning, and the <U+FB02>ow of heat rapidly decreases as the density is
  diminished.
    A   comprehensive                  testing of these consequences
                             experimental
  has hitherto   not               with the apparatus we have em—
                       been possible
  ployed.    We have, however, succeeded here in doing approxi
  mately what we could not in the case of friction—namely, to
  produce a space which may be regarded as an actual vacuum in
  relation to heat-conduction.     This made it possible, also, to se
  parate the effects of conduction and radiation.
     In order to measure the <U+FB02>ow of heat through a gas, we ob
  served (like Dulong and Petit) the cooling of thermometers of
  various forms in glass cases of different shapes at 0°. With
  higher pressures the action of pure heat-conduction is defaced
  by the action of the currents formed, in consequence of gravity,
  in the unequally heated gas. But when the pressure is lessened
  the velocity is increased with which, under given conditions,
  thermometric equilibrium is restored ; and therewith the in<U+FB02>u
  ence of currents recedes.      Thus, for a spherical thermometer,
  cooled in a spherical glass envelope, the time of cooling (from
  60° to 20°) between 10 millims. and                  l
                                               millim. mercury-pres
  sure is independent    of  the  latter; on  the  contrary, with 150
  millims. it was once and a half as great'as with 750 millims.
  The values obtained between 10 millims. and l millim. mercury—
  pressurc illustrate, on the one hand, the independence of the
  coef<U+FB01>cient of heat-conduction of the pressure within those limits,
  and, on the other, can be utilized for calculating that coef<U+FB01>cient.

  experiments, sensibly less   than  the  theoretic one.
    The absolute conduction-coef<U+FB01>cients of gases could only be
 approximately calculated, as we could procure only an approxi
 mate knowledge of the water-value of our thermometer.              Using
 this approximate value, we <U+FB01>nd the conduction-coef<U+FB01>cient of air
 equal to {-‘11 of that obtained      M. Stefan.by
    We will now describe how we succeeded in making the'space
 of the cooling-apparatus employed approximately avacuum with
 respect to the conduction of heat.
    It appeared at <U+FB01>rst that the time of cooling of thermometer,                  a
ifa   vacuum    is produced in the well-dried cooling-space, dimi
 nishes with time when the apparatus            left to itself.

ample, in one experiment, in twelve hours                 fell from 351     it
 seconds to 307 (in which times the thermometer sank from 60°
 to 20°).   The traces of aqueous vapour which cause this may
 partly proceed from the fat of the cock; but they are partly
discharged from the glass sides; for the discharge can be acce
lerated    by heating parts of the latter.        By such heating we
were able to lessen the time of cooling in another exhausted ap-‘
 paratus from 282 to 264 seconds.
    The quantities of aqueous vapour in question are extraordi
narily small, and not to be indicated                        by

    We thence     concluded that, in these vacua, the quantities
 of heat abstracted from the thermometer proceeded almost ex
 clusively from radiation.      It is true it follows from the gas—
 theory that, from certain degrees of rarefaction onwards, the
 quantity of heat conducted is dependent only on the num
ber of the molecules in the unit of space, and independent of the
 dimensions of the cooling-space; but with such degrees of rare
 faction that quantity of heat is an extremely small fraction of
 that carried over with normal pressures.
    We purpose to utilize such vacua for the determination of
 the absolute emissive power of black bodies and the depend
 ence of its value on the temperature.
    Using the water-value of our thermometer (to be sure only
 approximately ascertained), from our experiments up to this
 time a value of the emissive power of glass is obtained which
 nearly agrees with that ascertained by M. Lebnebach* ; for
 many reasons, however, we lay no stress on this accordance.
     On the dependence of emissive power on temperature We
 possess the law of Dulong and Petit, according to which its
 value is proportional to a', where a, referred to Centigrade,

         the Refraction of Sound by the Atmosphere.” By Professor
“ON Osborne Reynolds*.
   My object in this paper_is to o<U+FB01>er explanations of some of the
more common phenomena of the transmission of sound, and to
describe the results of experiments in support Of these explanations.
The <U+FB01>rst part of the paper is devoted to the action of wind upon
sound.                                  I
          In this part of the subject <U+FB01>nd that Ihave been preceded
by Professor Stokes, who in 1857 gave precisely the same expla
nation as that which occurred to me.          I  have, however, succeeded
in placing the truth of this explanation upon an experimental basis;
and this, together with the fact that my work upon this part of
the subject is the cause and foundation of what 1 have to say on
the second part, must be my excuse for introducing it here.               In
the second part of the subject      I have dealt with the e<U+FB01>ect of the
atmosphere to refract sound upwards, an e<U+FB01>ect which is due to the
variation of temperature, and which           I  believe has not hitherto
been noticed.     I  have been able to show that this refraction ex—
plains the well-known di<U+FB01>erence which exists in the distinctness
of sounds by day and by night, as well as other differences in the
transmission of sound arising out of circumstances such as tem
perature ; and    I  have applied it in particular to explain the very
de<U+FB01>nite results obtained by Professor Tyndall inhis experiments off

                     The Effect of Wind upon Sound
is a matter of common observation.            Cases have been known in
which, against a high wind, guns could not be heard at a distance of
550 yardsj", although on a quiet day the same guns might be
heard from ten to twenty miles. And it is not only with high
winds that the effect upon sound is apparent; every sportsman
knows how important it is to enter the <U+FB01>eld on the lee side even

             the Refraction     of Sound   by the Atmosphere.                       63
when the wind is very light.          In light winds, however, the e<U+FB01>ect
is not so certain as in high winds ; and (at any rate so far as our
ears are concerned) sounds from a small distance seem at times
to be rather intensi<U+FB01>ed than diminished against very light winds.
 On all occasions the e<U+FB01>ect of wind seems to be rather against
 distance than against distinctness.         Sounds heard to windward
are for the most part heard with their full distinctness ; and there
is only a comparatively small margin between that point at which
 the sound is perceptibly diminished and that at which it ceases to
be audible.
     That sound should be blown back by a high wind does not at
 <U+FB01>rst sight appear to be unreasonable.           Sound is known to travel
 forward through or on the air; and if the air is itself in motion,
 moving backwards, it will carry the sound with           it,
                                                           and so retard its
 forward motion—just as the current of         a   river retards the motion
 of ships moving up the stream.          A little consideration, however,
 serves to show that the effect of wind on sound cannot be ex
 plained inthis way. The velocity of sound (1100 feet per second)
is     so great compared with that of the highest wind (50 to 100
 feet per second), that the mere retardation of the velocity,            that if
  were all, would not be apparent.            The sound would proceed
  against the wind with    a  slightly diminished velocity, at least 1000
  feet per second, and with    a  but very slightly diminished intensity.
      Neither can the eifect of wind be solely due to its eifect on our
  hearing.      There can be no doubt that during            high wind our
                                                               a
  power of hearing  is   damaged; but this    is  the same from whatever
  direction the sound may come; and hence from this cause the
  wind would diminish the distance at which sounds could be heard,
  whether they moved with       it or against  it, whereas this     most di
                                                                         is
   stinctly not the case.    Sounds at right angles to the wind are but
   little affected by it; and in moderate winds sounds can be heard
   further with the wind than when there       is  none.
      The same may be said against theories which would explain the
   effect of wind as causing        aheterogeneous     nature in the air so
  thatit    might re<U+FB02>ect the sound. All such effects must apply with
   equal force with and against the wind.
      This question has battled investigators for so long time because
                                                                   a
   they have looked for the cause in some direct e<U+FB01>ect of the motion
   of the air, Whereasit   seems to be but incidentally due to this.      The
   eifect appears, after all, not to be due simply to the wind, but to
   the diiference in the velocity with which the air travels at the sur
   face of the ground and at    a  height above it. That        to say,
                                                                   is      we   if
   could have   a  perfectly smooth surface which would not retard the
   wind at all, then the wind would not obstruct sound in the way                    it
   does, for
           it    would all be moving with an equal velocity; but, owing
   to the roughness of the surface and the obstructions upon            there it,

    ture of the surface; for instance, in     a   meadow the velocity at             1
    foot above the surface     is only half what     it    at an elevation of
                                                          is

641             Royal Sociely :—Prof. Reynolds        on
8 feet, and smaller     still compared with what it is at greater
heights.
    To understand the way in which this variation in the velocity
affects the sound, it is necessary to consider that the velocity of
the waves of sound does depend on the velocity of the wind,
although not in a great degree.        To <U+FB01>nd the velocity of the sound
with the wind we must add that of the wind to the normal velo
city of sound, and against the wind we must subtract the velocity
of the wind from the 1100 feet per second (or whatever may be
the normal velocity of the sound) to <U+FB01>nd the actual velocity.
Now, if the wind is moving at 10 feet per second at the sur
face of a meadow, and at 20 feet per second at a height of 8 feet,
the velocity of the sound against the wind will be 1090 feet
per second at the surface and 1080- feet per second at 8 feet
above the surface; so that in a second the same wave of sound
will have travelled 10 feet further at the surface than at a height
of 8 feet. This difference of velocity would cause the wave to tip
up and 'proceed in an upward direction instead of horizontally.
For if we imagine the front of a wave of sound to be vertical to
start with, it will, after proceeding for one second against the wind,
be inclined at an angle of more than 45°, or half a right angle; and
since sound-waves always move in a direction perpendicular to the
direction of the front (that is to say, if the waves are vertical they
will move horizontally and not otherwise), after one second the
wave would be moving upwards at an angle of 45° or more. Of
course, in reality, it would not have to proceed for one second
before it began to move upwards : the least forward motion would
be followed by an inclination of the front backwards, and by an
upward motion of the wave.          A similar eifect would be produced
in a direction opposite to that of the wind, only as the top of the
wave Would then be moving faster than the bottom, the waves
would incline forwards and move downwards.               In this way the
e<U+FB01>ect of the wind is to lift the waves which proceed to wind
ward, and to bring those down which move with it.
    Thus the effect of wind is not to destroy the sound, but to raise
the ends of the wave, which would otherwise move along the ground,
to such a height that they pass over our heads.
    When the ends of the waves are raised from the ground they
will tend to diverge down to it, and throw 0E secondary waves, or,
as    Ishall call them, diverging waves, so as to reconstitute the gap
that is thus made.        These secondary waves will be heard as a
continuation of the sound, more or less faint, after the primary
waves are altogether above our heads.          [This phenomenon of di
vergence    presents  many   dif<U+FB01>culties, and  has  only as yet been dealt
with for particular cases.        It may, however, be assumed, from
 what is known respecting     it,  that in the case of sound being lifted
 up from the ground      by   refraction, or, what  is    nearly the same
 thing, passing directly over the crest of     a   hill so that the ground
 falls away from the rays of sound, diverging waves would be
 thrown 0E very rapidly at <U+FB01>rst and for considerable distance, de

pending on the wave-length of the sound; but as the sound pro
ceeds further the diverging rays would gradually become fainter
and more nearly parallel to the direct rays, until at a. sufficient
distance they would practically cease to exist, or, at any rate, be
no greater than those which cause the diifraction-bands in a pencil
of light“.   The divergence would introduce bands of diifraction or
interference within the direct or geometrical path of the sound, as
in the case of light.   These eifects would also be complicated by
the re<U+FB02>ection of the diverging waves from the ground, which, cross
ing the others at a. small angle, would also cause bands of inter
ference. The results of all these causes would be very complicated,
 but their general e<U+FB01>ect would be to cause a rapid weakening of
the sound at the ground from the point at which it was <U+FB01>rst
lifted; and as the sound became weaker it would be crossed by
bands of still fainter sound, after which the diverging rays,_as well
as the direct rays, would be lifted, and at the ground nothing would
be heard—September 1874.]
    If we leave out of consideration the divergence, then we may
 form some idea as to the path which the bottom of the sound, or
 the rays of sound (considered as the rays of light), would follow.
 If the variation in the speed of the wind were uniform from the
 surface upwards, then the rays of sound would at <U+FB01>rst move up
 wards, very nearlydn circles. The radii of these circles may be
shown to be 1100 X                  ,   where   v,   and o, are the velocities of the
                            v l —o 2
wind in feet per second at elevations diifering by feet.          In fact,
                                                                   72.
however, the variation        greatest at the ground, and diminishes
                                 is
as we proceed upwards, so that the actual path would be more that
of parabola.
    a
    Also, owing to this unequal variation in the velocity, those parts
of the waves immediately adjacent to the ground                 rise more
rapidly than the part immediately above       them;  hence  there will be
a  crowding of the waves at few       feet
                                        a   from  the  ground, and this
will lead toan intensifying     of  the  sound   at this point.    Hence,
notwithstanding   the   divergence,   we   might   expect the   waves   to
windward to preserve their full intensity so long as they were low
enough to be heard.        And this       in accordance with the fact,
                                                is

often observed, that sounds at short distances are not diminished
but rather intensi<U+FB01>ed when proceeding against the wind.
   It will at once be perceived that by this action of the wind the
distance to which sounds can be heard to windward must depend
on the elevation of the observer and the soundeproducing body.

    direction in which   I  could hear small sounds most distinctly, should
    yet be suf<U+FB01>cient to cover one’s approach to partridges, and more
    particularly to rabbits, even until one was within a few feet of them
    -—a fact which shows how much more effectively the wind obstructs
    sound near the ground than even a few feet above it.
       Elevation, however, clearly o<U+FB01>ered a crucial test whether such an
   action as that    I have described was the cause of the effect of wind
   upon sound. Having once entertained the idea, it was clearly
   possible to put it to the test in this way. Also, if the principles
   hold in sound, something analogous must hold in the case of waves
   on the surface of a running stream of water—for instance, waves
   made near the bank of a river.
       I had just reached the point of making such tests when              I  dis—
   covered that the same views had been propounded by Professor
   Stokes so long ago as 1857 *. Of course, after such a discovery,
'
   it seemed almost unnecessary for me to pursue the matter further;
   but as there were one or two points about which               I  was not then
   quite certain, and as Prof. Stokes’s paper does not appear to be
   so well known as it might be (I do not know of one writer on
   sound who has adopted this explanation), it still seemed that it
   might be well, if possible, to put the subject on an experimental
   basis.   I  therefore made the experiments         I am about to describe;
   and   I am glad that     I did not rest content without them, for they
   led me to what    I  believe to be the discovery of refraction of sound
    by  the atmosphere.
      The results of my <U+FB01>rst observation are shown in <U+FB01>g. 1. This

  from a point near the bank of a stream about 12 feet wide.                 Had
  the water been at rest there would have been semicircular rings;
  as it was, the front of the waves up the stream made an obtuse

  waves, it will be observed, gradually died out, showing the effect of
  divergence. The waves proceeding down the stream were, on the
  other hand, inclined to the wall, which they approached.
      I  was able to make a somewhat better observation in the Med
  lock, near the Oxford Road Bridge, Manchester.                  A pipe sent a

   My    apparatus consisted of an electrical bell, mounted on                         a   case
containing battery. The bell was placed horizontally on the top
             a

    These experiments were made on four different days, the 6th,

very light, on the  others     was  moderately strong, strongest on

which gave additional interest to the experiments, inasmuch as                               it
enabled me to compare the effect of different surfaces. On the

 could be heard furthest in this direction.    His method of experi
 menting, however, was not the same as mine. He compared the
  sounds from two equal bells, and in all cases placed the bells at
  such distances that the sounds were equally distinct.        on the             I,

  could be heard, the test being whether or not the observer noticed

68               Royal Socieiy :—-Prof. Reynolds         on
a break   in the continuity of sound, a stoppage of the bell. The
difference in our method of experimenting accounts for the di<U+FB01>er
ence in our results.   I  found in every case that the sound could be
heard further with the wind than at right angles to its direction;
and when the wind was at all strong, the range with the wind was
more than double that at right angles. It does not follow, however,
nor was the fact observed, that at comparatively short distances
the sound with the wind Was more intense than at right angles.
    The explanation of this fact, which was fully borne out by all
 the experiments, is that the sound which comes in immediate con—
 tact with the ground is continually destroyed by the rough surface,
 and the sound from above is continually diverging down to replace
 that which has been destroyed. These diverging waves are in their
 turn destroyed; so that there is a gradual weakening of the in
 tensity of the waves near the ground, and this weakening extends
 upwards as the waves proceed.       Therefore, under ordinary circum
 stances, when there is no Wind the distant sounds which pass
 above us are more intense than those which we hear.            Of this fact
 I have abundant evidence.      On the 6th, when       the  wind  was light,
 at all distances greater  than 20  yards   from   the  bell the sound  was
 much less at the ground than a few feet above it; and           I was able
 to recover the sound after it had been lost in every direction by
 mounting on to a tree, and even more de<U+FB01>nitely by raising the bell
 on to a post 4 feet high, which had the effect of doubling the
 range of the sound in every direction except with the wind,
 although even in this the range. was materially increased.
    It is obvious that the rate at which the sound is destroyed by
 the ground will depend on the roughness of its surface.               Over
 grass we might expect the sound at the ground to be annihilated,
 whereas over water it would hardly be affected.           This was shown
 to be the case by the diiference in the range at right angles to the
  wind over grass, and over the same ground when completely covered
 with snow. In the latter case         I  could hear the sound at 200
 yards,  whereas  I could  only hear  it at  7 O or 80 in the former.
    Now, owing to the fact that the sound is greater over our heads
 than at the ground, any thing which slowly brings down the
 sound will increase the range. Hence, assuming that the action
 of the wind is to bring down the sound in the direction in which
 it is blowing, we see that it must increase its range in this direc
 tion.   And it must also be seen that in this direction there will
 be less diiference in the intensity of the sound from the ground
 upwards than in other directions.          This was observed to be the
 menu all occasions. In the direction of the wind, when it was
 strong, the sound could be heard as well with the head on the
 ground as when raised, even when in a hollow with the bell hidden
 from view by the slope of the ground; and no advantage what
 ever was gained either by ascending to an elevation or raising the
 bell. Thus, with the wind over the grass the sound could be heard
v140 yards, and over snow 360 yards, either with the head lifted or
 on the ground; whereas at right angles to the wind on all occasions
 the range was extended by raising either the observer or the bell.
    It has been necessary to notice these points ; for, as will be

              llze Refraction  of Sound  by the Atmosphere.             69
seen, they bear directly on the question of the effect of elevation
on the range of sound against the wind.
    Elevation was found to affect the range of sound against the
wind in a much more marked manner than at 'right angles.
    Over the grass no sound could be heard with the head on the
ground at 20 yards from the bell, and at 30 yards it was lost with
the head 3 feet from the ground, and its full intensity was lost when
standing erect at 30 yards. At 70 yards, when standing erect, the
 sound was lost at long intervals', and was only faintly heard even
 then ; but it became continuous again when the ear was raised 9
 feet from the ground, and it reached its full intensity at an eleva—
 tion of 12 feet.
    Over the snow similar e<U+FB02>fects were observed at very nearly
                                                                             '
 equal distances.     There was this difference, however, the sound
 was not entirely lost when the head was lowered or even on the
 ground.    Thus at 30 yards     I could still hear a faint sound. Mr.
 Millar could hear this better than      I  could; he, however, experi
 enced the same increase on raising his head.        At 90 yards   I  lost
 the sound entirely when standing on the ground, but recovered it
 again when the car was 9 feet from the ground. Mr. Millar, how-’
 ever, could hear the sound very faintly, and at intervals, at 160
 yards ; but not with his head on the ground. At this point Iwas
 utterly unable to hear it; and even at an elevation of 25 feet          I
 gave it up as hopeless.     However, as Mr. Millar by mounting 10,
 feet higher seemed to hear it very much better,       I again ascended;
 and at an elevation of 33 feet from the ground          I could hear it
 as distinctly as   I  had previously heard it when standing at 90
 yards from the hell.      I  could not hear it 5 feet lower down; so
 that it was the last 5 feet which had brought me into the foot of
 the wave. Mr. Millar experienced the same change in this 5 feet.
 As the sound could now be heard as strong as at a corresponding
 distance with the wind, we thought we had reached the full inten
 sity of the waves. This, however, was not the case ; for the least
 raising of the bell was followed by a considerable intensifying of            I
 the sound ; and when it was raised 6 feet     I could hear each blow of
 the hammer distinctly, although just at that time a brass band was
 playing in the distance.                              I
                               It seemed to me that could hear it as
 distinctly as at 30 yards to leeward of the bell. All these results,
 were repeated on both days with great uniformity.                         I
    When more than 30 yards to the windward of the bell, the'
 raising of the bell was always accompanied by a marked intensi
 fying of the sound, and particularlyover the grass.         I could only
 hear the bell at 70 yards when on the ground; yet when set on
 a post 5 feet high     I heard it 160 yards, or more than twice the
 distance. This is a proof of what       I previously pointed out, that
 the waves rise faster at the ground than they do high up, and
 crowding together they intensify. In-all cases there was an unmis
takable greater distinctness of the sound from short distances of
windward than to leeward or at right angles.
    Except when the sound was heard with full force it was not
uniform.     The bell gave two sounds (the beats of the hammer and
the ring) which could be easily distinguished; and at times we

70             Royal Society .-—Pr0f. Reynolds                       on
could hear only the ring, and at others the beats. The ring seemed
to preserve itself the longest; whereas near the ground at short
distances the ring was lost <U+FB01>rst. This is explained by the fact that
the rate at which sound—waves diverge depends upon their note :
the lower the note the more will they diverge. Thus the beats
diverge more rapidly than the ring, and consequently die out
sooner; whereas when the head is on the ground near the hell it
is only the diverging waves that are heard, and here the beats
have the best chance. The intensity of the sound invariably seemed
to waver; and as one approached the bell from the windward side,
the sound did not intensify uniformly or gradually, but by <U+FB01>ts or
jerks; this was the result of crossing the rays’ interference, such
as those shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.
   During the observations the velocity of the wind was observed
from time to time at points 1 f00t and 8 feet above the surface.
   On the 9th, that is over grass, it varied from 4 feet per second
at 1 foot and 8 feet per second at 8 feet, to 10 feet at 1 foot and
20 feet at 8 feet, always having about twice the velocity at 8 feet
that it had at 1 foot above the ground.
   Over the snow there was not quite so much variation above and
below. On the 10th the wind varied from 3 feet at 1 foot to 4 feet
at 8 feet *. On the 11th the variation was from 12 at 1 foot and
19 at 8 feet to 6 at 1 foot and 10 at 8 feet.                      Thus over snow the
variation in the velocity was only about one third instead of half.
   Since the foregoing account was written,                     I   have had an oppor
tunity of experimenting on a strong west wind (on the 14th of
March); and the results of these experiments are, if any thing,
more de<U+FB01>nite than those of the previous ones.                         The wind on this
occasion had a velocity of 37 feet per second at an elevation of 12
feet and of 33 at 8 feet and 17 at 1 foot. The experiments were
made in the same meadows as before, the snow having melted, so
that the grass was bare.
   With the wind     I  could hear the bell at 120 yards, either with
the bell on the ground or raised 4 feet above it. At right angles
to the direction of the wind it ranged about 60 yards with the
bell on the ground, and 80 yards when the bell was elevated.
   To windward, with the bell standing on the ground (which, it
must be remembered, means that the bell was actually 1 foot above
the surface), the sound was heard as follows                     :-

and the intensifying of the sounds to windward by the raising of
the bell was even more marked than before; for at 90 yards to_
windward, with the bell raised,           I could hear it much more distinctly
than at a. corresponding distance to leeward. This fact calls for a
 word of special explanation; it is clearly due to the fact that the
 variation in the velocity of the air is much greater near the ground
 than at a few feet above it. When the bell is on the ground all
 the sound must pass near the ground, and will all be turned up to
 a nearly equal extent ; but when the bell is raised, the rays of sound
 which proceed horizontally will be much less bent or turned up than
 those which go down to the ground; and consequently, after pro
 ceeding some distance, these rays will meet or cross, and if the head
 he at this point they will both fall on the ear together, causing a
 sound of double intensity.          It is this crossing of the rays also which
 for the most part causes the interference seen in <U+FB01>g. 2.
    These experiments establish three things with regard to the trans
 mission of sound :—
     1. That when there is no wind, sound proceeding over a rough
 surface is more intense above than below.                                    _
     2. That as long as the velocity of the wind is greater above
 than below, sound is lifted up to windward and is not destroyed.
    3. That under the same circumstances it is brought down to lee
 ward, and hence its range extended at the surface of the ground.
    These experiments also show that there is less variation in the
 velocity of the wind over a smooth surface than over a rough one.
     It seems to me that these facts fully con<U+FB01>rm the hypotheses pro
 pounded by Prof. Stokes, that they place the action of wind beyond
 question, and that they a<U+FB01>ord explanations of many of the anomalous
 cases that have been observed ; for instance, that sounds can be heard
 much further over water than over land, and also that a light wind
 at sea does not appear to affect sound at all, the fact being that the
 smooth water does not destroy either the sound or the motion of the
 air in contact with it. When the wind and sea are rough the case
 is different.
                    The E<U+FB01>'ect of Variations of Temperature.
     Having observed how the wind acts to lift the waves of sound
 by diminishing their velocity above compared with what is below,
 it was evident to me that any other atmospheric cause which
 would diminish the velocity above or increase that below would pro
 duce the same elfect, viz. would cause the waves to rise.
     Such a cause must at certain times exist in the variation in the
 condition of the air as we proceed upwards from the surface.
     Although barometric pressure does not a<U+FB01>ect the velocity of
 sound, yet, as is well known, the velocity of sound depends on the
 temperature *1 and every degree of temperature between 32° and 70°
 adds approximately 1 foot per second to the velocity of sound.
 This velocity also increases with the quantity of m01sture 1n the
 air; but the quantity is at all times too small to produce an appre.
 ciable result.       This vapour nevertheless plays an important part 1n
    *                                  pressure
       It varies as the square root of           and consequently as the square root
                                       density,
 of  the absolute temperature.

72               Royal Society :—Prof. Reynolds            on
the phenomena under consideration; for it gives to the air a much
greater power of radiating and absorbing heat, and thus renders
it much more susceptible of changes in the action of the sun.
   If, then, the air were all at the same temperature and equally sa
turated with moisture, the velocity of sound would be the same at
all elevations; but if the temperature is greater, or if it contains
more water below than above, then the wave of sound will proceed
quicker below than above, and will be turned up in the same way
as against a wind.    This action of the atmosphere is, strictly speak
ing, analogous to the refraction of light.    In light, however, it is
density which retards motion ; temperature and pressure have little
or nothing to do with it; and since the density increases downwards,
the rays of light move slower below than they do above, and are
therefore bent downwards, and ,thus the distance at which we can
see objects is increased.    With sound, however, since it is tempera
ture which a<U+FB01>ects the velocity, the reverse is the case ; the rays
           upwards, and the distance from which we can hear          re       is
 are
 uce bient
       .
     It    well-known fact that the temperature of the air diminishes
          isa
as  we proceed upwards, and that               it   also contains less vapour.
Hence       follows that, as
            it                  a    rule, the waves of sound must travel
faster below than they do above, and thus be refracted or turned
upward.
   The variation of temperature          is, however, by no means constant,
and little consideration serves to show that
       a                                                   it     will be greatest
in   a quiet atmosphere when the sun            is    shining.    The sun’s rays,
acting most powerfully on that air which contains the most vapour,
warms the lower strata more than those above them; and besides
this, they warm the surface of the earth, and this warmth                is   taken
up by   the   air  in contact with it. It      is   not,  however,     only on such
considerations      as  these  that we are    ina    position  to   assert  the law
of variation of atmospheric temperature. Mr. Glaisher has fur
nished us with information on the subject which places                it     beyond

I     extract the following from his “Report on Eight Balloon

                         cloudy states of the sky the temperature of the
air decreased nearly uniformly with the height above the surface of
the earth nearly up to the cloud.                                  _

               the Refraction      of Sound by   the Atmosphere.      73
  We may say, therefore, that when the sky is clear the variation
of temperature      as we proceed upwards from 1 to 3000 feet will
be more than double what it is when the sky is cloudy. And since
for such small variations the variation in the velocity of sound, that
is the refraction, is proportional to the temperature, this refraction
will be twice as great with a clear sky as when the sky is cloudy.
    This is the mean difference, and there are doubtless'exceptional
cases in which the variations are both greater and less than those
 given; during the night the variations are less than during the day,
and again in winter than in summer.
     This reasoning at once suggested an explanation of the well
 known fact that sound are less intense during the day than at night.
 This is a matter of common observation, and has been the subject of
 scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry.     F. De La Roche discusses the subject, and ex
 poses the fallacies of several theories advanced to account for it.
 Amongst others there are some remarks by: Humboldt, in which
 he says that the difference is not due to the quietness of the night,
 for he had observed the same thing near the torrid zone, where the
 day seemed quieter than the night, which was rendered noisy with
 insects.
     It is, however, by the experiments of Prof. Tyndall that this fact
 has been fully brought to light; and‘from their de<U+FB01>nite character
 they afford an opportunity of applying the explanation, and furnish '
 a test of its soundness.
     Neglecting the divergence of the bottom of the waves, a differ
 ence of 1 degree in the 100 feet would cause the rays of sound,
 otherwise horizontal, to move on a circle, the radius of which by
 the previous rule =1100 . l%$1=110,000 feet. A variation of one
 half this would cause them to move on a circle of 220,000 feet
  radius.    From the radii of these circles we can calculate the range
  of the sound from different elevations.
     With a clear sky, i. 0. with a radius 110,000 feet from an eleva
  tion of 235 feet, the sound would be audible with full force to 1'36
  mile ; the direct sound would then be lifted above the surface, and
  only the diverging sound would be audible. From an elevation of
  15 feet, however, the direct sound might be heard to a distance of
  '36, oré mile further, so that in all it could be heard 1'72 (1%) mile.
     With a cloudy sky,       e. with a radius 220,000 feet, the direct
                             2'.
  sound would be heard to 2'4 miles from an elevation of 15 feet, or 1'4
  times what   it   iswith the clear sky. These results have been ob
  tained  by  taking the extreme variations of temperature at the sur
  face of the earth.     At certain times, however, in the evening, or
  when was raining, the variation would be much less than this, in
      it
  which case the direct sound would be heard to much greater dis
tances.

sound, that is, have supposed the edge of the sound to be de<U+FB01>nite,

and not fringed with diverging rays     but, as has been already
                                             ;
explained, the sound would diverge downwards, and from this cause
would be heard to considerable distance beyond the point at which
                         a
the direct rays <U+FB01>rst left the ground. From this point, however,
the sound would become rapidly fainter until       was lost.

 74              Royal Society :—Prof. Reynolds    on
extension which divergence would thus add to the range of the
sound would obviously depend on the refraction—that       is to say,
when the direct rays were last refracted upwards, the extension of
the range due to divergence would be greatest. It is dif<U+FB01>cult to
say what the precise e<U+FB02>ect of this divergence would be; but we may
assume that it would be similar to that which was found in the case
of wind, only the refraction being so much smaller the extension
of the range by divergence would be greater. On the whole the
results calculated from the data furnished by Mr. Glaisher agree
in a remarkable manner with those observed; for if we add 1 mile
for the extension of the range by divergence, the calculated dis
tance with a clear sky would be two miles from a cli<U+FB01> 235 feet
high—September 187 4.]
   Now Prof. Tyndall found that from the cliffs at the South
Foreland, 235 feet high, the minimum range of sound was a little
more than 2 miles, and that this occurred on a quiet July day
with hot sunshine. The ordinary range seemed to be from 3 to 5
miles when the weather was dull, although sometimes, particularly
in the evening, the sounds were heard as far as 15 miles. This
was, however, only under very exceptional circumstances.       Prof.
Tyndall also found that the interposition of a cloud was followed
by an almost immediate extension of the range of the sound.        I
extract the following passages from Prof. Tyndall’s Report :—
   “ On June 2 the maximum range, at <U+FB01>rst only 3 miles, after
wards ran up to about 6 miles.
   “ Optically, June 3 was not at all a promising day; the clouds
were dark and threatening, and the air <U+FB01>lled with a faint haze;
nevertheless the horns were fairly audible at 9 miles. An exceed—
ingly heavy rain-shower approached us at a galloping speed. The
sound was not sensibly impaired during the continuance of the rain.
   “July 3 was a lovely morning: the sky was of a stainless blue,
the air calm, and the sea smooth.     I thought we should be able to
hear a long way olf. We steamed beyond the pier end and listened.
The steam clouds were there, showing the whistles to be active;
the smoke—puffs were there, attesting the activity of the guns.
Nothing was heard. We went nearer ; but at two miles horns and
whistles and guns were equally inaudible.       This, however, being
near the limit of the sound-shadow,      I thought that might have
something to do with the effect, so we steamed right in front of
the station, and halted at 32 miles from it. Not a ripple nor
a breath of air disturbed the stillness on board, but we heard
nothing.    There were the steam-puffs from the whistles, and we
knew that between every two puffs the horn—sounds were em
braced, but we heard nothing.     We signalled for the guns ; there
were the smoke-pu<U+FB01>s apparently close at hand, but not the slightest
sound. It was mere dumb-show on the Foreland.           We steamed
in to 3 miles, halted, and listened with all attention. Neither the
horns nor the whistles sent us the slightest hint of a sound. The
guns were again signalled for; <U+FB01>ve of them were <U+FB01>red, some ele
vated, some <U+FB01>red point-blank at us. Not one of them was heard.
We steamed in to two miles, and had the guns again <U+FB01>red: the

                  the Refraction    0fSouhd by   the Atmosphere.       75
howitzer and mortar with 3—lb. charges yielded the faintest thud,
and the 18-pounder was quite unheard.
  “ In the                                I
                   of these facts stood amazed and confounded ;
              presence
for it   had been assumed    and af<U+FB01>rmed by distinguished men who had
 given special attention to this subject, that a clear, calm atmosphere
 was the best vehicle of sound: optical clearness and acoustic clear
 ness were supposed to go hand in hand         '*    *      .
              I
     “As stood upon the deck of the Irene" pondering this ques—
                                           ‘
 tion,   I became conscious of the exceeding power of the sun beating
 against my back and heating the objects near me.              Beams of
 equal power were falling on the sea, and must have produced copious
 evaporation.     That the vapour generated should so rise and mingle
 with the air as to form an absolutely homogeneou mixture          Icon
 sidered in the highest degree improbable. It would be sure,           I
 thought, to streak and mottle the atmosphere with spaces, in
 which the air would be in different degrees saturated, or it might
 be displaced by the vapour.        At the limiting surfaces of these
spaces, though invisible, we should have the conditions necessary
'to the production of partial echoes, and the consequent waste of
 sound.
     “ Curiously
                  enough, the conditions necessary for the testing of
 this explanation immediately set in. At 3.15 PM. a cloud threw
 itself athwart the sun, and shaded the entire space between us
 and the South Foreland.        The production of vapour was checked
 by the interposition of this screen, that already in the air being at
 the same time allowed to mix with it more perfectly; hence the
 probability of improved transmission.       To test this inference the
 steamer was turned and urged back to our last position of inau
                               I
 dibility. The sounds, as expected, were distinctly though faintly
 heard. This was at 3 miles distance. At 32 miles we had the
 guns <U+FB01>red, both point-blank and elevated.           The faintest thud
 was all that we heard ; but we did hear a thud, whereas we had pre
 viously heard nothing, either here or three quarters of a mile
 nearer. We steamed out to 4% miles, when the sounds were for
 a moment faintly heard, but they fell away as we waited; and
 though the greatest quietness reigned on board, and though the
 sea was without a ripple, we could hear nothing. We could plainly
 see the steam-puffs which announced the beginning and the end
 of a series of trumpet-blasts, but the blasts themselves were quite
 inaudible.
     “ It was now 4 P.M., and
                                 my intention at <U+FB01>rst was to halt at this
  distance, which was beyond the sound-range, but not far beyond       it,
  and see whether the lowering of the sun would not restore the
  power of the atmosphere to transmit the sound. But after waiting
 alittle, the anchoring of boat was suggested; and though 10th
                              a                                        to
  lose the anticipated revival of the sounds myself,      Iagreed to this
  arrangement.     Two men were placed in the boat, and requested to
  give all attention, so as to hear the sound   possible. Wlth perfect
                                                  if
  stillness around them, they heard nothing.        They were then in
  structed to hoist   a signal   they should hear the sounds, and to
                                   if
'keep    ithoisted as long as the sounds continued.
      “ At 4.45 we
                    quitted them and steamed towards the South Sand

  Head light-ship.      Precisely <U+FB01>fteen minutes after we had separated
  from them the <U+FB02>ag was hoisted. The sound, as anticipated, had at
  length succeeded in piercing the body of air between the boat and
  the shore.
      “On returning to our anchored boat, we learned that when the
  <U+FB02>ag was hoisted the horn-sounds were heard, that they were suc
  ceeded after a little time by the whistle-sounds, and that both in
  creased in intensity as the evening advanced.         On our arrival of
  course we heard the sounds ourselves.
   I “The conjectured                     of the stoppage of the sounds
  appeared to be thus explanation
                            re uced to demonstration; but we pushed
  the proof still further by steaming further out. At              miles we
                                                                         5;}

        Steaming   on  to the Varne   lightship,  which     situated  at the
 other end of the Varne shoal, we hailed the master, and were in
 formed by him that up to PM. nothing had been heard. At that
                              5
 hour the sounds began to be audible. He described one of them
 as very gross, resembling the bellowing of bull,’ which very accu—

 At the Varne light-ship, therefore, the sounds had been heard
 towards the close of the day, though              it12% miles from the

      Here we see that the very conditions which actually diminish ed the
 range of the sound were precisely those which would cause the
 greatest lifting of the waves.        And     may be noticed that these
                                              it
 facts were observed       and  recorded  by Prof. Tyndall with his mind
 altogether unbiased with any thought of establishing this hypothe
 sis.    He was looking for an explanation in quite another direction.
 Had    it not been so he would probably have ascended the mast, and
 thus found whether or not the sound was all the time passing
‘over his head.        On the worst day an ascent of 30 feet' should
have     extended   the range nearly  %  mile.

                                                                apparently
 treated as  a   subordinate question by Prof. Tyndall. At the com
 mencement of his lecture, he stated that the instruments were
 mounted on the top and at the bottom of the cliff; and he sub,
 sequently speaks of their being 235 feet above him. He does not,
 however, take any notice of the comparative range of those on the
 top and those at the bottom of the cliif but wherever he men

 tions them he speaks of them as on the cliff, leading me to suppose
 that for some reason those at the bottom of the cli<U+FB01> had been
 abandoned, or that they were less efficient than those above.            If
    am right in this surmise,      the sounds “from below did not range

but of which,I       think, Prof. Tyndall has offered no explanation.

many other phenomena which are explained by this refraction.

Europe.       And although Humboldt gave another explanation *,
which was very reasonable when applied to the particular case at
Orinocoi‘, yet it must be admitted that the circumstances were such
as would cause great upward refraction; and hence there can be
but little doubt that refraction had a good deal to do with the
diminution of the sound by day.
    In fact if this refraction of sound exists, then, according to
Mr. Glaisher’s observations, it must be seldom that we can hear
distant sounds with any thing like their full distinctness, particu*
larly by day; and any elevation in the observer or the source of
the sound above the intervening ground will increase this range
and distinctness, as will also a gentle wind, which brings the
sound down and so counteracts the e<U+FB01>ect of refraction.                          And
hence we have an explanation of the surprising distances to which
sounds can sometimes be heard, particularly the explosion of me
teors, as well as a reason for the custom of elevating church-bells
and sounds to be heard at great distances.—September                  1874.]

 magnet. This can be ascertained by causing the induced current
 to pass for some time within the tube: the heat resulting soon
 weakens and sometimes renders inactive the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence.
    (3) The pressure of the gas interferes with the action of the
 magnet to such       degree that

    (4) By varying the intensity of the induced current, eifects
can be obtained similar to those which result from varying the
pressure of the gas: in general, the more feeble the initial in
tensity, the more decided are the magnetic luminous modi<U+FB01>cations.
    (5) The phenomena are the same when the induced current                is
derived from       Holtz machine or Ruhmkorif induction-coil.

resistance of the part of the induced current under the in<U+FB02>uence of
the magnet.       This resistance is sometimes such that the current
may be suddenly interrupted at the instant when the magnet begins
 to act.    This is made evident in the following manner. A tube is
 taken formed of two parts in communication, one of them-present
 ing a constriction, the other a different length and diameter. The
 capillary part is placed in the pole of the electromagnet, after which
 the current of the coil is started. As long as the magnet is in
 active, the light circulates uniformly in the two tubes ; it is sud
  denly arrested in the shortest and narrowest at the instant when
 this is submitted to the action of the magnet. The e<U+FB01>ect can be
  produced with chlorine, iodine, sulphur, selenium.
     (2) This cessation of the induced light caused by the magnet can
  be determined, with the same gas, in two quite distinct cases—
  either when exhaustion has been carried so far that the induction
  current is near the limit which no longer permits it to pass, or, on
  the contrary, when the tension of the gas is suf<U+FB01>cient for the spark
  to be near the same limit.
     (3) Under the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence the luminous thread, when it
  persists, undergoes in capillary tubes a narrowing which can some
  times be perceived by simple inspection.       This narrowing is pro
  duced by an augmentation of resistance, suf<U+FB01>ciently energetic at
  times to be accompanied by a change of tint in the tube, or even by
  a modi<U+FB01>cation of the spectrum. In certain gases, such as hydrogen,
  nitrogen, carbonic acid, the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnet is hardly per
  ceptible, and the modi<U+FB01>cations observed enter into the system of
  the primitive lines.
      (4) This narrowing, or the change of tint of the luminous thread,
  does not extend to more than half a centimetre from the poles:
  thus on taking a tube of suf<U+FB01>cient length, by changing the height
   of the spectroscope while the magnetization is going on, the normal
   spectrum (that produced by the light outside of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld)
   and the spectrum modi<U+FB01>ed by the vicinity of the magnet can be
   successively seen.
      (5) In order to form a good judgment of the action of the mag
   net, it is necessary to manage so that the spectrum is not very
   bright at starting.    As soon as the current passes in the electro
   magnet, the lines appear in all their splendour.    The phenomenon
   is particularly successful and gives the most perspicuous results
   with chlorine, bromine, chloride of tin, <U+FB02>uoride of silicium, and
   sulphuric acid.
      (6) Direct measurements have proved that, for these last sub
   stances, the new lines developed under these circumstances are

           or IRON, ces'r IRON, AND STEEL.        BY M. DEPREZ.
      In  pursuing  my   researches on electromagnets and their applica
   tion to the registration of very rapid phenomena, the <U+FB01>rst results
   of which have been already communicated to the Academy,        I have

   80                Intelligence and Miscellaneous            Articles;
   been led'to investigate what was the effect               of the nature of the iron
   of the electromagnet upon the duration of the phases of magneti~
   zation and demagnetization.                                       I
                                         For this purpose have employed a
   register in which the pieces of iron constituting the electromagnet
   are removable, the bobbins, armature, style, &;0. remaining the same,
   so as to make evident the in<U+FB02>uence of the metal of the electromagnet.
  To measure the duration of the phases,                   I   have made'use of the
   method indicated in my <U+FB01>rst communciation on electric chrono
                                      ‘                                                  '

       TIhe metallic portion of the electromagnets, which                      I  placed
  successively in the magnetizing helices, consisted of two cores of 2
  millims. diameter and 13 millims. length.                  The coils into which the
  current passed contained 14 metres of wire                       millim. in diameter.
  The pile consisted of one Bunsen’s element modi<U+FB01>ed by M. Dulau
  rier.     The varieties of iron tried were the ordinary iron of com
  merce, the soft iron used specially for telegraphs, malleable cast
  iron, grey cast iron, and cast steel stretched and chilled.
      The results obtained were quite unexpected; for the soft iron,
 ordinary iron, malleable cast iron, and even the chilled steel gave very
 nearly the same results for the duration of the phases of magneti
 zation and demagnetization, viz.                                         second.

      The grey cast iron gave still better results; for the duration of
 the magnetization was reduced to about 1—6106 of a second.                           It
 would therefore be this last metal that would permit the greatest
 possible rapidity to be obtained in the transmission of signals.
      In brief, with my present registers (such as will be described
 soon) signals can be obtained perfectly distinct, succeeding each
 other at intervals of ‘ 0- of a second, by employing no matter What
 sort of iron for the aelectromagnets, and of 75%;; of a second when
 the latter are of grey cast iron.          It is essential to remark that am      I
 not speaking        here   of signals succeeding each other regularly at inter
 vals    of Tl-o- or  m     of a second, which would constitute a system.
 In this latter case, indeed, the number of signals which can be
 transmitted exceeds by far 350 or 500 per second.                                     -
    'I   am disposed to believe that the superiority of cast iron depend
 on its molecular texture, and not on the quantity of carbon which
it contains.        I   intend also to try soft iron cast and not forged, which,
I   think, will exceed in rapidity all that            I   have hitherto obtained.
I   purpose, moreover, in another communication, shortly to revert to
the details of my experiments, and to the application of my regis~
ters to electric chronographs intended for artillery.
     The durations above indicated, it must be observed, do not in
clude the time employed by the style in traversing its trajectory;
it is by adding this to the durations of magnetization and demag
netization that                or Eh; of a second, according to the case, is
found for the total duration of a signal, comprising the demagneti
zation, the time of fall of the style, the magnetization, and the re
turn of the style to its initial position. Besides, these are the
numbers when only one pile—element is employed ; the number of
signals transmitted per second increases with the intensity of the
current—Comptes Renclus de Z’Aead. des Sciences, vol. lxxx. p. 1353

XII.     On a New Farm of Micrometer for use in Spectroscopic
    Analysis.      By WV. M. WATTS, D.Sc., Physical-Science Master
    in the Giggleswz'c/c Grammar School*.
IN      determining the position of lines in a spectrum by the use
         of a micrometer-eyepiece 0r divided are, it is often dif<U+FB01>cult
to see the cross-wires distinctly without admitting extraneous
light, which with faint spectra frequently cannot be done. I
have sought to overcome this dif<U+FB01>culty by substituting some one
known line of the spectrum itself for the cross-wires, and thus to
measure the position of unknown lines, by bringing this index
line successively into coincidence with them. Thus, for example,
the sodium-line (which is present in nearly every. spectrum
 whether it is wanted or not) may be made to move along under
 the spectrum, and the displacement necessary to make it coin
cide with the lines to be measured may be determined by the
 readings of a micrometer-screw.           To accomplish this a convex
 lens   of  about  2 feet  focus is placed in front of the prism of the
 spectroscope, between the prism and the observing-telescope, and
 is divided along a line at right angles to the refracting edge of
  the prism.      One half of the lens is <U+FB01>xed; the other half is made
  to slide over it by means of a micrometer-screw.            When the
  movable half of the lens is in its normal position, the only effect
  is to alter the focus of the telescope slightly; but when it is
  made to slide over the <U+FB01>xed half, the refraction of the prism is
  increased or diminished, half of the spectrum appears to move
  over the other half, and the sodium-line, or any other con

line   (b,=5183) is used, and so on. For use with terrestrial
       b
spectra of bright lines, the lithium-, sodium-, and thallium-lines,
the hydrogen-lines obtained from a vacuum-tube, or for faint
spectra the carbon-lines obtained from a Bunsen burner, furnish
convenient reference-lines in suf<U+FB01>cient number.    The curves are
 drawn on such a scale that a difference in wave-length of 100
 tenth-metres* is represented by four inches, and one turn of the
micrometer-screw is represented by one inch.
    It requires 21'91 turns of the screw to bring the sodium-line
(5892) into coincidence with the thallium-line (5349).          The
interpolation-curves   are very regular and of slight curvature.
In fact the readings of this micrometer may be treated in exactly
the same way as the readings obtained by means of a graduated
arc orbi<U+FB01>lar eyepiece, or any of the other forms of measuring
apparatus.
     Within the limits allowed by the construction of the instru
 ment, the displacements measured by the micrometer-screw ne
 cessary to bring a given reference-line into coincidence with other
 lines to be measured are proportional to the angles between these
 lines and the reference-line as they would be obtained by a
 telescope moving over a graduated arc. The extreme displace
 ment of which the upper half of the lens is capable is 0'69 of an
 inch; and assuming a refractive index of 1'5 for the glass of
 which the lens is made, the radius of its surface is 23 inches.
 The deviation of a ray of light passing through the lens in its
extreme position is thus that due to a prism of retracting angle
 2 sin"1               ;    that      is,   about twice the angle whose sine              is   0-03.
 It, now, we calculate the minimum deviation which ray of light                       a
  su<U+FB01>'ers in passing through the lens at points whose distances
 from the axis of the lens are represented by 0'01, 002, and
  0'03 respectively, we obtain angles very nearly in the ratio of
 these numbers.
     The following numbers show the deviation suffered        ray                         by   a

surement of the <U+FB01>rst two bands by displacement of the lines in
the opposite direction gave 5006'2 and 4996'1.
   To test the capabilities of the new micrometer on faint spectra,
two determinations were made of the wave-length of a line in
the oxide-of-carbon spectrum given by a vacuum-tube enclosing
coal-gas. The wave-length of this line I found before by mea
surement with a three-prism instrument to be 5195.                           It was
obtained very faintly by a feeble discharge through the tube,
and was measured by using as reference-line the lines given by
a Bunsen <U+FB02>ame.
   Two successive determinations (each the mean of four read
ings) gave 5196 and 5196.
   The advantages of the new form of micrometer seem to be
(1) great precision in results, (2) convenience in use.                 My thanks
are due to Mr. Browning for the skill with which he carried out
my wishes in the construction of the instrument.
XIII.    On some Phenomena            connected with the        Boiling of Liquids.
                  By CHARLES TOMLINSON, F.R.S.
                  [Continued      from vol. xlix. p. 448.]
    HE boiling-point of          a liquid in an open vessel may be de
        <U+FB01>ned as the lowest temperature at which its vapour can
have the elasticity of common air.                  But the temperature of the
liquid itself and that   of    its   vapour    under      the terms of the de<U+FB01>ni
tion are not necessarily identical.                 Many circumstances, irre
spective of pressure, tend to raise or lower the temperature of
the liquid, such as (1) the nature of the vessel, slnce the liquid
ma wet some surfaces more or less completely, and others not
at all,- (2) the state of such surfaces with regard to chemical
                    * Too faint to be measured            exactly.

86        .        Mr. C. Tomlinson       on some Phenomena
cleanliness ; (3) the presence or absence of nuclear points in such
surfaces; (4) the presence of nuclei purposely introduced into
the liquid; (5) the presence of air in the liquid as diminishing
cohesion; (6) the purity or impurity of the liquid as in<U+FB02>uen
cing cohesion ; (7) the mode‘ of applying heat to the vessel con
taining the liquid.
     I   take, for example, a specimen of wood-spirit of which the
 boiling-point is 148° F.* In a clean test-tube over the <U+FB02>ame
 of a spirit-lamp, with a clean thermometer held in the axis of
 the tube, the boiling agrees exactly w'ith'this temperature; but
 in a clean glass vessel plunged into a water-bath at 208°, the
 temperature of the liquid may rise to 169° or 21° above its boil
 ing-point without any appearance of boiling.                      Distillation,
 however, is going on from the surface, as may be shown by con
  ducting the experiment in a thin glass retort connected with a
  glass condensing receiver. If the thermometer be raised out of the
  liquid into the vapour immediately above its surface the tempe
  rature falls rapidly to 148°.          Or if a bit of cocoanut-shell char
  coal weighing only 3 or 4 grains be put into the retort, the
  liquid boilsrbriskly at 148°, and the temperature does not rise,
  even though the belly of the retort be plunged into water at
  210° F.         If, however, the operation be long continued, both
  the liquid and the vapour of low-boiling <U+FB02>uids may become
   slightly superheated even with a charcoal nucleus.                In the ab-.
   sence of such nucleus, the superhesting both of liquid and vapour
  is considerable, as will be seen further on.
      The amount of vapour given off under the two last-named
   conditions, namely the presence or the absence of a nucleus,
   varies greatly.        An ounce and a half of the same wood-spirit con
   taining     a  chip  of  cocoanut-shell charcoal weighing 4 grains, was
   distilled during six minutes in a water-bath at 198° F. ; and the
   weight of the distillate was 273 grains.             In this case the tem
   perature of the liquid scarcely rose above 148° during the opera
   tion ; but in a second operation under the same conditions,
   except that the charcoal was omitted, the Wood-spirit quickly rose
   to 162° or 163°, and the weight of the distillate was only 150
   grains, or 123 grains less than in the former case, in which the
   charcoal nucleus was present.
       Seeing, then ,how powerful a nucleus cocoanut-shell charcoal is,
    andhow usefully it may be employed in facilitating the operations
    of boiling and distilling, it is a matter as well of technological
   as of scienti<U+FB01>c interest to determine, if possible, its function, and
   to show the part that it really performs in facilitating so greatly
      "‘
           In Watts’s Dictionary, under Methyl, Hydrate of (iii.988), it is stated,
   that     wood-spirit boils at from 60° to 66°‘5 C. (140° to l5l°'7 F.), accord
   ing to the nature of the vessel, and bumps strongly during boiling.

               connected with the  Boiling of Liquids.               87
the separation~ of vapour from boiling liquids, producing regular
cbullition, and preventing soubresauts, which endanger the safety
 of the vessel if not of the operator.
     If, as M. Gernez asserts, the function of nuclei be simply that
 of carrying down air into the liquid, that function must soon
 become exhausted.       Indeed M. Gernez attempts to show that
 any nucleus can be exhausted, not readily it is true, but under
 the in<U+FB02>uence of repeated boiling and reboilings separated by
  short intervals of time.    I showed in my last paper that cocoa-_
  nut-shell charcoal and some other nuclei cannot be thus ex
 hausted when the mode of applying heat is by means of the
  <U+FB02>ame of a spirit-lamp.     But, it may be asked, suppose the mode
  of heating be by means of a hot bath, what then is the e<U+FB01>'ect of
  repeated boiling?     The results of experiments on this point
  seem to me to be as remarkable as they are instructive.
     If, as M. Gernez af<U+FB01>rms, a nucleus, such as charcoal, becomes
 inactive after boiling <U+FB01>ve or from that to ten times in a liquid
 at intervals of <U+FB01>ve minutes or so, the charcoal ought to. show a
  gradual decline in power, from its highest state of e<U+FB01>iciency,
  through advancing degrees of feebleness, to inactivity.      In order
 to test this point, wood-spirit was distilled a number of timesin
 the presence of a bit of cocoanut-shell         charcoal weighing 5
                                                                        '
 grains; and the distillate was weighed each time after the opera-
 tion had been conducted during <U+FB01>ve minutes.             The source of
 heat was a beaker containing 10% ounces of water, which was
 raised to boiling by the <U+FB02>ame of a large spirit-lamp, after which
 a smaller <U+FB02>ame was kept under the beaker to‘prevent the tem
 perature from falling too much in consequence of the introduc
 tion of the cold vessel containing the wood-spirit, 1% ounce of
 which was put into a small deep-bellied retort, the beak of which
 passed into a globular glass receiver; and this was kept wet with
 cold water.     A thermometer passing through 'a cork closed the
 tubulure of the retort, while another thermometer was in the
 water-bath.

temperature of the spirit quickly attained 148°, at which it re
mained until near the close of the operation.            The introduc
tion of the retort lowered the temperature       of  the bath.

acquired a temperature of 160°, or 12° above its boiling-point ;
it then suddenly discharged so much vapour as to turn about
half the contents of the retort into the receiver.
    Eighth operation.—-Similar to the seventh. The spirit rose to
161°, when the charcoal suddenly became active, and the spirit
sank to 150°.
  Ninth operation.~—After <U+FB01>ve minutes with              a fresh charge.
The charcoal burst into activity            at 148°, and the distillation
proceeded regularly.

         Weight of distillate in <U+FB01>ve minutes 190 grains.
    The above details seem to me to throw considerable light on
the question at issue, namely, what is the function of such a
nucleus as cocoanut-shell charcoal?         We have seen that in the
<U+FB01>rst operation a fresh piece of charcoal becomes active at 90° or
100° when the air contained within its pores becomes displaced
by the heat and by the vapour; and it soon displays great acti
vity in liberating vapour, and would continue to be active
during many hours, as I have often found in distilling water,
turpentine, and other volatile oils, as well as spirits of wine
and other liquids of low boiling-points.            But         if,
                                                            when the
charcoal   is  fully active, its function of absorbing vapour and
liberating  it   under the action of heat be arrested and the
charcoal itself transferred to       cold liquid, there
                                        a                       is
                                                               conden~a
sation of vapour within its pores; so that in the second and
some of the subsequent operations the spirit requires to be
raised to the boiling-point before the vapour thus condensed
 can be made volatile and the charcoal become active.            But          if
 instead of an interval of <U+FB01>ve minutes the charcoal be left in the
 liquid during twenty-four hours, the condensation          more com
                                                                is
 plete
     ;    and   it requires     superior temperature to that of the
                                a
 boiling-point to vaporize the liquid within the pores of the char
 coal.    Thus we see that in the seventh and eighth operations
 the spirit rose 12° or 13° above its boiling-point before the
  charcoal nucleus became active; and its activity being thus re
  stored, we see that in the next operation, after an interval of
 only <U+FB01>ve minutes,    it  became active at 148°, as before.    It seems
  to me to be ignoring the obvious teaching of the facts before us
  to suppose, with M. Gernez, that the charcoal becomes inactive
  because the air has been driven out of          it,
                                                when all that    wanted
                                                                      is
  to restore its activity      is
                                higher temperature

                                                         ;  this can be
 given either, as in the case before us,            by
                                                  the liquid becoming
  superheated, or     byholding the retort over the <U+FB02>ame of spirit        a
 lamp, which     is the more expeditious way.        Of course in the

90             Mr. C. Tomlinson                  on some Phenomena
practice of distillation fresh charcoal would be taken in each'
operation.
   In the course of numerous operations with successive charges
of wood-spirit and other liquids,                  I
                                            had frequent opportunities
of noticing a fact which was pointed out in my paper read before
the Royal Society*—namely, that if the thermometer contained
in a liquid at, or near, or above the boiling-point be taken out,
waved in the air, and then reinserted, it produces a fresh burst
of vapour.      M. Gernez criticises this experiment, apparently

 in the bath      is,from the mode of applying the heat, somewhat
 lower in temperature than the rest of the liquid, while at
 such surface the vapour, however much the liquid be super
 heated, tends to adjust itself to the true boiling-point of the
 liquid, although, as will' be shown presently, the vapour may
 readily be superheated.
     As to the highest point to which liquids can be superheated,
  there are certain statements which seem to me to belong to the
  region of the marvellous rather than to that of fair inference an                 d
  common sense.         Thus Dufour dropped water into an oil-bath
  heated to 178° C. (352°‘4 F.), and supposed that the water was
'
  of the same temperature as the bath because             remained in
                                                            it                      it
  without boiling; and he points with apparent complacency to
  the fact that at that temperature the elastic force of aqueous
  vapour     is  equal to eight or nine atmospheres.        De Luc had
  already performed        similar experiment (the highest temperature
                            a
   of his oil-bath was          257°; but with commendable caution he
   remarks that he was           by
                                no means satis<U+FB01>ed. that the water ever
   reached that temperature.          “ Ces gouttes d’eau, renfermées
   dans l’huile, pouvaient étre dans un état particulier;”         which   by
   he meant “ the spheroidal state,” although that term had not yet
   been given to       phenomenon which De Luc- understood in its
                        a
   leading features.      The doubt expressed          by
                                                       him touches the
   weak side of most of the statements on superheating.             Ph -
    sicists have supposed that   liquid plunged into hot bath must
                                      a                     a
    necessarily  acquire  the temperature    of that bath.     Thus in
    Donny’s   celebrated experiment  water  contained       tube
                                                             in   a mil     8
    lims. in diameter,and bent upwards in such way as was supposed
                                                      a
    would prevent convection, was boiled in order to expel the air
    and sealed at the other end, which terminated in two bulbs.
    The end containing the water was then immersed during three
    minutes in three baths of calcic chloride in succession, the <U+FB01>rst at
    113° C., the second at 121°, the third at 128°,-          was thenit
    transferred to  afourth bath at 132°, which rose to 138°; but
    the tube had not been in this bath more than two and            half        a
    minutes when the water suddenly burst into steam which was

92             Mr. C. Tomlinson     on some Phenomena
 condensed in the two bulbs.        M. Donny remarks that this ex-.
 periment is of a nature to show that the forces of cohesion and
 adhesion may play a very important part in the ebullition of
 water, the cohesion of water being thus supposed to be superior to a
 pressure of three atmospheres, or a column of water of 30 metres.
     These are important conclusions, and ought not, as it seems
 to me, to rest on such data as the above experiment a<U+FB01>'ords ; for
  I cannot help thinking that it is a false inference to conclude
 that because the tube containing the water was kept in the hot
  baths during eleven and a half minutes, the water necessarily
 acquired the temperature of the baths.          No evidence short of
 the actual reading of a thermometer in the water, as well as in
 the hot baths, ought to warrant so marvellous a statement as that
 water not under pressure not even atmospheric in Donny’s ex
 periment) can be heated to 2806 F. without boiling.
    In like manner, it seems to me that M. Gernez has been led
 into error by his mode of operating.         He had a thermometer in
 his hot bath (water or paraf<U+FB01>ne) with the bulb near to the tube
 containing the liquid 5 and assuming that the liquid in the tube
 must be of the temperature of the bath, he states that such
 liquids as chloroform, wood-spirit, and bisulphide of carbon can
 support a temperature of 100° C. (212° F.) without boiling;
 that is, that bisulphide of carbon can be raised 94° F., chloro
 form 70°, and wood-spirit 64° above their boiling-points without
 boiling, even when not under pressure.
    Now, among the numerous experiments that        I     have tried with
 wood-spirit  and   other liquids  in  the only way   that  seems to me
to lead to satisfactory results, namely with       a    thermometer in
the liquid as well as in the hot bath,      I     have never seen the
liquid rise to any thing like the temperature of the bath        ,-  and
how  is   itpossible that it  can do so, seeing that distillation     is
constantly going on from the surface of the liquid     ;   and although
it  may  rise many degrees    above  its boiling-point, yet the tension
of the pent-up vapour at length asserts itself long before the
liquid has acquired the temperature of the bath.                 Even in
Donny’s experiment with tube not more than
                            a                                inch in dia
                                                           130
meter, the preliminary operation of boiling the water shows that
evaporation from the surface must have been going on in the
hot baths; and this of itself was suf<U+FB01>cient to keep down the
temperature.

       The <U+FB01>rst    arrangement     was   to boil distilled     water in a <U+FB02>ask

    clined position into a bath of oil in a copper bowl.             A thermo
    meter was placed in the water in the tube, and a second ther
    mometer in the oil-bath. The tube and the inserted thermo

        The  foregoing results agree with my own experience.                The
    water   becomes   superheated    a few     degrees, then   relieves the ten
    sion by a burst of vapour, and the temperature falls; there is
    also rapid but quiet evaporation from the surface, which also
    serves to keep down the temperature.

94                   Mr. C. Tomlinson   on some Phehomena
     In asking my friend Mr. Hatcher to continue these experi
ments, I suggested the following particulars :—-If the oil-bath
were kept at a pretty steady high temperature, the results of
the experiments would be more comparable.             In the selection of
tubes, avoid those that contain nuclear specks, which become
evident when a. liquid is boiled in a tube over the <U+FB02>ame of a
spirit-lamp by the stream of bubbles that escapes from one or
two points.     The results would also be more satisfactory if the
tube were sustained in a vertical position in the bath.             When
inclined there is a shallow depth of liquid at the elongated ellip
tical surface, on which the heat acts more easily than on greater
 depths.     The tube should not touch the bottom of the oil-bath ;
for there the temperature is higher than just abOVe. The thermo
 meter in the tube must be quite clean. If the scale on the stem is
 <U+FB01>lled in with black, this, being a mixture of lampblack and grease,
 is nuclear.    The thermometer should not touch the bottom of
  the tube, because, if it does, a thin capillary <U+FB01>lm of liquid is formed
 beneath      it,
               which readily bursts into vapour.         If the rounded
  end of  a glass rod or the thermometer-bulb be held against the
bottom or side of the vessel containing           boiling liquid,
                                                   a                 rapid
                                                                    9.
  stream of bubbles escapes from the point of contact.        Nor should
  the thermometer-stem touch the side of the tube, for the same
  reason, but be suspended in its axis so as to be read easily with
 ,out disturbing the liquid.       Mechanical holders are useful in ex

     The following results were obtained, subject, as nearly as pos
 sible, to the above conditions.        The thermometer had an exte
vterior casing tube.       The tube used in boiling (except in one
  experiment) was about 1%,- inch in diameter; and the thermo
_meter was suspended freely within            itwith the bulb at about
  half the depth of the water. The difference in temperature
.between the bath and the water was maintained at about 60° F.
  until the water <U+FB01>rst boiled, when the temperature wa allowed
 to rise.

The thermometer-bulb now became uncovered.
     Mr. Hatcher remarks on the abOVe :——“ In the intervals be
tween the great bursts of vapour there were frequent and some
what regular formations of large bubbles of vapour in the liquid,
which seemed to heave up the whole surface at once.
     “ The thermometer in the vapour acted as a condenser, drops
 of condensed liquid constantly falling from the end of the bulb
 into the heated liquid below; but in no case did the fall of one
 of these drops appear to be the cause of an explosion of vapour,
 or of one of the large bubbles.
     “ The thermometers were cleaned
                                                     by being dipped into strong
 sulphuric acid,      washed      in   a  stream    of water, dipped into potash
 solution, washed again, dipped                into the liquid to be tested (this
 was contained in a separate vessel), and then transferred as
 quickly as possible to the test-tube in which the experiment was
 to be made. Even with these precautions we seem to have had

     “ With respect to the apparent snperheating of the vapour in
 the last experiment,         I  should note that the test-tube with the
  spirit stood vertically in a bowl of water, and was constantly sur
 rounded by the steam from the water.                     It is quite possible that
 when the difference of normal temperature of the included vapour
 and the external steam is great (as in the case of the wood-spirit)
 some superheating of the included vapour may take place—not
  mm the superheated liquid belOw so much as from the steam
jacket enveloping the tube.”                            .
     The following are some further experiments on the super
 heating of the vapour over the surface of the superheated liquid.

   It appears from these experiments that ether-vapour readily
becomes superheated from the column of vapour from the bath, as
already stated, but that     dif<U+FB01>cult (at least in this form of the

“The tube in the water experiment must be surrounded by                                            a
certain column of air heated by the oil or paraf<U+FB01>ne-bath; but
the temperature (normal) of this vapour being high,         cannot                        it
take much heat from the surrounding column of air, and apps»
rently its radiation of heat outWards for some time exceeds its

the elaborate attack of M. Gernez, the statements laid by me
before the Royal Society in 1869 are con<U+FB01>rmed.         ltis proved, 1
think :-—that there are such things as nuclei which act powerfully
in separating vapour from water and other liquids at, or near, or
above the boiling-point ; that although air may assist the pro
cess of ebullition, air is not by any means the only nucleus, as
M. Gernez a<U+FB02>‘irms, but that various bodies which are not wetted
by the liquid, but to which vapour will adhere, act as nuclei;
that porous bodies such as charcoal, and especially the cocoanut
shell variety of       it,
                     are energetic in absorbing vapour, and dis
charging  it  under the action of the high temperature to which
they are exposed; that the air of room being full of particles
                                           a
of dust and motes, the momentary exposure of clean surface

energy in the boiling liquid; that the supposed inactivity of po
rous nuclei does not arise from their loss of air, but from the
condensation of the vapours within their pores, seeing that they
reassume their activity under the in<U+FB02>uence of higher tempera

 far below that of the bath, which     purposely raised much above
                                           is
the boiling-point of the liquid under examination; and that the
 statements respecting water and other liquids under ordinary
pressure, or under no pressure at all, that they are capable of
 attaining temperature in some cases more than double that of
             a
their boiling-points,            is
                           altogether   mistake, seeing that evapo

 sion of the vapour     limit in another direction to the attainment
                             a
 of any such exalted temperature; that, in short, no statements
as to the temperature of the superheated liquid can be correctly
inferred from the temperature of the bath, the reading of ther        a
mometer in the liquid itself being the only reliable evidence.

   In the consideration of gases, we start from the hypothesis
that their molecules move in straight lines and only change
their directions through collisions with one another or striking
against the solid sides of the containing vessel.      We will preli
minarily regard the molecules as material points; that             we                    is,
will neglect the circumstance that the constituents of molecule              a
are also in motion relative to each other.
   In reference to the mean length of path of the molecules be
tween two collisions,     have already* arrived at certain results,

some of which      will here brie<U+FB02>y recapitulate.

   After discussing the somewhat complicated action exerted                                    by

another molecule can come before       recoil commences.
    If we picture to ourselves, as             is a

which falls to each molecule. With the aid of these symbols                                    I
constructed the following equation for the case in which only
one molecule was in motion and the rest were <U+FB01>xed, the mean
path-length of the moving molecule being          :—          l'

 I expressed      in the following proposition* :———The mean length of
path of a molecule is to the radius of the spheres of action as the
 entire space occupied by the gas is to that part of the space which
 is actually <U+FB01>lled by the spheres of action of the molecules.
      If  we   imagine the molecules as elastic balls, we must (as
 already said) suppose the diameter of such' a ball as great as the
 radius of the above-de<U+FB01>ned sphere of action, whence we get for
 the volume of the elastic ball one eighth of the volume of the
 sphere of action.          The last proposition then runs, The mean
 length of path of       a  molecule is to one eighth of its diameter as
 the entire space occupied by the gas is to that part of it which is
 actually <U+FB01>lled by the molecules.
      § 10. To these previously found results on the collisions of
 the molecules we will connect our further considerations.                 It
 will, however, be advisable not to employ the formulae in their.
 previous shape, but to regard the subject in a somewhat different
  manner, whereby we shall arrive at formulae which are still more
  exact and have a form singularly suited to our present purpose.
      Given a space bounded by any irregular surface.               At any
  place whatever within this space let there be a moving point, so
  that for all equally large portions of the space the probability of
  their containing the point may be equal. Let the point make
  an inde<U+FB01>nitely       small movement in any direction whatever, so

  these circumstances,      what is the probability that the point with its
  inde<U+FB01>nitely small movement, will strike the surface?
       We will <U+FB01>rst consider a single element ds of the surface, and
  inquire 'what is the probability that the point will strike precisely
  this element of the surface.
      If  dl is the inde<U+FB01>nitely small extent of the point’s motion, let
  us now imagine the point at rest, and, conversely, that the sur

  dl.     Thereby an inde<U+FB01>nitely small prismatic space will be de

scribed by the surface-element; and the probability that the
point is situated exactly in this space is the same as the proba
bility that the point in its motion strikes the surface-element ds.
    For all cases in which the supposed motion of the surface
element is outwards from the enclosed space, so that the small
space described by that element lies outside of the given space,
the probability that the point will be in this small space is equal
to zero.        0n the contrary, where the supposed motion of the
surface-element      is inwards, so that the small space described by
it forms a part of the given space, the probability that the point
will be found in exactly this part of the space is represented by
a fraction whose numerator is this part, and its denominator the
entire   space.
    If 0    is the angle which the direction of the motion of the ele
ment makes with the normal erected inside upon the element,
the magnitude of the small space is represented by the expression
                                   cos dds dl,
 which becomes positive or negative according            as the small space
is within or without the given space.           Hence,   if the entire given
 space be denoted by W, then with                       to the probability
 which is to be determined we can say :—       respect
                                                    or directions of motion
 with which the preceding expression becomes negative the proba
 bility is equal to zero; and for those with which the expression
 becomes positive the probability is
                              _ cos 6 ds dl
     Now, in order to calculate the mean probability for all possible
 directions of motion, we must take account of the law of proba
 bility with respect to the angles. The likelihood that the angle'
 which the direction of motion makes with the normal lies be
 tween a given value (9 and the in<U+FB01>nitesimally different value
 0 +d6 is represented by the ratio of the area of a zone having
 the polar angle 6 and the breadth dB to the total .surface of the
 sphere, therefore by the fraction

   The   same  probability which holds for one surface-element,
holds also for every other of equal magnitude.    We get there
fore at once for any <U+FB01>nite portion s of the surface selected for
consideration, or also for the entire surface (which shall be de
noted by S), the following proposition :—If within a space W
bounded by the surface S a point, starting from any position what~
ever, traverses in any direction the in<U+FB01>nitesimal distance d1, the

surface is represented by                                 |

 to move until it strikes the surface and, according to the laws of
 elasticity, recoils, upon which its motion is continued with the

 pose that the force exerted on the point by the surface acts only
 in its immediate vicinity, so that the alteration of the direction
 of motion at the collision takes place in an imperceptibly short
 time, and accordingly the velocity may be regarded as constant,
 notwithstanding the variation during the collision.

  §  1]. Let us now turn to the consideration of the molecules.
Instead, however, of assuming all the molecules alike to be in
motion, let us imagine    space in which very many molecules are
                          a
in <U+FB01>xed positions—not, indeed, regularly arranged, but yet so
 far uniformly distributed that equal measurable sections of the

space contain equal numbers of molecules.           Between these <U+FB01>xed
molecules one molecule only shall move, which, now here, now
there, shall strike against a <U+FB01>xed one and recoil from it.            The
problem       is,
               to  <U+FB01>nd  the number   of collisions during the unit of
time; from which we shall then also obtain the mean length of
p ath.
    Instead of moving molecule, we can consider
                    a                                      mere point in          a
motion,   ifwe at the same time imagine the above-de<U+FB01>ned spheres
of action described about the centres of gravity of the <U+FB01>xed mo
lecules, and assume that, as often as the moving point strikes
against the surface of sphere of action,
                                   a               recoils from it. We

thereby obtain again the case discussed in             10, inasmuch as    §
the surface of each sphere of action forms           part of the surface
                                                                      a

                       then the surfaces of the spheres of action and
the exterior bounding surface together constitute the entire sur
face which limits the free space for the motion.
 . We will<U+FB01>rst assume that the space furnished in the given manner
with <U+FB01>xed molecules          in<U+FB01>nitely extended, so that the moving
                                   is
point strikes against the surfaces of the spheres of action only,
and not against       <U+FB01>rm envelope.

molecules present may       be  determined                     by

 that it has for its numerator the entire volume V, while the new
 one has only the part of the volume which is free for the motion
 as its numerator.     The latter is more precise; but the difference
 is so slight that it may usually be neglected, because a characters
 istic peculiarity of gases is that only a very small part of the
 entire space occupied by a gas is actually <U+FB01>lled by the spheres of
 action—especially if the gas is a perfect gas ; for this idea itself
 implies that, compared with the entire space, the space <U+FB01>lled by
 the spheres of action is a negligible quantity.           After the fore
 going, however, there is no dif<U+FB01>culty in taking this slight differ
 rence in the formulae into account; and in the above-men
 tioned proposition previously advanced we need only, instead of
 the words “the entire space occupied by the gas,” to put “the
 part of the space which is left free from the spheres of action of
 the molecules.”
     If the space furnished with stationary molecules has only the
magnitude V and is circumscribed by a <U+FB01>rm envelope which the
point strikes against and recoils from, and if we wish to take
into consideration these collisions also, only a slight modi<U+FB01>cation
of the formulae is necessary for this purpose.          Let a be the mag

divide the velocity of the molecule by P ; but as in this case its
velocity doe not remain invariable, but in general takes another

  §  12. We must now take up the question whether, and in
what manner, the theorem of the mean ergal can be applied to
the above-discussed molecular motions.
   This proposition     is
                        applicable    the variables which determine
                                            if
the positions of the points change periodically, or                if,

used in forming the variationsin the same manner as the periods
of periodic variations, conduct to variations that satisfy the equa

                                       in
   When from this point of view we contemplate the irregular
motions of the molecules, we immediately perceive that no pe
riodicity of the variables which determine the positions of the
molecules     is
               present.   Even the <U+FB01>xing of the before-mentioned
time-intervals appears, on consideration of the actual motion, to
present considerable dif<U+FB01>culties.       will therefore content myself

              is                                                 It                      is
founded on the fact that the motion which really takes place can
be replaced        by
                  another, in which all the quantities essential to
our investigation have the same values as in the former, and

 108        Prof. R. Clausius   on the Theorem   of the Mean Ergal,
which satis<U+FB01>es the requisite condition for the applicability of the
 theorem of the mean ergal.
    To facilitate contemplation, we will not immediately treat of
 the molecules in confused motion and striking against one an
 other, but start from a simpler case.           Given an in<U+FB01>nitely ex
 tended space, furnished, in the manner spoken of in the last
 section, with stationary molecules, between which very numerous
 material points are circulating without affecting each other in
 their motions, but rebounding from the spheres of action of the
 molecules as often as they touch them.
    The force suffered by a point from the action of the rebound
 we will conceive as proceeding from the surfaces of the spheres
 of action, and assume that only in the immediate vicinity of
 those surfaces does it become sensible, but then with still greater
 nearness increases very rapidly.         In this case, as long as the
 point   is  at a sensible distance from all spheres of action, we may
 regard its vis viva as constant, and put its share in the ergal
  (which we will brie<U+FB02>y call its ergal, since the motions of the
  individual points are independent of one another) equal to nil.
  But when the point comes close to the surface of a sphere of
  action, then the part of its vis viva referred to the direction
 normal to the surface very quickly diminishes to zero, and then,
 after the reversal of the normal component of its motion, just as
 quickly increases up to its original value. At the same time its
 ergal increases from zero by just the same amount as the vis viva
 diminishes, and then again sinks to zero.          From this it follows
 that the mean ergal of each point must be very small in propor
 tion to its mean vis viva, because only during a very short time
 has the ergal speci<U+FB01>able values—and, further, that with a given
vis viva the mean ergal of a point must be proportional to the
number of collisions it suffers during unit time.
     For the number of collisions of one point, we have equation
 (70), namely
                              _

Let N' denote the number of moving points which are found
simultaneously in a volume of magnitude V ; and let us prelimi
narily assume that they all move with equal velocity v ; then the
total number of collisions which take place within the volume V
during a unit of time will be represented by the product

    The same number holds also for another case. Given          a vessel

common velocity‘v in all possible directions.             Let the space
content of the vessel be called W, and its super<U+FB01>cies S; then we
have, for the mean number of collisions of the single points
during unit time, equation (68), viz.

and accordingly       the total number of collisions taking place in
the    vessel during unit time will be represented by the product
                                 1 r_

                                           4W
In    order, therefore, to get the same number of collisions in this
case as    in the preceding, we have only to choose the vessel so
that W and S are equal or proportional to the quantities
V—Ngmf‘ and N4'n'p2.                                          '
    Besides, the strokes against the surface of the sides of the
vessel have the same multifariousness in respect of their direc
tions as those against the surfaces of the spheres of action.          If,
<U+FB01>nally, we assume that the force exerted on the points by the
 surface of the sides of the vessel is represented by the same
 function of the distance as the force which the surface of a
 sphere of action of a molecule exerts upon the points, then ‘the
 augmentation and diminution of the ergal take place with the
 strokes against the sides just as with those against the sphere
 of action of the molecules. We must thus in both cases get the
 same mean ergal.           _
     It can, however, be assumed that the velocities of the points
 moving among the stationary molecules vary according to some
 law, which law can be mathematically expressed by aying,             “If
 one of the points be taken arbitrarily, the probability that its
 velocity lies between a given value v and the in<U+FB01>nitesimally dif
  ferent value c-i-a'v is equal to f(v)dv,” where

                In this case we must ascribe to the points which are
  in the vessel velocities corresponding to the same law; and then
  the same mean 122's viva and the same mean ergal are again ob
  tained for the points in the vessel as for those which move
 between the stationary molecules.
     As the above conditions which the space-content and the su
  per<U+FB01>cies of the vessel must satisfy do not determine its form,
  that of a rectangular parallelepiped can be chosen.         If we then
  determine the positions of the points by rectangular coordi
  nates parallel to the edges of the parallelepiped, we shall have,
  in these coordinates, variables which alter periodically,

    § 13. We now go further, to consider an in<U+FB01>nitely extended
space <U+FB01>lled with molecules which are all in motion and strike
against one another.
    It has already been hinted that the number of shocks under
gone by a single molecule under these circumstances can be ob
 tained if we ascribe to the molecule in question its mean velocity
relative to all the other molecules as its proper velocity, assuming
that it moves among stationary molecules.             From this we derive
for the number equation (74), namely
                          P_      N'rrp'ii'

 wherein   N   denotes the number of the molecules which are simul
 taneously present in a volume V*.           In order, further, to deduce
 from this the total number of collisions which take place in the
 Volume V during unit time, the last formula must be applied to
 all the N molecules.      At the same time it must be recollected
 that each collision concerns not merely one molecule, but two,
 and thus occurs twice among those which all the individual mo—
 lecules suffer.    In order, therefore, to express the number of
 collisions which take place, we must not simply multiply the
 formula by N, but further divide the product by 2, and conse
quently obtain

    We get the same number of collisions when we suppose that

 5N points are present and moving in all possible directions with
 Velocities the mean value of which is F, and, without reciprocal
 action on one another, rebound from the sides of the vessel.
    As regards the force of the collisions, this depends on the
angles of meeting and on the velocities.             The various possible
 angles occur in the same manner with the collisions of the mo
lecules as with the points striking against the sides of the vessel ;
and hence we can leave them out of view.               With respect to the
Velocities, we remark, <U+FB01>rst, that with two molecules which strike

 must be put in the above formula in place of N. But when V is a volume
containing a ponderable quantity (e. g. a unit of weight) of the gas, N is a
number so immensely great that 1 may be without hesitation neglected, and
N put instead of N—l.

against each other the force of the shock is the same as if one of
them were stationary and the other had the relative velocity 7' of
the two molcules as its own velocity.            Hence also a material
point of the same mass as the molecule, if it strikes with the
velocity r against a solid partition, will receive a shock of the
same strength.
     The relative velocities of the various occurring combinations
 of the molecules in twos necessarily di<U+FB01>'er 3 and their ratio can
 be mathematically expressed by saying that if out of all those
 combinations one be taken arbitrarily, the probability that the
 relative velocity of the two molecules belonging to it lies between
 a valuer and the in<U+FB01>nitesimally different value r+dr is equal to
 F(r)dr, in which F denotes a function dependent on the law that
 holds for the velocities of the individual molecules.           Assuming
 this function as given, we ascribe also to the éN points in the
 vessel such velocities that, if one of the points be taken arbi
 trarily, the probability is equal to F(r)dr that its velocity lies
 between    1' and  r+dr.
     In this   case, not  only is the total number of the shocks expe
 rienced by the points in the vessel equal to the total number of
  the collisions which take place between the molecules of the
  volume V, but there also occur exactly as many collisions of
  each degree of force in the vessel as among the molecules.
  Accordingly the %N points in the vessel have the same mean
  ergal as the N molecules in the volume V.
      Besides, it can be proved that also the vis viva of the 12~N ma
  terial points is equal to that of the N molecules.        1 have shown,
  in a recent memoir*, that for any system of mass-points m1, m”

     § 14.‘ We can now limit our further investigations to the case
in which, in a rectangularly parallelepipedal vessel a vast num
ber of material points are in motion, not in<U+FB02>uencing one another,
but only subject to forces from the sides of the vessel causing
them to rebound.
     The force eXerted on a point by a side of the vessel shall be
 perpendicular to the side, and represented by a function of the
 distance.     If, then, we introduce rectangular coordinates parallel
 to the edges of the parallelepiped, the origin lying somewhere in
 its interior, a: denoting one of the coordinates,-and if further, of
 the two walls perpendicular to the direction of this coordinate,
 that situated “on‘the positive side has the distance 0, and that
 situated on the negative side the distance 0' from the origin of
 coordinate, so that c—z and c' + .z' are the distances of the moving
 point from the two walls, we can represent the force which acts
 on the point along the w-direction by an expression of the form
 _                        F'(c—.z')—F'(c'+.z'),
 in which    I” signi<U+FB01>es a function which, we will assume, is very
 near equality to zero for all greater values of the argument, and
 only for very small values does its quantity become sensible, but
 then,on the argument still further diminishing, increases rapidly.
 Let F denote the integral of the function F' 5 the part of the
 ergal referring to the m-direction will, for the point under con;
  sideration, be expressed by
                            F(c—~.r) +    F(c'+z).
     The motions of the material points           are to take place in all
 Pessible directions,    and  so  that all possible directions are equally
 represented.
      The Velocities of the different points are to be different; and
  the law which prevails in this respect we will now express in the
  following manner.        For this purpose we select the quantity

being the fundamental formula of unitation), the following in
vestigations in this paper refer to proofs and developments of the
points advanced in the previous paper, in. relation to the unitates
of powers and roots.
    2. If m and g be integers, Vq irrational, and n any integer,
excepting unity, so great that the expression nm—q is positive,
then the unitate of the mth root of q to the base 5 (or Uat’yq)
is <U+FB01>nite and integral when 5 is of the form nm—q.          For if g
be found in the recurring series that belongs to the unitates of
the mth powers of numbers, Q/ q will be found in the correspond
 ing place in the series of the unitates of natural numbers, and
 this whether Q/q be rational or irrational.       But for q to be
 found in such a series of unitate, it is necessary that 8 should
 be of such a value that r8       = an integer) being subtracted
                                       (1‘

 Now   U,1'5=       8
                    ;    and this equation becomes
                                  5   = n'"      —-   g.
 If   nm—q     be less than      q,   the expression                   USQ/q will become
 Usv   U 5q.
    3. The following examples show some of the forms which
 nm—q may assume; at the same time they are proofs       induc                          by
 tion of the general theorem.
    Example I.—Find some of the values of        or some of the              5,
 series of unitates, in which M has an integral unitate.

    Example II.—Find some of the values of 8 in which     V?) has
an integral unitate.
   The values obtained from the formula 8=n"‘—-q, by substitu
tion of integral numbers for n, are 6, 13, 22, 33, 46, 8:0.
   Example [IL—M 35 has integral unitates in the following
systems—~14,    29, 47, 65, 86, 109, &c., of which the <U+FB01>rst two
refer to the expression U,\/ U 835,
   Example lV.—-Integral unitates to the square root of 499 or

   Example V.—-The unitation bases which give integral results
in the case of {747 are 17, 78, 169, 296, 475, 682, 953,
1284, &c.           v
   4. Other values of 8 may be found, which furnish integral values
for the unitates of a given surd, in those systems which are exact
divisors of the systems found by means of the formula 8=n"'—q.
For instance M3 has an integral unitate to the base 11, and 11
is an exact divisor of 22 and 33, both of which are found in the
values of 8 obtained from the formula 8:1»‘2—3.         Again, 23 is
an exact divisor of 46, and accordingly the unitate U” M3 is in
tegral. This plan can always be relied upon ,' for it is evident that
  8         .     .                               .                .

  5. Unitation squares may be used to obtain collateral proofs
of the unitates of the roots of numbers. For instance, in the
unitation square of the powers to the unitation base 7 in the
order           a5,   a1},    a’i‘,   a‘,   a2, a4, as,    &c., the unitates that continue the
law of series are 1%, 2‘}, 4’}, and 7%,. It would appear at <U+FB01>rst
sight that,   the case of square roots, unitation squares give only

    Those calculations in which surds merely enter as intermediate
quantities, but disappear in the result, can readily be checked                 by
using an appropriate system of unitation.            The same facility
occurs when surds remain throughout the calculation to the very
end.     Unitation has not yet been applied to the veri<U+FB01>cation of
the approximate decimal equivalents for surds.

     10. In the <U+FB01>rst paper on unitation (Phil. Mag. Nov. 1868)                  a
 general statement was made of the theorem, and various examples
 were given.     In the next paper (Phil. Mag. July I873) the prin
 ciples of inductive philosophy, and especially of successive induc
 tion, were brought to bear upon the ascertainment and explana~
 tion of negative and fractional unitates.       In the third and last
 paper (Phil. Mag. May 1875) the position of unitation was ex
 amined in reference to its place among other operations.          This
 classi<U+FB01>ed treatment was found necessary to the proper working
 out of each division of the subject, considering the method of
  thought involved in each investigation.       Interpretation of sym
  bols has already been applied to the elucidation of the meaning
  of negative unitate, and
   a                          it   can again be employed to show the
  meaning of 4/—-1 in unitates.
     The method of inquiry put forward in the Philosophical Ma
  gazine of July 1873, into the nature ofa negative unitate, taking
  the number  9   as the value of    3,  capable of general statement,
                                          is
  so that almost the same form of words may be used to prove the
  proposition that U8(—a)=U5(5—-a).               follows that
                                                   It             correa
  sponding positive unitate may be found for every negative uni
  tate.   This method of working applies directly to the dealing
  with 4/-—1 in unitation.       Taking a+bM—c as the type of the
  practical appearance of this quantity, the minus sign may be“

    The further consideration of the meaning of V—l in unita

    The peculiarities and practical uses of unitates are due in a
great measure to their being periodic functions.

XVI.     On the Origin and Mechanism ofproduction of the Prismatic
     (or columnar) Structure of Basalt.             By ROBERT MALLET,
    F.R.S.*
          branch of physical geology is superior in interest or in
 NOthe importance           of its relations than that which regards the
jointing, lamination,      and   cleavage of rock-masses.
     Lamination and cleavage have been ably elucidated by Sharpe
and others.        Our knowledge of the 'mechanism of the joint
 ing, though contributed to by Haughton, Phillips, and other
 observers, is still very far from complete.           Least complete of
all, however, is our knowledge of that which constitutes the
 most singular of all observed forms of jointing, namely that
 which has resulted in the production of that complicated system
of joints evidenced in columnar basalt. Even before the con
 troversy of the last century as to the igneous or aqueous origin
 of basalt was settled (and the conclusion admitted very gene
 rally that basalt is an igneous rock differing from other lavas
 chie<U+FB02>y in the conditions under which it was poured forth), the
 circumstances attending the production of such <U+FB01>ssuring as ends
 in columnar structure was speculated on, but in the same
 super<U+FB01>cial and inexact manner that has generally characterized
 the treatment of the subject by subsequent writers up to the
 present time.       So far as the writer’s acquaintance with the
 systematic    works    of British geologists and vulcanologists ex
 tends, including those of Bakewell, De la Beche, Lyell, Dau
 beny, Jukes, and several others, no consistent or even clearly
 intelligible theory of the production of columnar structure can
 be found.       Even agreement upon the fundamental fact of

 will be found in its Proceedings (No. 158), January 2], 1875. After <U+FB01>ve
months had elapsed, and the paper, as 1 am informed, had been submitted
to four referees in succession, 1 received notice that “ it was not deemed
expedient to print it at present.”     I offer no comment upon a decision as
to the grounds for which I am necessarily ignorant; but being unable to

publish it in its present form.

whether the prismatic jointing is to be attributed to the con_
traction by cooling of a previously melted mass cannot with
certainty be gathered, or whether the structure is due to pre
existing concretionary or crystalline arrangement of the inte
gral particles of the mass, or to this co-acting with enormous
external pressures, the origin of which is left perfectly vague,
or to some play of successive and joint actions of all these vari
ous forces, the writer has found himself unable clearly to gather.
 Mr. Scrope, who has written somewhat at length on the subject

 traction,”  i.  e. by cooling; and      will be apparent upon collating

       Professor James Thompson, now of the University of Glasgow,
  communicated     a  paper to the Geological Section of the British
  Association in 1863 (an abstract of which appears           Brit. Assoc.

  Report, 1863, P-roc. of Sections, p. 89), in which he develops
  some new views on this subject.
       After the lapse of eleven years he has in substance repeated
   those views in a  paper on the Giant’s Causeway, read before the
   late Meeting of the British Association at Belfast (Belfast       News
                                                                       ‘
   Letter,’ August 27, 1874).        Professor Thompson has done ser
   vice to science      by
                         correcting some erroneous statements as to
   matters of fact, and         by
                               showing that concretionary or crystalline
    forces have probably had nothing to do with the production of
   prismatic and jointed structure.        He merely accepts the views
   of previous authors    as  to  the  production of the prisms'by the
    contraction of the mass; and in that part of the paper which
    alone appears to the writer to possess claim to novelty, viz. his
    explanation of the production of the cup-formed cross joints, his
   own views appear to the writer untenable.

   production of columnar and jointed structure in               somewhat

124       Mr. R. Mallet   on the Origin and Mechanism of
goes, been hitherto done.      He proposes to show that the play
of contractile forces alone is suf<U+FB01>cient, in a large mass of hu
mogeneous material, when cooling from a state of igneous
fusion, to account for all the observed phenomena of the
production, by successive <U+FB01>ssuring, of prismatic columns and
of the cross joints or “cup-formed articulations ” which se
parate these into longer or shorter pieces—and to show that
concretionary or crystalline forces perform n0 necessary part
in the process, and merely tend, through a greater or less
want of homogeneity, more or less to modify the forms into
which parts of the mass become separated.         Incidentally it Will
be pointed out that the production of such jointing, or even of
prismatic masses at all, by the mutual compression of superposed
orbicular masses, in the way imagined by Gregory Watt, De la
Beche, Scrope, and some others, is impossible and inconsistent
alike with observed facts and with the physical conditions 1n
volved,    The distinguishing characteristic of masses of prismatic
basalt, when compared with the masses of lava-streams, are
that the basaltic masses are tolerably regular in their general
form, which is usually, and on the whole, more or less tabular,
that the material before splitting up was, on the whole, very
homogeneous throughout, and that there are few or no indica
tions of joints or <U+FB01>ssurings, whether curved or straight, except
those separating the prisms themselves; whereas in great lava
streams the general forms of the whole mass are not regular
nor tabular, and present great want of homogeneity. The masses,
when large, have usually <U+FB01>lled ravines or valley, so that the lava
stream presents all the irregularities of contour of the valley
which forms its mould—its upper surface being also highly irre
gular, and the interior of the mass, owing to the mechanism of its
<U+FB02>ow, being extremely heterogeneous.         These conditions involve
immense inequalities in the rate of cooling, and in the direc
tions in which heat is principally lost at successive periods ; hence
internal strains through contraction and unequal subsidence
result, which crack and divide it (by planes which are very gene
rally curved) into masses of very various sizes and dev01d of all
regularity of form.    The fractures, in fact, are often as irregular,
and as much the result of what we may call accident, as are those
into which a large lump of red-hot glass or red-hot <U+FB02>int becomes
shattered by being thrown into water.        To speak of such irre
gular breaking up as cuboidal, or as constituting one distinct
and analyzable class of jointed structure in lavas, is merely to
give rise to confusion.
   It must be remarked, however, that this absolutely capricious
fracturing may occasionally be seen passing into something like
regularity and approach to columnar structure, where previously

            production          of   the   Prismatic Structure of Basalt.         125
unshattered lava-streams have cooled pretty symmetrically.
Local and occasional admissions of surface-water through some
of those cracks is one of the agents in their highly irregular dis.
tribution. These conditions may be well seen in some of the
great lava-<U+FB02>ows of Auvergne, which have been largely and deeply
quarried for building-stones. There is therefore no analogy or
true relationship between the capricious and accidental forces
and conditions which have broken up the mass of lava-<U+FB02>ows into
blocks of the most diverse forms and dimensions, and those quite
symmetric and determinable strains which have produced the
splitting of basalt into jointed prisms.         Yet instances occur in
great    lava-masses   of  the  irregularly  broken   up and the pris
 matic structure in different parts of the same mass.                The
conditions producing this diversity need not be here enlarged
upon.
     The primary conditions to the production of straight pris
 matic structure in basalt are general homogeneity of the ma
 terial, a tolerable regularity in the general form of the mass, and
 inequality in the rate of its cooling in one or more directions,
 1'.e. from one or more of its bounding faces.         The more or less
 horizontal and tabular masses of basalt as they occur in nature
 are usually cooled most rapidly from their upper or lower face——
 or     the basalt be found <U+FB01>lling dyke, then from the two opposite
       if                                       a
 surfaces of the adjacent rock.       Let us supposeaperfectly homo
  geneous, isotropic,    and  tabular  mass of basalt resting upon                    a
 horizontal <U+FB02>oor, all its dimensions being great and its length and
 breadth much greater than its depth.           Let us suppose     cooled   it
 entirely from the upper surface, from every portion of which there
is   an equable loss of heat, such as would result from the super
 position of     auniform mass of conducting material constantly
 maintained at      temperature inferior to that of the upper surface
                     a
  of the tabular mass of basalt. We have now to trace the pro
  gress of refrigeration and the progress and results of the internal
  strains due to its contraction       cooling. by The mass, assumed as
  originally in liquid igneous fusion and nearly at the same tem
  perature throughout, becomes less <U+FB02>uid, and <U+FB01>nally rigid at the
  surface of cooling.      Below this         in    more or less plastic
                                                     it   is   a
  condition  ;  and as the wave of heat passes outwards always
  parallel to the cooling surface, so the thickness of the rigid and
 of the viscous horizontal couches tend constantly to descend
 deeper into the mass of liquid basalt beneath.         So long as nearly
  the entire mass remains liquid or viscous, the internal strains
                       the contraction due to cooling will be resolved
                         a by
  produced in    it
  into and met       byvertical descent of the whole mass and          in        by
  ternal movements in the still imperfect liquid.         No splitting or
  <U+FB01>ssuring can take place except in such upper laminae of the mass

126      Mr. R. Mallet        on the    Origin and Mechanism of
as have by cooling already arrived at such a degree                   of rigidity   as
no longer to permit of such movements.
    The upper surface <U+FB01>lm' <U+FB01>rst arrives at that temperature at
which its rigidity becomes suf<U+FB01>cient to prevent its yielding to the
contractile strains in orthogonal directions and in the plane of
its thickness in any way, except by its splitting up into much
smaller surfaces which can draw off from contact with each other.
We have assumed the mass isotropic—that                         is,
                                                      contracting alike
in all three dimensions for equal decrement of heat. The plates
into which the rigid <U+FB01>lm tends to separate must therefore be

edges form the continuous <U+FB01>lm.           What, then, determines the
form of each of these separated plates?          The tension between
all the particles of rigid <U+FB01>lm, such as we have supposed, con
                        a

 of the <U+FB01>lm, can obviously be met             by
                                          its subdivision in two direc

 horizontal axes—that        is,   by

 of certain size and this at <U+FB01>rst sight would seem to be the sim

 the surface must become divided—the <U+FB01>rst and last having their
 sides, singly or in pairs, respectively normal to three axes in
 the plane of the <U+FB01>gure crossing each other at angles of 60",
 and in the case of the square to two such axes cr0ssing each
 other at 90°.      What, then, in nature determines her choice of
 the complicated form of six sides in place of the simpler ones of
 three and four sides respectively?        The reason is to be found in
 the    “ principle of least action,” which, as a universal law, governs
 every operation of unbalanced force, the end to be obtained (to
 restore equilibrium) being effected in such a manner as to require
 the minimum expenditure of work.            Now it can easily be shown
  that the smallest amount of work necessary to split up a given
  surface by contractile tensional forces within it will be that which
  divides it into hexagons rather than into equilateral triangles 01'
  squares, all being of equal area, and that whether the divisional
  <U+FB01>gures be large or small in proportion to the surface.
      In a mass contracting by cooling every particle tends to cause
  every other to approach nearer to it; and if we take any two
  distant points a and b at random in such a body, all the parti
  cles round each point tend to approach it with forces propor
   tional to some function of their respective distances from a and
   b.    In a line drawn from a to b there are therefore equal and
   opposite tensional forces; and when their amount exceeds the
   tensional resistance of the material, breach of continuity must
   occur somewhere across the line a b ; and as every particle along
   that line is urged by equal and opposite forces through paths
   dependent upon the elasticity and coef<U+FB01>cient of contraction of
   the material and proportional to its distance from a and 6 re
    spectively, so the point of discontinuity must occur at the middle
   point between a and b ; and if the line have determinate width
    and breadth, i. e. be a small prism of the material between a and
    6, its fracture must occur at its mid length and normal to its
   axis.    We are not concerned at present with determining the
    distance between a and b for a given material under the condi
    tions of cooling at which breach of continuity must occur; but
    we will presently return to it.      Let us apply the above reason
    ing to the rigid <U+FB01>lm forming the surface of the cooling mass of
r basalt already supposed.         As every particle tends to draw every
    other particle towardsit,    the surface of the <U+FB01>lm, when breach of
    continuity occurs, most split up into <U+FB01>gures of equal area for the
                                                              ;
    tensional pull in all directions round points in the surface such as
 a     and
        b   is   proportional to the number of particles, and to their
    distances round each, or to equal areas round each. Now the rend
    ing forces, or those tending to produce splitting up, are propor
    tional to those areas; and the resisting forces of the material
    are proportional to the perimeters separating these areas—that

is, to the lengths of the lines of fracture. Referring now to the
diagram (<U+FB01>g. 1), in which the three possible forms of subdivi
sion are shown in two adjacent triangles, squares, and hexagons,
the areas of all of which are equal, let rupture be supposed
to take place between two adjacent areas along the lines of con
tact lm of two adjacent <U+FB01>gures, the rending forces proportionate
to the areas may be supposed situated at the centre of gravity
of A and B, and to act in the directions (along the line lm) of
the short convergent arrows.           The resistance of the material to
rupture is proportional to the perimeter of the <U+FB01>gure; or, as
every side of every <U+FB01>gure is opposed to a similar side of another
adjacent <U+FB01>gure, it is proportional to lm, or to a third of the
total perimeter of the triangle, to one fourth of the perimeter of
the square, and to one sixth that of the hexagon; and the re
sistance to rupture along the lines I m is in a direction perpen
dicular to the same.       Though the total rupturing force, being
proportional   to the  area,   is equal in all the <U+FB01>gures, the effective
rupturing   force  differs  in   all three, being dependent upon the
relative obliquity   with  which     the tensile forces between A and
B act along the line lm—in other words, upon the integrals
upon all possible angles of direction along I m between the direct
pull AB and the most' oblique one               m.         lA

in the latter direction. Integrating graphically and approximately
the total rending effort along and perpendicular to the line I m in
the three respective <U+FB01>gures by dividing the angle which it sub
tends in each respectively (viz. 120° in the triangle, 90° in the
 square, and 60° in the hexagon) into an equal number of equal
parts, we <U+FB01>nd that the total e<U+FB01>'ective effort to produce rupture
along the line lm in the three <U+FB01>gures is proportional to the fol

    Splitting-up once commenced in this form at the cooling sur
face, must, as the cooled couche thickens, proceed deeper and
deeper into the mass in a direction perpendicular to the surface
of cooling, dividing the whole into hexagonal prisms, the lower
terminations of the planes of fracture between which can at any
moment never reach deeper into the mass than the distance at
which it has cooled downwards from its original temperature to
the “ splitting-temperature,” or to that at which the stiff viscous
mass still existing deeper down shall have assumed suf<U+FB01>cient
 rigidity to break when exposed to tension instead of yielding to
 it as a plastic mass. We have now to <U+FB01>x, as far as existing in
 formation will enable us, what is this superior limit of tempera
 ture at and below which splitting by contraction can commence
 and continue.     And here, as in every other portion of the sub
ject   before  us in which numerical data would be of the very
 highest importance, we have to lament their almost total absence.
 None of those who have speculated, more or less vaguely and in
 many words, upon the subject have ever thought it worth
 while to determine experimentally         the dilatation  by heat
 (1'.e. the coef<U+FB01>cient of contraction) of any one sort of basalt, or
 its extensibility at any temperature when exposed to tensile
 strain, or its total extension at rupture by such strains.     Yet
 upon our possession of such data depends our being able to de.
 termine in actual measures the diameter of the prisms into which
a given sort of basalt under given conditions shall split up. We

tallurgic slags and the temperature at which actual lava ejec

reached the surface of the mountain after their fall, they were ge
nerally too tough to be broken either               by
                                               their fall or        by

rature at which they coul          be shattered by the hammer, and
 afterwards to one at which they could be broken across                      by
a  steady strain very inferior to that which would have broken the
same mass when cooled to atmospheric temperature.               The supe
rior limit of temperature at which the <U+FB01>rst stage of rigidity was
reached was certainly below that of any “redness” visible in
daylight but in complete shadow from the sun’s rays. It was
 therefore probably below 900°F.          and the temperature of brit
                                           ;
 tleness as to static strains appeared to the writer to be reached
somewhat above 600° F., or about the melting-point of lead.
We may estimate     it,  then, as probable that the splitting tempera
ture in basalt may be reached somewhere between 900° and
600° F., and that while the material             above the superior of
                                                     is

                                            the contractile strains pro
duced    by  slow cooling cannot occur, but that the effective con
tractile strains will be relieved            by
                                            the stretching and distor
tion of the still plastic mass. We have no actual data as to
the amount of contraction for given decrement of temperature
for basalt. We may, however, approximate to                  by reference
                                                               it
to the author’s experimental determination of the coef<U+FB01>cient of
total contraction between 3700° and 53° F. of iron furnace-slags
having   a  chemical constitution closely resembling the mean of
most basalts, as recorded in his paper “ On the Nature and

           production of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.        131
  Origin of Volcanic Heat and Energy” (Phil. Trans. Part 1,
 1873), from which results he has since calculated partial mean
 coe<U+FB02>icients for each 500°, or thereabouts, within the above
 limits. The partial mean coef<U+FB01>cient for temperatures between
 900° and 600° F. gives a lineal contraction =0'00000396 per
 unit of length for 1° F. We may therefore provisionally con
 clude that basalt in cooling from the brittle point, or 600° F.,
 may sustain a contraction for each 100 degrees of temperature
lost of 0000396 of a foot taken as unit, or of nearly 0'4 of a
 millimetre per metre in length.        We know not at what amount
 of tensile strain per square inch of section basalt, within the
  limits of temperature here in question, will be torn asunder by
 mechanical tension, nor have we any information as to what is
 the amount of extension of the material at rupture, though we
 may be pretty certain that its tensile strength is considerable
  though probably inferior to that of glass, and its extensibility
 extremely small though probably greater than that of glass.         It
 is certain, however, that Whenever, upon a line as ab (supra)
 of whatever length, the amount of contraction by cooling
 through a given range of temperature exceeds the amount of
 extension upon the same length that would produce rupture,
then splitting in one or more places between a and 6 must
occur.     It does not seem probable that the ultimate extension
of basalt at rupture at any temperature below 600° would reach
as much as 2 millims. per metre; and if so, a reduction of
 500° Fahr. in temperature would be more than suf<U+FB01>cient to
 originate splitting.   It is obvious also that the diameter of the
prisms in any given instance depends mainly upon the nume~
rical relations of these coef<U+FB01>cients of contraction and of extensi
bility.    The upper-surface <U+FB01>lm of the mass of basalt having once
commenced to subdivide        itself, as illustrated with exaggeration
in <U+FB01>g. 2, the splitting proceeds downwards into the mass pari

thinnest at the lower part, where the time of cooling has been the
shortest.   We have now to consider the mode of production of
the cross joints or articulated cup-like fractures observed in
these prisms, and to show that they too are fully accounted for
by the play of contractile forces.    Before proceeding to this, it
should be remarked that the cooling effects due to the pro
gress of splitting asunder of the prisms, will be far more marked
than might be at <U+FB01>rst supposed.     Geological facts tend strongly
to the conclusion that most basalts over<U+FB02>owed from <U+FB01>ssures
under water.     Whether the liquid basalt <U+FB02>owed directly into
contact with water or spread itself out laterally between a more
solid bottom and a mass of loose matter resting upon        it,
                                                             or Was
poured out sub die and exposed to rain &c., water would cer
tainly <U+FB01>nd its way into all the joint-<U+FB01>ssures opened betWeen the
prisms, and with an energy proportioned to the depth or head
of water above it. Nor would the repulsion known to exist be,

         production   of   the   Primatic Structure of Basalt.    133
tween highly heated bodies and liquids such as water, as
shown by Boutigny’s experiments, here come into play to re
sist the entrance of the water fully into the <U+FB01>ssure; for, as we
have seen, the splitting of the mass cannot commence except
in those portions of it which have fallen to 600° Fabr. The
temperatures of the sides of the prisms already split, and thus
much below 600°, would therefore exercise no repulsion to
the water which descended into these <U+FB01>ssures, but would be for
the most part at such temperatures as have been found the most
favourable for the rapid communication of their heat to the
water, and the production from it of steam at a pressure due to
the superincumbent head.         The conjoint action, therefore, of
 steam so produced demanding avast supply for latent heat, and
of rapid and circulatory movements given to the sheets of water
within the <U+FB01>ssures, would tend most powerfully to lower the tem
 perature of the prisms, and that with an energy the greater as
 they became longer by the <U+FB01>ssures extending more deeply into
the mass.
    It has been urged by some auth0rs that water cannot have
 entered the <U+FB01>ssures between the prisms, inasmuch as these are
 frequently found so close as not to admit the blade of a
 table-knife ; but even if this closeness were universal, water
 would freely enter and ooze through such <U+FB01>ssures at a mode
 rate pressure.    The actual water-pressure, however, to which
 many amygdaloidal basalts have been exposed must have been
 very great ; for it has forced the sea~water and its saline contents
 in solution through the substance of the prisms as if through a
 <U+FB01>ltering-stone, and so enabled the cavities of such basalt to be
 come gradually <U+FB01>lled with hydrous minerals, zeolites, chalcedo
 nies, &c.    Besides this, the thinnest <U+FB01>lm of water within the
 <U+FB01>ssures must tend to widen these by hydrostatic pressure.           It
 may   also be remarked   that an over<U+FB02>ow of  basalt covering   a level   I
 surface must, by heating that surface, raise it slightly into a con
 vex umbo, whence the <U+FB01>ssures and prisms, when formed, must be
 come slightly divergent; but after the whole has cooled com
 pletely, the umbo will disappear by contraction down to the ori
 ginal level surface, or even somewhat below it; and so all the
 prisms will approach each other towards their upper extremities,
 and thus in an after age be found to grip one another and be in
 closer proximity than at the time of their <U+FB01>rst formation.         Re
 turning now to the production of cross joints, we have assumed
 the tabular mass of basalt to be isotropic, its coef<U+FB01>cient of con
  traction being thus the samcin the vertical direction, or parallel
 to the axes of the prisms, asin the two others orthogonal thereto
 or horizontal.    Were the temperature in any given section of a
 prism transverse to its axis the same throughout          e. the axial
                                                           (1'.

portion of     a prism no hotter than the exterior),        then no reason
could be assigned why transverse          fractures  or cross  joints should
be produced at all however long the prism; for every prism
being free and independent from its summit at S S (<U+FB01>g. 4) down'
to BB (the lowest point at which splitting is actually taking
place*), the contraction of every prism lengthways would be
met simply by the shortening or subsidence of the prism itself.
But the exterior of every prism is colder than the interior por
tion, the difference in temperature between the exterior and in
terior portions being greatest at some point between BB and
S S (<U+FB01>g. 4). Differential strains in approximately the longitu
dinal direction are therefore produced in each prism; so that
taking for origin the <U+FB01>rst cooled <U+FB01>lm S S (<U+FB01>g. 4), the outer por
tions contracting most, tend to pull off or upwards or to approach
S S in the direction of the arrows as seen in <U+FB01>g. 5, and to leave
the central portions C behind for the time.                                  -
The effect of this inequality of strain is the
                                                          s      ’
same in result as that which would be pro
duced by some external force tending to
draw upwards or in one direction the ex
ternal parts of the prism, and to leave
behind or relatively to push downwards
or in the opposite direction the central
parts thereof; and if the differential
 strains be suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful to origi
 nate transverse fracture, this must com
 mence all round the circumference of the
 prism at some point of its length, and travel
 inwards until the whole prism becomes divided by a transvere
joint, which will happen when the central portions have cooled
 down to the same temperature as that at which the external
 portions began to divide transversely; and such joints will repeat
 themselves at de<U+FB01>nite intervals along each prism, proceeding
 downwards from the <U+FB01>rst or highest one, lm, <U+FB01>g. 4.                  We have
 supposed our illustrative mass of basalt isotropic, contraction for
 equal decrements of temperature being the same in all directions.
 Under any given conditions as to the material and mode of cool
 ing, the <U+FB01>rst or uppermost transverse joint cannot occur nearer
 the top surface S S, <U+FB01>g. 4, than the diameter from side to side of
     * In consequence of the elasticity of the material, the plane passing
 through all the splitting-points at any instant will be found a little deeper
  (by a distance which will be nearly constant) than, or in advance of the
  isothermal couche to which the splitting is due (viz. 600° to 900° Fahr.),
 just as a cleft produced by a wedge driven into an elastic block of wood
  extends somewhat further than the point of the wedge itself; this remark
  also applies to the transverse joints of the prism, hereafter referred to.

the diameters of the prisms, a b, <U+FB01>g. 4, equal to the distance be
tween their centres A, B, decide also the length of line a l,
in which the contractile strain becomes suf<U+FB01>cient to fracture the
material.     The distance at will actually somewhat exceed this,
becaue the temperature of the prism at the place of the <U+FB01>rst
joint is higher than at the surface S S ; and the distance between
the <U+FB01>rst and the second joint lower down will be somewhat greater
than that of the <U+FB01>rst from the top; but after a certain length
has been attained by the prisms, if their material were perfectly
homogeneous and isotropic and the temperature of the unsplit
mass the same at all depths, the distance between the joints
 would become constant, and never greatly exceed the diameter
 of the prism if that be large.
    In nature the mass of basalt is never perfectly homogeneous
 or isotropic; and we shall hereafter consider the effects of the
 want of homogeneity, as well as of the diameter of the prisms,
 in disturbing the lengths between the joints.

     The <U+FB01>rst of these varieties (which occurs at Lerni, Delaware
 Co., Pa.) has the following characters :—The unaltered mineral
 is of a dull sea-green colour, has a highly developed micaceous
 structure, is an aggregate of rough hexagonal plates, and of ver
 imperfect external form.        It is transparent in moderately thin
 laminae, and is free from enclosed foreign matter.            The optical
 characters of the mineral closely resemble those of the Culsagee
 variety of vermiculite, the angle between the optical axes varying
 in different parts of the same laminae from 18° to 0°. Its hard
 ness is about 1'5 ,- and three determinations of its speci<U+FB01>c gravity
  (taken in alcohol at 23° C.) gave 2'409, 2'368, and 2373.

    The mineral was prepared for analysis by drying at 100° until
its weight was constant, and in this condition was easily decom
posed by hydrochloric acid.                 The bases, after the separation of
silica, were converted into nitrates and separated by Deville’s
process.     The iron and alumina were weighed together as oxides,
and the magnesia as the pyrophosphate.                      The amount and con
dition of the iron were determined by decomposing the mineral
by the process described by the writer in Silliman’s American
 Journal, v01. xliv. p. 347, estimating by a standard solution of
potassic permanganate the ferrous iron at once, and the total
 amount of iron after reduction to the ferrous state.                             Small
 amounts of lithium and potassium were found by the spcctro~
 scope in the residue obtained in Smith’s process for the deter

vermiculites and magnesian micas.     The hardness of the mineral
is about 1'5; two determinations of its speci<U+FB01>c gravity (taken

    The writer has described (loc. cit.) the remarkablehygroscopic
 properties of the vermiculites, and the dif<U+FB01>culty of separating
 the constitutional from the hygroscopic water which they may
 contain.   The varieties from Lerni and Pelham offer the same
 dif<U+FB01>culty in the determination of their water, thirty to forty
 hours being required to bring one or two grammes of either of
 them to a constant weight at 100° C.
    In obtaining a constant temperature of 100° C., an electric
 regulator was used which differs from other similar forms of ap
 paratus in simplicity of construction.           The current is made or
 broken by a very slight rise or fall of mercury in a U-tube con
nected with a glass bulb within the air-bath.                By means of a
pressure-tap   which     closes an   open  L  of the   connecting tube, the
 air within the  bulb    may be con<U+FB01>ned as soon as the bath reaches
 the required temperature.         After this a very slight increase of
temperature raises the mercury column suf<U+FB01>ciently to close the
electric circuit, and then the current shuts the cock which regu
lates the supply of gas to the burner under the bath.              The chief
advantage    and   the  novelty  of  the  apparatus    is to be found in the
 simplicity of this stopcock, which was suggested by Professor
 H. B. Hill. It consists of an ordinary chloride-of-calcium tube
placed horizontally, and closed at the larger end by a rubber
stopper which allows a considerable freedom of motion to a
smaller glass tube passing through it; by this the illuminating
gas enters the chloride-of-calcium         tube, from which it passes to
the burner.      When the current is closed, an electromagnet act
ing on an armature attached to the outer end of the small tube
plunges the curved inner end beneath the surface of some mer
cury in the bulb of the chloride-of-calcium tube and thus shuts
off the main supply of gas, although a small ori<U+FB01>ce in the side of
the inner tube allows a suf<U+FB01>cient flow to keep the <U+FB02>ame under
the air-bath alive.      The variation of the temperature of the air
bath does not ordinarily exceed one or two degrees during periods
of <U+FB01>fteen to twenty hours, even under great variations of pressure
in the gas-mains.

    The marked hygroscopic character of the Culsagee, Lerni,
and Pelham vermiculites led to the idea that the discrepancies
between the published analyses of Je<U+FB01>'erisite and Hallite might
be due to the hygroscopic nature of these minerals.                           The water
contained in each of them was therefore carefully again deter
mined. Table V. gives the percentages of water found in air
 dried specimens of Jefferisite ; analyses (1), (2), and (4) of
Table VI. give the percentages of water found in the same spe
cimens dried at 100° ; (3a) gives the percentages of water found
in the mineral dried for three months over sulphuric acid, and
(3 b) the percentages found in the same specimen subsequently
dried at 100° C.

    The mean of (1), (2), (3b), and                            (4) of Table VI. is 1051.
    It would appear             from       analyses (3) that the amounts of water
lost at 100° 0., and over sulphuric acid during a period of three
months, are very nearly identical.                                 Assuming that 1051 (the
mean of the four determinations above) represents the percentage
of water in the mineral dried at 100°, the following scheme con

142              Prof.    J.   P. Cooke and Mr. F. A. Gooch                              on two
only about 3 per cent., showing that it holds its water much
more <U+FB01>rmly than the <U+FB01>rst.      In order to institute a just compa
rison between the different vermiculites, it is obviously important
to seek for each variety the point at which the mineral assumes
a constant condition and maintains it through a considerable
variation of temperature.    Save only some practical convenience,
there is no peculiar virtue in 100°, as the temperature at which
a mineral should be dried for analysis.     As in the case of crys
 talline salts, we should expect to <U+FB01>nd for each hydrous mineral
 acertain point or points of temperature at which it loses the
whole or a part of its water of crystallization, and certain limits
between which it maintains a constant composition.         Moreover
we should expect that these temperatures would be the more
de<U+FB01>nite in proportion as what we may callthe hygroscopic power
is the more marked—that while in some cases the mineral
would lose its water at a nearly constant temperature, and the
intervals of de<U+FB01>nite hydration would be well marked, in others
the loss would extend over a considerable range of temperature,
and it would be more dif<U+FB01>cult to secure the states of de<U+FB01>nite
composition.     That such differences as these are conspicuous
among the vermiculites the Tables given above abundantly show ;
but in addition to this evidence, the di<U+FB01>erence in the behaviour
of the several varieties, when heated, impressed upon us more
strongly the principle we have stated than the <U+FB01>gures would in
dicate.    Nevertheless, as the following Table shows, we have
been able to bring all the vermiculites to essentially the same
condition.    The Table is merely a summing-up of the results
already given, and exhibits a comparison of the atomic ratios*
of the several varieties.                        .

in the vermiculites       water of crystallization.

 Norman Loekyer, F.R.S.
     I beg permission to lay before the Royal Society a. portion of the
 new map of the solar spectrum referred to in one of my former
 communications.                         .
     It consists of the portion between w.1. 39 and 41.
     I have found it necessary, in order to include all the lines visible
 in my photographs in such a manner that coincidences may be
 clearly shown, to construct it on four times the scale of Kngstrtim’s
  “ Spectre Normal.”
     The spectra of the following elements have been photographed
  side by side with the solar spectrum and the coincidences shown :—
               Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Ce, U, Cr, Ba, Sr, Ca, K, A1.
     The wave—lengths of new lines in the portion of this spectrum
 at present completed have been obtained from curves _of graphical
 interpolation.       Instead of the reading of a micrometer—scale, a pho
 tographic print of the spectrum has been employed in the con—
  struction of these curves, the wave—lengths of the principal lines
  being taken from an unpublished map of the ultra-violet region of
  the solar spectrum, a copy of which has been kindly placed at my
_ disposal by M. Cornu.        The photograph of the solar spectrum from
  the ultra-violet to beyond F, kindly given to me by Mr. Rutherfurd,
  has also proved of great service in the present work.                 I  have, in fact,
  up to the present time, only been able to excel this photograph in
  the region about H.
     From the extreme dif<U+FB01>culty of carrying on eye—observations
  upon the portion of the spectrum now completed, Xngstro'm’s map
  is, of course, very incomplete about this region. The few lines
  mapped differ slightly in some cases from the positions assigned by
 'Cornu; but the wave-lengths giVen by the latter observer generally
  fall into the curve without breaking its symmetry, and these posi—
  tions have therefore been adopted.             The advantage possessed by
  the photographic method over eye—observation may be estimated
  from the following numerical comparisons :—

“ On Acoustic Reversibility.” By J. Tyndall, D.O.L., LL.D., F.R.S.
  On the 2lst and 22nd of June, 1822, a Commission appointed
by the Bureau of Longitudes of France executed a celebrated
series of experiments on the velocity of sound.      Two stations had
been chosen, the one at Villejuif, the other  at Montlhéry, both lying
south of Paris, and   11'6 miles  distant  from   each other.  Prony,
Mathieu, and Arago were the observers at Villejuif, while Hum—
boldt, Bouvard, and Gay—Lussac were at Montlhéry. Guns, charged
sometimes with 2 lbs. and sometimes with 3 lbs. of powder, were
<U+FB01>red at both stations, and the velocity was deduced from the interval
between the appearance of the <U+FB02>ash and the arrival of the sound.
    On this memorable occasion an observation was made which, as
far as I   know, has remained a scienti<U+FB01>c enigma to the present
hour.    It was noticed that while every report of the cannon <U+FB01>red
at Montlhéry was heard with the greatest distinctness at Ville
juif, by far the greater number of the reports from Villejuif failed
to reach Montlhéry. Had wind existed, and had it blown from
Montlhéry to Villejuif, it would have been recognized as the cause
of the observed difference ; but the air at the time was calm, the
slight motion of translation actually existing being from Villejuif
towards Montlhéry, or against the direction in which the sound was
best heard.
   So marked was the difference in transmissive power between the
two directions, that on the 22nd of June, while every shot <U+FB01>red at
Montlhéry was heard “ a merveille at Villejuif, but one shot out
                                       ”
of twelve <U+FB01>red at Villejuif was heard, and that feebly, at the other
station.
   With the caution which characterized him on other occasions, and
which has been referred to admiringly by F araday", Arago made
no attempt to explain this anomaly. His words are :—“ Quant
aux di<U+FB01>érences si remarquables d’intensité que le bruit du canon
a toujours présentés suivant qu’il se propageaient du nord au sud
entre Villejuif et Montlhéry, ou du and au nord entre cette seconde
station et la premiere ; nous ne chercherons pas aujourd’hui a Per:
pliquer, parce que nous ne pourrions olfrir au lecteur que des con
jectures denuées de preuves”      ‘l’.
I     have tried, after much perplexity of thought, to bring this
subject within the range of experiment, and have now to sub
mit to the Royal Society     apossible solution of the enigma. The
<U+FB01>rst step was to ascertain Whether the sensitive <U+FB02>ame referred
to in my recent paper in the Philosophical Transactions could
be safely employed in experiments on the mutual reversibility
ofa   source of sound and an object on which the sound impinges.

              Prof. Tyndall   0n Acoustic Reversibility.            147
Now the sensitive <U+FB02>ame usually employed by me measures from
18 to 24 inches in height, while the reed employed as a source of
sound is less than a square quarter of an inch in area. If, there—
fore, the whole <U+FB02>ame, or the pipe which fed        it,
                                                     were sensitive to
sonorous vibrations, strict experiments on reversibility with the
reed and <U+FB02>ame might be dif<U+FB01>cult,         not impossible.
                                          if               Hence my
desire to learn Whether the seat of sensitiveness was so localized in
the <U+FB02>ame as to render the contemplated interchange of <U+FB02>ame and
reed permissible.      -
   The <U+FB02>ame being placed behind         cardboard screen, the shank
                                          a.
of  a funnel passed through   a  hole in the cardboard was directed
upon the middle of the <U+FB02>ame.       The sound-waves issuing from the
vibrating reed placed within the funnel produced no sensible
effect upon the <U+FB02>ame.    Shifting the funnel so as to direct its shank
upon the root of the <U+FB02>ame, the action was violent.
   To augment the precision of the experiment, the funnel was con
nected with a  glass tube 3  feet long and half an inch in diameter,
the object being to weaken by distance the e<U+FB02>ect of the waves dif
fracted round the edge of the funnel, and to permit those only
which passed through the glass tube to act upon the <U+FB02>ame.
   Presenting the end of the tube to the ori<U+FB01>ce of the burner (b,
<U+FB01>g. 1), or the ori<U+FB01>ce to the end of the tube, the <U+FB02>ame was vio
lently agitated by the sounding-reed, B. On shifting the tube,
or the burner, so as to concentrate the sound on           portion of
                                                           a
                                Fig.      1.
the <U+FB02>ame about half an inch above the ori<U+FB01>ce, the action was
'nil. Concentrating the sound upon the burner itself about half
an inch below its ori<U+FB01>ce, there was no action.
   These experiments demonstrate the localization of “the seat of
sensitiveness,” and they prove the <U+FB02>ame to be an appropriate in
strument for the contemplated experiments on reversibility.            ‘
   The experiments proceeded thus z—The sensitive <U+FB02>ame bemg
placed close behind   a  screen of cardboard 18 inches high by 12
inches wide,  a  vibrating reed, standing at the same height as the
root of the <U+FB02>ame, was placed at distance of
                                   a              6 feet on the other       ‘
side of the  screen.    The  sound  of the reed, in this   POSItIOII, pro
duced   astrong agitation   of the <U+FB02>ame.                 .
                                                         _
   The whole upper half of           <U+FB02>ame was here visible from the
                                  thisJ   2

148                           Royal Society     :
 reed  ; hence the necessity of the foregoing experiments to prove
the action of the sound on the upper portion of the <U+FB02>ame to be m'l,
and that the waves had really to bend round the edge of the screen
so as to reach the seat of sensitiveness in the neighbourhood of the
burner.
    The positions of the <U+FB02>ame and reed were reversed, the latter
being now close behind the screen, and the former at a distance
of 6 feet from it.        The sonorous vibrations were without sen—
                                                               '
sible action upon the <U+FB02>ame.                         .
    The experiment was repeated and varied in many ways._ Screens
of various sizes were employed; and instead of reversing the posi
tions of the <U+FB02>ame and reed, the screen was moved so as to bring,
in some experiments the <U+FB02>ame, and in other experiments the reed,
close behind it.     Care was also taken that no re<U+FB02>ected sound from
the walls or ceiling of the laboratory, or from the body of the expe—
rimenter, should have any thing to do with the e<U+FB01>eet. In all cases
it was shown that the sound was e<U+FB01>ective when the reed was at
a. distance from the screen and the <U+FB02>ame close behind it; while
the
  '
      action was insensible when these positions were reversed.
    Thus, let s e, <U+FB01>g. 2, be a vertical section of the screen. When the
reed was at A and the <U+FB02>ame at B there was no action ; when the
                                   Fig.   2.
                      6
 reed was at B and the <U+FB02>ame at A the action was decided.            It may
 be added that the vibrations communicated to the screen             itself,
  and from it to the air beyond    it,
                                     were without e<U+FB01>ect; for when the
 reed, which at  B   is effectual, was shifted to   C,where its action on
 the screen was greatly augmented,          ceased to have any action on
                                           it
 the <U+FB02>ameat A.
    We are now, think, prepared to consider the failure of rever
                I
 sibility in the larger experiments of 1822.      Happily an incidental
 observation of great signi<U+FB01>cance comes here to our aid.            It was
 observed and recorded at the time that while the reports of the
 guns at Villejuif were without echoes, roll of echoes, lasting from
                                                a
 20 to 25 seconds, accompanied every shot at Montlhe'ry, being heard
 by the observers there. Arago, the writer of the Report, referred
‘these echoes to re<U+FB02>ection from the clouds, an explanation which         I
 think we are entitled to regard as problematical. The report says
 that “ tous les coups tirés   a  Montlhéry     étaient accompagnés d’un
                                                y
 roulement semblable      acelui du tonnerre.”      have italicized a very
                                                    I
 signi<U+FB01>cant word—a word which fairly applies to our experiments
 on gun-sounds at the South Foreland, where there was no sensible

               Prof. Tyndall on Acoustic Reversibility.            149
solution of continuity between explosion and echo, but which could
hardly apply to echoes coming from the clouds. For supposing the
clouds to be only a mile distant, the sound and its echo would
have been separated by an interval of nearly ten seconds.         But
there is no mention of any interval ; and had such existed, surely
the word “ followed,” instead of “accompanied,” would have been
the one employed.       The echoes, moreover, appear to have been
continuous, while the clouds observed seem to have been separate.
“ Ces
         phénoménes,” says Arago, “n’ont jamais eu lieu qu’au mo
ment de l’apparition de quelques nuages.”         But from separate
clouds a continuous roll of echoes could hardly come.        When to
this is added the experimental fact that clouds far denser than any
ever formed in the atmosphere are demonstrably incapable of sen—
sibly re<U+FB02>ecting sound, while cloudless air, which Arago pronounced
echoless, has been proved capable of powerfully re<U+FB02>ecting          it,
                                                                    I
think we have strong reason to question the hypothesis of the
illustrious French philosopher.
     And considering the hundreds of shots <U+FB01>red at the South Fore
land, with the attention specially directed to the aerial echoes,
when no single case occurred in which echoes of measurable dura
tion did not accompany the report of the gun,       I   think Arago’s
statement that at Villejuif no echoes were heard when the sky
was clear must simply mean that they vanished with great rapi
dity.     Unless the attention were specially directed to the point, a
slight prolongation of the cannon-sound might well escape obser
vation and
      ;        it would be all the more likely to do so   ifthe echoes
were so loud and prompt as to form apparently part and parcel of
the direct sound.
 I     should be very 10th to transgress here the limits of fair criti
 cism, or to throw doubt, without good reason, on the recorded ob
 servations of an eminent man. Still, taking into account what has
 been just stated, and remembering that the minds of Arago and
his colleagues were occupied by totally di<U+FB01>erent problem (that
                                    a
 the echoes were an incident rather than an object of observation),
I   think we may justly consider the sound which he called “instan
 taneous as one whose aerial echoes did not di<U+FB01>erentiate them
          l’
 selves from the direct sound by any noticeable fall of intensity,
and which rapidly died into silence.
     Turning now to the observations at Montlhéry, we are struck
 by the extraordinary duration of the echoes heard at that station.
 At the South Foreland the charge habitually <U+FB01>red was equal to
 the largest of those employed by the French philosophers      ;but on
no occasion did the gun sounds produce echoes approaching to 20
 or 25 seconds’ duration.       It rarely reached half this amount.
Even the syren-echoes, which were more remarkable and more
 long—continued    than those of the gun, never reached the duration
 of the'Montlhéry echoes.      The nearest approach to     was on the
                                                          it
 17th of October, 1873, when the syren-echoes required 15 seconds
to subside into silence.         -        .    _    ,
     On this same day, moreover (and this      is   apoint of marked

150                    Royal Society :—
signi<U+FB01>cance), the transmitted sound reached its maximum range,
the gun sounds being heard at the Quenocs buoy, which is 16%
nautical miles from the South Foreland.                I
                                               have already stated that
                                                                      ”
the duration of the air-echoes indicates “ the atmospheric depths
from which they come". An optical analogy may help us here.
Let light fall upon chalk, the light is wholly scattered by the
super<U+FB01>cial particles; let the chalk be powdered and mixed with
water, light reaches the observer from a far greater depth of the
turbid liquid.    The solid chalk typi<U+FB01>es the action of exceedingly
dense acoustic clouds ; the chalk and water that of clouds of mode
rate density. In the one case we have echoes of short, in the other
echoes of long duration.      These considerations prepare us for the
inference that Montlhéry, on the occasion referred to, must have
been surrounded by a highly diacoustic atmosphere; while the
shortness of the echoes at Villejuif shows the atmosphere sur
rounding that station to have been acoustically opaque.
   Have we any clue to the cause of the opacity?              think we  I
have.    Villejuif is close to Paris, and over it, with the observed
light wind, was slowly wafted the air from the city. Thousands of
chimneys to windward of Villejuif were discharging their heated
currents ; so that an atmosphere non—homogeneous in a high degree
must have surrounded that station. At no great height in the
atmosphere the equilibrium of temperature would be established.
The non-homogeneous air surrounding Villejuif is experimentally
typi<U+FB01>ed by our screen with the source of sound close behind                           it,
the upper edge of the screen representing the place where equi
librium of temperature was established in the atmosphere above
the station. In virtue of its proximity to the screen, the echoes
from our sounding—reed would, in the case here supposed, so blend
with the direct sound as to be practically indistinguishable from                     it,
as the echoes at Villejuif followed the direct sound so hotly, and
vanished so rapidly, that they escaped observation. And as our
sensitive <U+FB02>ame, at a    distance, failed to be aifected            by
                                                          the sounding
body placed close behind the card-board screen, so,         take   Idid         it,
the observers at Montlhéry fail to hear the sounds of the Villejuif
gun.    This is   the explanation of Arago’s difficulty which      have     I

     Two tin tubes      (MN       and O P, <U+FB01>g'. 3) with open ends are placed
   so as to form an acute         angle with each other. At the end of one

  Rocks of North America.”              By Prof. H. Alleyne Nicholson, M.D.,
  D.Sc-.,    F.R.S.E., F.G.S.
      In    this paper the author accepted the union of Ghatetes and
  Stenopora made by Milne-Edwards and Haime, and stated that
  Monticulipom, D’Orb., and Nebulipora, McCoy, also seemed to him
  to belong to the same generic group, for which he proposed                to
  employ the name O'hwtetes.           The genus thus de<U+FB01>ned he proposed to
  divide into 4 groups, under which he described the following North
  American species :—

 Duncan, F.R.S., F.G.S.
      The specimen noticed by the author was obtained from the Low
  Main Coal-seam of Newsham, Northumberland. _ The component
  bones are a parasphenoid and a pair of pterygo-palatals.            The left
  dental plate agrees with the type of O'tenodus cristatus (Agassiz) in
  the Leeds Museum.           The author describes the bones and teeth in
  detail. He regards Otenodus as closely related to Ceratodus in the
_structure of the palate, and as differing but little from the Devonian
 Dipterus.                                 ,         .             ..

Leicester.”     By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.
    This paper consists of a detailed description of the strata exposed
at a little distance from the railway-station at Stratford-on-Avon
and at Kineton, and of the evidence of the existence of the Insect
beds near Knowle in Warwickshire.          The author also records the
discovery of the Rhaetics near Leicester by Mr. Harrison.             The
following is the section at the brick-pit at the base of the Spinney
Hills, in ascending order—twenty feet of red and blue marls, twenty
feet of hard <U+FB01>ssured sandy marl containing <U+FB01>sh-scales, and <U+FB01>fteen
feet of black and light-coloured shales full of fossils.       The beds
appear to dip to the 8.13.
    11.  “ The Resemblances of Ichthyosaurian Bones to the bones of
other Animals.”      By Harry Govier Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    Hitherto in comparative anatomy the term af<U+FB01>nity has been
 vaguely used in treating of the extinct groups.      In this paper the
 author endeavoured to give precision to the term Ichthyosaurian by
 analyzing the characters of the Ichthyosaurian skeleton into the
 resemblances which it presents to the skeletons of other Vertebrates.
 Ichthyosaurian characters are subdivided into Mammalian, Avian,
 Crocodilian, Chelonian, Lacertilian, Chamaeleonian, lthynchocepha
 liau, Ophidian, Urodelan, Piscine, Plesiosaurian, Dinosaurian, Dicy
 nodont, and Labyrinthodont.        By thus classifying the characters it
 is anticipated that the af<U+FB01>nities of the Ichthyosaurian type may be
rendered    evident.

 other Animals.”     By Harry Govier Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.

 saurian skeleton.
     13. “ On the Tibia of Megalornis, a large Struthious Bird from
 the London Clay.”      By Harry Govier Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    The author described the distal portion of a right tibia of a large
 struthious bird from the London Clay of Eastchurch in Sheppey.
 The only living types approximating to it are the Apteryx, which
 similarly has the shaft at the back of the distal articulation, and the
 Emu, which similarly has the shaft compressed from back to front.
 The author considered that the skull named by Prof. Owen Dasomz's
 might, if it belonged to a bird, be referred to Megalomis; but he
 detailed considerations which led him to suggest that Dasornis may
 possibly be a <U+FB01>sh.

  (Seeley), from the Cambridge Upper Greensand.” By Harry Govier
 'Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
     The author described in detail a cervical and a dorsal vertebra of
  a precocious Crocodile from the Cambridge Upper Greensand, which

154                      Geological Society.
in  the main presented the character of a young existing Crocodile
coupled with distinctive features.      The centrum of the cervical ver
tebra is oblique, and  the  neural  canal  of the dorsal vertebra is small
as in  Hyposaurus.    The   species is of small  size.
   15.  “ On the base of a large Lacertian Skull from the Potton
Sands.” By Harry Govier Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   This specimen was interpreted by the author as the anchylosed
basioccipital and basisphenoid of a Dinosaur.          It showed a resem
blance to Crocodiles in its posterior aspect, but in all other respects
was Lacertian ; it makes a close approximation to Hatteria, and in
no respect shows af<U+FB01>nity to birds.         The pterygoid processes look
downward, and the basioccipital condyle looks downward and
backward. The base of the brain-cavity is long and narrow, while
itsanterior border corresponds to an imperfectly ossi<U+FB01>ed <U+FB01>brocarti
lage seen in the same position in Hatteria.            The author did not
regard the specimen as giving support to Prof. Huxley’s hypothesis
of the Avian af<U+FB01>nities of Dinosaurs.
   16.  “ A Section through the Devonian strata of West         Somerset.”
By Barry Govier Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   In 1867 the author had visited the Devonian country in search
                          J
of the fault which Mr. ukes supposed to traverse Devon and West
Somerset.    He satis<U+FB01>ed himself by sectional evidence that no fault
existed, and in a section from Hurlstone Point to Brushford has
noted down the mineral character of the successive groups of strata
forming the country, and the only folds of the strata seen by him on
that line of section.     He thought that Mr. Etheridge’s detailed
grouping of the rocks was better suited to the N.W. part of the
country than to West Somerset, and that for that region the divisions
                       J
of strata used by Mr. nkes were convenient.
   17. “ On the Pectoral Arch and Fore Limb of Ophthalmosaurus.”
By Harry Govier Seeley, Esq, F.L.S., F.G.S.
   After some remarks on the structure of the pectoral arch in 12k
thyosaums, the author described parts of a skeleton discovered by
Mr. Leeds in the Oxford Clay, on which he founded the genus
 Ophthalmosaurus.
   The pectoral arch comprised the usual bones; but their relation to
each other was unusual.        The clavicles form a strong arch; the
lateral clavicles join behind by interlacing sutnral union, and not
by overlap ; while in front the episternum (or interclaviole) is
Wedged in between them so as to divide them.              The coracoids are
expanded and grasped by the clavicles in a depression in their mar
gins ; the scapula is large.
   The humerus shows the usual Ichthyosaurian characters, and has
three facets at the distal end.       To these correspond three bones in
the forearm, the olecranon-ossi<U+FB01>cation being two thirds as large as
the radius.    The single row of carpal bones includes four elements.

         ON THE TEMPERATURE         or THE   SUN.      BY  J.-B. sonn'r*.
                                                    Geneva, 14th Oct. 1874.
  I   HAVE read with very great interest the Notes, on the tempera»
      ture of the sun, which you have communicated to the Academy in
  the name of M. Violle, a distinguished philosopher, who, besides
  his original works, is entitled to the gratitude of all physicists for
  the important part he has taken in the publication of Verdet’s
  G'uvres.     You, perhaps, remember that         I have for several years
  been occupied in researches which, as regards the means of obser
  vation, are very similar to those of M. Violle.        I  have already made
                                          I
  known some of the results 1' ; and hope to be able shortly to make
  these investigations the subject of a more complete publication,
  which    I  have been obliged to defer because a correction rather
  dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain remained to be determined.
      These measurements of the calori<U+FB01>c intensity of solar radiation
  are,   I  believe, very interesting in divers respects ; but         I doubt
  whether, in the present state of science, they can lead to the deter
  mination of the temperature of the sun.
      The principle of the apparatus, or actinometer, successively em
  ployed for these observations, <U+FB01>rst by Pouillet (who soon ado ted
  a di<U+FB01>erent method), then by Mr. Waterston, Father Secchi<U+FB01>tf .
  Ericson, M. Violle, and myself, consists in placing a thermo
  meter with a blackened bulb in an enclosure of which the tempera
  ture 6 is known.        An aperture admits into the enclosed space a
  pencil   of solar  rays,  which falls upon the bulb of the thermometer,
  which takes a temperature t.
‘
      In order to be able to deduce from this the temperature of the
   sun, it would be necessary <U+FB01>rst of all to know the law of the ra
  diation of heat at very elevated temperatures. Sometimes Newton’s
  law has been assumed, sometimes that of Dulong and Petit. Now
  neither the one nor the other is accurate for high temperatures:
  this appears to me to follow very distinctly from a series of ex
  periments which       I  made known two years sincei.          Permit me to
  recapitulate the results, referring for the details to the Notes which
  I  have published.

      With the actinometer which employed, the solar radiation at
   Geneva produces an excess of temperature t— 6 which exceeds 14°'5.

    same as that of the sun,             I
                                obtain an excess of temperature t—O of
    0°'5 only. The temperature of the disk is at least equal to, and
    probably exceeds, that at which platinum fuses; it may therefore
    be estimated at 1900 or 2000 degrees.
       Father Secchi, a few months ago, communicated to the Academy
    a similar experiment, made with the electric light, the temperature
    of which he estimates at 3000°; and he obtained an intensity of ra—
    diation from 34 to 36 times less than that of the sun.       am quite              I
    disposed to admit the accuracy of this experiment ; but one might
    perhaps object that there is suf<U+FB01>cient uncertainty about the tempe—
    rature of the electric lamp, and that it is not quite certain that the
    whole extent of the carbon visible to the thermometer is equally

    rature of the disk is near 2000°, and at any rate does not exceed
    2800°. Newton’s law, then, is not veri<U+FB01>ed.              .
       The Rev. Father Secchi, in discussing either some of my experi
    ments or his own experiment, infers for the sun a temperature of
    more than 100,000 degrees- His reasoning may be summed up by                                        ~
    saying that, since the intensity of the solar radiation is 44 times
    that of the electric light, the temperature of the sun must also be
'
    44 times that of the lamp. This conclusion does not appear admis
    sible ; for it is equivalent to supposing that Newton’s law is accu
    rate from 2000° or 3000° upwards; while experiment manifestly
    proves that it is inaccurate between zero and 2000°.
       Let us pass to the law of Dulong and Petit. From this law M.
    Vicaire has deduced, for the case we are considering, the formula

       Now,      we apply this formula to my experiment, in which
                   if

formably to observation, ought to be several hundreds of degrees.
Therefore the law of Dulong and Petit, so accurate for tempera;
tures from zero up to 300°, ceases to be so when these limits are
p assed.                                                                          _

merely modifying the value of the coef<U+FB01>cient a which would be de
duced from my experiment, 1'0028 would be found for this value
instead of 10077.     Next, applying the formula to the excess t—O
ivhich     I
          obtained at the summit of Mont Blanc, we should arrive
at the number of 3330° for the temperature of the sun. But the
reasoning is not 1egiti1'nate; the law of Dulong and Petit being in
accurate from 300° to 2000°, it cannot be admitted to be applicable
above 2000°. And since the coef<U+FB01>cient a (which, according to
the law, should be constant) diminishes from 1'0077 to 1'0028 when
we pass from 300° to 2000°, it is probable that it would take a still
lower value at temperatures exceeding 2000°; and this would con
 duct us to a higher number than 3330° for the temperature of the
sun.

    The following are some results which      I have obtained by opera
ting with plates cut out of     one and the same cobalt glass.      At the
temperature    of fusion  of platinum,  two  of these plates   superposed
were suf<U+FB01>cient to give sensibly the purple tint: this        I  have been
able to observe leisurely at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers
at the time of the fusion of the platinum for making the interna
tional metres, at which operation        I had the good fortune to be
present.     Shortly after, thanks to your kindness,   I  had the oppor
tunity of attending in your laboratory at the experiment of the
fusion of iridium: at the instant of the maximum of temperature,
this source of light, viewed through the same two plates, appeared
perfectly blue ; but with three plates the tint was purple, of a shade
exactly like that given by a gas-<U+FB02>ame seen through two plates.
Now, if the sun is observed high above the horizon in a clear sky,
the purple tint is not obtained with three, or four, or even with
six plates superposed. A great thickness of cobalt glass is requi
site in order to get this shade on the edge of the sun’s disk; and
part of the effect is doubtless to be attributed to defects of homo—
geneity in the glass which       I employed. The light of the moon

           ON FUSED BORACIC ACID AND ITS TEMPEBING
                            BY V. DE LUYNES.
    Fused boracic acid, which closely resembles glass in external
characters, presents the following remarkable properties.
    In the viscous state it can be drawn out in threads which rapidly
solidify; and in this respect its ductility resembles more that of
silica than that of glass properly so called.
    Its hardness, between 4 and 5, places it between <U+FB02>uorine and
apatite ; it scratches glass ; it is found to be with dif<U+FB01>culty cut by
means of sand, grit, or emery either dry or with oil: to grind it
the solvent action of water must be interposed; and in this case the
cutting takes 7 or 8 times as long as that of common glass in the
same circumstances.       This resistance to grinding, which does not
correspond to its hardness, is doubtless due (as M. Damour has as          ,\
certained in the case of other minerals) to a peculiarity of structure.
    Fused boracic acid in mass is slowly hydrated in contact with
water; but when pulverized the action is rapid, as Ebelmen has
shown. When powdered boracic acid is moistened with water, it
increases in volume, and the temperature of the mixture rises to
nearly 100°.
    Boracic acid is remarkable especially for the energy and persist
ence of its tempering.      By running it upon a cold metallic surface
vitreous plates are obtained, of which the lower surface, cooled by
the metal, is more strongly tempered, and consequently more di
lated than the upper surface.       Hence results a <U+FB02>exure which may
be suf<U+FB01>ciently great to determine the rupture of the plate and its

projection in splinters. Boracic acid poured upon water is suddenly
pulverized; but with oil little masses with short stems are obtained
which explode under the same conditions as Prince Rupert’s drops.
    A chilled plate of boracic acid with parallel surfaces acts on pola
rized light like chilled glass ; but while the latter loses this property by
annealing, boracic acid retains it with singular tenacity. Some frag
ments of chilled boracic acid were placed in the annealing-furnaces
of M. Feil, kept at a red heat for <U+FB01>fteen hours, and submitted to a
slow cooling of several days.       They acted on polarized light as ener
getically as before, although some lumps of glass of 60 kilogrammes
placed beside them were completely annealed.
    On placing some rather large pastils of chilled boracic acid in
water at the temperature of from 15° to 20°, hydration is observed
to take place in layers, producing a veritable exfoliation.       The inner
layers, in undergoing hydration, increase more in volume than the
outer ones; hence results a lifting of the exfoliated portions, which
takes place nearly symmetrically with respect to the middle layer
towards each surface; and the plate of boracic acid, after hy
dration, has the appearance of two caps tangent by their convex
surfaces.
    This deformation is constant, and does not depend on the form
of the fragment of boracic acid operated on. It proves that the two
surfaces are chilled in opposite directions; it shows, next (and this
is the most interesting fact), that the portions already dilated by
chilling do not undergo through combination with water the same
augmentation of volume as the parts less chilled or which are not
chilled at all.     In a word, hydration produces in boracic acid aug
mentation of volume ; nevertheless, if tempering has already given
rise to an increase of volume, hydration takes place, but there is not
the same change of volume.           These facts appear to be intimately
 connected with those described by M. Berthelot under the name of
 kénomérie.    They con<U+FB01>rm, as regards boracic acid, the structure
 which  I  have attributed to chilled glass.-—C'omptes Rendus dc l’Acad.

 THE DISCOVERY OF A METHOD OF OBTAINING THERMOGRAPHS
     OF THE ISOTHERMAL LINES OF THE SOLAR DISKI                  BY ALFRED
     M. MAYER.
    On June the 5th, 1875,        I devised a method for obtaining the
 isothermals on the solar disk.         As this process may create an
 entirely new branch        of solar  physics,  I  deem it proper that      I
 should give a short account of it in order to establish my claim as
 its discoverer.
    In the American Journal, July 1872,           I  <U+FB01>rst showed how one
 can, with great precision, trace the progress and determine the
 boundary of a wave of conducted heat in crystals, by coating
 sections of these bodies with Meusel’s double iodide of copper and
  mercury and observing the blackening of the iodide where the

 160           Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
 wave of conducted heat reaches 70° C.       If we cause the image of
 the sun to fall upon the smoked surface of thin paper while the
 other side of the paper is coated with a <U+FB01>lm of the iodide, we
 may work on the solar disk as we formerly did on the crystal
 sections.
  '
    The method of proceeding is as follows :--Beginning with an
 aperture of object-glass which does not give suf<U+FB01>cient heat in any
 part of the solar image to blacken the iodide,    I gradually increase
 the aperture until    I have obtained that area of blackened iodide
 which is the smallest that can be produced with a well-de<U+FB01>ned con
 tour.                                     I
         This surface of blackened iodide call the area of maximum
 teinperature.   On exposing more aperture of object-glass, the
 surface of blackened iodide extends and a new area is formed
 bounded by a well-de<U+FB01>ned isothermal line.        On again increasing
 the aperture another increase of blackened surface is produced
 with another isothermal contour ; and on continuing this process      I
 have obtained maps of the isothermals of the solar image.       By ex
 posing for about 20 minutes the surface of iodide to the action of
 the heat inclosed in an isothermal,  I  have obtained thermographs
 of the above areas, which are suf<U+FB01>ciently permanent to allow one
 to trace accurately their isothermal contours.        There are other
 substances, however, which are more suitable than the iodide for
the production of permanent thermographs.
    The contours of the successively blackened areas on the iodide
are isothermals, whose successive thermometric values are inversely
as the successively increasing areas of aperture of object—glass which
respectively produced them.
    As far as the few observations have any weight, the following
appear to be the discoveries already made by this new method :—
(1) There exists on the solar image an area of ensibly uniform
temperature and of maximum intensity.          (2) This area of maxi
mum temperature is of variable size.      (3)  This  area of maximum
temperature has a motion on the solar image.           (4) The area of
maximum temperature is surrounded by well—de<U+FB01>ned isothermals
marking successive gradations of temperature.           (5) The general
motions of translation and of rotation of these isothermals appear
to follow the motions of the area of maximum temperature which
they inclose; but both central area and isothermals have indepen
dent motions of their own.
    On projecting the enlarged image of a sun-spot on the blackened
surface and then bringing a hot-water box, coated with lamp-black,
near the other side of the paper, one may develop the image of the
spot in ral on a dark ground.        A similar method probably may
serve to develop the athermic lines in the ultra-red region of the
solar and other spectra.——Silliman’s American Journal, July 1875.

 XX.    Note on Kohlrausch’s Determination      of the Absolute Value

    HENRY    A.  ROWLAND, of the Johns Hopkins University, Balti

    N looking over Kohlrausch’s paperi' upon the determination
       Of a resistance   in absolute measure, with a view to under
taking    something Of the     kind myself, and also, if possible, to
discover the reason of the di<U+FB02>'ereuce from the results of the Com
mittee of the British Association, I think I have come across an
error of suf<U+FB01>cient magnitude and in the proper direction to ac
count for the 2-per-cent. di<U+FB02>erence.       Kohlrausch’s experiments
were made with such great care and by so experienced a person
that it is only after due thought and careful consideration that I,
 take it upon me to O<U+FB02>'er a few critical remarks.
    We observe, then, <U+FB01>rst of all, that the principal peculiarity of
his method consists in doing away with all measurements of the.
coils of the galvanometer, and in its place making accurate de
terminations of the logarithmic decrement both with the circuit"
closed and open, together with various absolute determinations
rendered necessary by this change.       In this way the logarithmic
pecrement is raised from being a small correction to a most im—
dortant factor in the equation.      Hence it is that we should care;
fully scrutinize the theory and see whether it be correct enough
for this purpose; for only an approximation is needed' for the
<U+FB01>rst method.

divided into two principal parts—<U+FB01>rst, that due to the resistance
of air and viscosity of suspending <U+FB01>bre, and, second, that due to
the induced current in the coils.  The <U+FB01>rst resistance is usually
taken as proportional to the velocity, and thus assumes the vis
cosity of the air to be the most important element.           This is pro
bably   true in most    cases where   the  motion  is  slow.    This factor
is quite small compared with the second when the-magnet is large

of the coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction from his equations.
    For the sake of clearness, and because the subject                quite                    is

the rest of the way as Maxwell has done (Electricity, art. 762).
Assuming that all frictional resistances to the needle are propor

At <U+FB01>rst sight this equation will appear to  be the same as that of

reduces to that of Kohlrausch when L==0.
   To see how this error will a<U+FB02>'ect Kohlrausch’s results, we must
remember that he uses this equation to <U+FB01>nd the constant of his
galvanometer, on which his whole experiment depends; and the
error is so interwoven with all his results that an entire recom

    XXI.       On Temperament, or the Division of the Octave.—No.                II.‘
                     By R. H. M. BOSANQUET, Esq.*
                        [Continued     from vol. xlviii. p. 511.]
               continuing the discussion of the subject in the
BEFORE
   form proposed       at the end of my last communication,     I
have to say a few words on the general purpose of the investiga
tions contained in these papers.
   Some time ago, in tuning an organ, my attention was di
rected, for the <U+FB01>rst time in a practical manner, to the e<U+FB01>'ect of
temperament.      Since             that time I have perceived the effect con
stantly in all musical             instruments, in some more, in some less.
I do not say that the              e<U+FB01>'ect is always tormenting or intolerable;
but. it is there.  This             was the inducement to study the subject
in the <U+FB01>rst instance.
        The following       from Steiner’s ‘ Harmony founded on
                            passage
the Tempered Scale,’ pointed out a defect in our knowledge
with a directness rarely found in the writings of any one not
specially devoted to science.
   “When musical mathematicians shall have agreedamongst
themselves upon the exact number of divisions necessary in the
octave, when mechanists- shall have constructed instruments
upon which the new scale can be played, when practical musi_
cians shall have framed a new notation,” &c.
   Without entering into detailed criticism, I may observe that
this passage <U+FB01>rst pointed out to me the division of the octave as
a subject of study: it was clear that musicians in general knew
nothing about         it,
                    and scienti<U+FB01>c men but little more, and that
any knowledge that did exist was perfectly useless regarded from
any point of view whatever.
   Two principles are' regarded as axioms, or perhaps postu
lates, drawn from practical music, especially that of Bach :—
      (1) Similarity of all keys.
      (2) Unlimited facility of modulation.              .
   The <U+FB01>rst requirement         met by the property which
                                       is                       have       I
expressed        by
              the word regular—i. e.      that the  notes  of system      a             -
admit of arrangement in       series of <U+FB01>fths, all of which have the
                                       a
same value.     The second requirement can only be completely
met       by
         the property to which the name cyclical has been com
monl   applied.
    Al will acknowledge that the notes of the ordinary equal
temperament are <U+FB01>rst approximations to the notes intended to
be discussed; and      in strict analogy to the practice of other
                             it   is

           On Temperament,    or the Division  of   the Octave.       165
 branches of experimental science, the history of which invariably
 indicates a procedure by successive approximations, that I re
 duce the discussion to that of corrections to, or departures from,
 equal-temperament positions.        I am obliged to mention this, as
 there is a. tendency on the part of some, especially pure mathe
 maticians, to object to the treatment by approximations.             But
 we must remember that there is no instance of any theory being
 reduced to observation or experiment except by means of ap
 proximation, or with a limited accuracy of some kind ; and astro
 nomy itself, the greatest example of modern science, is the greatest
 example of the procedure of approximations.
    We can easily imagine the octave divided into any number of
parts.    And we can easily imagine that a of these parts will
 be the best approximation to the <U+FB01>fth, b to the third, and so on ;
 and if we tabulated all the values for all possible modes of divi
 ding the octave, we should no doubt be able to <U+FB01>nd but all the
 properties of every division. But this would be a very clumsy pro
ceeding ; and accordingly     I have preferred to start from a quasi
 aualytical point of view, and to de<U+FB01>ne a number having certain re
lations with any system,which'lcall its order. This admits readily
 of doing two things :—<U+FB01>rst, determining the best approximation
 to the <U+FB01>fth ; and secondly, arranging the whole system into scales
 corresponding to that approximation.        Thirds and other inter
vals are made to depend upon the <U+FB01>fths. ' Now the de<U+FB01>nition of
 the order of a system is really simple.      Since the equal-tempe
 rament <U+FB01>fth is 7 semitones and the octave is 12, it is clear that
 12 equal-temperament <U+FB01>fths = 7 octaves.           Hence the deviation
 of 12 <U+FB01>fths of any system from 7 octaves is an important pro
 perty of the system ,- and if we take some approximate <U+FB01>fth
 of any system and multiply its number of units by 12, the
 number of units by which the result exceeds or falls short of 7
 octaves is what I call the order of the system for that approxi
 mate <U+FB01>fth. With ordinary systems there is only one approxi
 mation that merits discussion at all, and consequently only one
order practically for each system. The importance of the order
 is not only that systems are arranged into scales in different
 manners, according to their orders,» but also, since the depar
 ture of the <U+FB01>fth of the system n of order     1' is     it is only neces
                                                      a,
 sary to compare this fraction with the departure of the perfect
 <U+FB01>fth ('01955), or of any other <U+FB01>fth, to ascertain with facility all
 that is to be known about it.
    Having said so much as to the general method, [ pass on to
 notice a few points in the history of the subject.           For general
 references, see Mr. A. J.    Ellis,  F.R.S.,“   On    the  Temperament
 of Instruments with Fixed Tones ” (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1864)..

166          Mr. B. H. M. Bosanquet       on Temperament,
  The history of the scale divides itself into three principal
period, corresponding to (1) the ancient systems of perfect con—
cords,   (2) the mean-tone and allied temperaments, and (3) the
equal temperament.        The exact mode of origin of the <U+FB01>rst tem
 peraments is no doubt unknown.           According to Smith (‘ Har
 monics,’ 1759), Salinas found a temperament in use in Italy in
 an empirical manner, its theory not being understood; and on in
 vestigating the question, he arrived at certain forms, that which
 he preferred being such that all the <U+FB01>fths were made                i
                                                                    of a
comma <U+FB02>at; this is the mean-tone system.             Zarlino is said to
 have <U+FB01>rst published it; so that the date of the origin of this
 system is ascertained with some certainty as being in the latter
 part of the sixteenth century.        Its practical employment does
 not appear to have spread very rapidly.        Mersenne (Harmonica
rum   Liber,   1636),  who  quotes Salinas,   and  certainly knew ofthe
 system, con<U+FB01>nes himself almost entirely to perfect-concord sys
 tem.    A century later the mean-tone system was almost univer
sal (though Bach had by that time given it its death-blow as ap
                                                        ‘           ’
plied to 12-keyed instruments) ; and in Smith’s Harmonics it,
and modi<U+FB01>cations of      it, are treated as being alone of any value.
 The equal temperament, or the division of the octave into 12
equal intervals, has now almost universally superseded it.
    Mersenne himself belongs to the <U+FB01>rst period.            His systems
are all based on perfect concords; and he meets the dif<U+FB01>culty of
the great number of notes required for uch systems              bymeans
of key-boards of greater or less complexity.         These are in prin
 ciple of the same nature with the key-boards of General T. Per~
ronet Thompson; and indeed Thompson says himself that he
learnt much from Mersenne.
    The system of 31 equal divisions in the octave         is known      by
Huyghens’s      name.    This  system   was known     to  Mersenne  and
 Salinas; but they could not make any thing of it. Huyghens
points out that they were not acquainted with the methods re
quired for dealing with        it,
                                 and constructs   it   himself with the
aid of logarithms (Cyclus Harmonicus~0pem Varia, vol. i.). All .
parts of this system are, within an error small with respect to
the error of practical tuning, the same as the mean-tone system.
The original date of the Cyclus Harmonicus was probably before
           ~
1700.

               Harmonics,’ 1759 (2nd edit.) has always been re

the dissonances of the tempered <U+FB01>fth, sixth, and third.             He as

The work of Helmholtz has superseded his theory of beats for
practical purposes.       Of- the three temperaments Smith arrives at,
the one which he calls equal harmony              that which he prefers.

It  makes the <U+FB01>fths <U+FB02>atter than in the mean-tone temperament,
and the thirds flat; the <U+FB01>fths and sixths beat equally in oppo
site directions.     The mean tone he regards as preferable in the
next degree; he calls           the “vulgar temperament.”
                                         it                         But as
both of these are very bad on the 12-keyed board, he proposes                                      a
third system in which the thirds and <U+FB01>fths beat equally fast, the
<U+FB01>fths <U+FB02>at and the thirds sharp.             This system     intermediate          is
between the mean-tone and the equal-temperament;                  and the
interest of        that
                   it   is   or something very likeit, appears to have
                                    it,
been generally adopted in practice.           The more recent form of
the unequal temperament             substantially this system, though
                                                 is                                                it
 may be doubtful whether its employment was derived from
Smith*.    The properties of Smith’s equal harmony are closely
represented             by
                the cycle of 50 (negative of the second order), as
he himself points out    and his third system (that above alluded
                                        ;
to) has very nearly  the properties of the system of 43 (negative
of the <U+FB01>rst order).   Smith describes an arrangement of stops
for introducing additional notes into the harpsichord for the
purposes of the mean-tone system or of his “equal harmony                                          ;”
he   possessed and used     harpsichord thus constructed.

modulations of modern music.
    There is an interesting passage in which Smith anticipated to
some extent the doctrine of Helmholtz that dissonance consists
of beats (p. 227):—“ For nothing gives greater offence to the
bearer, though ignorant of the cause of           it,
                                             than those rapid rat
tling beats of high and loud sounds which make imperfect con
sonances with one another; and yet        few slow beats, like the

practice of musicians and that introduced               by

    technical detail. They both represent forms of just intonation.
      I   need not enter into any detail as to Helmholtz’s work in
_   this Magazine, more especially as it is now accessible in an
    English translation.   But I must allude to a serious defect in
    Tyndall‘s exposition of Helmholtz’s theory of beats in the ear,
    to which my attention was drawn by Professor Mayer’s paper in
    the ‘American Journal of Science,’ October 1874, though I be
                                                                    ‘
    lieVe it had been commented on before by Mr. Sedley Taylor.
        In ‘Tyndall on Sound’ (2nd edit. p. 296) we <U+FB01>nd the fol
    lowing statement as the reason why no beats are audible‘in the
    octave cl—cez—
       “ Here our rates of vibration are 512, 256; difference =256.
    It is plain that in this case we can have no heats, the difference
    being too high to admit of them.”
       This is not Helmholtz’s position.     His theory is that notes
    an octave apart a<U+FB02>'ect di<U+FB02>ferent portions of the nervous mecha
    nism of the ear, and consequently no beats ever take place
    between these sounds at all when they are received in the ear.
       Again, Helmholtz does not say, as Tyndall makes him, that
    beats blend always into a continuous sound when they attain
    the limit of 132 per second.     He says (3rd edit. p. 270) of the
    132 beats per second produced by the interval b3 04, “ and these
    are really audible in the same manner as the 33 beats of          09,[21
    although they sound somewhat weaker in the higher position.”
       An account of some repetitions of the experiments of Pro
    fessor Mayer contained in the paper above referred to appeared
    recently in the Philosophical Magazine.      They consist of deter
    minations of the limiting rates at which beats cease to be distin
    guished for all parts of the musical scale.

                                 ‘                                             ’
    for 1874 deals almost exclusively with just intonation.          The
    remark I   would make with reference to this              is,
                                                          that the chief
    dif<U+FB01>culty in applying just or approximately just systems to ordi
    nary music lies in the music itself; this does not conform to
    certain rules which must be observed in writing for just intona
    tion; and I   feel sure that until just intonation      studied, and
                                                                   is

       A  question of primary importance, which has perhaps scarcely
    received suf<U+FB01>cient attention,     Is there any natural standard for
                                     is,
    excellence in melodic sequences? and        so, what
                                                   if        it?    is
       Mr. Ellis (Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1864) and,                 I
    believe, Mr.'Sedley Taylor, accept Helmholtz’s authority for the
    position that the sequences of the diatonic scale are the best,
    and that in proportion as the sequences of any other scale differ

170        Mr. R. H. M. Bosauquet         on Temperament,
from those of the diatonic scale, they will offend the ear. Helm
holtz adduces, in support of this view, an experiment conducted
by him and Herr Joachim with the assistance of Helmholtz’s
harmoninm with pure scales.      The result appeared to prove con-          .
clusively that the eminent violinist employed pure scales.    And
it is sought to infer from this that the sequences of the diatonic
scale commend themselves naturally to the ear in all cases.   This
is more than can be legitimately deduced from the experiment.
There is no doubt that good violinists play substantially perfect
concords, in general at least.        It is clear that they cannot do so
in all cases ; for there are, as I have said, many passages in or
dinary music which do not admit of being constructed with
perfect concords.      And the artist who habitually plays perfect
concords (when away from the piano), may very well play
single notes in the same way.           But there is no doubt, in the
<U+FB01>rst place, that all violinists play di<U+FB02>erently when accompanying
a keyed instrument; and in the second place, the experiments
of Cornu and Mercadier, of which Mr. Ellis has given an
account, showed that the artists, whose performance was there
examined, generally played their thirds very sharp when freed
from accompaniment, though they played them true when the
harmony required it.
   But this seems to me eminently a question in which progress
may be made.        It is commonly treated as if it were impossible
to bring any observation of one’ s own to bear upon the matter;
but   Ihave come to the conclusion that a process of education,
such as my own ears have gone through, and constantly repeated
experiments, such as those I have been in the habit of making
with the assistance of persons possessing ears of the most excep
tional delicacy, are necessary to enable an opinion to be formed
on the matter.      I do not think that any single experiments can
compare as evidence with such as have been repeated day after
day for a long period, until the effects to be observed have be
come perfectly familiar.
   First, as to diatonic scales.       The most striking effect of the
diatonic scale  is, to my ear, the difference between the major and
minor tones: this difference    is   a  comma; and  I      now perceive
                                                                      it
with perfect clearness. The impresion          it    makes varies accord
ing to whether I    have been using the diatonic scale much or not.
If
 I   come   back  to  the instrument (the 53 harmonium, which has
diatonic scales within    a  very close approximation) after   a    consi
derable absence, and especially      if
                                     I      have been hearing much or~
dinary music, the impression made         by   the unequal tones is   dis
agreeable.    When    I   <U+FB01>rst  realized   the   difference
                                                        I      thoughtit
horrible. Few, except highly gifted musicians, can realize this
difference without frequent repetition of thc experiments; but

                         or the Division        of the     Octave.                    171

has frequently listened to these equences. The result                   always   is
the same; he cannot tolerate any of them.                 They are different
in magnitude from the sequences he employs; and, as he de
scribes    it,
             when he hears one of these intervals he also hears
clearly in the mind the note that would be given                       by
                                                                  the interval

                                                             is
the chords; the note most objected to in chords formed from
the diatonic scale        isthe minor third.        Many musicians have
singled   this  out  instantly    as offensive.    In  fact         about one
                                                                      it   is
 ixth of an equal-temperament semitone higher than the equal
temperament note would be.             On evidence of this kind         refuse  I
to believe that the diatonic scale            natural standard of melody.
                                                is   a

                                                                            is
from the mean-tone system.              The semitone of that system                    is
one sixth part greater than an equal-temperament                     semitone

played   on  this  system    as  examples; and the above point about
the semitone came       out  strongly in the remarks which were made.
The other stop was tuned on the so-called just system (Helm
holtz’s).

172         Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet           on Temperament,
   The view to which     I  have been driven is that the appreciation
of melodic sequences      is purely the result of custom.       This com~
pletely   explains   how an eminent violinist may play diatonic
scales, while other musicians, educated at a keyed instrument,
cannot endure any marked deviation from the equal tempe
rament.
    The harmonic seventh is an interesting example of the general
point.    If we <U+FB02>atten the tempered minor seventh by about one
third of a semitone, we get a pure chord free from beats.                The
ordinary   musician   cannot    at  <U+FB01>rst  endure  it.  The consonance      of
a full chord of    the dominant seventh containing         this  note   is of
the most magni<U+FB01>cent quality ; and if its introduction is properly
managed, so that the interval made by the <U+FB02>attened note with
the preceding and following notes of the same part is not out
rageous, most musicians appreciate its beauty after a time. But
it is necessary to be very careful about the context. Though by
dint of custom I'like the chord much now, yet if I introduce it
so as to give rise to any melodic interval widely different from
its usual value, the effect is still bad to my ear.
    I am clear that a general certainty on this and similar points
can be attained only by a wider diffusion of actual knowledge
 (not reading) on the subject.          One might suppose that an edu
cated musician would have some right to speak with authority
on such questions as intervals, consonance, dissonance, and the
like. It is hard to believe, but it is nevertheless true, that
scarcely any musician has ever heard a perfect consonance, or
has any idea of the sound of any intervals except those formed
by the equal-temperament scale.            But until a person has become
tolerably   familiar  with   the   effects of any ystem, his opinion as
to its merits cannot command any con<U+FB01>dence.                 Smith, in his
 ‘
   Harmonics,’ makes this same observation.            These systems can
all be thoroughly studied by means of my key-board; whether
they ever will be so studied remains to be seen.
                                 Intervals.
    Intervals are always expressed in-terms of equal-temperament
 (E.T.) semitones. The following rules are employed for trans
formation of vibration-ratios into E.T. semitones as far as <U+FB01>ve
places of the latter, and vice versd.         The rationale is obvious.
    I. To <U+FB01>nd the value of a given vibration-ratio in ET. semi
 tones.
    From the logarithm of the ratio subtract 3,1,6 of itself; call
this the <U+FB01>rst improved value. From the logarithm subtract $56
of the <U+FB01>rst improved value, and I 1 - of the <U+FB01>rst improved
value.    Multiply the result by 40. The product is the value
in E.T. semitones correct to <U+FB01>ve places.                              .

       Symmetrical Arrangement         and Generalized Key-board.
   For an illustration of the application of the principle of sym
metrical arrangement to positive systems, and for a woodcut of
the generalized key-board, I mut refer to my papers in the Royal
           ‘                         ‘
Society’s Proceedings’ and the Transactions’    '
                                                      of the Musical
Association.                                _
   Any interval formed in any regular system can be represented
by an expression of the form x+y8, where .z' is an integral num
ber of E.T. semitones, and y the number of <U+FB01>fths whose depar
ture is involved.     The principle of symmetrical arrangement
which I adopt consists in representing notes by positions deter
mined by .r as an abscissa and y as an ordinate, where w and y
have integral values.    The second term is always taken positive
for <U+FB01>fths up, and negative for <U+FB01>fths down, whatever he the sign
of the departure 5. The reason for this is the convenience of
having the same key-board for positive and negative systems.
The best mode of describing the key-board will probably be to
refer the middle points of the ends of the keys to three rectan
gular axes, 1' being measured along the length of the key-board,
y along the depth (from the player), and z vertically upwards.
 The note 0 on the left nearest the player may be taken for
 origin. The numbers of units in y and z are the same. 'The
 extremities of the keys all lie in a plane rising like the slope of
a desk at an angle tan-1%.. The values of .2 correspond to half
inches, of y to quarter-inches, and of z to twelfths of an inch.
 Thus, for the departure of 12 <U+FB01>fths, .z'=0, y=3 inches, z=1
inch ; that  is,the key /c      straight behind and
                                is                      little above

given key.      This is of importance; e. g. in the chord c—\le—-g—c
taken with the right hand, the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>nger has to reach \e between
the adjoining keys          and a little under the c. All the keys are
cut away so as to overhang about % an inch for this purpose ; so
that though the length of each key on a plan is only 3 inches, yet
the tangible length is 3% inches.        Notes derived from the black
keys of the E.T. (ordinary) key-board are black (2:1, 3, 6, 8,
10). The other keys, corresponding to w=O, 2,                     4-,11,5,   7,   9,
are white.
   It results from the arrangement                  by
                                             intervals that all combi
nations, scales, or chords of any kind haVe the same form for the
<U+FB01>nger in whatever key they are taken,             simpli<U+FB01>cation which
                                                          a
gives the learner one thing to acquire where there are twelve on
the ordinary key-board.
   The thirds used in positive and negative systems being di<U+FB02>'er
ently derived, the resulting forms of scale on the key-board are
different.    The positive scales can be played with little prac   a
tice and all desirable chords and combinations can be grasped
       ;
with ease.     But as far as facility of performance goes, the nega
tive systems afford the principal simpli<U+FB01>cation.           believeI  am       I
not exaggerating in saying that           may  be

in this manner passages of greater complexity and dif<U+FB01>culty than
can be performed on the ordinary key-board.            The movements
of the <U+FB01>ngers required are less in amount and simpler in cha
racter.    Passages of the most rapid kind are performed with
ease.    The mean-tone stop on my small enharmonic organ has
given me the opportunity of realizing what           had always antici
                                                              I

                                 Practical Applications.
   The <U+FB01>rst instrument constructed with generalized key-board
was    large harmonium.
       a                     The key-board has 84 keys to each
octave     ;was thus arranged in order that, in the experiment
               it
with the system of 53 in particular, there might be no risk of
failure from any de<U+FB01>ciency in the extent of the instrument.                            I
specially wish to direct attention to the fact that both the instru
ments hitherto constructed are designed for experimental pur
poses—as an objection constantly made against my instruments
 is,that   put into practical form their bulk would be enor
               if               a

will answer? hitherto, for the experimental instruments,           has            it
been,   what     theis largest development    that   may possibly be
needed?     For instance, the only practical instrument        clearly   I
see my way to at present         one for some kind of negative sys
                                         is

  a result  of experience, I am satis<U+FB01>ed that 24.- will be suf<U+FB01>cient
   for all practical purposes.      Probably Smith’s system of <U+FB01>fths
  and thirds beating equally in opposite directions would be best to
 begin with.
     The large harmonium was tuned according to the division of
 the octave into 53 equal intervals.             For the details of the
  tuning and the specialization of the notation in the system of
 53,   I                                      ’
         must refer to the ‘Transactions of the Musical Associa
 tiOn.    The compass of the key-board is 4% octaves; and the
 keenuess of the tone, the perfect standing in time, and the ge
 neral completeness of the instrument have enabled me, during
 the two years it has been in my possession, to obtain a consider
 able familiarity with one of the most important of the approxi
 mately just systems.
     The <U+FB01>fths of the system of 53 being practically perfect, the
 thirds by 4 <U+FB01>fths up are practically Pythagorean thirds. The
 contrast between these and the approximately perfect thirds may
 be called startling.
     With the view of having an instrument which should be less
 troublesome to take to pieces for removal, and also with a view
 to obtain a negative system on the key-board, a small organ was
 subsequently constructed with a generalized key—board of three
 octaves in compass, 48 keys per octave and two stops, the one
 tuned to the positive system of perfect thirds, and the other to
 the mean-tone system.          The mean-tone system has only 36
 pipes per octave. The pipes are metal stopped diapasons; and
 their accurate tuning is effected by stoppers of a peculiar con
 struction, containing an internal slider worked by a projecting
 screw, which may be regarded as a <U+FB01>ne adjustment.               The ar
rangement is of a general character, which is susceptible of ex
tension; and all the working parts can be got at quite easily,
which is not the case with the harmonium.             This organ, as well
as my tuning-machine, the great harmonium,               and an ordinary
organ,    have  been   built  for  me  by  Mr.   T. A.  Jennings, whose
exceptional mechanical       skill alone  has   enabled  me to prosecute
these investigations with any success.
     For any further details I am obliged to refer to the two
papers above quoted. I have here endeavoured to give a general
summary of my investigations, avoiding technical details. The
points I specially wish to direct attention to are :—the ques
tion of melodic sequences; the unsuitability of just systems
for ordinary music, and the desirability of writing specially
with a view to their employment; and the suitability of nega
tive systems for ordinary music; but especial] it is most de
sirable that it should be felt how worthless t eoretical ideas
about the properties of musical sounds are when unaccompa
nied by practical study.

XXII.    On the Flewure      of Continuous Girders.        By MANSFIELD
   MERRIMAN, C.E., Instructor in Civil Engineering in the Shef
   <U+FB01>eld Scienti<U+FB01>c School, New Haven, Conn, U. S. A.*
       the            text-books on Mechanics the theory of the
 IN <U+FB02>exureordinary
               of girders  is developed for particular cases.        First
a beam fastened at one end and supporting a weight at the other
is considered, and the equation of the elastic line for that case is
applied to girders of one span with free ends. Then, by methods
tedious and particular, beams with <U+FB01>xed ends are treated ; and
occasionally may be found investigations upon girders of two
spans for special cases of loading, such as a uniform load over
the whole of the girder, or a single load in the middle of one of
the spans.     The impression is conveyed that the investigation
of continuous girders is too dif<U+FB01>cult to be undertaken except when
the load in each span is uniformly distributed over its entire
length.     The student who is interested in this branch of mathe
matical analysis and who seeks to extend his investigations, <U+FB01>nds
but little to assist his progress, and is apt to drop the subject in
despair, particularly as he <U+FB01>nds authorities hinting that the theory
is too complicated for development‘l‘.
    I propose in this article to demonstrate and present a few new
 and simple formulae which shall include the whole theory of the
 moments, shearing-forces, and reactions for girders of any num
 bers of spans, equal or unequal, subject to any assignable loads.
 The remarkable theorem of three moments for concentrated
 weights will serve as a basis for my investigation; and as I am
 unaware of any work in English which presents a proof of that
 theorem, 1 shall <U+FB01>rst give an abridged demonstration of it.          The
 formula that I shall deduce from it will be found to be perfectly
 general, and yet in a form easily applied to any particular case,
 as the examples which follow them will illustrate.             Armed with
 these algebraic expressions, which may be written upon a sheet
 of common note-paper, the student may attack and solve every
 problem relating to the <U+FB01>exure of girders over level supports.
    The following are the conditions which enable the theory of
 continuous girders to be mathematically investigated :—(1) the
 extensions and compressions of different <U+FB01>bres are proportional
 to their distances from the neutral axis; (2) the de<U+FB02>ection is
 small compared with the length of the beam; (3) the moment
 of inertia is constant.     In the following pages the supports will
 also be considered upon the same level.
    The curve which a beam assumes under the action of its own
 weight and the loads that it supports is known as the elastic

have been expended) are together equal to the total heat com

 need, in order to be universally valid, a further alteration, which
'will make them still more different from Boltzmann’s.”          It is
through this change that my new equations differ from my pre

where   9% denotes a quantity very nearly proportional to the mean

mean length of path is nearly proportional to the volume of a

latter has for its factor %T.

  196      Prof. R. Clausius   on the Theorem   of the Mean   Ergal,
     When, applying the ordinary laws of gases, the work is deter
  mined which is accomplished in a change of state, it is found
  that the factor g-T is the correct one, and consequently that
  the earlier equation, while in every thing else its form is correct,
  does not in this point correspond to the reality.
     I  must confess that this divergence of the then existing for
  mulae from the reality (to which my attention was <U+FB01>rst turned
  subsequently) has occasioned me great dif<U+FB01>culties.       Through it   I
  was obliged to begin the entire mechanical treatment of the
  subject de novo, and to carry it out in a more generalized manner.
'
                 I
  In doing so convinced myself that my earlier equations were
  certainly suf<U+FB01>cient for motions of points in closed paths, but
  that new considerations, not yet instituted in mechanics, were
  requisite for that extension of the equations which would make
  them suitable to be applied to a system of points that do not
  move in closed paths.       By this investigation I arrived at the
  theorem of the mean ergal, which, because it appeared to be of
  general importance in mechanics,       I published in a separate me
  moir, and which in the present one       I  have applied to the mole
  cular motions of gases; at least      I  have replaced these motions
  by others which have the same mean ergal and the same mean
  vis viva, and with which the variables and time-intervals which
  satisfy the conditions of the theorem can be readily obtained.        I
  think that this result/is peculiarly adapted to show how neces
  sary it is to contemplate from this new point of view the second
  proposition of the mechanical theory of heat, if we wish to

  sidered in this way :—The_m0lecules        are represented simply as
  elastic balls which exert no forces on one another except after
  their surfaces have come into contact, when on a still nearer
  approach they repel one another with a rapidly increasing force.
  This representation is defective, even for the case in which,
  neglecting the relative motions of the constituents of a molecule,
  we wish to take into consideration only the motions of the centres
  of gravity of the molecules, because, as we must conclude from
  certain phenomena, the molecules not merely repel, but at some
  what greater distances also attract each other.         Still the con
  ception may serve to give an idea of the nature of the motion
  and to explain some characteristic properties of gases.          It will
  therefore not be devoid of interest if we develop a little more
  completely the equation for the case where there exists between
  the molecules only a repellent force which <U+FB01>rst becomes sensible
  when they arrive at a certain degree ofproximity, but then, as they
  emiroach still closer, increases very rapidly.
     First replacing, as before, the actual motions of the molecules

        and its Application to the Molecular Motions                                    of Gases.     197
 within a certain volume V by motions of material points in a
 rectangularly parallelepipedal vessel, and employing coordinates
 parallel to its sides and having their origin in its centre, we ex
 press the forces exerted on a point by the wall that is perpendi
 cular to the m-axis, not generally by F'(c—.z') and —F'(c+.z-),
 but, as in § 5, by

 suming that the quantity or (which we there assume to be so
 small that the force in the centre of the vessel was insensible)
 is so small that the force is sensible only in the immediate
 vicinity of the side—and therefore, in developing the series,
 taking into account only the terms of the <U+FB01>rst order with re
 spect to on.
    Of the equations given in those sections we will select equa
 tions (53) and (54) for further discussion, but will abbreviate
 them by omitting the terms which contain as a factor a

XXIV.     On the Origin and Mechanism of production of the

<U+FB01>gure being divided by nearly parallel lines, the distances be
tween which represent successive approximately                 isothermal
couches), the prism is at once in progress of cooling and of con
tracting by loss of heat from its top surface S S, and by that
from the sides of the prisms—which are at the lowest temperature
at the top (where cooling has been going on longest), and higher
at every point below down to the splitting level B B, <U+FB01>g. 4.           In
a line round the prism, as lm, <U+FB01>g. 6, every particle of the ex
terior couche is subjected to two orthogonal strains, due to con
traction of the material of the prism in its axial and transverse
directions respectively; and the contractile pull in each of these
directions is proportional to the length of the contracting column
which produces it. Thus at the point 0 (taken very near to l)
the vertical strain 0 p is proportional to ls, and the horizontal or
transverse component 0 q is proportional to lw, or nearly to the
radius of the prism.        The resultant, or, of these two compo
nents is the direction of the contracting force at the point
0 tending to initiate fracture at that point; and if we assume

  202        Mr. R. Mallet  on the Origin and Mechanism of
  similar points taken all round the prism (which, as we shall see
  hereafter, it will be suf<U+FB01>ciently exact to consider as a cylinder),
  the locus of the resultant through all these points will be in a
  cone ly, <U+FB01>g. 6.     In a homogeneous body the plane of a frac
  ture when produced by contractile forces is perpendicular at
  every point to these forces.     The <U+FB01>rst portion of the fracture
  through the exterior couche through any point as, 0, will not be
  directly transverse to the axis of the prism, but in a plane normal
  at that point to o r ,- and taking successive points round the
  entire circumference, the plane of fracture between I and 1' will
  approximate to a cone whose vertical angle will be I zm.
     Proceeding now to the next isothermal couche within, we may
  apply the same reasoning to <U+FB01>nd the direction in which the
  fracture will proceed through it.    If 0' be the point at which the
  fracture through the outside couche is prolonged into the second,
  then o'p' will be the vertical component and very nearly the
  same as in the former case ; but the horizontal component 0' g' is
  less than for the outside couehe by the assumed thickness of that
  couche, the resultant or rending pull 0'11 is therefore less inclined
 for this, the second, than for the previous or outside couche, and
 the fracture through the thickness of the second couche normal
 to o' r' is more nearly transverse to the axis of the prism than
 that of the outside couche; and so on for every successive couche
 until we arrive at the axis of the prism, where the plane of the
 fracture will be exactly transverse to it.     Assuming the succes
 sive couches of inde<U+FB01>nitely small thickness, the entire fracture
 through the prism will be thus in the form of a lens at the con
 vex side, or of a corresponding shallow cup at the concave side—
 the convex side of the curve of fracture always presenting itself
 in the direction opposite to that in which the cooling of the
 prism is occurring, or towards the hotter part of the prism.
     Referring now to <U+FB01>g. 7 (which represents an axial section
 below the <U+FB01>rst cross joint, already referred to, and between that
 and the second joint), it will be obvious that the curvature of the
 cup-shaped fracture will slightly differ from that of the <U+FB01>rst
joint as in <U+FB01>g. 6. For at the point 0, corresponding to that in
 <U+FB01>g. 6, the vertical component op is the same as in <U+FB01>g. 6, and
 so is 0g, and the angle of the resultant or is also the same;
 therefore the angle of the plane of fracture at the surface of the
prism is the same as in <U+FB01>g. 6; but as the top surface of the
whole mass of basalt, assumed as a horizontal plane S S in <U+FB01>g. 6
is the origin of all the vertical components down to the <U+FB01>rst
joint, so these increase slightly in succession as they approach
the axis: but after the <U+FB01>rst fracture has been effected, the
origin of the vertical components producing the second and all
subsequent joints is to be found in the hollow surface of the pre

          production of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.       203

zontal components alone vary, as already described, from I to the
axis. The effect of this is simply that the amount of curvature
of every joint below the <U+FB01>rst is rather greater than that of the
<U+FB01>rst, or, in other words, the depth of the cup-shaped articulation
 of the <U+FB01>rst joint produced is a little less than that of all subse
 quent joints proceeding lower down.
    We have thus proved that contraction alone in the axial and
 transverse directions is suf<U+FB01>cient to account for the production
 of transverse joints, and their cup-shaped form of fracture taking _
 place at successive intervals as the cooling proceeds along or
 downwards through the prism, and that, if the material be iso
 tropic and homogeneous, the distance between any two succes
 sive joints must be approximately equal for like conditions of
 cooling; and we can see that the amount of curvature of each
 joint, and the nature of any curve in any plane passing through
 the axis of the prism, depend upon the relation that subsists v
 between the length of the piece between two successive joints
 and the diameter of the prism, and the law according to which
 heat is lost in directions transverse to the axis of the prism.   It
 would be di<U+FB02>icult, if not impossible, to assign precisely the posi
 tions and directions of the isothermal couches, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 4
 and subsequent <U+FB01>gures, in so complicated a case of cooling as
 that which is here before us; but it will be readily seen that
  neither the form nor the amount of concavity in the joints will

    204       Mr. R. Mallet     on the  Origin and Mechanism of
    be very materially varied, whatever be the law of lateral cooling
    which we may be at liberty to assume. In <U+FB01>gs. 6 and 7 the thick
    ness of successive isothermal couches has been taken as equal, or
    the volume of a unit length of each couche to vary as the square
    of the radius, thus giving the largest volume to the outside and
    hottest couche.     But if the thickness of the isothermal couches
    be taken so as to give equal volumes per unit length to all the
    successive couches from surface to centre, the curvature of the
    cross fracture L Z M in <U+FB01>g. 7 is but little altered by the differ
    ence in the rate of cooling inferred, and approaches more nearly
    to an elastic curve than that shown by <U+FB01>g. 7, which is not far
    from that of a circle.     If the thickness of the exterior couches
    be supposed still less than in either of those cases, the effect upon
    the curvature will be to cause it to approach more nearly to that
    of an ellipse, so that the cup-shaped articulations would approach
    more nearly to the form of a watch-glass.
       In the preceding considerations we have viewed as a suf<U+FB01>ciently
    near approximation that the hexagonal prism coincides with the
 _ inscribed    cylinder.    But those portions of the prism exterior to
    that cylinder have also to be considered; and, as will be seen by
    the dotted lines to the right of <U+FB01>g. 7' (representing in so far
    an axial section of the prism taken through the angles of the
    hexagon, in which' the curve of transverse fracture has been
    laid down on the-principles already described), they present no
    material difference as to the curvature where that approaches the
    solid angles of the prism, from the same curve as laid down in
    <U+FB01>g. 7 taken in a direction of section normal to the faces.
       In all that precedes we have supposed the cooling of the ba
    saltic tabular mass to take place from the top surface only, when
    the convexity of the cross fractures will point downwards only.
 . But the cooling of such a tabular mass may take place either
    from the top or bottom surface, or from both, in which cases the
    convexity of the cross joints will point upwards at the lower
    portions of the mass; and in general the convexity of the cross
   joints will point in the reverse direction to that in which the wave
    of heat has been transmitted from any cooling surface of the mass.
g It is obvious that the curvature of any cross joint must be less
    in proportion as the diameter of the prism is less—that is to
    say, as the difference in temperature at the time of fracture is less
    between the exterior and axial portions of the prism.       Hence in
    very small prisms     we  should  expect  to <U+FB01>nd the transverse frac
    tures more nearly approaching to a direct transverse plane of
    separation, as is actually seen to occur in the long and slender
    prisms 0f the Rhineland basaltic country: but this will be better
    referred to further on in considering the effect of want of homo-‘
    geneity in the mass upon the form and positions of the vertical
    and cross jointings.

          production of the Prismatic Structure   of Basalt.     205
    It remains here to explain the play of forces by which the lip
or edge of the cup adjacent to the solid angles of the prism is
so frequently found broken off, or strained so as readily to break
off, in something of the peculiar form shown in <U+FB01>g. 8 in vertical
section, and in the plane of the joint in <U+FB01>g. 9.       It will be re

collected that at the moment of the production of the cup-joint
the material at the concave side a is still at a somewhat higher
 temperature than the mass b from which it has just become de
 tached by a fracture, the sides of which are kept in absolute con
 tact by the superincumbent weight of h and those above it.
     Cooling still proceeds, and with it contraction until both 11
 and a have attained the same temperature; but the form of the
 cup-shaped fracture has been impressed upon it at a higher tem
 perature as respects the lower block a, which therefore differen
 tially contracts as to its cup-shaped cavity upon the lens-shaped
  surface of b which <U+FB01>lls it; hence strains transverse to the prism
 and in the plane of the joint are produced, the effect of which is to
  tend to split off portions of the exterior parts of the cup a; and
 this action is most e<U+FB01>'ective at and about the solid angles of the
  hexagon, where the surfaces of the cup-shaped fracture have the
  most effective frictional grip of each other, i. e. where the angle
  of the fracture itself is largest with respect to a plane passing
  through or near the lip of the cup, as cd, <U+FB01>g. 8. This play of
  forces may either break off altogether three or the whole of the
  solid angles of the hexagon at the lip of the cup, or may onl
  visit so seVere a strain upon the rigid basalt at and about these
  parts as may cause a plane of weakness by which, at some sub
   sequent period, by any slight extraneous force such as frost &c.,
  the fracturing off of these fragments may be produced, as seen
  in <U+FB01>gs. 8 and 9. The curves assumed by these fractures are
  always such as indicate the play of forces as above described,

206       Mr. R. Mallet    on the  Origin and illechanism of
ending in a thrust outwards upon the detached fragment, the
fracture of which may be longer or shorter between m and y, de
pendent upon the rigidity of the basalt and its coef<U+FB01>cient of con
traction, which no doubt varies a good deal in different examples
of that rock.
   From what precedes, it is obvious that in a perfectly homo
geneous and isotropic mass of basalt cooling symmetrically, all
the prisms should be divided transversely by joints, each range of
which should be at the same level in all the prisms—an arrange
ment which observation shows is very nearly approached in many
instances in ponderous masses of basalt ; but a very slight amount
of heterogeneity or admixture of adventitious matter, or difference
in the rate of cooling, will cause a certain amount of irregularity
in the relative levels of the different prisms or length of the joint
pieces.    It is obvious also that the imbedding of foreign mate
rial, or even the existence of empty cavities, which are often of
considerable size in certain basalts, will not only produce irre
gularities in the distances between these joints, but also more
or less disturb the regularity of their cup-shape.          This last
source of disturbance in the cup-forms of the joints has been
pointed out by Professor James Thomson in his paper already
referred to.    ()n referring to those papers it will be remarked
how widely his notions of the production of the cross joints
themselves differ from the solution here given, and how entirely
inadequate they are to account for the facts.       He supposes cross
fracture to commence at the axis of the prism and to spread
outwards towards its surface.       He assumes tension, therefore,
greatest about the axis or hottest part of the prism ; and to ac
count for the equal and opposite force, he imagines a couche
produced about the exterior of the prism by calling in some
wholly imaginary force of expansion produced by some molecular
or chemical change in the basalt itself at and near the surface
of the prism by which its length there is increased. Even were
we to admit for a moment these vague and unsupported hypo
theses, there is nothing indicated to account for the production
of the cup-form of the joints, nor for their convex sides being
presented in one direction rather than another, nor Why they
should actually be presented in opposite directions.
   Hitherto we have been considering perfectly homogeneous and
isotropic basalt; and although such basalt is closely approached
in nature, observation shows that almost all basalts are more or
less heterogeneous as regards the mineral constituents of which
they are made up or which are imbedded in them, and to a
greater or less extent are not isotropic anterior to cleavage into
prisms.     The main constituent minerals, namely felspar, py
roxene, oxides of iron, &c., vary much in proportion and in the

        1
         production of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.         207
 development of their differently shaped crystals.          The entire
 mass, forced up through <U+FB01>ssures from below and over<U+FB02>owing
 horizontally, assumes the interior conditions of a stream or
 streams of imperfectly liquid matter, in which the <U+FB02>oating crys
 tals arrange themselves with their broader sides more or less
 horizontally, and their greater lengths in the direction of the
 <U+FB02>ow.    A distinct grain is thus often impressed upon the entire
 mass, tending to produce differences in the facility of fracture in
 two vertical orthogonal planes and one horizontal plane, the latter
 being the one of easiest fracture in the mass.         From the <U+FB01>ne
 ness of the particles of basalt and the want of large imbedded
 crystals, these characteristics are but ill pronounced and are fre
 quently not discernible; but they only differ in degree from the
 well-known structure, likewise developgdbl <U+FB02>ow, which has been
 remarked, and is well known to the quarry-men in the Dartmoor
 and many other granites, which possess three orthogonal planes
 presenting differences of facility of fracture. The horizontal one is
 that of easiest fracture ; and in it are found the <U+FB02>at surfaces (gene
 rally) of the large separate crystals of felspar, and many of those of
 black mica also.     The plane of next easiest fracture is a vertical
 one, which generally coincides with the longest axes of these
 crystals ; while the plane of most dif<U+FB01>cult fracture is a vertical
 one orthogonal to the last, and therefore transverse to the line
 of <U+FB02>ow of the granite when molten.          In addition to this struc
 ture, more or less developed, the lower part, which has received
 the greatest pressure from the superiucumbent mass of the basalt
 itself and of matter heaped upon     it,   must be denser than the
 higher portions.      All  these conditions   tend to modify several
 features of the prismatic structure, as already developed in what
 precedes.     Di<U+FB02>erent parts also of the same large mass of basalt
 will be found on comparing hand specimens to differ in grain,
 hardness, &c., showing that the basalt when poured forth in         a
 liquid state was not perfectly homogeneous throughout.
    These differences involve variations of elasticity and rigidity in
 different directions, and, we cannot doubt, variations in extensi
 bility under contractile strains, and in the rate of cooling under
 given conditions.      The principal effects produced     by all these
 are chie<U+FB02>y shown in variations of the mean diameter of the prisms
 and in the length between the cross joints.        Where the lengths
 between these are usually found to be very great, as in most of
'the Rhenish basalts, the prisms are found generally of small
 diameter,.often not exceeding six or seven inches     ;   and in such
 cases the nearly <U+FB02>at cross joints, often many feet apart, are attri
 butable not so much to the differential contraction in cooling,
 already described as generating cup-formed joints, but chie<U+FB02>y to
 the propagation of mechanical strains through the whole mass,

208       Mr. R. Mallet   on the   Origin and Mechanism of
  breaking the prisms transversely, or pulling asunder lengthwise
  or breaking transversely such prisms as may be unequally gripped
  at different points by those surrounding them—these strains ori
  ginating in the later stages of cooling of the mass viewed as a
  whole.    On the other hand, where planes of easiest fracture are
  more or less developed in the mass of unsplit-up basalt, their
  effect will be to shorten the length between the joints, so that
  they shall be found to occur within distances of each other less
  than the diameter of the prism.      This is frequently observed in
  the Antrim and Scottish basalts; and wherever that is the case,
  so far as the writer has observed, the separate-joint blocks break
  under the hammer more easily in the direction transverse to the
  length of the prism than in any other. We have yet to consider
  some of the circumstances which render the prisms into which
  the mass splits more or less irregular as to the lengths and the
  number of their sides.    As has been shown, in homogeneous and
 isotropic basalt cooling symmetrically, the prisms can only be
 hexagonal and equilateral.       Irregular prisms, however, are to
 be found, in most basaltic regions, having from three to seven or
 even more sides, and often far from equilateral.     Without going
 into prolix detail, it will be easily seen that differences of mole
 cular structure in different directions in the yet unsplit mass, the
 unequal dispersion throughout of cavities or heterogeneous im
 bedded materials, differences of conductivity in nearly contiguous
 parts of the mass, slight differences in the contraction in differ
 ent directions and the consequent greater width of the <U+FB01>ssures
 separating the prisms in one direction rather than in another,
 and slight differences in the rate of cooling of adjacent parts of
 the mass by inequalities in the contour of the cooling surface or
 in the “jacketing
                        ” of detrital matter which may cover      it,
 or in the movements of superincumbent water, all tend respec
 tively to perturb the regularity of the hexagonal prism, which,
 however, is   never observed to disappear as the ruling or typical
form of the basaltic prism.      Walking over the tops of large
                                                             a
pavement      of basaltic columns    such as those exposed at the
Giant’s Causeway      and  elsewhere,  one sees places in which the
hexagonal form becomes irregular, and gives place, though for     a
very small extent of surface, to quadrangular and other irregular
forms, sometimes even triangular or wedge-shaped     ;    but passing
a   short distance we <U+FB01>nd these rapidly returning to the normal
hexagonal type through intervening prismatic forms, which usu
ally plainly indicate that, whatever may have been the origina
ting cause of the disturbance of form, the tendency is to return
to the hexagonal prism through such intermediate forms of irre
gular prisms as require the least amount of molecular work_ to
produce their separation, the principle of least action thus being
ever and pervadingly   present.

            production   of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.          209
    So far we have been regarding the mass of basalt as tabular
 and horizontal, and cooling symmetrically from the top or bot
 tom surface or from both, in which cases the prisms are all
 vertical and straight.   We have yet to point out how differences
 in the form, variations in thickness at different parts, and in
 the positions of the principal cooling surfaces, can affect the
position in space of the axes of the prisms, and can cause
them to be no longer straight but curved in very various ways.
On the principles already developed, it is plain that the direction
of the axes of the prisms is determined by the form of the sur
face passing through all the points in which splitting is actually
taking place, the separated sides of the prisms being always
normal to that surface.     If, therefore, the mass be tabular and
horizontal, and cooled from the top surface only and uniformly
from  it, the prisms will be vertical and straight, and will extend
from the top to the bottom of the mass, where they will rest upon
a  thicker or thinner stratum of irregular fragments, as in <U+FB01>g. 10.
If, however, like tabular mass be cooled from the top surface and
               a
the bottom surface also, there will be formed two distinct ranges of
straight vertical prisms abutting upon each other somewhere be
tween the top and the bottom of the mass, and separated      bystra
                                                                  a

of prisms   isproduced      by
                            the top cooling causing splitting down
wards, the lower range by the cooling from the bottom and
splitting upwards.    The axes of any two prisms in the top and
bottom ranges need not coincide in position; and the respective
lengths of the prisms in each range depends upon the rate of
cooling from the top and from the bottom respectively; so that
if the cooling from each of these were the same, the separating
stratum of irregular fragment would be found in the middle of
the thickness of the mass.    But in nature almost always occurs,
                                              it
for obvious reasons, that the rate of cooling from the top surface
greatly exceeds that from the bottom, and hence the upper
range of prisms     proportionately longer than the lower range.

    angle between these in a ratio
    which depends on the rate of cool
    ing from the top and from the
    abutting side respectively, the prisms being longest in that
    direction in which cooling has proceeded most rapidly—the ir

single sheet, but is broken up into partial waves with divergent
and, as may be said, accidental wave-paths, so that fracture by
contraction takes place in many different directions.   The strata
of irregular fragments thus produced   are not invariably found in
nature, being sometimes replaced by thin beds of clays or ochres
whose incoherence and small conductivity admit of more regular
cooling at the extremity of the prisms.       Such irregular frag
ments are also found occasionally converted into ochre by de
composition.       If
                    the thickness of a tabular mass varies but
slightly and gradually, so that the section is slightly wedge
shaped, and cooling takes place mainly from the top surface,
then the prisms may be straight and perpendicular            to the
top   surface throughout  the  mass, and  only separated  from  the
bottom by a stratum of irregular fragment.              But if (as in

mechanical work of splitting up the cooling and contracting
mass.     The principle of economy in work, which determines
the size as well as the form at starting, continues throughout the
entire production of the prism however deep it may enter into
the mass; but if each prism continued to diminish in diameter
inde<U+FB01>nitely in length, there would be an enormous waste of
work in splitting the deeper parts of the mass into prisms far
more numerous than would be necessary there to relieve the
contractile strain, which, when the temperature has become the
same is per unit length the same as it were at the surface.
Hence after the taper prisms have reached a certain length from
the surface, they are either found to end at a thin stratum of
irregular fragments and a fresh range of taper prisms to com

214      Mr. R. Mallet       on the   Origin and Mechanism of
regions, though no solution of the facts has hitherto, so far
as the writer is aware, been given.            In <U+FB01>g. 17 such con
vergent prisms are shown separating one of those huge mush
room-shaped protrusions of basalt which have welled up through
<U+FB01>ssures (as in <U+FB01>g. 13) and have also over<U+FB02>owed the surface,
examples of which are numerous in Saxony and elsewhere.               In
such a case cooling is almost wholly con<U+FB01>ned to the top sur

but amorphous   ;   or  ifprismatic, the prisms may be more or less
confuscdly curved, on principles to be hereafter referred to.

cooling from the under surface, and at          a certain height above
this columnar structure will become evanescent and all the re

 basalt alone.    Examples of this passage from prismatic into
 massive basalt are to be found in all basaltic regions.
    Inasmuch as the splitting into straight prisms always takes
place perpendicular to the cooling surface,                obvious (on

simultaneously from its top and bottom and from the convex
<U+FB02>anks of the valley or hollow, the prisms will tend, on the whole,
to perpendicularity towards the centre of the valley, being formed
in one or several ranges separated by angular fragments; while
at the convex <U+FB02>anks the prisms may assume curvilinear forms,
on principles now about to be more particularly explained.
   So far the writer has treated only of the formation of straight
prisms; but curved or apparently bent prisms must also be
produced by the play of those forces which have been already
explained when the bounding surfaces supporting the mass of
cooling basalt are curved, or the mass of such form as is suitable
to their production.
   Whatever be the form of a cooling mass of basalt whose tem
perature is supposed originally uniform throughout, the wave of
heat which is <U+FB01>rst lost is parallel to the external contour of the
mass; and if the mass be of such a form that successive iso
therms are parallel to each other and to the original contour, as
in the tabular masses that we have been considering, the prisms
into which it splits, whatever be their direction in space must be
straight and normal to the external contour or bounding surface
of the mass. But if the mass be of such a form that successive
isotherms taken in descending order (as ii, kk, ll, <U+FB01>g. 22) do
not remain parallel, the prisms (as 1112', p'p”, 8:0.) can be no

the splitting passes through successive divergent isotherms, as

a level plane, cooling taking place in each case from the top sur
face only.    The isothermal planes whose vertical sections are
represented in <U+FB01>gs. 22, 22 A, 22 B by dotted lines will be seen to
diverge towards the shallower part of the mass in every case—just
as the ice which forms upon a pond, <U+FB01>rst forms and becomes
thickest at the shallower parts of the water, and thins out, it may
be to nothing, as it approaches the deeper parts—the under sur
face of the ice (which at any instant is the isotherm of 32° Fahr.)
not being parallel to the level upper surface, but rising as it ap
proaches the deeper and therefore still warmer portion of the
water, which, like our basalt, cools only from the surface.
   The sole necessary condition, therefore, to the production of
curved in place of straight prisms is su<U+FB02>icient inequality in
volume, and therefore in the rate of cooling, of the mass at dif
ferent points of its surface, the measurements being taken nor
mally to the cooling surface; and curvature in the prisms must

            production   of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.        217
  be produced whether the form of the bottom upon which the
  mass of basalt reposes be convex (as in <U+FB01>g. 22), or concave (as in
  22 A), or a plane (as in <U+FB01>g. 22 B). Curvature in the prisms
  must also take place when the top and bottom surfaces are both
‘
  planes (as in <U+FB01>g. 15) but inclined to each other at an angle large
  enough to give suf<U+FB01>ciently abrupt change in depth to the cooling
  mass, cooling in all cases being supposed to take place from the
  top surface or from one of the two surfaces only.           The precise
  curve that will be assumed by each prism must vary in different
  parts of the mass, and may vary also in different parts of the
  length of each prism—that is to say, depends upon the greater
  or less rapidity with which the isotherms vary in divergence
  from parallelism.       The concave side of the curvature of each
  prism will always present itself towards the deeper part of
  the mass, in which direction also the isothermal planes con
  verge.     The cases illustrated by the <U+FB01>gs. 22, 22 A, 22 B
  refer to change of depth or of volume in the mass in one di
   rection only, in which case the curvature of each prism will be
  in one plane only 5 but, as is obvious, the depth or volume of the
   mass may vary in orthogonal directions, and hence the prisms
   split from such a mass may be curved in more than one plane;
   and with certain forms of irregularity of the bottom the curva
   ture of some of the prisms may have points of contrary <U+FB02>exure.
   It is further obvious that curved prisms thus produced by cooling
  from the top only will be very slightly taper, their smallest dia_
   meter being at the bottom.            As in nature the curvature is
   usually   small  in proportion    to  the  length of the prism, so the
   taper may   be   so small  as  to   be  inappreciable.  It is also plain
   that if from any causes the rate of cooling varies at different
   points of the cooling surface, corresponding changes may result
   in the curvature or divergence of the isothermal planes and, by
    consequence, in the curvatures of the prisms themselves.
      Innumerable variations and combinations of curvature, often
   so perplexed and confused as to defy analysis, are to be found in
   many basaltic regions, due generally to successive and superim
   posed out<U+FB02>ows locally occurring, and to dykes <U+FB01>lled with trans
   verse prisms    cutting through prismatic masses previously deve
   loped, and to violent diversities of cooling due to water-channels
   formed on the surface, or to violent mechanical efforts (such as
   those of tilting or dislocating of the bottom, or of denudation,
   &c.) having concurred with, or acted posteriorly to the pro
   duction of the prisms themselves; but into these details the
    writer cannot here enter.
       No intelligible solution of the mode of production of curved
   basaltic prisms has, so far as the author is aware, been produced
   by former authors. De la Beche (‘ Geological Observer,’ 2nd edit.

218        Mr. R. Mallet on the Origin and Mechanism of
p. 406)  says,
                “ also in those curved columns of basalt where  . . . .
no joints are apparent we may suppose that some tendency of
an original set of spheroids to develop themselves more in one
direction than another, from some local cause, has been so con
tinued as to produce the general curve observed ;” while Scrope
says (‘Volcanos,’ 2nd. edit. pp. 99-100), “sometimes the co
lumns have taken a gradual and graceful curve, probably in
consequence of some slow movement impressed upon the lava
matter during the process of consolidation.”        The last merely
repeats the notion expressed by Bakewell (Introduction to Geo
logy, 1st edit. 1813, p. 112), who says, “In some situations
basaltic columns are bent, apparently by the force of incumbent
pressure when in a soft and yielding state.”
   The <U+FB01>rst of these notions is devoid of any value, resting, as it
does, upon the false hypothesis originated by Gregory Watt,
that prismatic basalt has been produced by the squeezing toge
ther of spheroidal lumps ; while the two latter are untenable on
the ground already proved, that the splitting into prisms can
not commence until after the mass has been cooled enough to
become rigid.      Curved prisms are frequently jointed ; and had
they  been   formed   originally straight, and subsequently bent by
pressure,   however    slowly applied, after the mass had become
rigid, it is scarcely conceivable that transverse fractures of the
prisms should not be found, and that the transverse joints, if
produced in the way explained in the preceding pages, should
not have been opened upon the convex side of the curve; indeed
the most natural supposition would be that the bending-force
would dislocate the straight and rigid prisms at the joints and
form bundles of straight prisms meeting each other at very ob
tuse angles.     It is not to be denied, however, that severe pres
sure has in some instances been transmitted through masses of
prismatic basalt suf<U+FB01>cient to generate a distinct slaty cleavage
in the prisms after their production from previously homoge
neous material.      Thus, in the neighbourhood of Mont d’Or les
Bains is a huge isolated mass of prismatic basalt, all the sepa
rate joints of which have a slaty cleavage, so that they may be
split into a coarse sort of roo<U+FB01>ng-slabs,         whence the mass
takes its local name of “ la tuillerie.”     The pressure has varied
in direction in different parts of the mass, the prisms at one side
of which possess a cleavage approaching to a plane transverse to
their axes, while at the remote side of the mass the plane of
cleavage is inclined at a small angle to the axes.    But there are
no evidences that the severe pressure suf<U+FB01>cient to produce this
 laty cleavage has bent or distorted the prisms themselves—thus
presenting an additional proof that the basaltic mass was already
rigid when the splitting into prisms took place, and that the

          production of the Prismatic Structure  of Basalt.       219
rigidity was suf<U+FB01>cient to prevent the subsequent distortion in
the forms of the prisms without preventing those minute mole
cular movements by which slaty cleavage is developed in rigid
bodies under severe pressure.
    We have thus traced the production of prismatic structure,
and all the leading phenomena which it presents in nature, to a
single and simple cause, namely contraction by cooling, the ad
mitted physical laws governing which suf<U+FB01>ciently account for
the hexagonal as the normal form of the prisms, for the diame
ters assumed by the prisms, for the variably cupped form and
the direction taken by the convexity of the transverse joints
and the variability of their distances apart, for the various direc
tions in which the axes of straight prisms are found in nature,
and for the production of prisms whose axes are variously cur
vilinear.
    Upon the principle, then, that that solution of any natural
problem which accounts, upon admitted principles, for all the
phenomena, and introduces as consequences no new facts not
accountable for, must be the true one, the writer ventures to
believe he has solved this problem which for nearly ninety
years has perplexed physical geology.
    If the principles here enunciated be admitted, it will be readily
seen that they present a powerful and valuable guide to the <U+FB01>eld
geologist for deciphering the hitherto perplexing phenomena
presented by basalt, as well as many of those produced by it
upon adjacent rocks.
    It would seem therefore unnecessary to enter upon any for
mal refutation of those very crude and ill-thought-out notions
which attribute prismatic structure to the squeezing together of
                                         “              ” of Antrim,
globular or spheroidal masses like the onion-stone
or like the superimposed spheroids which are to be found in
all large basaltic regions.     Such spheroids are found not con
<U+FB01>ned to basalt, but existing    as the residues of chemical decom
position and weathering in all rocky formations, presenting a
more or less distinct horizontal strati<U+FB01>cation with vertical planes
of separation. Such instances are familiar, not only in granitic,
gneissose, and porphyritic rocks, but in many of a far softer
character, argillaceous or calcareous.      The superpoed columns
of orbicular masses of onion-stone prove themselves by every
indication to be the decomposing remains of what were once
jointed prismatic columns of basalt.
    The exterior of each spheroid is friable or incoherent, cohe
rence increasing as we advance toward the centre of the sphe
roid, which presents no nucleus of foreign matter or any in
dication that the spheroid has been produced by what have been
vaguely called concretionary forces.       The little irregular
                                                                 prip
                                                                     \

220       Mr. R. Mallet   on the Origin and Mechanism of
 matic frusta which can be readily detached in crusts or singly
 from the exterior of the spheroids, are very generally separated
 by thin interposed     urfaces of soft clayey material (kaolin),
 which has obviously been produced by the decomposition
 of the felspar, one of the chief constituents of basalts, as is
 proved by the marked de<U+FB01>ciency of alkalies, found by analyses,
 in the exterior fragments of the spheroids, as compared with
the proportion of these in the harder and deeper interior of
 the lump.    From the nature of the contractile forces of cooling,
by which the prismatic joints or cheeses of basalt have been pro
duced, as described in the preceding pages, it follows that some
residual internal strains due to the <U+FB01>nal play of the contractile
forces, and after those which have produced the prismatic and
jointed structure have ceased to act, must exist in every one of these
prismatic segments, producing, in a material so rigid as is basalt,
interior planes of strain and of weakness in directions both cir
cumferential and radial (as indicated in <U+FB01>g. 23), and assuming
the spheroidal form the more nearly as they approach the centre.
                            F'IC.23
These planes of strain and of weakness become, under the in<U+FB02>u
ence of the chemical action of air and water, of rain and of frost,
the planes of separation in which the prismatic segments become
broken up, angles and corners disappearing <U+FB01>rst, until at last
an irregular orbicular lump alone remains, or several of these
superimposed.     And where these lumps are found not regularly
superimposed, but thrown together pell mell, as often happens,
a careful examination of the directions in which the planes of
disintegration are found in the lumps occupying di<U+FB02>'erent parts
of the mass is suf<U+FB01>cient to prove that they have been formed
from what were once prismatic segments or cheeses, detached
and overthrown by mechanical forces from their pristine colum
                                                     -
nar arrangement.
    Did space allow, much additional evidence might be adduced
in proof of the fact that prismatic basalt has not been formed
by any process whatsoever from such spheroids, but that, on the
contrary, these latter have been produced by decomposition and
disintegration of the pointed pieces of basaltic prisms previously

         production  of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.         221
formed. The facility with which certain varieties of basalt decom
pose and disintegrate is instanced by Bakewell, who, in his work
                                              “
already quoted (p. 127), states that he had seen a mound formed
of basalt that had been got out of a mine by blasting with gun
powder, and which, he was informed, was once extremely hard and
resisted the point of the pick; but by exposure to the air for
thirty years it was converted into a rich mould and covered with
a luxuriant crop of vegetables.”      Similar striking differences in
facility of decomposition and disintegration have long been re
marked in lavas.      Torrents are to be found in abundance which,
though poured forth beyond the reach of history or tradition, still
resist decomposition, and scarcely permit even a lichen to grow
 upon their austere and rigid surface, while other examples are
 abundant of lavas largely decomposed into vegetable earth within
 a few generations of men ; these fact tend to account for the pre
 sence of compact columnar basalt, and basaltic columns decom
 posed into onion-stone, existing in close proximity to each other.
     The notion of production from spheroids is traceable to the
 paper of Mr. Gregory Watt, in the Phil. Trans. for 1804, entitled
 “ Observations on Basalt,” &c.         Partly from the backward
 state of physical and chemical science as applied to geology at
 that period, this paper at once acquired an exaggerated reputa
 tion and currency, and has continued almost unchallenged for
 seventy years.     So far, however, as relates to the production of
 prismatic basalt in the way assigned by Mr. Watt, it is impos
 sible to avoid stating that his opinions rest upon a bad or imper
 fect experiment inaccurately reasoned upon and falsely applied.
 He fused in a reverberatory furnace (whether an iron-foundry
 “ melting-furnace ” or a “ puddling-furnace ” is not
                                                           clear) some
 six or seven hundredweight        of  “              ”  basalt; and
                                         Rowley-rag
 <U+FB01>nding that after slow cooling some parts of the mass consisted
 of irregular spheroidal lumps of various sizes separated from
 each other by more or less <U+FB02>attened surfaces, which were red or
 rusty in colour, he concludes that by fusing and slow cooling this
 concretionary structure had resulted ; he also infers that a like
  structure upon a much vaster scale must have been developed
  in all prismatic basalt, the prismatic structure being produced
  by the squeezing together of these concretionary lumps into the
  prismatic form.     Now the immediate result of Mr. Watt’s ex
  periment was not fused basalt alone, but that material hetero
  geneously mixed up with the fused brick of his furnace (roof as
  well as sole), and most probably also with the silicates and oxides
  of iron adherent to it from former use, and more or less of the
  ashes of the fuel; hot sand moreover was employed to cover
  over the surface of the lique<U+FB01>ed mass,_ so as to cause it to cool
  more slowly.     All these conditions suf<U+FB01>ciently show that the

222       Mr. R. Mallet   on the   Origin and Mechanism of
concretionary structure was due to the heterogeneity of the ma
terial and the foreign nuclei introduced.    The formation of such
curviform lumps is familiar to every ironmaster as occurring
occasionally in almost every variety of slag; but it is always
traceable to heterogeneity or to abrupt and unequal cooling.
Where is the evidence for any such concretionary development
in the vast masses of prismatic basalt, which are amongst the
most perfectly homogeneous of known rocks?           But assuming
that such a general structure did preexist, and that we had some
evidence in support of the purely arbitrary assumption that some
extraneous force existed suf<U+FB01>cient to squeeze these to any extent
of mutual distortion, where is the evidence that such mutual
compression could even result in their being squeezed into con
tinuous jointed prisms.     The supposed concretionary masses can
only be assumed thrown confusedly together like cannon-shot of
various calibres in a pile, not even in regular layers or resting
on any symmetric base; and as we ascend, the spheroids of each
succeeding layer must drop, so far as the variability of their sizes
will admit, to the lowest possible point between the supporting
spheroids below.     Each spheroid, therefore, as in the two only
possible arrangements of shot in a pile, which may have a trian_
gular or quadrangular base, must be in contact either with three
or with four supporting spheroids below it; but in this case,
which is in reality the only possible one, mutual compression
(equal in all directions) will not produce prisms at all, but
merely an aggregate of rhombic dodecahedrons differently
posited in the two cases.    If we are to have prisms as the result,
the spheroids must be assumed arranged in vertical or rectilineal
columns, each touching only one below       it, in unstable equili
brium and   in de<U+FB01>ance of all the laws which regulate the posi
tions of free and mutually attractive molecules or gravitating
spheroids.
     If
      we admit these enormous improbabilities, then prisms either
tetrahedral or hexahedral might result from mutual compression    ;
but, unless the spheroids were all precisely of equal diameter and
identical in compressibility and retained exactly their original
lineal arrangement during the whole progress of compression,
the prisms could not be even approximately of equal diameter
throughout. Nor could the cup-form of the cross joints ever be
produced at all, whether, as Mr. Scrope imagines, the convex
surfaces were always presented downwards, or the contrary; for
it may be easily shown that the mutual distortion of such lines
of spheroids into prisms, whether square or hexagonal, must
result not in mutually <U+FB01>tting convexities and cups, but in ex
tremely complicated opposite surfaces undulated both in radial
and circumferential directions.

          production    of the Prismatic Structure of Basalt.              223
    Such are the conditions of mutual compression which most
writers on the subject since Mr. 'Watt have had somewhat con
                                               ‘
fusedly in their minds (see Scrope, Volcanos,’ 2nd edit. foot
note p. 102.et seq.).          But the conditions assumed by Mr. G.
Watt are even still more far-fetched and chimerical, and may be
stated in his own words :—-“ In a stratum composed of an inde
<U+FB01>nite number in super<U+FB01>cial extent, but one only in height, of
impenetrable spheroids with nearly equidistant centres, if the
spheroids should come in contact on the same plane, it seems
obvious that their mutual action would form them into hexa
gons; and if these were resisted below and there was no oppo—
 sing cause above them, it seems equally clear that they would
extend their dimensions upwards, and thus form hexagonal
prisms whose length might be inde<U+FB01>nitely greater than their
 diameters” (Phil. Trans. 1804!, Part i. p. 307). This suppo
 sition leads to even more extravagantly improbable results than
 the former*.        None of these authors condescends to inform us
 whether their spheroids under compression are to be supposed
 cold and rigid, or heated so as to be plastic.          We may infer from
 the context, however, in the case of Mr. Watt, if not also in that
 of Mr. Scrope, that each spheroid is in a state of plasticity by
 heat, thus yielding to pressure as an imperfect liquid.              Vertical
 prisms are recorded by authors 150 feet in length and only 9
 inches in diameter (Scope ‘Volcanos,’ p. 102), and others 6
 to 8 feet in diameter and 4.0 feet and upwards in length.                If we
 assume a prism of the smaller of these diameters and only 100
 feet in length, it would demand a sphere for its production in
 the supposed manner equal to its own volume, or 4'1 feet in
  diameter, and, in the case of the larger diameter and length of
  prism, of 8'4 feet diameter.         No instance has been observed, or
 probably exists, of any extensive collection of spheroids of either
 of these large sizes, or even approximately: all of equal diame
 ters.    Admitting, argumenti gratia, the existence of some un
 known external compressive force suf<U+FB01>cient to overcome all the
 resistances, including that of the hydrostatic pressure of the
     * Mr. Watt's paper presents one of those singular examples, of which
  so many others exist in the records of scienti<U+FB01>c research, of how near an
  author may approach to completely discerning a truth and yet be blinded
 by a preconceived and falsely based hypothesis.      At page 311 (Phil. Trans.
  as above) it will be seen that Watt had some clear ideas as to the splitting
  up into hexagonal prisms by contraction in cooling ; but immediately after
  (pp. 313—314) he dismisses this all in the words, “though these conside
  rations may be su<U+FB01>icient to explain the tendency to division into prisms
  which is so generally extended . . . . they are utterly inadequate to the for
  mation of the more perfect basaltic prisms; they offer no means of account
  ing for the extreme regularity of the sides and the precision of the angles,
  for the articulations, for the close contact in which the perfect columns are
  placed to one another,” 810.

224       Mr. R. Mallet on   the   Origin and Mechanism of
forced-up columns, let us in one or two instances remark the
consequences in which the assumed mechanism must land us.
In the case of the 9-inch prism, let us suppose a surface of
spheres of 4'1 feet diameter squeezed orthogonally and equally
in both directions between the exterior edges and the centre ; or
in half a mile there are 640 spheres at the commencement
which are squeezed by upward yielding into the same number
of hexagonal prisms of 9 inches minor diameter, the aggregate
of their diameters in the one line being 64-0 x '75 feet=480 feet,
deducting which from 2640 feet (half a mile), we <U+FB01>nd that the
centre of <U+FB01>gure of the exterior sphere must travel or be forced
over the ground upon which they all rest by a distance equal
to 2160 feet.
   Is it possible that such an enormous range of transport should
ever have occurred in nature and left no trace upon and beneath
                                     '
the base of the basaltic mass ?
   Compressive forces of enormous energy are to be found in
nature, but always acting through small ranges. Where have we
any examples of such forces acting through such immense
ranges as are here required and yet leaving no trace of their ex
istence?     Assuming, however, that such have so acted, the fol
lowing   would   be amongst the consequences of which evident
trace could not but be found :—
    1. The compressive      effect in elevating the squeezed-up
columns will not be uniform along any one line of spheres, but
will be greatest upon those spheres which are nearest to the ex
terior of the surface pressed ; the <U+FB01>nal effect, therefore, of such
compression upon a square mile of spheres 4'1 feet diameter'
will not be to produce a <U+FB02>at-topped tabular mass of 480 X 2:960
feet square, but one having the general form of an inverted
square pyramid, the prisms being tallest all round the out
side and of least altitude in the centre.     Has any such gene—
ral form, or any thing even remotely resembling        it, in large
masses of vertically prismatic basalt ever been observed?       On
the contrary, do not all such masses present the general charac
teristic of having nearly level or more or less irregularly convex
tops  ?
   2. If the prisms be produced      by the squeezing against each
other of  a  stratum of spheres plastic   byheat, then must internal
movements have been produced in the mass of each sphere during
its distortion, resulting in a  distinct molecular structure or ar
rangement of the particles of the prism throughout its length,
from which    it  would result that the prism itself would be more
dif<U+FB01>cultly frangible transverse to its axis (the only direction in
which joints are found to occur), and be most easily frangible
or cleavable in planes parallel to the sides of the prism, or in

            production   of the Prismatic Structure qf Basalt.       225
    radial planes passing through its axis—contrary to the result of
    observation in all natural basalt.     Were it worth while to oc
    cupy space   in further refutation of this notion, it would be easy
    to point out many other incongruous conditions either involved
    in the conception or in its consequences.       One other notion is
    to be found more or less obscurely suggested by various authors,
    and to which even some countenance has been given by Delesse;
    it is that which supposes basaltic prisms to have resulted from
    crystallogenic forces, and to be themselves of the nature' of
    gigantic crystals.
        The mere magnitude of the prisms is not alone suf<U+FB01>cient to
    overthrow this notion; for undoubted crystals of quartz, of beryl,
    carbonate and sulphate of lime, galena, common salt, &c. are
    known to exist of magnitudes vying with the diameters at least
    of basaltic prisms.    But these all possess the character of true
    crystals, viz. that their internal structure is throughout that an
    nounced by their exterior contour; but in no basaltic prism,
    however distinctly crystallized may be the integrant particles of
    dissimilar minerals (pyroxene, felspar, Ste.) of which the prism
    consists, is there the slightest relation traceable between the di
    rections of the axes of these integrant crystals and the axis or
    contour of the prism itself.     We might as well call a hexagonal
    column of granite or porphyry cut out by the hand of alapidary
    a crystal, as to apply the term to a basaltic prism.
        But though crystalline forces have had no part in the produc
    tion of basaltic prisms, the laws of their production by symme
    tric fracturing, due to cooling and contraction, do present some
     interesting analogies with the results of crystallization under
    certain circumstances in bodies solidifying from fusion.
        It has been pointed out by the writer, in his paper “On
    the Physical Conditions involved in the Construction of Artil
‘         ”
    lei-y   (in the ‘Transactions’ of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxii.
    June 1855), that in all such cases the principal axes of the crys
    tals constituting the cooled mass arrange themselves in direc
     tions orthogonal to the external contours of the mass—that       is,
    in the directions in which the heat-wave has passed from the
    cooling body; that   is  to say, the principal axes of the integrant
    crystals are in their arrangement very similar to those of the
     axes of the prisms in prismatic basalt. And the analogy extends
     even to this—that the principal axes of the crystals are curved
     where the crystallizing mass has curved surfaces of contour, or
     where the volume in relation to the cooling surface changes more
     or less abruptly; in other words, where the isothermal surfaces
     of cooling are divergent, as, for example, in the ogival portion
     of elongated projectiles for ri<U+FB02>ed cannon of chilled cast iron,
     the principal axes of the crystals are found curved, as in <U+FB01>g. 24,

and in the same way as described in

the curved prisms of basalt, and illus
trated by <U+FB01>g. 2213, which may be
viewed as a longitudinal section of
one half of the projectile, B B being
its axis. But these appear to be mere
resemblances and analogies; and if there is anyphysical connexion       .
 between the splitting forces by which prismatic basalt has been
 produced and those crystallogenic forces <U+FB01>rst pointed out by the
 writer in 1855 and here referred to, it will be hereafter to be
 sought for by the laws ascertained by Mitseherlich with respect
 to the different dilatation (or contraction) of crystals in different
 directions with respect to their principal axes, which seem to
 point to the conclusion that the formation of the crystalline
 planes of separation in masses of crystallizable substances as they
 cool may be due to differences of contractility of their constituent
 crystals in different directions.    If  so, the production of crystal
 line planes   of separation parallel  to  the principal axes in a mass
 crystallizing from cooling may prove to be as much the result
 of contraction as the splitting-up of an uncrystallizable mass of
 basalt into prisms is so.     All bodies which contract by heating,
 by   cooling, and  by  drying, such as sand baked into stone, starch,
  mud, coke, &c., tend to separate, as has been often remarked,
  into more or less prismatic masses; upon the particular condi
  tions of which in different cases it is not 'necessary here to en_
  large, further than to remark that in the case of mud, which as it
  occurs in nature has almost invariably been deposited from water
  in shallow hollows or cavities, the deposit thins out towards its
  edges.    In drying, therefore, by sun and air, the stratum is ob
  served to crack <U+FB01>rst at and near the edges and in directions
  more or less orthogonal to these.        The irregular ribbons thus
  produced between two contiguous cracks again split transversely
  by further drying into more or less square pieces—a form which
  thus results from two successive stages of contraction, in con
  tradistinction to the one which produces the hexagonal division
  of the basalt, as enunciated in the preceding pages. It must be
  borne in mind that the contractile forces produced by baking,
  desiccation, &c. must act locally and in succession on different
  parts of the mass, and can never produce the same regularity of
   separation as is found in a mass of cooling basalt.

 XXV.       On an Alleged  Error in Laplace’s Theory of the Tides.
                  By Sir WILLIAM THOMSON, F.R.S.*
            in his article on Tides and Waves in the Encyclo
1.
     AIRY,
        pedia Metropolitana, gives a version of Laplace’ theory         s
of the tides which     has the undoubtedly great merit of being
freed from certain inappropriate applications of “ Laplace’s co
c<U+FB01>icients,” or, as they are now more commonly called, “ Sphe
rical harmonics,” by which its illustrious author attempted, not
quite successfully, to design a method for taking into account the
alteration of gravity due to the tidal disturbance of the surface
of the sea in the solution of his dynamical equations.
   It is the repetition of this attempt for each of the “three spe
cies of oscillations ” (Ille'canique Ce'leste, Liv. iv. arts. 5., 7.,9.),
and the preparation forit [in the course of working out the fun
damental differential equations (art. 3.)] by the assertion that “ a,
b, c, a' are to be rational functions of      and 4/1— 2,” that
                                                    ,u,
throws   acloud over nearly the whole chapter (Liv. iv. chap. of            i.)
the Mécanique Ce’leste devoted to the dynamical theory of the
tides, and fully justi<U+FB01>es the following statement with which
Airy [Tides and Waves, art. (66)] introduces his own version of
Laplace’s theory:—
  “ It would be useless to offer this
                                      theory in the same shape in
“which Laplace has given           for the part of the Mécanigue

             which   contains the Theory of Tides     perhaps on the
                                                              is
“whole more obscure than any other part of the           same extent
“in that work. We shall give the theory in form equivalent to

   2. The only good thing lost in Airy’s treatise through the
omission of the spherical harmonic analysis           is
                                                Laplace’s complete
solution for the case of no rotation and equal depth of the sea

substantially the same as Laplace’s, except the judicious omission
of the unsuccessful attempts referred to above.
   3. In giving Laplace’s solution for the semidiurnal tide with
the change of gravity due to the change of <U+FB01>gure of the water
not taken into account, Airy points out what he believed to be
an error, so serious that, after correcting          it,  it   was “needless      to

“ observe that Laplace’s numerical calculations of the heights of
“tides in certain latitudes, and his inferences as to the latitude
“ where there is no tide 860., fall to the ground.” \Vhen I first
read Airy’s treatise ten years ago on board the ‘ Great Eastern,’
 1 could not assent to his correction of Laplace, but, on the con
trary, satis<U+FB01>ed myself that Laplace was quite right. Not having
 the Me’canique Ce'leste at hand,   I  set the subject aside for a time,
 intending   to  return  to  it for the   second volume of ‘Thomson
 and Tait’s   Natural   Philosophy,’ with the <U+FB01>rst volume of which
 I was then occupied.
    4. My attention has recently been recalled to it by reading
 in a volume of ‘ Tidal Researches,’ constituting an appendix
 contributed by WV. Ferrel to the ‘ United States Coasts Survey
 Report for 1874,’ the following passage referring to Laplace’s
 solution for the semidiurnal tides :—
    “ The results show that the form which the surface of the
“ sea assumes in this case di<U+FB01>'ers very much from that of a prolate
 “ spheroid with its longer axis in the direction of the disturbing
 “ body, and that for certain depths of the ocean the tides at the
 “
   equator are inverted, low water taking place un der the attracting
 “ body. For great depths, however, the tides were found to be
 “direct in all latitudes; and even in the cases in which they
 “are inverted at the equator they were found to be direct to
 “ ward the poles, and consequently there is a latitude in such
“ cases where there are no tides. Laplace, however, failed to in
“ terpret correctly in this case his own solution, so that the nume
 “ rical results which he has given for different assumed depths of
 “the ocean are erroneous ; but still the general results just stated
 “ are readily seen from the solution. Having failed to see the in
“ determinate character of the problem, he adopted a singular and
 “ unwarranted principle for determining the value of a constant
“ which is entirely arbitrary in the case of no friction, but which
 “ vanishes in the case of friction, however small. This oversight
“of Laplace and the indeterminateness of this constant were sub
                                                “
“sequently pointed out by Airy.” The singular and unwar
ranted principle” thus referred to is in fact an exquisitely subtle
method by which it seems Laplace had determined a constant
which is not arbitrary in any case, and which cannot be more
than in<U+FB01>nitesimally modi<U+FB01>ed by in<U+FB01>nitesimal friction. Ferrel
further extends to Laplace’s integration for the “diurnal tide”
the objection of indeterminateness which Airy had raised only
against his integration for the semidiurnal ; and he follows
Airy in an integration (not given by Laplace) for the “long
period tide,” in which a false appearance of determinateness
 (strangely inconsistent with the indeterminateness asserted of
the solutions for the semidiurnal and the diurnal) is produced

                              in Laplace’s Theory of the Tides.                                        229
by the inadvertent    omission of a constant*, the true value of
which is to be determined by a proper application of Laplace’s
method.     With these results before me, cannot wait two or             I
three years more for the second volume of ‘ Thomson and Tait’s
Natural Philosophy ’ to defend Laplace’s process, but must
speak out on the subject without delay; and therefore        offer                                 I

of the problem of <U+FB01>nding the semidiurnal tide in a polar basin,
or ocean continuous and equally deep from either pole to a shore'
lying along any circle of latitude on the near side of the equator.
Laplace’s result, as we have seen, does the same for a hemisphe—
rical sea from pole to equator.      But for a sea extending from
either pole to a coast coinciding with a circle of latitude beyond
the equator another form of solution (still, however, with but
one arbitrary constant) must be sought*, because Laplace’s
form [(3) of § 5 above] ceasing to converge when w (or the
sine of the polar distance 6) increases up to unity, fails to
provide for the continuous variation of 0 from zero to any
value exceeding évr.       And, further, the method suggested by
Airy, when extended to a complete solution of the differential
 equation with its two arbitrary constants-t, completely solves the
 problem of <U+FB01>nding the semidiurnal tide in a zonal sea of equal
 depth between coasts coinciding with any two parallels of latitude.

 covered with water, we <U+FB01>nd in the Me’canique Céleste the nume
 rical results referred to by Airy (but not quoted, because of the
 supposed error in the process by which they were obtained). They
 are of exceedingly great interest (when we know them to be cor

The negative sign in the <U+FB01>rst case shows that the tide is “ in
verted” at the equator ; or there is low water when the disturb
ing body is on the meridian, and high water when it is rising
or setting.  For small values of x (that is to say, for polar
regions) the sign is positive, and therefore the tides are direct
for this, as clearly for every other depth (because in every case
the <U+FB01>rst term is +Hw9).          In the particular case in question
(depth           as

roughly '95, or the cosine of 18°. Hence Laplace concludes
the tides are inverted in the whole zone between the parallels of
18° north and south latitude, while throughout the regions
north and south of these latitudes the tides are direct.       The
formulae given above for the second and third of the depths
chosen         by
             Laplace shows that in these cases the tides are every
where direct and increase continuously from poles to equator.
    The results of the summation for the equatorial tide in the
three cases given above are very interesting as showing howv
                       each case than    (the equilibrium height).

equilibrium value, which it soon approximately reaches. To <U+FB01>nd
what is meant by “ soon ” (“ bientot”) take the case of e=l4, or
depth —1— of the radius.      For a rough approximation to                          R3
       72‘25
take R4=0, and use formula                 (9) § 8   with Ic=3.         Thus we have

Then by successive applications of                  (8)   with k=2 and k=1          we
<U+FB01>nd
                          R2='0367 and R,='104.
Hence in this case        we have roughly

   = H(.r9 +      “104.1..1'4   + '00382    . a5   + '000071     .   x”),
which shows that when the depth is about a seventieth of the
radius, the actual amount of equatorial tide exceeds the equili
brium amount by nearly eleven per cent.
    16. From the <U+FB01>rst and second of Laplace’s numerical formulae
for a given above         15), we may infer that when e is increased
from 2'5 continuously to 10, the value of a for any value of a:
must increase continuously           to +00 , then suddenly become
 —-00 , and increase continuously        from that till it has the value
given by the formula, for e=10.           When c has a value exceeding
by   however    small  a  difference  the  value which makes             ,
                                                                   _—l_—oo   a:
the value of a for very small values of .r is positive, and dimi
nishes through 0 to very large negative values as w is in—
 creased to 1; that is to say, there are nodes coinciding with
 two very small circles of latitude, one round each pole, direct
tides within these circles, and very great inverted tides round
the rest of the earth.        As e is increased continuously from this
<U+FB01>rst critical value,    the   nodal circles expand until (as seen above)
when e=10 they cvincide approximately with 18° North and
 South latitude.      From the greatness of the coef<U+FB01>cient of w‘
 in Laplace’s result for this case we may judge that e cannot be
 increased much above 10 without reaching a second critical
 value, for which the cor<U+FB01>icient of .24, after increasing to
  + 00 , suddenly becomes —00 .           It is probable that the nodal
 circles do not get much nearer the equator than 18° North and
  South before this critical value is reached.       When eis increased
  above it,   asecond pair of nodal circles commence at the two
  poles, spreading outwards and getting nearer to the former pair
  of nodal circles, which themselves are getting nearer and nearer
  to the equator.     Then there are direct tides in the equatorial
  belt, inverted tides in the zones between the nodal parallels of

 238'           Sir William Thomson         on an  Alleged Error
 latitude in each hemisphere, and direct tides in the north and
  south polar areas beyond.           This is the state of things for any
  value of e greater than the second critical value just considered
  and less than a third.       When e is increased through this third
  critical value, a third pair of nodal circles grows out from the
  poles; and there are inverted tides at the equator, direct tides
  in the zone between the nodal circles of the <U+FB01>rst and second
 pair, inverted tides in the zones between the second and third
  nodal circles of each hemisphere, and still ,' as in every case, direct
  tides in the areas round the poles; a fourth critical value of 0
  introduces a fourth pair of nodal circles, and so on.
      17. The critical values of e which we have just been consider
  ing are of course those corresponding to depths for which free
  vibrations of the several types described are symperiodic with the
  disturbing force; and the free oscillations without disturbing
  force are in these cases expressed by the formula (3) of § 5,

 period of rotation.
      18. The calculation of the ratios Rf, R9, R3 is an exceedingly
  curious and interesting subject of pure mathematics or arith
  metic.     First, remark the rapid extinction of the error resulting
 from taking 0 or any other than its true value for RH1 in

physical impossibility, so far as the North Atlantic is concerned,
of any general interchange of equatorial and polar water due to
gravrtatlon.
    It is a condition absolutely essential to the gravitation theory
that the surface of the ocean should be highest in equatorial
regions and slope downwards to either pole. Were water abso

     W      and Gravitation    Theories of Oceanic Circulation.         243
to produce a surface-<U+FB02>ow from the equator to the poles; but to
induce such an effect, some slope there must be, or gravitation
could exercise no power in drawing, the surface-water pole
wards.
    The researches of the ‘ Challenger ’ expedition bring to light
 the striking and im ortant fact that the general surface of the
 North Atlantic, to he in equilibrium, must stand at a higher
level than at the equator.       In other words, the surface of the
Atlantic is lowest at the equator, and rises with a gentle slope
to well nigh the latitude of England.         If this be the case, then
it is mechanically impossible that, as far as the North Atlantic
is concerned, there can be any such general movement as Dr.
Carpenter believes.       Gravitation can no more cause the surface
water of the Atlantic to <U+FB02>ow towards the Arctic regions than 'it
 can compel the waters of the Gulf of Mexico up the Mississippi
into the Missouri. The impossibility is equally great in both
cases.
    In  order to prove what has been      stated, let us take a section
of the mid-Atlantic, north and south, across the equator             ; and,
 to give the gravitation theory every advantage, let us select that
particular section adopted by Dr. Carpenter as the one, of all
 others, most favourable to his theory, viz. section marked No.
VIII. in his memoir lately read before the Royal Geographical
Society *.    The section referred to is shown in the accompanying
diagram (p. 244). Its peculiarity, as will be observed, is the thin
ness of the warm strata at the equator as compared with those of
 the heated water in the North Atlantic.         The fact that the polar
 cold water comes so near the surface at the equator is regarded
 by Dr. Carpenter as evidence in favour of the gravitation theory.
 On <U+FB01>rst looking at his section, it forcibly struck me that, if it
 was accurately drawn, the ocean, to be in equilibrium, would re
 quire to stand at a higher level in the North Atlantic than at
 the equator.     In order, therefore, to determine whether this is
 the case or not,   I  asked the Hydrographer of the Admiralty to
 favour me with the temperature-soundings indicated in the sec-v
 tion, a favour which was most obligingly granted.             The follow;
 ing  are the  temperature-soundings      at  the   three   stations  A, B,
 and C.     The temperatures     of C are  the  mean     of six  soundings
 taken along near the equator :—

.     On computing the extent to which the three columns A, B,
and C are each expanded by heat, according'to Muncke’s Table
of the expansion of sea-water for every degree Fahrenheit,                I
found that column B, in order to be in equilibrium with C (the
 equatorial column), would require to have its surface standing
fully 2 feet 6 inches above the level of column C, and column A
fully 3 feet 6 inches above that column.            In short, it is evident
  that there must be a gradual rise from the equator to latitude
  38° N. of 3% feet.       Any one can verify the accuracy of these
 results by making the necessary computations for himself; and
he will <U+FB01>nd that, for columns of equal weight, column Ais longer
 than column C by 3%; feet, and column B longer than column C
by 2% feet.
      I may observe that had column C extended to the same depth
  as columns A and B, the difference of level would be consider
  ably greater; for column C requires to balance only that portion

246         Mr.   J.    Croll   on the ‘Challenger’s’   Crucial Test of   the
of columns  A and B which lies above the equilibrium level of
its base. And of course in computing the extent of the expan
sion of columns A and B,                I
                              have taken into account not the
entirelength of these columns, but only that portion which lies
abQVe that level.    Suppose a depth of ocean equal to that of
column C to extend to the North Pole and the polar water to have
a uniform temperature of 33° from the surface to the bottom,
then, inorder to equilibrium, the surface of the ocean at the
equator would require to be 4 feet 6 inches above that at the
pole.   But the surface of the ocean at B would be 7 feet, and
at A 8 feet above the pole.      Gravitation    never could have
caused the ocean to assume this form.        It is impossible that
this immense mass of warm water, extending to such a depth
in the North Atlantic, can have been brought from equatorial
regions by means of gravitation.    And even if we suppose this
accumulation of warm water can be accounted for by some other
means, still its presence precludes the possibility of any such
surface-<U+FB02>ow as that advocated by Dr. Carpenter.       For so long
as the North Atlantic stands 3% feet above the level of the
equator, gravitation   can never move the equatorial waters
polewards.
     It   will not  do as an objection to assert that according to the
gravitation       theory the ocean never attains to a condition of static
                                                    I
equilibrium. This is perfectly true, as have shown on a former
occasion*; but then it is the equator that is kept below and the
poles above the level of equilibrium ; consequently the disturb
ance of equilibrium between the equatorial and polar columns
would actually tend to make the difference of level between the
equator and the Atlantic greater than 3% feet, and not less, as
the objection would imply.
   There is another feature of this section irreconcilable with the
gravitation theory.   It will be observed that the accumulation
of warm water is all in the North Atlantic, and that there is little
or none in the south. But according to the gravitation theory,
it ought to have been the reverse. For, owing to the unrestricted
 communication between the equatorial and antartic regions, the
 general <U+FB02>ow of water towards the south pole                   is,
                                                          according to
that theory, supposed to be greater than towards the north and             ;
consequently the quantity of warm equatorial water in the South
Atlantic ought also to be greater; Dr. Carpenter himself seems
to be aware of this dif<U+FB01>culty besetting the theory, and meets                   it
by  stating that
                  “ the upper stratum of the North Atlantic not            is
                                            by by
nearly as much cooled down          its limited polar under<U+FB02>ow as
that of the South Atlantic          the vast movement of antarctic

  But this “ vast  movement of antarctic water
                                                 ”
                                                   necessarily implies
   a vast counter movement of warm surface-water;           so that if
  there is more polar water in the South Atlantic to produce the
  cooling effect, there should likewise be more warm water to be
   cooled.
      According to the wind theory of oceanic circulation the expla
   nation of the whole is simple and obvious.     It has already been
   shown that owing to the fact that the south-east trades are
  stronger than the north-east, and blow constantly over upon the
  northern hemisphere, the warm surface-water of the South
  Atlantic is drifted across the equator.      It is then carried by
   the equatorial current into the Gulf of Mexico, and afterwards
   of course forms a part of the Gulf-stream.
      The North Atlantic, on the other hand, not only does not lose
  its surface-heat like the equatorial and South Atlantic, but it re
  ceives from the Gulf-stream, in the form of warm water, an
  amount of heat, as we have seen, equal to one fourth of all the
  heat which it receives from the sun.     The reason why the warm
  surface-strata are so much thicker in the North Atlantic than
  in the equatorial regions is perfectly obvious.       The surface
  water at the equator is swept into the Gulf of Mexico by the
  trade-winds and the equatorial current as rapidly as it is heated
  by the sun, so that it has not time to gather to any great depth.
  But all this warm water is carried by the Gulf-stream into the
  North Atlantic, where it accumulates.       That this great depth
  of warm water in the North Atlantic, represented in the section,
  is derived from the Gulf-stream, and not from a direct <U+FB02>ow from
  the equator due to gravitation, is further evident from the fact
  that temperature-sounding A in latitude 38° N. is made through
  that immense body of warm water, upwards of 300 fathoms
1
  thick, extending from Bermuda to near the Azores, discovered by
  the ‘Challenger’ expedition, and justly regarded by Captain
  Nares as an offshoot of the Gulf-stream.          This, in Captain
   Nares’s report, is No. 8 “ temperature-sounding,”     between Ber
  muda and the Azores; sounding B is No. 6 “ temperature
    urve,” between Teneri<U+FB01>’e and St. Thomas.
     There is an additional reason to the one already stated why
  the surface-temperature of the South Atlantic should be so much
  below that of the North.       It is perfectly true that whatever
  amount of water is transferred from the southern hemisphere to
  the northern must be compensated by an equal amount from
  the northern to the southern hemisphere; nevertheless the warm
  water which is carried off the South Atlantic by the winds is not
  directly compensated by water from the north, but by that cold
  antarctic current whose existence is so well known to mariners
  from the immense masses of ice which it brings from the South
  ern Ocean.

       servations on the Temperature of the North Paci<U+FB01>c made in the
       U.S.S.' ‘Tuscarora’”*. The temperature-soundings made in
       that vessel seem to me to show that the thermal condition of
       the North Paci<U+FB01>c      just as irreconcilable with the gravitation
                                            is
       theory as that of the North Atlantic.        They show that the
       North Paci<U+FB01>c     much colder than the North Atlantic, and that
                                  is
       the immense stratum of warm water found in the latter     wanting                            is
       in the North Paci<U+FB01>c. But as the North Paci<U+FB01>c       almost entirely                 is
       cut off from the cold Arctic basin, its waters, according to the
       gravitation theory, instead of being colder, ought to be much
       warmer than those of the Atlantic.
          But this      not all; these soundings bring to light the
                                  is
       remarkable fact, as will be seen from the subjoined Table, that

            Now     it obvious that down to 500 fathoms (the depth to
                             is
         which these observations extend), for columns of equal weight,
         column V. (in lat. 52°) must be higher than column    (in lat. 43°).                  I.
         It therefore follows, from the principles of hydrostatics, that
         unless the condition of things be totally the reverse below 500
         fathoms, which      not at all likely, the top of column V. must

            Dr. Carpenter himself seems aware of the dif<U+FB01>culties besetting
         the theory.   But     appears to me that the explanation which
                                        it
         he offers   as hostile to the theory as are the facts themselves

    Mud        and Gravitation Theories of Oceanic Circulation.     249
perature of the North Paci<U+FB01>c is that the surface-<U+FB02>ow in that
ocean is reversed, and that, instead of <U+FB02>owing, as everywhere
else, from a lower to a higher latitude, it <U+FB02>ows in the opposite
direction.    His theory is that there is an under<U+FB02>ow from the
Antarctic regions northwards across the equator up to about
latitude 52° N., and a counter surface-<U+FB02>ow from that latitude
southwards across the equator to the Antarctic regions.           And
he gives a diagram illustrating this mode of circulation.         But
it must be perfectly obvious that no such <U+FB02>ow could he produced,
according to the gravitation theory, from difference of tempera
ture.    The difference of temperature, which is the prime mover
according to this theory, results from the difference in the amount
of heat received from the sun at equatorial and polar regions.
The sea is warmer in equatorial than in temperate regions,
because the amount of heat received from the sun is greater in
the former than in the latter regions ; and for the same reason the
 sea in temperate is warmer than in polar regions.     It is therefore
 impossible, according to the gravitation theory, that the ocean at
 latitude 52° can be warmer than at the equator.       But, unless it
 were so, there could be no surface-<U+FB02>ow due to gravitation from lat
 itude 52° to the equator, because the surface of the ocean would
 not be higher in that latitude than at the equator, and without a
 slope gravitation could not act.      I, of course, admit that the
 ocean may actually be warmer in temperate than in polar regions ;
 for of this we have, as already shown, a good example in the
 case of the North Atlantic; but then no such condition of things
 could arise from a circulation resulting from difference of tem
 perature. A surface-<U+FB02>ow from temperate regions across the equator,
 sustained by di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature, is simply a mechanical im
possibility.
   The truth       is,
                  that the adoption of such     mode of circulation
                                                 a
makes the gravitation theory self-contradictory; for, according
to that theory,       the lowness of the temperature of the ocean in
                     it   is
high latitudes, in comparison with that in low, which     the reason
                                                              is
why the surface-<U+FB02>ow       toward the poles; but in the case of the
                               is
North Paci<U+FB01>c this low temperature in high latitudes          adduced
                                                               is
as a reason why the <U+FB02>ow       in the reverse direction, viz. towards
                                    is
the equator.
   According to the wind theory the explanation of the pheno
mena    isplain and obvious.    The North Paci<U+FB01>c        colder than
                                                         is

Ocean, as ascertained by the ‘Challenger’ expedition, appears
to me to be also irreconcilable with the gravitation theory.       Be
tween the parallels of latitude 65° 42' S. and 50° 1' S., the
ocean, with the exception of a thin stratum at the surface heated
by the sun’s rays, was found, down to the depth of about 200
fathoms, to be several degrees colder than the water underneath *.
The cold upper stratum is evidently an antarctic current, and the
warm underlying water an equatorial under-current.            But, ac
 cording to the gravitation theory, the colder water should be
 underneath.
   The very fact of a mass of water 200 fathoms deep, and ex
tending over 15 degrees of latitude, remaining above water of
three or four degrees higher temperature shows how little in<U+FB02>u
ence difference of temperature has in producing motion.           If it
had the potency which some attribute to           one would supposeit,
that this cold stratum would sink down and displace the warm
water underneath.      If difference of density suf<U+FB01>cient to move        is
the water horizontally, surely      must be more than suf<U+FB01>cient to
                                                    it

                       is
consequently, any cause which will greatly affect the system of

This necessary connexion between the system of the winds and

days, which is very nearly the mean time of rotation of the sun
spots; column II. gives 24'52 days—the assumed actual value
being Sptirer’s estimate for the solar equator, 24-57 days.

     '

         MASS of water contained in a glass vessel is put in communi
          cation with the earth by means of a. platinum wire. Ifa. stick
  of resin be rubbed and then brought near the water, positive electri—
  city is drawn from the earth and distributed at the surface of the
  water.      The platinum wire, which serves as electrode of entry, has
  a <U+FB02>ow of positive electricity; at it bubbles of oxygen gas are liber‘
  ated, in quantity proportional to the quantity of electricity entering:
  at least this takes place if an electrode of very small surface is
  employed, a Wollaston point. The fact of the liberation of oxygen
  under these circumstances is well known ; it has been veri<U+FB01>ed,
  notably by M. Buif and by M. Soret.
      After oxygen has been liberated, the hydrogen which was com
  bined with it remains in excess in the mass of water or else at its
  surface. This excess, proportional to the charge, remains in some
  way dissembled as long as the water is electrized ; but at the
  instant of the discharge the hydrogen is disengaged.
      The removal of the stick of resin suf<U+FB01>ces.        The charge, which
'
  was retained by in<U+FB02>uence, passes away into the earth through the
  platinum point.       This point serving as electrode of exit has a <U+FB02>ow
  of positive electricity ; it liberates bubbles of hydrogen gas. The
  dissembled hydrogen is therefore found again during the discharge;
  the whole of it is recovered.
      In fact, according to Faraday’ s law, the same quantity of electri   ‘
  city which liberates 1 equivalent of oxygen when it enters, sets
  free precisely 1 equivalent of hydrogen nt~its departure.
       Since the Whole of the dissembled hydrogen is to be recovered,
  no part of it can be taken away by di<U+FB01>usion, or oxidation, or any
  physical or chemical action that leaves the electric charge intact.
  In other terms, the concealed hydrogen is neither combined nor
  dissolved; and yet it is really there, since we can cause its liberation
  by removing the stick of resin.
      Moreover the words dissolved or combined might be applied to
  hydrogen retained in the interior of a mass ; but here, it seems, we
  have a <U+FB01>rst instance of another order of material union.        The dis
  sembled hydrogen is all held at the surface of the water—I mean,
  in that portion of the body in which the electric charge is dis
  tributed.
      In fact, any portion whatever of the interior mass of water may
  be replaced by air; and as long as the surface is unchanged, the
  charge of electricity and consequently the quantity of dissembled
  hydrogen are unchanged also.          Thus the mass can be hollowed out
  without changing the quantity of the hydrogen; this is therefore
  found again at the surface.
      In the same way a mass of water electrized unequally, contains
  at its surface an excess of hydrogen proportionate to the electric
  charge.~—O'omptes     Rendus de Z’Acad. des Sciences, August 9, 1875,

 ON THE INFLUENCE          OF THE TEXTURE          01“ IRON UPON ITS MAG

   The following is a statement of two series of experiments which

11 millims. in thickness, and each weighing 34-2 grammesl
   Bar I. had a granular, while bar II. had a decidedly <U+FB01>brous struc
ture—recognized in both bars from the fracture-surfaces.     For the
observations the bars were placed in an induction-coil of 1600
turns; and the moments were read o<U+FB01> in the well-known manner
on a Wiedemann mirror-compass distant 500 centims., by means
of a telescope with scale at 4 metres distance.
   In the following Tables the <U+FB01>rst columns contain the relative
intensities of the current through the coil, and the second contain
the de<U+FB02>ections (in scale-divisions) corresponding to the respective
moments.

   From this we get the remarkable result that, for equal intensities
of the current, the two bars gave almost exactly the same induced
magnetic moments, and consequently that the very different struc
ture of the two pieces of iron employed had no in<U+FB02>uence whatever
upon the amount of the induced magnetic moment.—P0ggendor<U+FB01>’s

         ON MAGNETS FORMED FROM COMPRESSED                           POWDERS.
                                     BY   J. JAMIN.
   In 1836, in the Mémoires de Z’Académie of Stanislas, De Haldat
published an interesting observation he had put iron <U+FB01>lings into
                                               :
a  brass tube closed     by
                       two screw stoppers; he magnetized        by the          it
usual process, and ascertained that     had acquired, and retained, at
                                              it
its extremities two opposite poles. The polarity was not sensibly
augmented when the stoppers were tightened, and diminished but
slowly when increasing quantities of river-sand were mixed with
the <U+FB01>lings. In all cases the polarity remained very feeble and va           ;         it
nished when the metallic grains were displaced by agitating the tube.

    This observation is accurate but imperfect.     I   have repeated it
 by forcibly compressing with a small hydraulic press the iron <U+FB01>lings
 in the tube. When they begin to aggregate, the polarity is seen
 to augment considerably, and continues to increase with the pres—
  sure. I  exhibit to the Academy tubes of from 8 to 10 centims.
 length and 3 centims. diameter, which attract at least as much
 steel <U+FB01>lings as would be attracted by pieces of good steel of the
 same dimensions.
    As the <U+FB01>lings  I   employed were of unknown origin,     I   had some
 prepared in my presence from very soft iron, perfectly reduced and
 Without appreciable coercive force. The results were quite equal
 to the former.     Here, then, is a metal which has no coercive force
 when it is continuous, but acquires a coercive force equal to that
'of steel when we reduce it to minute fragments and then make
 them contiguous by pressure. Must not the polarity observed be
 attributed to this discontinuity? and is not the coercive force of
 steel to be explained by the same cause ?
    The distribution of the force in a magnet cannot be accounted
 for without regarding it as composed of rows of minute magnetic
 elements with opposite poles reacting on each other at a. distance;
 and it is veri<U+FB01>ed that the quantities of separate magnetism in each
 of them are increased by this reaction, from the extremity to the
 middle line (Lame, Physique, vol. iii. p. 100). Up to the present
 it seems to be assumed that these elements are the molecules them
 selves; the preceding experiment seems to show they are formed
 either by fragments of iron in proximity to one another, or by
 minute crystals agglomerated as in steel.
    When, before pressing the <U+FB01>lings, we interpolate among them
 substances which render the mass more homogeneous,             the same
 polarity cannot be given as when they are unmixed.          For example,
 by making a paste of chloride of iron and the <U+FB01>lings and pressing
it,  we obtain, aft-er a.few days,a   subchloride continuous in appear
 ance, capable of being <U+FB01>led and polished like pure iron, but hardly
 magnetizable.
    lron reduced by hydrogen, and scales of oxide of iron, behave
 like iron <U+FB01>lings; but magnetic or diamagnetic substances mixed
 with the <U+FB01>lings alter notably the faculty they possess of being mag
 netized. The study of all these circumstances promises interesting
 researches.    Hitherto have had at my disposal only insuf<U+FB01>cient
                        I
 apparatus   and
               a   small laboratory press. It probable that by greatly
                                              is
 increasing   the compression of the powders the coercive force will
 be found to increase to a maximum, and afterwards diminish when
 the approximation of the fragments has restored suf<U+FB01>cient degree
                                                     a

 nicate to the Academy the result of these new researches—Campus

258          Mr. H. A. Rowland       on Magnetic    Distribution.
lopment of Faraday’s idea of the analogy between a magnet and
a voltaic battery immersed in water.           I  shall throughout speak
of the conduction of, and resistance to, lines of magnetic force,
and shall otherwise treat them as similar to lines of conducted
 electricity or heat, it now being well established from the re—
 searches of Professor Maxwell and others that this method gives
 exactly the same results as the other method of considering the
 action to take place at a distance.
                                  I
     In arranging this paper have thought best to give the theory
 of the distribution <U+FB01>rst, and then afterwards to see how the
 results agree with experiment; in this way we can <U+FB01>nd out the
 defects of the theory, and what changes should be made in it to
 adapt it to experiment.
                   I
     At present am acquainted with two formulae giving the dis
  tribution of magnetism on bar magnets: the <U+FB01>rst was given by
  Biot, in his Traite' de Physique Ezpe'rimentale et Mathématique,
  vol. iii. p. 77, and was obtained by him from the analogy of the
  magnet to a dry electric pile, or to a crystal of tourmaline elec
  tri<U+FB01>ed by heat.       He compared his formula with Coulomb’s ob
  servatiOns, and showed it to represent the distribution with con
  siderable accuracy.       Green, in his ‘Essay,’ has obtained a for
  mula which gives the same distribution; but he obtains it by a
  series of mathematical approximations which it is almost impos
  sible to interpret physically.             J
                                        M. amin has recently used a
                                        I
  formula of the same form ; but have as yet been unable to <U+FB01>nd
  how he obtained it.       My own formulae are also quite similar to
  these, but have the advantage of being obtained in a more simple
  manner than Green’s; and, what is of more consequence, all the
  limitations are made at once, after which the solution is exact ;
  so that although they are only approximate, yet we know just
  where they should differ from experiment.
                                        II.
      If we take an    iron bar and magnetize one end of it either by
  a magnet or helix, we cause lines       of magnetic induction* to enter
  that end of the bar, and, after passing down it to a certain dis
  tance, to pass out into the air and so round to the bar again to
  complete their circuit.       At every part of their circuit they en
  counter some resistance, and always tend to pass in that direc
  tion where it is the least: throughout their whole course they
  obey a law similar to Ohm’s law; and the number of lines pass
  ing in any direction between two points is equal to the difference
     1“ For difference between lines of
                                        magnetic force and lines of magnetic
  induction see Maxwell’s ‘ Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,’ arts. 400,
  592, and 604.

of magnetic potential of those points divided by the resistance
to the lines.
    The complete solution of the problem before us being impos
sible, let us limit it by two hypotheses. First, let us assume that
the permeability of the bar is a constant quantity; and secondly,
that the resistance to the lines of induction is composed of two
parts, the <U+FB01>rst being that of the bar, and the second that of esca
ping from the bar into the medium—and that the latter is the
same at every part of the bar.        The <U+FB01>rst of these assumptions is
the one usually made in the mathematical theory of magnetic
induction ; but, as has been shown by the experiments of Miiller,
and more recently by those of Dr. Stoletow and myself, this is
not true 3 and we shall see this when we _come to compare the
formula with experiment.        The second assumption is more exact
than the <U+FB01>rst for all portions of the bar except the ends.
    Let us <U+FB01>rst take the case of a rod of iron with a short helix
placed on any portion of        it,

264             Mr. H. A. Rowland         on Magnetic          Distribution.
                                          III.
   Among the various methods of measuring linear magnetic dis
tribution, we <U+FB01>nd few up to the present time that are atisfactory.
Coulomb used the method of counting the number of vibrations
made by a magnetic needle when near various points of the
magnet.     Thus, in the curve of distribution most often repro
duced from his work, he used a magnetized steel bar 27 French
inches long and 2 lines in diameter placed vertically ; opposite
to   it,
       and at   distance of
                  a            lines, he hung
                                     8           magnetic needlea                           3
lines in diameter and    lines long, tempered very hard; and the
                            6
number of oscillations made              by
                                      was determined.
                                              it         The square
of this number     proportional to.
                       is           the magnetic <U+FB01>eld at  that point,
 supposing the magnetism of the needle to be unchanged; and
this, corrected for the magnetism of the earth, gives the mag
netic <U+FB01>eld due to the magnet alone.        This for points near the
magnet and distant from the ends        nearly proportional to the
                                                   is
  so-called magnetic surface-density opposite the point.             At the
 end Coulomb doubled the quantity thus found, seeing that the
 bar extended only on one side of the needle.
     It will be seen that this method             only approximate, and
                                                        is
  almost incapable of giving results in absolute measure.               The
 effect on the needle depends not only on that part. of the bar
 opposite the needle, but on portions to either side, and gives, as
it  were, the average value for some distance          in the next place,
                                                               by ;
 the correction at the end,          by
                                    multiplying           seems to be in
                                                               2,
 adequate,    and   gives  too   small     result
                                              a    compared with other
 parts.    For at points distant from the end the average surface
 density at any point will be nearly equal to the average for                               a
  short distance on both sides, while at the end           will be greater
                                                                    it
 than the average of        short distance measured back from the
                            a
 end.     To these errors must be added those due to the mutual
 induction of the two magnets.
    The next method we come to             that which has been recently
                                              is
 used      M. Jamin, and consists in measuring the attraction of
           by
a   piece of soft iron applied at different points of the magnet.
 In this case does not seem to have been considered that the
                  it
 attraction depends not only on the magnetic density at the
given point, but also on that around                     it,
                                                    and that       piece of
                                                                          a
 soft iron applied to      magnet changes
                            a                   the  distribution    imme
diately   at all points,  but   especially   at that  where    the  iron                    is
applied.     The change         of course less when the magnet
                                is                                        of           is
very hard steel and the piece of soft iron small.           Where, how
ever, We wish to get the distribution on soft iron,              becomes it                 a
quite serious dif<U+FB01>culty.       Another source of error arises from the
fact that the coef<U+FB01>cient of magnetization of soft iron                func    is   a

           Mr. H. A. Rowland     on Magnetic Distribution.       265
tion of the magnetization: this source of error is greatest when
the contact-piece is long and thin, and is a minimum when it is
short and thick and not in contact with the magnet.            Hence
this method will giVe the best results when the contact-piece is
small and in the shape of a sphere and not in contact with the
magnet, and when the method is applied to steel magnets.         But
after taking all these precautions, the question next arises as to
how to obtain the magnetic surface-density from the experiments.
Theory indicates, and M. Jamin has assumed, that the attrac
tive force is nearly proportional to the square of the surface
 density.    But experiment does not seem to con<U+FB01>rm this, except
where there is some distance between the two bodies, at least in
 the case of a sphere and a plane surface, as in Tyndall’s expe
 riments (Phil. Mag. April 1851).         It is not necessary at pre
 sent to consider the cause of this apparent discrepancy between
 theory and experiment ; suf<U+FB01>ce it to say that the explanation of
 the phenomenon is without doubt to be sought for in the vari
 able character of the magnetizing-function      of iron.      I
                                                           All wish
 to show is that the attraction of iron to a magnet, _especially
 when the two are in contact, is a very complicated phenomenon,
 whose laws in general are unknown, and hence is entirely un
  suitable for experiments on magnetic distribution.
     A third method is that used in determining the correction for
 the distribution on the magnets in <U+FB01>nding the intensity of the
 earth’s magnetism.       Usually the distribution is not explicitly
 found in this case; but it is easy to see how it might be. Thus,
 one way would be as follows :—Take the origin of coordinates
 at. the centre of the magnet.      Develop the distribution in an
 ascending series of powers of .z' with unknown constant coef<U+FB01>
 cients.    Calculate the magnetic force due to this distribution
 for any points along the axis, or else on a line perpendicular to
 the magnet at its centre.      Determine the force at a series of
 points   extending  through as  great a range and as near the mag
 net as possible.    These experiments give a series of equations
 from which the coef<U+FB01>cients in the expansion can be determined.
 Other and better methods of expansion might be found, except
 for short magnets, where the method suggested is very good.
     The similarity of this method to that used by Gauss in deter
 mining the distribution on the earth is apparent.
     A fourth method is similar to the above, except that the
 lines of force around the magnet are measured and calculated
 instead of the force.
     The last two methods are very exact, but are also very labo
 rious, and therefore only adapted to special investigations.
  Thus, by the change in direction of the lines of force around the
 magnet, we have a delicate means of showing the change in dis

  266         Mr. H. A. Rowland        on Magnetic Distribution.
  tribution,  as, for instance, when the current around an electro
   magnet varies.
     The <U+FB01>fth method is that used lately in some experiments
  of Mr. Sears (American Journal of Science, July 1874), but
  only adaptedrto temporary magnetization.              At a given point
  on the bar a small coil of wire is placed, and the current
  induced in it measured by the swing of the galvanome
  ter-needle when the bar is demagnetized.             It does not seem
  to have been noticed that what we ordinarily consider the
  magnetic distribution is not directly measured in this way; and
  indeed, to get correct results, the magnetization should have
  been reversed, seeing that a large portion of the magnetization
  will not disappear, on taking away the magnetizing-force, where
  the bar is long.       The quantity which is directly measured is
  the surface-integral of the temporary magnetic induction across
  the section of the bar, while the magnetic surface-density is pro
  portional to the surface-integral of magnetic induction along a
 given portion of the bar.        In other words, the quantity measured
 is Q instead of             We can, lhowever,     derive one    from  the
  other very easily.
     The sixth and last method is that which I used <U+FB01>rst in 1870,
  and by which most of my experiments have been performed.
 This consists in sliding a small coil of wire, which just <U+FB01>ts the
  bar and is also very narrow, along the bar inch by inch, and
 noting the induced current over each inch by the de<U+FB02>ection of
 a galvanometer-needle.           This measures Q“ except for some
 corrections which     I  now wish to note.    In the <U+FB01>rst case, to give
 exact results, the lines of force should pass out perpendicular to
 the bar, or the coil must be very small.           But even when the
 last condition is ful<U+FB01>lled errors will be introduced at certain por
 tions of the bar.      The error is vanishingly small in most cases,
 except  near  the  ends   ; and even there it is not large, except in
 special  cases;  for   at  this part the lines of force pass forward
toward    the end   of  the   bar, and so the observation next to the
 end may be too small, while that at the end is too large.            The
correction can be made by <U+FB01>nding where the lines of force
 through the centre of the section of the coil in its two posi
tions meet the bar.          The error from this source is not large,
and may be avoided to a great extent.
    One very great advantage in the method of induced currents
is the facility with which the results can be reduced to absolute
measure by including an earth-inductor in the circuit as I have
before described (Phil. Mag. August 1873).              There is also no
reaction (except a temporary one) between the magnet and cur
rent; so that the distribution remains unchanged.               Hence it

           Mr. H. A. Rowland       on Magnetic  Disiributien.      267
seems to me that       this method is the only one capable of giving
exact results directly.
    The coils of wire which       I   used consisted of from twenty
to one hundred turns of        <U+FB01>ne  wire  wound on thin paper tubes
which just <U+FB01>tted the bar and extended considerably beyond
the coils.      The coils were mostly from '1 to '25 of an inch
wide and from '1 to '2 inch thick.          A measure being laid by
the side of the given bar under experiment, the coil was
moved from one division of the rule to the next very quickly,
and the de<U+FB02>ection produced on an ordinary astatic galvanometer
noted. After experience this could be done with great accuracy.
It might be better in some cases to have the coil slide over a
limited distance on the tube, though for the use to which            I
intend to put the results the other is best.
    Up to 35° Qe is nearly proportional to the de<U+FB02>ection; and
when any larger value is put down in the Tables, it is the sum
of two or more de<U+FB02>ections.         I  have not the data in most cases
to reduce my results to absolute measure, but took pains to
 ensure that certain series of experiments should be comparable
among themselves.
    Having measured QE at all points ofa rod, we may <U+FB01>nd Q by
adding up' the values of Qs from the end of the rod.
    The magnetizing force to which the bar was subjected was in
 all cases a helix placed at some part of the bar. The iron bars
were of course demagnetized thoroughly before use by placing
them in the proper position with reference to the magnetic me
ridian and striking them.
    In the Tables L is the distance in inches from the zero-point,
 Q, is the de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer when the helix is passed
between the points indicated in the <U+FB01>rst column.              Thus, in
 Table 11., 347 is the de<U+FB02>ection on the galvanometer when the
helix was moved from the tenth to the eleventh inch from
 the zero-point; and so we may consider it as the value of QE at
 10% inches; so that the values of Q, refer to the half inches,
 but Q to the even inches.
    In all the calculations the constants in the formulae were taken
 to represent Q. most nearly, and then the corresponding formulae
 for Q. taken with the same constants.
    For ease in calculating by ordinary logarithmic Tables, we

toward the long end.           Table   III.        is from a bar 2 feet long with
a helix 4%; inches long near one end, so that its centre was 19%
inches from the end on which the experiments were made, the
zero—point being at the end.
   In adapting the formula to apply to the case of Table I.,
we may assume that at the end of the bar s=oo and C=O,
which is equivalent to assuming that the number of lines of
induction which pass out at the end of the rod are too small
to be appreciated.

    In these Tables we see quitea good agreement between theory

certain law in the distribution of errors.    Thus in Table I. the
errors of   Q,’

not great.   Hence between 0 and 8 inches the resistance of the
bar, R, is greater than at succeeding points, and hence a less
number of lines of induction pass down the bar from 8 towards
0 than would be given by the formula, which has been adapted
to the average value of R at from 9 to 141 inches.           In
Table II. this same fact shows itself towards the end of the
Table, and would probably be more prominent had the Table
been carried further.    However, in this Table all things have
combined to satisfy the formula with great accuracy.

and the vertical ordinates are values of Q',.              The full line
gives the observed distribution, and the dotted line that accord
ing to the formula.
     The formula gives the distribution very nearly for all points
except those near the end.        The formula indicates that Q's'de
creases continually toward the end; but by experiment we see
that it increases near this point.      On <U+FB01>rst seeing this, I thought
that it was due to some residual magnetism in the bar; but after
repeating the experiment several times with proper care, I soon
 found that this was always the case.          I give the following ex
 planation of it :—In the formulae we have assumed R', the re
 sistance of the medium, to be a constant,- now this resistance
 includes that of the lines of force as they pass from the rod
 through the medium and thus back to the other end of the rod,
 and of this whole quantity the part which affects the relative
 distribution at any part of the rod most is that of the medium
 immediately surrounding that part; and so the parts near the
 end have the advantage over those further back, inasmuch as the
 lines can pass forward as well as outward into the medium.
 The same thing takes place in the case of the distribution of
                          “           ” is
 electricity, where the      density       inversely proportional to the
 resistance which the lines of inductive force experience from the
  medium; and here we <U+FB01>nd that the “ density ” is greatest on
  the projections of the body, showing that the resistance to the
  lines of induction is less in such situations, and by analogy
  showing that this must also be the case for lines of magnetic
  force.   But this effect is not very great in cylinders until quite
  near the end; for Coulomb, in a long electri<U+FB01>ed cylinder, has
  found the density at one diameter back from the end only 1'25
  times that at the centre ; and so there is probably a long distance
  in the centre where the density is sensibly constant.          Hence we
  may suppose    that our   second   hypothesis,   that R'  is a constant,
  will be approximately correct for all parts of a bar except the
  ends, though of course this will vary to some extent with the
  distribution of the lines in the medium; at least the change
  in B.’ will be gradual except near the end, and so may be par
  tially allowed for by giving a mean value to r.
      Hence we see that could the formula be so changed as to in
  clude both the variation of R and of R', it would probably agree
  with the three Tables given.
      To study the effect of variation in the permeability more care
   fully, we can proceed in another manner, and use the formulae
   only to get the value of r at different parts of the rods.
      No matter how 1' may vary, equations (2) and (3) will apply
   to a very small distance I along the rod; and as the origin of
   coordinates may be at any point on the rod, if Q' and Q]E are

    Before applying these formulae to any series of observations,
the latter should be freed from most of the irregularities due to
accidental causes.     For this purpose the following Tables have
been plotted and      aregular curve drawn to represent as nearly
as possible the observations;    in other cases    column of differ
                                                      a
ences was formed and plotted.        In either case the ordinates of
the curves were accepted as the true quantities.        But, for fear
that some might accuse me of tampering with my observations,
I  have in all cases added these as they were obtained.
    The correction    is necessary, because small irregularities in
the observations will produce immense changes in 13.
    Table IV. contains some of the best observations            have               I
obtained.    It  is from   a bar 57 inches long with        helix 1%       a
inch long in the centre to magnetize it.          Each quantity                             is
the mean of six observations, these being made on both ends
of the bar and with the current in opposite directions.
   In this Table      asource of error was guarded against which
I  have not seen mentioned elsewhere.          When      bar of iron
                                                                 a

further.    Hence in this Table time was allowed for the bar to
reach  its permanent state.

   This method of <U+FB01>nding the variation of      analogous to that                                         [.L   is
of <U+FB01>nding conductivity for heat      raising the temperature of              by
one end of bar and noting the distribution of heat over the
                           a
bar; indeed the curves of distribution are nearly the same in
the two cases.
   If   were thought worth while,
        it                             would be very easy to ob              it
tain  acurve of magnetic distribution for   rod and then enclose                                 a
the whole rod in helix and determine its curve of permeability.
                                       a
This would give data for determining R' in absolute measure at
every point of the rod.
   To complete the argument that the variation of        in great                                                                     r2   is

of <U+FB01>ne wire was wound for distance of foot; and the currenta                                     1
for magnetizing the bar was sent through this. The zero-point
was at the centre of this helix and at the centre of the bar so                                                                                                3
that the observations on the <U+FB01>rst     inches include the part of             6
the bar covered bythe helix.
   The values of Q', are the sum of four observations on each end
of the bar and with the current reversed. The three Tables are
comparable with each other, the same arbitrary unit being used
for all.

us data for determining the magnetizingfunction             iron in a               of

 which   I  publish, but from very many others ; so that my Tables

 XXX.      On a controverted Point in Laplace’s Theory of the Tides.
             By Sir GEORGE B. Amy, Astronomer Royal.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
        a paper published     in the last Number of the Philosophical
 IN Magazine,       Sir William Thomson has, with great personal
courtesy towards myself, objected to my imputation (in the
         “ Tides and Waves ” of the
article                                   Encyclopedia Metropolitana)
to Laplace, of a serious error in a portion of his investigation of
the theory of the Tides.         I had at <U+FB01>rst proposed to myself to
enter into a discussion of Sir William Thomson’s methods; but
I   soon found my thoughts taking the same course as in the
                         I
original article ; and <U+FB01>nally judged it best to do little more than
to refer to that article, with perhaps a slight expansion of the
verbal remarks.
    The part of the Me’canique Ce'leste in which the investigation
in question occurs is Livre IV., Chapitre Premier, Article 10,- and
the part of my own Essay, in which          I have endeavoured to put
Laplace’sinvestigation into a clearer form, is SectionIII. Art. 110.
And the following is the course of the process. Supposing the
depth of the sea to be uniform, and making (for the present) no
assumption regarding its boundaries, there is to be satis<U+FB01>ed a
certain di<U+FB01>'erential equation of which every term can be expressed
as a multiple of an even power of sin 6.         The quantity to be de
termined is called ya.         To obtain its value by the method of
                                                                     -
indeterminate coef<U+FB01>cients, the form is assumed,
gag K2 sin’ 6 + K, 816‘ e + &c. T Kass-*0 + KgkHsin’kHB            +_  &c.,
or,  if ya: G sin’ 0+   60'”,
    a’” = (Kg— G) sin”  9  + K, sin4  6 + &c. + K2,. sin<U+FB01>kd

                                              + K2k+2 Sin2k+26 + &C
Substituting this in the di<U+FB01>'erential equation above mentioned,
and comparing the coef<U+FB01>cients of the different powers of sin 0,
the following subordinate equations are obtained :—

                         (—16K6+          101(4)

                         (~40K,+28K6)bim                  -4K,=o                  ;

Now an equation like this, which gives the third term in terms
of the <U+FB01>rst and second, the fourth term in terms of the second
and third, and so on, must have the <U+FB01>rst and second terms as
foundations or origins wherefrom to start for the formation of
the entire series.  There is no more ground for inferring the
second term from the general subordinate equation than for in
ferring the <U+FB01>rst term from it. The <U+FB01>rst and second terms must
stand on their own foundation.    The value of K, is perfectly
clear, namely KQ=G (not deduced from the general subordinate
equation).    But how with regard to K4?        The subordinate
equation 12(K4—K4)=O gives no information whatever; and                                               I
infer from this that we may give to K, any value that we think
<U+FB01>t (as regards the equation,iunlin1ited by boundaries &c., with
which we started), or any value that may be required by physical
circumstances not yet introduced (as the boundary of the sea).
But does any arbitrary value of K4 really satisfy the original
differential equation?  It does. Then say that K4 is truly an   I
undetermined quantity, which may perhaps be determined here
after by reference to physical conditions not yet stated, but.
which cannot under anycircumstances be inferredfrom the general
subordinate equation.                                        I
                         And, so far as know, the whole course
 of applied algebra does not offer a more certain conclusion.                                         I
scarcely need to add that                   I
                                look upon Laplace’s process as a
mere sport with symbols, and upon Laplace’s conclusion as a

HAVING
    certain       decompositions, we were induced to determine
 whether covering its surface with more-negative metals would
 so augment its chemical activity as to enable       to decompose          it

two hours, when they were heated to 100° C.         Hydrogen gas

      XXXIII.       Notes on the Action of the Copper-Zinc Couple.
           By Professor GLADSTONE and ALFRED Tarne*.
    Relative Activity of pure Zinc and Zinc covered with spongy
                                        Copper.
A
.
        SOLUTION of sulphuric               acid containing 3% parts of acid
         to 1000 of water is just acted upon by pure zinc.
    In an experiment with 2'5 grms. pure zinc (granulated) im
mersed in this strength of acid, 7 volumes of hydrogen were given
off in one hour.                          .
    In another experiment, in which the same piece of zinc upon
which “003 grm. of copper had been deposited was used, 80 vo
lumes of hydrogen Were given off in the same time.
    Thusit appears that the activity of zinc in very dilute sul
phuric acid is increased elevenfold by 0'12 per cent. of the ne
gative metal.                          ~
                            Arseniuretterl Hydrogen.
    If zinc  containing arsenic act upon dilute sulphuric acid, the
hydrogen, as is well known, contains AsHa, the formation of
which is explicable (from analogy with what is known of the
action of hydrogen upon oxynitrogen compounds) on the supposi
tion that thc arsenic becomes dissolved, and that by the subse
quent action of hydrogen upon the arsenical compound in solu'
tion the arseniuretted hydrogen is produced.
    Some four years ago we pointed out that the copper-zinc couple

286              Mr. J. Croll       on the        Wind Theory
in presence of water effects the decomposition of that <U+FB02>uid—zinc
hydrate  and  hydrogen being produced.
   According to Bonsdur<U+FB02>', arsenic does not dissolve in water
free from dissolved oxygen—a fact which we have veri<U+FB01>ed, and
also that dilute sulphuric acid does dissolve it.
   If the foregoing view the formation of AsH8 be correct, the
                              _of
hydrogen obtained by the action of the' couple upon water should
be free from; arsenical gas, even though the couple be made with
arsenical zinc.
   We give the results of four experiments.       quantity of arse

nical zinc-foil was “coupled” with copper, washed, and heated
with water; and two litres of gas evolved were passed through                  a
tube heated to redness.     Not   trace of arsenic was noticeable.
                                        a
  A   portion of the same foil not “coupled” wa treated with
dilute sulphuric acid, and two litres of hydrogen evolved       the       by
action were passed through        tube heated as before.
                                        a                   0‘0019
grm. of arsenic was deposited in the cool part of the tube.
   The arsenical zinc with      covering of spongy copper, when
                                    a
treated with dilute sulphuric acid, gave arseniuretted hydrogen,

per, but the inability of the arsenic to get into solution, that
accounts for the absence of hydrogen in the gas from water and
the couple—a conclusion that was con<U+FB01>rmed          adding   by
                                                             dilute   a
solution of arsenic     part As2 O3
                         (1          in  12,000 of water) to some
couple, when immediately the arsenical mirror was produced in
the heated tube.

     The fundamental arguments of the advocates of the gravitation
theorg.—1. The gravitation theorists base their argument on two
 principal assumptions which cannot be conceded. First, the
  maintain that the existence of polar water in the depths of the
  ocean is consistent with their theory only; and, secondly, the
  assume as a necessary condition of the wind theory that the
  understratum of the ocean should consist of warm water.        It is
  a well recognized fact that the ocean beyond the reach of sun
 heat is occupied with water of a polar temperature; and they
  therefore point triumphantly to this fact as at once a proof of
 their position and a conclusive argument against the wind
 theory.     But, on the other side, it will not be di<U+FB02>icult to show
 that the existence of cold water throughout the ocean depths is

  288                Mr. J. Croll   on the Wind Theory
  as much a necessary result of the wind theory as of the gravi
  tation theory, and that there is no relation whatever between
  the wind theory and warm water in the depths of the sea.
     It is supposed that the return under-currents from the polar
  regions are by far too insigni<U+FB01>cant to be able to maintain at a
  polar temperature the great depths of the ocean.
     Let us examine this objection.           It is freely admitted, nay
 even strenuously maintained by the advocates of the gravitation
 theory themselves, that the heating-power of the sun does not
  extend to any great depth below the surface of the ocean; con
  sequently there is nothing whatever to beat this mass of water
 underneath except the heat coming through the earth’s crust ;
 but the amount of heat derived from this source is so tri<U+FB02>ing
 that an under-current from the Arctic regions of no great mag
 nitude would be suf<U+FB01>cient to keep the mass at an ice—cold tem
 perature.
     On a former occasion*        I  showed that, taking the rate at
 which internal heat passes through the earth’s surface to be
 that assigned by Sir William Thomson, the total amount re
 ceived per annum by the North Atlantic, between the equator
 and tropic of Cancer, including the Caribbean Sea, is equal to
 only mg; of that conveyed by the Gulf-stream, on the supposi
 tion that each pound of water carries 19,300 foot-pounds of
 heat,-——and    that consequently an under-current from the polar
regions    of  not   more than 3‘; the volume of the Gulf-stream
 would suf<U+FB01>ce to keep the entire mass of water of that area
 within 1° of what it would he were no heat derived from the
 crust of the earth, and an under-current of less than ,—‘,- that
 of the Gulf-stream coming from the polar regions would keep
the entire North Atlantic from the equator to the arctic circle
<U+FB01>lled with ice-cold water.      A polar under-current half the size of
the Gulf-stream would be suf<U+FB01>cient to keep the entire water of
the globe (below the stratum heated by the sun’s rays) at an
ice-cold temperature.        Internal heat would not be suf<U+FB01>cient
under such circumstances to maintain the mass 1° Fahr. above
the temperature it possessed when it left the polar regions.
    In short, whatever theory we adopt regarding oceanic circu
lation, it follows equally as a necessary consequence that the
entire mass of the ocean below the stratum heated by the sun’s
rays must consist of cold water.           For if cold water be con
tinually coming from the polar regions, either in the form of
under-currents, or in the form of a general under<U+FB02>ow as Dr.
Carpenter supposes, the entire under portion of the ocean must
ultimately become occupied by cold water; for there is no

  . It is therefore evident that the great mass of cold water occu
pying the depths of the ocean cannot be urged as an objection
to the wind theory.
    2. But it is asserted that the impulse of the wind on the
surface of the ocean cannot produce and maintain deep under
currents.     This is an objection which has been urged by some
eminent physicists; but it is based upon a misapprehension of the
manner in which, according to the wind theory, under-currents
are produced.
    It is true, as the objectors maintain, that a wind simply im
pelling the water forward will not necessarily produce an under
current, since compensation will more readily take place by
return surface-currents, as in this case the path of least resis
tance will generally be at the surface.       But when the general
surface of one half of an ocean basin is being constantly impelled
forward by prevailing winds in a contrary direction to that in
which it is being impelled in the other half, compensation can
not possibly take place by means of return surface-currents.       For
a full discussion of this point    I  must refer the reader to my
work, ‘ Climate and Time,’ Chap. XIII.
    It however, needless to advance arguments priori against
      is,                                             or
the possibility of such under-currents; for we have actually
several well-known examples of such currents, the particulars of
which will also be found in the work to which    I    refer.
    3. But supposing   it   could be shown that the winds cannot
directly produce under-currents,        can nevertheless be demon
                                       it
strated that they can do so indirectly.        A vertical circulation
<U+FB01>lling the deep recesses of the ocean under the equator with
polar-cold water, follows as readily and truly from the wind
theory as   it   does from the gravitation theory.        It has been
shown that the general tendency of the system of the winds          is
to impel the surface-water of the equatorial regions into the
temperate and polar regions as rapidly as        it   isheated.   But
such a    transference of surface-water must tend to destroy static
equilibrium      by making the equatorial too light and the tem
perate and polar columns too heavy, as truly as though the
transference had taken place    by   means of difference of tempera
ture.     The effect must be to produce     aconstant ascent of the
equatorial column and      an  inflow of cold  water below equal to
the out<U+FB02>ow above.       In short, the wind   must  produce a   system
of circulation precisely the same as that supposed to take place
by   difference of temperature.

   By both theories the cause of the vertical motion is the
transference of water from the top of the one column to the top
of the other. This vertical motion is therefore as much a ne—
cessary consequence of the wind theory as it is of the gra
vitation theory.

                    By FREDERICK GUTHRIE*.
          following numerical results of experiments may be of
THEuse      in the further study of wave-motion.         They refer to
stationary  waves  mainly,   and  include  those of circular  and those
of rectangular troughs.      The guiding idea was :——to deduce the
velocity of wave-progression under different conditions from the
frequency of recurrence of a given phase in the same place, in a
manner similar to that employed in the measurement of the velo
city of a sound-wave through a solid by the pitch of the note
when a certain length of the solid vibrates longitudinally; and,
by making use of re<U+FB02>ection, to bring into a compact form for
study the effects of wave-progression.
                           Circular Troughs.
   § 1. The <U+FB01>rst condition of motion examined in circular troughs
is that which I shall call binodal.      This motion can be easily set
up in a cylindrical trough of water if it be not much less than
9 inches in diameter, nor the water much less than 6 inches
deep.    The bottom of an empty beaker glass serves well to ge
nerate the waves, on account of its buoyancy.        This is placed on
the centre of the water, and moved down and up at a rate de
pendent upon the diameter of the vessel.          The motion of the
water soon guides the hand, and, being judiciously humoured,
establishes itself and continues for many minutes with great
regularity. The number of times in one or more minutes that
the crest appears in the middle may be easily counted if the re
<U+FB02>ection of a window-sash is seen obliquely on the liquid surface.
    § 2. In<U+FB02>uence of amplitude—Before examining the in<U+FB02>uence
of diameter (which with stationary waves amounts to an exami
nation of the in<U+FB02>uence of wave-length), a brief examination of
the in<U+FB02>uence of Depth, Temperature, Density, and Amplitude
had to be undertaken, to determine at all events the margin of
variation admissible without vitiation of the result.        The ampli
tude was measured by standing a brass wire graduated in milli
metres, and fastened to a leaden foot, in various parts of the
trough after the wave-system was established.
   § 3. A cylindrical vessel, B, of tin plate had the mean dia
meter 456 millims. (It was slightly elliptical, 455, 457 millims.)

292        Frederick Guthrie     on Stationary   Liquid Waves.
    At  a depth  of 30 millims. no fundamental undulations        could
be preserved.     In order to see whether the effect of shallowness
took most effect on waves of larger or smaller amplitude, the
depth 70 millims. was restored and an initial central ampli
tude of 30 millims. was given.            In the <U+FB01>rst minute 113 were
counted,- after a lapse of 10” the same number 113 were counted
in the second minute.          A second experiment, in which the in
terval between the two minutes was 15”, gave for both minutes
exactly the same number 113.             The general conclusions to be
drawn from these results appear to be that the normal rate of
pulsation is not reached unless there be at least a depth of about
130 to 170 millims. (say 6 inches), and that the effect of shal
lowness is as great on small as on larger amplitudes.         No doubt
the diminution in rate is due to the increased drag upon the
bottom of the vessel.       It is at about this depth that the to-and
fro motion of the particles at the bottom of the vessel ceases to
be sensible.
    But the examination of the effect of depth is not complete
unless we know whether that effect is a function of the diameter
or wave-length.       Accordingly a circular vessel D was taken of
the diameter 314 millims., with the following result :—
                                   Number of

     It appears, then, that in the vessel D, whose diameter is 314
millims., the effect of the shallowness begins to be felt at rather
lesser depths than is the case in the wider troughs.          At depths
of 30 millims. and under, the fundamental system cannot maintain
itself.
     § 6. E<U+FB01>'ect of variation in chemical nature—A cylindrical ves
 sel, which   I shall call D, had the diameter of 321 millims.        It
was <U+FB01>lled to a depth of 80 millims. with methylated spirit. This
 gave in each of three experiments 143 pulsations per minute.

   §  9. Form    fundamental bimodal wave in cylindrical trough.—
                      of
 The beautiful smoothness and persistence of the stationary bino
 dal waves in cylindrical vessels enables us to examine their form

           Frederick Guthrie    on Stationary     Liquid Waves.         295
with some accuracy. It is at once seen that while the only part
of the water free from radial motion is that in contact with the
walls and the' very axis of the cylinder, there is a nodal ring of
constant height—which, however, is only a geometrical expres
sion ; for the water sweeps to and fro through the node radially.
Putting aside for the present the internal motion of the water, let
us examine the position of the nodal ring.    This can be done by
shifting the gauge of § 2 until there is no rise and fall on its
stem, and then measuring its distance from the edge.                A per
manent record of the nature of the wave-system can be got by
immersing a sheet of cardboard in a vertical plane passing
through the axis of the cylinder and reaching to the circumfe
rence.     The cardboard loses its smoothness where the water has
touched it.      By both of these methods it appeared that in ves
sel A the node was 99 millims. from the edge, in B it was '75
millims., and in C it was 64 millims. The diameters of these
being respectively 595, 456, and 366 millims., the fraction of
the diameters at which the nodes were formed were respectively
6'01, 6'08, and 5'72.      The central amplitude was in each case
26 millims.       In the vessel C this amplitude causes incipient
breakers, so that the nodal point sways.           It appears that in a
perfect system of such waves the nodal line is           of the diameter
                                                         il;

  §    10. Relative amplitude at di<U+FB02>erent parts.-—-When the ampli
tude  is  great, the elevation at the centre exceeds the depression
at the same place. The elevation may be so great as to project
water repeatedly, while the corresponding cavity              smooth and
                                                               is
round.     In  sucha  condition  the  node  sways.    With    smaller  am
plitudes, the alternate depression     and  elevation   at  the  centre are
equal to one another, and the node becomes stationary.
   With great amplitudes, that at the centre inde<U+FB01>nitely greater
                                                    is

                                                                            ‘
amplitudes the amplitude at the edge         is nearly exactly one half
of that in the centre; this     is the more nearly true the less the
amplitude,     and  would,I   conceive,  be strictly true       the waves

  §   11. Comparison with stationary waves          solids.—A uniform

                                     1,    be  set  in vibration in the
manner shown      by the dotted                    Fig_1_

such  a    way that a=c=éb
and d=e=f.          The nodes
are at it   from the ends, and
the amplitude at the ends       is
nearly the same as in the middle.           A  lath consisting of two
isosceles triangles (<U+FB01>g.   2) can be thrown   into   similar waves whose

planes are at right
angles to the plane
of the lath (<U+FB01>g.
But the nodes are
now at nearly H
from the ends, and
the amplitude       in
the middle is approximately twice that at the ends.
    Imagine a thin circular board to consist entirely of such
sectorial laths.    They would, if strung on a circular wire passing
through their centres of gravity, form a rigid system ,- for motion
around the wire would cause gaping between the apiece and
 crushing between the bases of the sectors.       Nevertheless such
 motion is possible if the disk is elastic, as is shown by the for—
mation of a nodal line around a circular plate at a distance of
one sixth of the diameter from the circumference when the disk
 is bowed through a hole in the middle.      The motion of such a
 disk is analogous in many respects to that of water in a circular
trough. We may compare both cases with systems of is0sceles
triangles oscillating about lines passing through their centres of
 gravity.   With the disk we have momentum and inertia con
 trolled by elasticity; in the wave they are controlled by gravity.
 If  the surfaces of the waves were conical, the following simple
 comparison might be drawn for an elementary displacement.
Let <U+FB01>g. 3, D E, be the
axis of the cylindrical
trough.      Let D G,
D B be the limiting
radii of the displaced
cone -sector D G B.

                                                        and as much
water has to enter the wedge FGBAl-l C.               These volumes
must be equal.     It easy to show that they are so. This in
                            is                                   is
accordance with the general law that when two heavy planes in
one plane turn together round any axis passing through their
common centre of gravity, they sweep out solids of equal
volume.
   As the water      constrained neither to separate in the middle
                      is
nor from the walls, the sectors change from conical to circular
sectors and back again.       And with conical waves the actual
volume of water concerned in the motion         less than that traced
out   bythe rotating sector; but this defect      is is
                                                 the same in volume
with the wedge as with the tetrahedron.

    § 12. Level of node.—-When the wave-system is perfect, the
vertical height of the node is the same as that of the surface of
the liquid when at rest.        The movement of particles of powder
 on the water shows that though the node itself is at rest, the
water composing it is in violent motion.             [t is a stationary
market in a shifting population.         It shows that, as in solid and
gaseous waves, a node is a region where most work is done, and
accordingly where least motion ensues—a hinge.

were found to have the following dimensions in millimetres :—

   About the depth, my only care was to have such a depth of
water that there should he no sensible drag by friction.             This
appears from § 5 to be the case with about 150 millims. of water.
It will be shown in § 23 that, at this width, variation in width
is without sensible effect.        The mean widths are given.        The
lengths  are also   the  means   of twelve  measurements    1 inch apart.
In no case was there a difference of more than 1 millim. between
lengths which should have been identical.
   In rectangular troughs two chief wave - systems can be
established which maintain themselves automatically.                They
may be called binodal and mononodal respectively.               The <U+FB01>rst
is the counterpart of the circular waves which we have been
considering.      The binodal system is got by placing a wooden
lath, 2 or 3 inches wide and nearly as long as the trough is wide,
and provided with a handle at right angles to its plane, on the
surface of the water exactly halfway from either end, and de
pressing and raising it intact.       The waves soon grow and main
tain themselves for several minutes.         The second or mononodal
system is very easily produced by slightly tilting the trough
repeatedly around one of its lower end edges.         We shall consider
the binodal motion <U+FB01>rst.        The troughs were all <U+FB01>lled to a depth
of 260 millims.        As it appears from the whole of the subjoined
experiments that the number of undulations in the <U+FB01>rst minute
was the same as those in the second, and so on, it followed
that, as in circular troughs, the amplitude was without effect
upon the frequency of pulsation.

     The mean of these is 74'7, and this is the distance which a
 wave   a metre long would pass over in 1' when moving in deep
 water between parallel walls.     This is under the assumption that
 no velocity is lost by re<U+FB02>ection ; and the same assumption must
 be made    in § 8 with circular troughs, where the velocity of the
 metre wave in circular troughs was found to be 831 metres in 1'.
     § 16. As the circular undulation was referred to an oscillating
 triangle 0r vibrating pair of triangular laths, so may the motion
 of the water above described in the rectangular trough be likened
 to the balancing of two rectangular laths supported at their lines
 of gravity, or, more closely, to the binodal vibration of a rectan
 gular lath (see § ll). The lines of gravity are now from each
 end % of the joint length.     The nodes are at All from each end.
 Accordingly in rectangular troughs the nodes are at exactly       it
 from the ends when the undulation is binodal. Also, on taking
 a paper section of the system (see § 9), it is found that the am
 plitude at the centre only exceeds that at the ends by a very
 small amount.      As before, the node is not a line of material
 rest.   The water sweeps through it towards the mountain which
is forming at one side or the other.
     § 17. Mononodal undulation in circular troughs—In circular
 troughs the mononodal waves can be produced by tilting or by a
 segmental stirrer. The former, of course, lifts the node and pro
 duces at <U+FB01>rst a longer wave than is due to the proper limits of
the trough. This very fact causes the wave to accommodate itself
to the trough, and to establish a nodal line which is a diameter
 of the cylinder at right angles to the plane of the wave.       The
 same system is produced at once by the careful use of the seg
mental stirrer.     Two kinds of irregularities may show them
selves.    The one depends upon the partial degeneration of the
mononodal system into circular bi- or quadrinodal systems; the
second consists of an almost unavoidable rotation of the node.
 Such rotation, which need not exceed a quadrant in three or four
hundred waves, must of course be an experimental fault, since no
reason can be assigned why it should take place in one rather
than in the other direction.         Neither irregularity appears to
affect the rate of the mononodal system ; the <U+FB01>rst gradually
 effaces itself probably by disaecord between the older and newer
effects.

       XXXVI. Mr.     Mallet’s Theory of Volcanic Energy                   tested.
                    By the Rev. 0. FISHER, F.G.S.*
   N the July Number of this Magazine Mr. Mallet has replied
      to certain remarks upon his theory of volcanic energy made
 by  Professor   Hilgard'l- and by myselfi, and containing some
 thing in common.         Professor Hilgard suggested an objection
 to the theory which he thinks “must strike every reader of the
original memoir,” and assumes not to require proof—that
                                                                   “ the
 maximum temperature resulting from the crushing to powder
of the hardest rock is something over 217° Fahr.” as determined
by Mr. Mallet.        But inasmuch as Mr. Mallet in his memoir
appeared    to rely upon the localization of the heat produced in
crushing the whole of a certain quantity of rock for fusing one
part of      it,
              I attempted to show that such localization of the
heat was -not possible, and that consequently,                        if
                                                               crushing
 rock could fuse        all the rock so crushed ought to be fused;
                        it,
and, inasmuch as for any thing that appeared to the contrary,
Mr. Mallet relied upon the result of his experiments for giving
the full amount of heat obtainable in that way,               concluded
                                                                      I
that his argument required that the cubes experimented upon
ought to have been themselves fused.
    In his reply Mr. Mallet commences                      by
                                                  suggesting that the
heat evolved       by
                    crushing rock in the depths of the earth’s crust
may be much greater than what be inferred                        by
                                                      calculation from
his experiments; for         must be borne in mind that the heat
                              it
was not measured, but calculated.          However,      will begin
                                                                 I                   by
commenting      on  his  answer   to  my <U+FB01>rst objection (which he has
taken second), viz. that the heat produced                       by
                                                       crushing could
not be localized; for that          could be so

the heat calculated to be evolved out of crushing one volume
would fuse about one tenth of an equal volume *.
    Let us, then, consider a prism of rock of any length.             This
is itself a part of the earth’s crust, and by its resistance has,
up to the moment of its giving way, resisted, and o permitted,
the necessary accumulation of the pressure which eventually
causes it to yield.        Conceive that in this prism there are portions
situated here and there which are weaker than the average,
and that these weak portions when crushed allow of the prism
 being shortened at the places where-they are situated by the
 quantities 0:1, 0:5,, as, &c. respectively.   It is clear that the weaker
places will yield <U+FB01>rst and under a less pressure, and by the
relief so afforded delay the crushing of the others, because the
 pressure must accumulate afresh.             But, for argument’s sake,
 we will suppose all to yield together, and the pressure throughout
 the action to be equal to the value it had at the <U+FB01>rst yielding.
     Now suppose that when the prism has yielded the whole of
 it becomes shortened by the length a.                If, then, P be the
 pressure which caused it to yield, Pa will be the whole work
 done upon the prism.          The length a is made up of the portions
 a],  mg, as, 860., by   which  the weak portions have been shortened;
 while Pal, Pug, Pas, 8w. are the portions of work done at these
 places.     And these taken together make up Pa, since a, + a2+
 u8+&c.=a.          We see, then, that the work must be con<U+FB01>ned to
 these places; for if there were work done elsewhere we should
 have more work than Pa, which is impossible.               Hence the work
 convertible partially into heat takes place at all these places, and
  at each in proportion only to the yielding, and nowhere else,
  so that it cannot be localized at any one place.          It seems to me,
  therefore, that, unless the heat got out of crushing any portion
  of rock is suf<U+FB01>cient to fuse that particular portion, none will be
  fused ; and this led me to my second objection (put <U+FB01>rst by Mr.
  Mallet), that, if crushing rock could fuse                   it,
                                                          the cubes experi
  mented upon ought to have been fused; for                certainly under
                                                               I
  stood Mr. Mallet to rely upon his experiments for showing how
  much heat might be obtained by that means.
     The suppOsed weak parts of the prism answer to the joints
  of ashlar stones, as instanced            Mr. Mallet in his late paper
                                             by
  in this Magazine.
     In reply to my objection last mentioned, Mr. Mallet enters
  upon the consideration of the circumstances under which crushing
  may be thought to occur deep down in the earth’s crust, and holds
  *       188.
                 “   It   follows from equation (6) that   1   cubic mile of crushed
      §
 mean rock will thus heat. 0'262 cubic mile of the heated material, or will
 fuse 0'108 cubic mile of the fused material, the speci<U+FB01>c heat of all being
 taken as the same.”

 304              The Rev. 0. Fisher   on  Mr. Mallet’s
 that these are fully suf<U+FB01>cient to refute it.    He says, “indeed the
 statement that if under any circumstances and in the rock-masses
 of nature ‘crushing can induce fusion, then the cubes experi
 mented upon ought to have been fused in the crushing,’ seems
 as unsupportable as it would be to af<U+FB01>rm that no heat is developed
 by the slow oxidation (eremacausis) into water and carbonic acid
 of a pound of wood, which when burned develops a well-known
 amount of heat.”         I may observe that   I  made no statement
 about the “rock-masses of nature,” but simply commented on
 Mr. Mallet’s arguments, such as       I understood them to be 5 for
 I did not see the bearing of the numerous and elaborate experi
 ments, and laborious calculations founded upon them, unless it
 was held by him that the results as he had left them were held
 by him to be applicable to the case of nature.       I certainly sup
 posed that such was the author’s meaning; and it seems that
 Professor Hilgard came to the same conclusion.          I am also at
 aloss to perceive how the instance of eremacausis bears upon the
 question.    If it represents the cubes crushed in air, and the quick
 burning   represents   the rock crushed low down within the crust,
 then it would support the view that the heat developed in both
 cases is the same; for the total amount of heat developed by the
 burning of the wood is the same in either case, though the times
 taken to develop it differ.       In Mr. Mallet’s experiments time
 does not enter as a factor; for the work is measured by pressure
  X distance through which it acts, and no deduction is made on
 account of any escape of heat.
    We will now follow Mr. Mallet into his developments of the
 original theory, as given in his paper
                                              “ On the
                                                          Temperature
 attainable by Rock-crushing and its Consequences.”
    “ If a cube of rock, which in free air is found to crush under
a certain pressure, be situated deep within a mass of similar rock
and there crushed, it does not admit of dispute that the work
 necessary to effect crushing must be largely increased.”
    This does not appear easily reconcilable with the statement of
 § 92 of the original memoir.        But, admitting it to be the case,
and that the pressure required to crush cubes at the depths of 10
and 20 statute miles will be as supposed 2'14 and 428 times as
great as in air, it of course follows that “if we assume the dis
placement of the crushed particles after crushing to be the same
as in the case of the cube crushed in air, then the work and the
heat due to its transformation will be also 2'14 or 4'28 times
as great.”    But it seems impossible that a cube of rock so situated
could be reduced to a cake of considerably increased diameter,
as were the cubes experimented on; and therefore if one factor
in the expression for the work should be increased, as Mr.
Mallet believes, the other must be at the same time greatly

                                 Theory     of Volcanic Energy.                        '305
    diminished, because the four lateral faces of the cube cannot
    have the same liberty of distention as in the experiments.       We
    cannot,therefore, feel assured that the heat developed will increase
    in proportion to the superincumbent pressure.        If the cube in
    the experiment had been just crushed in a close—<U+FB01>tting box, and
    the heat developed measured thermometrically, the proportionality
    might have been more reliable.                         I
                                        It is think to be regretted
    that Mr. Mallet has not given the thermometrie results of his
    experiments in § 99, although even in them the box in which
    the rock was enclosed did not touch it round the periphery, and
    so was far from repreenting the case of nature.
       But in truth the principal arguments in the paper under con
    sideration have regard to Professor Hilgard’s suggestions as to
    the “combined. in<U+FB02>uence of friction and rock-crushing.”       And it
    is really most important to examine the question under this
    extension;   for that Mr. Mallet’s sagacity has pointed out a
     subterraneous source of heat which had been overlooked is
    undeniable, while at the same time the question whether it
    will account for volcanic action                 is,
                                             presume, not yet settled.
                                                      I
     He now suggests the possibility of the rock, after being crushed,
    being pushed aside, leaving part of its heat behind          and the     it,
    rest of the column being crushed down upon the same spot of
    a  hard rock wall, and taking up some of the heat left from the
     antecedent portion in addition to what         proper to itsown
                                                               is
    crushing.
       To judge of what must happen under the circumstances, we
    must consider what the supposed column is.         It     in truth  is               a
    horizontal element of a vertical slice of the solid crust.       Mr.
    Mallet argues thus respecting       :——“ The <U+FB01>rst cubic foot of the
                                                it
    column that      crushed has its temperature raised, let us suppose,
                       is
     by the minimum 217°.      The crushed fragments at this tempera
    ture are pushed aside              by
                               the advancing column, whose extremity
    is thus surrounded            by
                            crushed material at    temperature of 217°,
                                                               a
.   and the second foot in length of the column becomes crushed.
    But the material of this second cubic foot         at   higher tem
                                                                   is   a
    perature  before        crushed
                            it   is   than  was the  <U+FB01>rst cubic foot; so
    that the heat due to the transforming work of crushing of each
    successive cubic foot of rock raises its temperature to        higher      a
    point than that of the preceding one, because each successive
    cubic foot at the instant before crushing          at          is
                                                             temperaturea
    already higher than the preceding ones, resulting from the heat
    taken up          by
                  the uncrushed column from the hotter portions of
     material surrounding       that have already been heated
                                       it                             the          by
    crushing.”
       Now       it       that the above reasoning might possibly be
                      seems
    applicable     to an isolated column, crushed down upon      hard              a

306             The Rev.  0. Fisher   on   Mr. Mallet’s
plane, if the column were originally weakest at the point of
contact and the parts nearer that always weaker than those
more remote, it being also provided that it did not bend or
“buckle” anywhere. But the column must in any case be
isolated; else the supposed “pushing aside
                                                  ” and surrounding of
the end of the column by the “hotter portions
                                                      ” could not take
place.    It seems to me that we here get very far away from the
condition of the “rock-masses of nature.”             If there be any
pushing aside of material, it seems that it must happen to the
whole vertical thickness affected, and must manifest itself by
extrusion at the surface of matter not melted; for the tempera
ture is admittedly not high enough for that in the portions <U+FB01>rst
crushed.
    Looking at the matter thus, it seems that, if fusion of the
matter of the earth’s crust can be induced by the mechanical
consequences of gravitation, it must be, as Professor Hilgard
suggests, by the friction of rock-masses amongst themselves,
but that surface-movements commensurable with the internal
friction must in that case manifest themselves.             With this
aspect of the question Mr. Mallet has not dealt; and, as Prof.
Hilgard observes, “ of the complex thermal effects of the move
ments of detrital masses under great pressure, his <U+FB01>gures offer
                                                                       '
no measure whatsoever.”
    Nevertheless on the main question Prof. Hilgard thinks that
 “ Mallet’s experiments on the contraction of fused rock in cool
 ing, and his estimates of the amount of volcanic energy mani
 fested on the globe, coupled with that of the earth’s annual loss
 of heat, completed the proof of the quantitative adequacy of the
 cause invoked by him.”      And he adds, “the burden of proof of
the qualitative inef<U+FB01>ciency of the several modes of action that
may come into play, would seem to be effectually 0 thrown upon
the opponents of the theory.”
    In connexion with this branch of the subject it is important
to refer to a paper by Mr. Mallet in the Philosophical Trans-            ‘
actions, entitled an “ Addition to the Paper on Volcanic
Energy”*.       In this he has made a comparison between his
estimate of volcanic energy and the particular store of energy
from which he supposes it derived, namely the crushing of the
rocky matter of the crust.     Upon the basis of Sir W. Thomson’s
estimate, that the heat annually lost by the earth would melt
777 cubic miles of ice at 32° F., he estimates the annual descent
of the shell on suppositions of its being 100, 200, 400, 800
miles thick respectively.     The estimates are founded upon the
supposition that the amount of heat so lost is derived from the
                    * Phil. Trans. vol. clxv. pt.  1.

                    Theory of Volcanic Energy.                                307
cooling of the nucleus, from which it passes through the crust.
Consequently he assumes for the coef<U+FB01>cient of contraction a
mean of those higher values which he has shown experimentally
to obtain for exalted temperatures.       In passing, it may be
remarked that this seems to be opposed to Sir W. Thomson’s
conclusions in his paper “On the Secular Cooling of the Earth” *,
in which his diagram shows that, if no convection-currents
exist within the nucleus, the heat in the deep interior of
the earth has scarcely decreased at all since it was all melted,
but that the loss has taken place chie<U+FB02>y from the outer portions,
and continues to do so still.    Hence it is doubtful whether Mr.
Mallet’s mode of estimating the contraction is admissible, and
whether he has not consequently made the annual descent of
the surface too great.
    Having in this manner estimated the annual descent of the
shell, he calculates the amount of volume by which the shell
will, after its descent, be found too large to <U+FB01>t the contracted
nucleus,- and he supposes that the super-abundant matter is
crushed and extruded, giving forth the amount of heat ap
propriate to its volume, as estimated from the experiments
discussed in his original paper.   He then compares this amount
with the amount of heat estimated to be suf<U+FB01>cient to maintain
volcanic energy for a year, and <U+FB01>nds it somewhat greater than
suf<U+FB01>cient if the shell be 400 miles thick.
    Now it is obvious that this mode of arguing assumes the
numerical correctness of the experimental results and their
 applicability to the case of deeply buried rocks.    But it seems
 that the whole subject will be placed on a more intelligible basis
if some comparisons be made which may be independent of this
 particular assumption.
    With a, crust 400 miles thick Mr. Mallet reckons that the
 annual radial contraction would be 0'00000000928 mile, or
 000058995 inch.
    We will then proceed to <U+FB01>nd the number of units of heat due
 to the annual descent of the crust on these suppositions :-
  R, r the external and internal radii of the crust,
  (l its descent,
  p its density.

    Substituting the above values, we get for the work of descent
of the crust 4851 x 10‘“; and dividing this by Joule’s equivalent
 (77 2), we obtain for the corresponding number of units of heat
                                  6283 x 10”.
    It does not appear that Mr. Mallet has directly expressed the
 annual amount of volcanic energy in terms of units of heat; but
 he considers that he “has shown that its total amount cannot
 exceed a small fraction of the entire heat dissipated annually,
 being only 5313—9 thereof”*.          We have therefore <U+FB01>rst to express
 in units the heat annually dissipated.
     Now 777 cubic miles =1144 x 10H cubic feet (about).                 And
 each cubic foot of ice requires 8265 units of heat to melt it
  (Addition, p. 4), or say 8 x 103. Hence the number of units of
 heat annually lost by the globe is
                 1144:  x 1011   X 8 x  103:9152 x 10“.
 And it    has been just shown that the entire work of subsidence
 of  a crust  400 miles thick is equivalent to
                          628 X    1014  units of heat.
  The latter is therefore 3:512592-of the former, or about T13:
     Mr. Mallet reckons the annual volcanic energy at 151—89 of the
 whole heat dissipated; whence we obtain approximately,
   Volcanic energy : the entire energy of subsidence : : 1 z 100.
  So that, if the nature of the materials by their resistance to
  motion could allow P (the horizontal pressure) to accumulate to
 a suf<U+FB01>ciently large value, and if no work were done upon the
  nucleus by the descent of the crust, there is no doubt that there
  would be enough and to spare in.the annual subsidence to
  account for the required amount of energy as he has estimated
 it. Much would depend, however, upon the degree of such
 resistance.     For instance, if the rocks were <U+FB02>uid there would

     be no resistance, and if absolutely rigid no movement, so that
     in either of these extreme cases no heat would be developed in the
     crust.
        It is easy to see that the whole work which can be obtained
     out of the lateral compression is the same thing as the whole
     work of subsidence; for let ds, ds' be the edges of a rectangular
     element of the shell, h its thickness, e the coef<U+FB01>cient of com
     pression, which is evidently the same as that of radial contraction
     under the suppositions made above, P the mean pressure on a
     unit of area of a vertical section of the crust ; then P h ds is the
     pressure on a face of the element.
        And Pkdsx eds' is the work of compression of that element
     inthe direction perpendicular to ds.
        Similarly, Pkds' x eds is the work in the orthogonal direction.
     And the sum of these will be the whole work on the element.
        Hence the entire work on the crust will be

towards the centre of <U+FB01>gure.         The interior goes on contracting
until the compression accumulates suf<U+FB01>ciently to cause a move
ment of some kind among the particles of the crust, be it crush
ing, or faulting, or corrugation, or what not; and the motion
being arrested, the work becomes transformed into heat.            This
heat,   as I have   already proved,   can  be developed only   at those
places where the movement occurs.           The question is whether it
will be suf<U+FB01>cient to give rise to a volcano.        If some places are
 Weaker than others, the movement will necessarily occur at them.
Let there be several such, which for simplicity we will suppose
 to be situated at points upon a great circle.        The force of com
 pression   will  go  on  increasing  until one  of  these places gives
 way.     Let PX be a general symbol for this increasing force,
 measured by the pressure, in terms of the weight of a cubic mile
 of mean rock at the surface, upon a square mile of vertical sec
 tion of the crust.                              V                   ,
     Now it is evident that no greater lateral shortening, or ap
 proach of the particles of the crust among themselves, can take
 place at one place than at another, except through a lateral
 movement of the layers of the crust over the nucleus towards
 the place in question.          Hence any localization of work at a
 given place must ,require this to occur more or less.           Conse
 quently if the pressure goes on accumulating until it becomes
 equal to PX all round, and under that pressure the crust begins
 to yield at A, the yielding there cannot relieve the pressure any
 _where else, unless the crust is shifted over the nucleus towards A.
     Having premised thus much, we will endeavour to find the
 amount of'heat which can be developed along a vertical section
 at any one place in the crust under several conditions.
     Conceive a strip of the crust, one mile in width, situated
 along a great circle ; and suppose the pressure to have gone on
 increasing to some value PX, which has caused the crust to yield
                          a             A              B'

  h
  at A; and that by such yielding the pressure has been reduced
  to PA at A, and relieved over AB and A B' on either side of A,
  but not beyond B and 13'.          Hence at B, B' the pressure will
  still be PX. Beyond B and B' it will have been relieved by
  yielding at other places; and it is supposed that it does so yield
  all round, so as to fit the reduced nucleus.       Hence the amounts
  to which the pressure      will accumulate at different places will de
  pend upon the strength of the crust ; but the amount of shorten
  ing of the whole crust will not depend upon the amount of the
  pressure, but solely upon the amount of contraction of the nu
  cleus.   Consequently if e be the coef<U+FB01>cient of linear or radial

contraction, seeing that the points B, B' are not shifted upon
the nucleus, it follows that the compression ofB B' is eB B'.

                                      a
just  resist, so as under its action not to move over the nucleus.
Then, before motion commenced,          would depend on the adhe

   The corresponding value for BB' will be 5333 miles.
   Now, according to Mr. Mallet’s results in his original memoir,
§  133,   (1) and (6), we are informed that 6472 units of heat
would fuse 0'108 cubic foot of mean rock previously at 300° F.,
taking 2000° as the melting temperature.‘ Hence with a solid
earth, according to our calculation, a limit greater than ~the greatest
possible gives 0'0015 cubic foot of mean rock that could be fused
annually for each square foot of the plane of vertical section.
With this value it would take a thousand years to fuse one
vertical slice of a foot and a half thickness within the range
of crust de<U+FB01>ned by the distance BB', or 5333 miles, on a great
circle of the sphere.     But the place of weakness cannot but
have a considerable thickness throughout which the heat would
 be distributed.   If, then, it Were, say, a mile thick, the number
of units of heat to each-cubic foot would                             be             or about 0'02

   The force of compression, besides the work at A where the
yielding takes place, also does work over the plane of shearing
in overcoming adhesion and friction.   Let the whole force ex

 Hence the work, and therefore the heat, upon the last unit of the
 plane of shearing, where it will be greatest, is only one <U+FB01>fth of
 the work and heat respectively on a unit of the vertical section.
      This result seems unfavourable to the view that the heat
 arising from friction of the rocks along horizontal planes can
 account for the heat concerned in producing even metamorphism.
      It must be fully understood that'the results just arrived at
 with respect to the heat developed at a vertical section, as well
 as along the plane of shearing, have reference not to any probable
 values, but to a superior limit which must be greater than the
 greatest possible.     In fact they involve several impossible as
  sumptions, all of which make it too large.             These are :—
      ( 1) That the contraction   from   cooling   takes  place in the matter
 of the nucleus and not in the crust.
      (2) That the above circumstance allows the coef<U+FB01>cient of con
 traction to be nearly four times as large as it would be on the
 more probable supposition.                                      I
 ‘    (3) That the pressure
                              increases to the utmost attainable value,
 viz. that of a column of rock 2000 miles long, before yielding
takes place.
     (4‘)  That when yielding does take place, the pressure at the
place of yielding entirely vanishes.
    The above assumptions, besides making the amount of heat
impossibly great, also localize it to an impossible degree, as may
be seen by observing that        1313'  would be lessened by diminish?

,   Mr. Mallet has obtained experimentally the pressure neces
 sary to crush small cubes of rock of various kinds.         These are
valuable results as far as they go but they do not tell us much
                                                  ;
of the pressures which would be required to cause the strata of
the earth to yield at great depths.   In his paper of July, p.                                   4,
he makes some estimates upon this point, which, for the sake of
illustration, we will adopt.
    Let us then take 434 x 104 lbs. as the force per square foot
which just causes     cube of rock to yield.
                          a                   Mr. Mallet thinks
that 2'14 times this will be the pressure requisite at 10 miles
depth and 4'28 times at 20 miles.     Call the height in feet of                                  a
column of rock which would just crush the cube 1;.         cube of                          A

                              p=217         x   10‘2   feet.
The pressure at 400 miles depth will therefore be that due to                                    a
column of the height
                   40 x 2'14 217 x10e feet; x
and dividing         by
                  the number of feet in  mile (5280), this givesa
for the compressing force necessary to crush _the section of the
crust throughout, PX=35 miles of rock.
     It  obvious that this force
          is                          quite inadequate with the as
                                                 is
sumed value of     to shear the crust over the nucleus. We must
                     n
therefore suppose Px to accumulate to          much greater degree.

   Let us, then, take     just suf<U+FB01>cient to shear the crust, which
                              it                                                                 it

the contraction   of  the   nucleus  and   not  of the crust.  Hence
suppose Px=400.        But    after the  crust  has been compressed,
it    reasonable to suppose that there will be still some pressure

at A which cannot well be less than the hydrostatic pressure
due to the depth; call it, therefore,‘the mean of this for the

 so that the heat would scarcely be localized at     all.
    In  presence  of the enormous  pressures   to which   the interior of
 the earth must be subject, if they be no greater than would arise
 from <U+FB02>uid pressure alone, a compressing force due to a column
 of 400 miles of crust at a like depth is very probably consi
 derably smaller than the true value, which, within the extreme
 limit of about 2000 miles pressure, is determined solely by the
 pressure the strata can sustain.    It is extremely probable, there
 fore, that the heat per unit of vertical section might be consider
 ably above 6 units per annum. But even then we get but a very
 small way towards what may reasonably be‘thought requisite to            ‘\
 supply volcanic energy, especially when we consider that it must
be distributed through the whole thickness of the weak section.
    The above estimates have been made uponthe supposition
that the action between the crust and the nucleus is of the
nature of friction between solids.     If, however, asis more likely,
the crust rests upon a <U+FB02>uid or viscous layer, the resistance to
 lateral motion will be much smaller; but we are not able to
 guess what it will be ; so that we cannot apriori assign a value to
it. But a probable estimate may he arrived at from the consi
 deration that a great circle of the sphere cuts, on an average, at
least three lines of weakness, as appears upon inspection of a
map showing the lines of volcanic action.

untenable.

     On the Smisations  of Tones as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of
        Music. - By Hnamn L. F. HELMHOLTZ, M .D. Translated, with

          TE have now before     us the translation of the third edition of
            Prof. Helmholtz’s ‘ Tonemp<U+FB01>ndungen ’ by Mr. Ellis. Though
    the English scienti<U+FB01>c public has for some time been acquainted with
     the principles and methods of this work through Mr. Sedley
     Taylor’s able exposition, it was a want much felt that we had no
     translation of the original Treatise.
?'.     This want has now been supplied in a clear and forcible trans—
    lation, which, besides the advantage of easy and pleasant English,
     has the additional advantage of avoiding such words as timbre, and
     clang, and clangtint, which we agree with Mr. Ellis in considering
     unnecessary as our scienti<U+FB01>c nomenclature now stands.
         The purpose of this book is to give, so far as this is possible,
     a physical explanation of music and of the physical materials at
     the command of the musician.
        It sets forth how much our organs of hearing can do, what
     objective facts are presented to them, and how from the two we
     can explain the analysis of Sounds, ' Concord and Discord, Melody
     and Harmony.
         The <U+FB01>rst section of the work discusses partial tones, with their
     in<U+FB02>uence on quality of tone, and also the physiology of the ear,
     with the object of discovering how we are able to analyze and
     combine sounds. The waves of the sea. are seen moving across
     each other and coalescing, then separating again, and each pur—
      suing its own path; the whole process of interference is here
     apparent to the eye, but the ear cannot so survey the waves of
      sound. The passages of the car are so small compared with the
     waves of sound, that only those motions in the directions of the
      axis are available for disturbing the air in it.      But though the
      ear cannot survey the process of interference, it yet possesses the

320                    Notices respecting New Books.
 power of separating and recognizing individual tones in a com
 posite mass of tones, in such a way that Ohm was led to enun—
  ciate this law :--“ Every motion of the air which corresponds to a
 composite mass of musical tones is capable of being analyzed into
 a sum of simple pendular vibrations corresponding to a simple tone
 sensible to the ear, and having its pitch determined by the periodic
 time of the corresponding motion of the car.” If we direct our
 attention closely to the tones of a piano or violin, we become
 conscious of higher tones mingling with the fundamental tone ; and
 the more we accustom ourselves to discriminating these, the easier
 and fuller is our recognition of them. In Prof. Helmholtz’s theory
 their presence is considered as determining quality of tone; and
 they are also, in this theory, the chief cause of the difference be
 tween consonant and dissonant intervals.
     It is therefore an important inquiry, are there any objective
.signs of their existence? and if so, how can we most easily and
 distinctly apprehend them ?        The phenomena of sympathetic
 resonance are a full answer to the <U+FB01>rst question. They all depend
 on the power of a vibrating body to set in vibration even a large
 mass, provided that this mass have a proper period of its own the
 same as that of the vibrating body.     Thus a large bell may be set
 ringing by a very small force, provided that the pulls are of the
 same period as the proper swing of the bell; and a very small
 forward and backward motion of the hand will put into vibration
 a ball which it holds suspended by a thread, provided only that the
 proper period of the ball pendulum coincides with one of the
 periods of the hand’s motion when resolved into simple pen—
‘dular vibrations by Fourier’s theorem.
     It is the same with the small vibrations of sound. Take for
 example a piano-string sounding g’ ;Y the string C being struck and
 then damped, g 'is heard to sound. Here the vibration of the
 sounding-board gives small impulses to the string of g’ at its points
  of attachment; these impulses accumulate, each going to help the
 previously acquired swing of the string, and the result is the
 tone g'.                              ‘
                                                                     -
     By means of his globe resonators, which strongly reinforce tones
 in unison with their proper note, Prof. Helmholtz was able to
  examine the upper partials of ,di<U+FB01>erent notes. All these cases are
 instances ofa,  mechanical selection of simple pendular vibrations.
     The car at <U+FB01>rst experiences great dif<U+FB01>culty in detecting upper
 partials, because the whole training of ordinary ears    is   towards
 fusing them, and discriminating the fused results from each other.
 But we may train ourselves to detect them by such expedients as
 <U+FB01>rst sounding the higher harmonics, and then the prime tone of the
  harmonic, or    by<U+FB01>rst detecting them with the resonator, and then
 <U+FB01>xing our attention on them when the fundamental tone    is  sounded.
  Having in this way trained ourselves to detect the harmonics, we
 may then do Without assistance.
     By comparing the upper partial tones of various instruments
'With their quality of tone, these general results are obtained.

Simple .tones are soft and pleasant, but dull.                  Musical tones, ac
companied by a moderately loud series of the low upper partials,
are comparatively rich. If the even partials are wanting,
                                                                           the tone
is hollow and nasal. When the prime tone is weak compared withI
the upper partials, the quality of tone is poor.
    The vowel—sounds are tones produced by the vocal chords, with
a resonance-chamber capable of altering in length, width, and re—
                   and therefore capable at di<U+FB01>erent times of reinforcing

different partials of the compound tone. By means of his' reso—
nators, Prof. Helmholtz has examined the upper partials of the
              vowels, and has been able, by means of a combination of
different
tuning-forks and resonant chambers, to construct some of the
 Vowels,    as  U 0 0.
           last part of this division of the work is occupied with the
    The
Physiology of the Ear, which is very fully discussed, and seems to
Justify us in concluding that in the basilar membrane with Oorti’s
arches, we have a stringed instrument capable of performing all
the analysis accomplished by the <U+FB01>nest ears.
    The second division of the work concerns itself with the nature
 of combinational tones and beats, as well as the manner in which
they distinguish Consonance and Dissonance.
    Combinational tones arise when the aerial displacements are so
large that they can no longer be taken proportional to the forces of‘
 restitution.
    Suppose a particle of mass m to be impinged on by two sonorous
                           f
 waves, with forces sin pt and y sin (qt+c) in the same direction,
 and that the force due to its displacement x is ax-l-bzc”, we have
 for its equation of motion

                              = (ix+bx’+fsinpt+gsin (qt+c).
                  -m£:l_t‘:_’
    Integrating this equation by successive approximations, we <U+FB01>nd
 two vibrations of the respective periods p—q and p+q. The
 former are the differential tones of Tartini; the latter, discovered
 by Prof. Helmholtz, he calls summational tones. The summational
 tones are much weaker than the di<U+FB01>erential tones; and both, by
 their combination with the prime tones, give rise to weaker com
 binational tones.
    These tones are objective, and can be reinforced by resonators
 tuned to be in unison with them.
     Beats, again, are subjective ; they are produced by two tones
 nearly of the same pitch ; and if Prof. Helmholtz’s theory of the
                                                            are due to the same
function of Corti’s arches is correct, they
  Oorti’s arches being        set in  vibration   by  the two   tones. The num
  ber of beats per     second     is  equal to  the  di<U+FB01>erence    of the vibrational
  numbers      of the  interfering      tones,  this  being   the  number of times
 that   the   tones  reinforce     each  other.    The  disagreeable    character of
 beats    is   to be  ascribed     to  the fatigue   which   they   cause in the car
  by  the    intermittent      excitement    they  produce.      Dissonance,   then,
 arises from the upper partials of two tones being so near in pit-ch

that beats arise; and consonant intervals are those in which no
beats are formed, or, at least, such as produce no unpleasant dis
turbance.
    Most musical tones being rich in upper partials, the consonant
intervals are limited by the beats arising when one or both tones
are imperfect; and in those instruments which are de<U+FB01>cient in
upper partials, such as timing-forks and stopped organ—pipes, the
required limitation is to some extent supplied by the combinations]
                                                                  '
 tones.
    Again, the superiority of the major chord over the minor is
mainly due to the combinational tones of the <U+FB01>rst order being
audible in the latter.
    Ramean and D’Alembert were the <U+FB01>rst to recognize the import-~
ance of partial tones in limiting the consonant intervals, about the
 middle of last century ; and Tartini showed the importance of
combinational tones; but their conclusions, though important and
vance-s, were imperfect and partial.
    The last division of the book consists of an historical survey of
the progress of music, mainly with a. view to the application of the
physical principles established in the <U+FB01>rst two parts. The tonal
relationship which was the characteristic of European music, and
developed into the dependence of all the chords of a piece on the
fundamental chord, is to be regarded as a principle of style, in the
same way that the Gothic style of architecture is due to msthetical
feelings, and not to physical principles.        The structure of the dif
ferent parts of the musical edi<U+FB01>ce, however, is governed by phy
sical laws quite as much as is the construction of great buildings.
    It is impossible to enter fully-into this part of the work, or to
 to do more than merely allude to the leading discoveries of its
 distinguished author; so we shall content ourselves with saying
 that this treatise will henceforth be a necessary part of the study
 of any English student Wishing to master the theory of music.
    The mathematics of the work are conveniently placed at the end
 of the book, along with a valuable collection of notes by the trans
 lator, among which we may specially mention those on Prof.
 Helmholtz’s vowel-theory.v
Climate and Time       in their Geological Relations: a Theory of Secular

    Neither Mr. Croll nor his work requires any introduction to the
readers    of the Philosophical Magazine, and it is almost a. super
<U+FB02>uous task on our part to recommend the present book to favour
able notice.      For a long series of years Mr. Croll has been an
honoured contributor to these pages ; and a great proportion of the
                “ Climate and Time” will be found scattered over the
contents of
volumes    of  the   last ten or twelve years.      Besides doing simple
justice   to  himself,   Mr. Croll has rendered great service to the
advancement of science by the collection, systematic arrangement,

_..and.pub1ication  of these papers. Since he (ten years ago) <U+FB01>rst
Ipropounded in these pages the central. idea of his theory to account
  for the then mysterious phenomena of the glacial drift, he has gone
  on patiently and successfully, not only buttressing his position by
additional facts, arguments, and illustrations, but also enlarging
 its scope and widening its sweep till it has attained the solidity
 and dimensions presented in the present work.         The publication
 of this volume marks one of the great eras in the progress of
 geolOgical investigation.   It is only necessary to compare a manual
 of physical geology of <U+FB01>fteen years ago with what the same ought
to contain at the present day, to see how enormous is the modi<U+FB01>ca—
 tion made in fundamental principles, what a number of crude ten
tative speculations have given place to solid well—compacted theory,
and how many loose and helpless-looking facts have by such theory
,found their <U+FB01>tting place and explanation.        And when it is asked
.to whom science is chie<U+FB02>y indebted for this extension of its borders,
,who has made the most powerful and lasting impress on modern
             speculation, the answer undoubtedly should be—Mr.
   ames Croll. N o greater clearing of ground, lengthening of cords,
geological
and strengthening of stakes in the <U+FB01>elds of geology have taken
place since the days of Hutton; and while the Scotch may honour
their Lyell, Murchison, Ramsay, and Geikie, they have the highest
 reason to be proud of their Hutton and Croll.
 . The manner in which Mr. Croll meets and combats           Dr. Car
penter’s theory of oceanic circulation is very characteristic of the
unwearying patience, acuteness, and courage of his investigations.
It is not our purpose here to express any opinion on this un<U+FB01>nished
 controversy, further than to say that Mr. Croll follows Dr. Car
penter into every one of his positions with aresolution and tenacity
 of purpose which, were it not so really calm and passionless, might
almost be looked on as cruel and unmerciful.       When, according to
his own view, he has completely overthrown any of Dr. Carpenter’s
arguments by one special line of attack, he opens <U+FB01>re upon it from
another point with the same hearty goodwill he might be expected
to exhibit in leading a gallant onslaught against any hitherto un—
assailed position. This he does not do with the intention of thrice
 slaying the slain, but simply because he has in an eminent degree
the faculty of examining a. problem from many sides; and he is
concerned,'nct for dialectic triumphs, but for the presentation of
truth in its entirety. No sooner has the active and versatile Doctor
marshalled new arguments from new facts in favour of his vast
conception, than Mr. Croll is ready to take up his challenge, and
show that all the facts can be read 01f in a. light that harmonizes
with his adopted wind theory. Mr. Croll has not the literary
dexterity and skill which eminently characterize Dr. Carpenter’s
pen; but he, as much as any man, knows the manifold physical
bearings of the vexed question; and while on the one side the
exposition of an argument is adorned with literary grace, on the
other the real scienti<U+FB01>c value of facts and observations is more
prompt-1y apprehended.

   Since Mr. Croll <U+FB01>rst propounded his theory of secular changes
of climate, a great amount of attention has been given to the
arrangement and nature of super<U+FB01>cial geological deposits; many
old facts have been read in the new light shed by additional observa
tion; and gradually much that was obscure, involved, and perplex
ing has come to take its <U+FB01>t and proper place.     These observations
have not in any case been made with the view of <U+FB01>tting the facts
into Mr. Croll’s theory, but were in many cases simply put down
by altogether unprejudiced minds as so many isolated facts, which
might hereafter be pieced together. Thus by degrees there have
accumulated a great variety of observations, all tending to prove
that the glacial epoch was as peculiarly characterized by periods of
abnormal heat as it was by cycles of rigorous cold. The inevitable
inference was at <U+FB01>rst very staggering to geologists, and they were
naturally slow to admit this last and crowning mystery into the
long train of perplexities which beset the reading of these baf<U+FB02>ing
records. The discovery of numerous proofs of these warm inter
glacial periods has been one of the best testimonies to the sound
ness of the theory of secular changes, as it is the only theory which
not only permits, but requires the occurrence of such oscillations
of temperature. Mr. Oroll has collected a formidable body of
facts proving the interposition of such warm periods ; and he has
ingeniously and successfully accounted for the rarity and obscurity
of the evidences of interglacial heat as compared with glacial cold.
With the light so obtained he casts his eye backward over the
whole geological record, and <U+FB01>nds probable evidences of numerous
glacial periods in the earth’s history, one of the most important
and interesting of which forms the Carboniferous period. But
this is an inquiry which is yet in its infancy, although it is not
dif<U+FB01>cult to suppose that results of the highest value may yet arise
out of its prosecution.
   Had Mr. Croll written his book entirely de novo, it is more than
probable he would have succeeded in arranging his matter and in
marshalling his facts and arguments in a more systematic and
effective form.   As it is, his work resembles more a storehouse
than a museum: matter of great weight and value is packed up in
its chapters ; but these chapters have been in some cases <U+FB01>tted
together more with a view to convenience than to their natural
sequence and interdependence. This want of continuity would de~
tract greatly from the value of the book with popular or holiday
readers; but in no sense does Mr. Oroll address such an audience.
His work is eminently one for study: it is not simply to be read,
but dug into; and while it will always hold its place among the
standard records of science, it will for many a day to come he an
indispensable work of reference to all cultivators of the more re~

 IPHE   18.  “ The Glacial Phenomena of the Eden Valley and the West
 ern Part of the Yorkshire-Dale District.” By J. G. Goodchild, Esq.
      This paper is a continuation, in a northward direction, of the
  investigation of glacial phenomena which formed the matter of a
 paper lately read before the Society by Mr. Tiddeman, and pub
 lished in the Society’s Journal.           It gives a detailed description of
  the district treatedof, the occurrence of ice-scratches, glacial erosion,
  and glacial drift.       The author considers that the phenomena re
   corded by him could not possibly have been produced by <U+FB02>oating
  ice, and therefore must have been caused by land-ice.            In the drift
 he <U+FB01>nds evidence of a <U+FB02>ow of ice from' the south side of the Scot
  tish southern uplands; and the ice which <U+FB01>lled the Eden valley
  seems to have had two opposite directions, the local ice <U+FB02>owing
  from the high land of the south pressing outwards far to the north
  of the currents which <U+FB02>owed eastwards—the latter currents of ice
  going up the Eden valley, but apparently not having ground down
   the ridges of the high land at the head of the valley.               At the
   same time the author proves that it must have passed over to the
   lower levels, and that it undoubtedly deepened many of the valleys
   which happened to lie in its course.          He considers that the Scotch
   ice could not well have exceeded 2400 or 2500 feet in thickness, and
   <U+FB01>nally arrives at the conclusion that angular moraine-like drift
   of the high ground, the upper and lower tills, the deposits which form
   the eskers, and the numerous stranded boulders are the result of the
   melting of a vast thickness of land-ice charged throughout with
   stones and boulders of nearly every kind of rock occurring within
   the area in which the body of the ice originated.

   Thian-Shan range.” By Dr. F. Stoliczka, F.G.S.
       In this paper the author gives an account of the geology of the
   district traversed by him in his journey from near Kashgar to Lake
    Chaderkul on the Russian frontier, a distance of about 112 miles,
   his route lying among the southern branches of the Thian-Shan
   range.
       Three principal ridges were crossed.       The <U+FB01>rst, or “ Artush rid ge,”_
    consisted of newer Tertiary deposits of bedded clay and sand, mostly
    of a yellowish-white colour. These “ Artush beds ” W916 traced by
    the author for a distance of 22 miles.        The southern slopes of this
    range Were covered with gravel from 10 to 15 feet thick, which
    passes into a conglomerate with a thickness of about 200 feet.
       The second, or “ Kokan range,” is formed on the southern side of

 326                      Geological Society  :—
  old sedimentary rocks, whilst the northern is occupied by newei’
 Tertiary deposits and basaltic rocks—the former consisting of shales
  and limestones, in which the author found some fossils inducing
 him to refer them to the Trias.       These are succeeded by some
  dark—coloured shales, slates, and sandstones, dipping at a high angle
  to the north.                                   I
     On the denuded edges of these the newer Tertiaries rest, consisting
  of sandstones interstrati<U+FB01>ed with basaltic rocks. These latter in~
  crease in thickness till just beyond Kulja an old “somma” is
 reached, with perpendicular walls rising to a height of 1500 feet
 above the river.    The cone of the volcano has disappeared by sub
                                                                          '

     The third ridge, “Terek-tagh,” consists of old sedimentary rocks,

     20. “ Note upon a recent Discovery of Tin-ore in Tasmania.”      By
 Charles Gould, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     In this paper the author states that the ore has been found in
 large masses in situ, and that the containing rock is lithologically
 distinct from the ordinary ternary granite which forms the whole
 of the stanniferous country of Queensland.          The discovery was
 made at Mount Bischo<U+FB01>‘, in the N.W. portion of Tasmania; but, as
 the district is covered by scrub, an exact estimate of the exposed
 area of stanniferous rock is as yet impossible.    It does not appear to
 exceed a few hundred acres.      Large quantities of stream-tin have
 been already obtained.

                                                                          '
 dale Rocks of Wensleydale.”      By L. C. Miall, Esq.
    The author brie<U+FB02>y describes a specimen, discovered by Mr. W.
 Horne, of Leyburn, in the Lower Carboniferous Rooks there, com
prising casts of <U+FB01>ve bones. Two‘of these are probably tibiae. Owing
to their fragmentary nature the others cannot be accurately deter
mined. The author considers that these bones belong to an animal
 of higher rank than any known <U+FB01>sh, and thinks that the Lower
Coal-measures of Glasgow (with Lowomma) may be of earlier date
than the Yoredale Rocks.
    22. “ Geological Notes on the Route traversed by the Yarkund
Embassy, from Shahidulla to Yarkund and Kashgar.”              By Dr. F.
Stoliczka, F.G.S.
    The author described the rocks observed by him along the course
of the Karakash river and through the Sanju pass as chie<U+FB02>y meta
morphic and very highly inclined, until near Yam sedimentary
rocks rest unconformably on the schists.          These are probably
Palaeozoic.    Later rocks occur near the camp Kiwziz, some re
sembling the rocks of the Nahl'm group and underlain by deposits
containing Carboniferous fossils. At Sanju coarse grey calcareous
sandstones and chloritic marls of Cretaceous age occur.        True Lo'ss   '

       23. “ The Hematite Deposits of Whitehaven and Furness.”       By
    J. D. Kendall, Esq., F.G.S.
       The deposits of hematite occur in the Silurian and Carboniferous
    rocks, but chie<U+FB02>y in the latter; and nearly all those worked in the
    two districts are found in the Mountain-limestone.     They occur at
    all levels in the limestone, and generally near faults; their dip is
    the same as that of the beds in which they lie.   Their longest axis
    almost always corresponds     with the magnetic meridian. Their
    internal   nature varies at the two localities.      The Whitehaven
    hematite   is much more compact than that of Furness.          In the
    latter place it contains fossils from the Carboniferous Limestone.
       The author considers the hematites to have been deposited by
    water, coming probably from the Coal-measures, containing bi
    carbonate of iron.    The author behaves that they were probably
    deposited after  the Millstone-grit but before the Permian.
       24. “ Notes on the Physical Characters and Mineralogy of New
    foundland.”   By John Milne, Esq., F.G.S.
       In this paper the author described in considerable detail the
    physical characters of the island of Newfoundland with regard to its
    surface-con<U+FB01>guration and coast-outline, the traces of ice-action dis
    played in  it,
                 and its mineral resources.   The details of the latter are
    given under the heads of the various localities visited by the author.
      25.  “ Notes on the Sinaitic Peninsula and North-western Arabia.”
    By  John  Milne, Esq., F.G.S.
       In this paper the author described in great detail the geological
    observations  made by him during      journey_in company with Dr.
                                           a
    Beke in the Sinaitic peninsula.
       26. “ Giants’ Kettles at Christiania.”    By MM. W. C. Briigger
    and   H. H.   Reusch.
     The authors <U+FB01>rst refer to the popular notices about Giants’ kettles,
  and describe in detail   number of these pits, which were examined
                               a
  and emptied near Christiania.       They then mention the theories
concerning their origin.      From their own facts and reading they
  conclude that many of these remarkable pits were made at the
                        ”
  bottom of “ Moulins     during   glacial period, when the locality was
                                      a
‘covered with ice on the scale of existing ice in Greenland. The
“contents of these pits are traced to their parent rocks, which are
'
  higher up towards the great valley of Gndbrandsdal, in which glacial
  phenomena abound.       They are inclined to conclude that moraine
~matter was washed off the glacier-ice from time to time, and left
  in the pits at last.

      “ Notes on the Comparative Microscopic Rock-structure of some
    Ancient and Modern Volcanic Rocks.”   By J. Clifton Ward, Esq,
    F.G.S.
"
      .The author stated at the outset that his object was to compare

                  ‘
328       _                 Geological Society :—~
  the microscopic rock-structure of several groups of volcanic rocks,
  and in so doing to gain light, if possible, upon the original structure
  of some of the oldest members of that series. 'The <U+FB01>rst part of the
  paper comprised an abstract of what had been previously done in
  this subject.
      The second part gave details of the microscopic structure of some
  few modern lavas, such as the Solfatara trachyte, the Vesuvian
  lava-<U+FB02>ows of 1631 and 1794, and a lava of the Alban Mount, near
  Rome. In the trachyte of the Solfatara, acicular crystals of felspar
  show a well-marked <U+FB02>ow around the larger and <U+FB01>rst-formed crystals.
  In the Vesuvian and Albanian lavas, leucite seems, in part at
   any rate, to take the place of the felspar of other lavas; and the
   majority of the leucite crystals seem to be somewhat imperfectly
  formed, as is the case with the small felspar prisms of the Solfatara
  rock. The order of crystallization of the component minerals was
   shown to be the following—magnetite, felspar in large or small di
“stinct crystals, augite, felspathie 0r leucitie solvent.     Some of the
  <U+FB01>rst-formed crystals were broken and rendered imperfect before the
   viscid state of igneous fusion ceased. Even in such modern lava
   <U+FB02>ows as that of the Solfatara considerable changes had taken place
'by alteration and the replacement of one mineral by another, and
   this very generally in successive layers corresponding to the crystal
“
   outlines. The frequent circular arrangement         of the glass- and
‘
   stone-cavities near the circumference of the minute leucite crystals
   in the lava of 1631 was thought to point to the fact that after the
.other minerals had separated from the leucitic solvent, the latter
 .began to crystallize at numerous adjacent points; and as these
   points approached one another solidi<U+FB01>cation proceeded more rapidly,
   and these 7cavities were more generally imprisoned than at the
   earlier stages of crystallization.    In the example of the lava of
   1794, where the leucite crystals were further apart, this peculiar
   arrangement of cavities was almost unknown.
      The third part of the paper dealt with the lavas and ashes of
   North Wales; and the author thought that the following points
   were established :—
      1. Specimens of lava from the Arans, the Arenigs, and Snowdon
   and its neighbourhood, all have the same microscopic structure.
   2. This structure presents a hazy or milky-looking base, with scat
   tered particles of a light-green dichroic mineral (chlorite), and gene
   rally some porphyritically imbedded felspar crystals or fragments of
   such, both orthoclase and plagioclase.     In polarized light, on cross
   ing the Nicols, the base breaks up into an irregular-coloured breccia,
   the colours changing to their complementaries on rotating either of
   the prisms.      3. Finely bedded ash, when highly altered, is in some
   cases undistinguishable in microscopic       structure from undoubted
   felstone.    4. Ash of a coarser nature, when highly altered, is‘ also
   very frequently not to be distinguished from felstone, though now
    and then the outlines. of some of the fragments will reveal its true
    nature. 5. The fragments which make up the coarser ash-rocks seem
  generally to consist of felstone, containing both orthoclase and pla

   Mr.   J. C. Ward   an Ancient and Modern Volcanic Rocks.        329
gioclase crystals _or fragments ; but occasionally there occur pieces
of a more crystalline nature, with minute acicular prisms and pla
gioclase fclspar.   6. In many cases the only tests that can be applied
to distinguish between highly altered ash-rock and a felstone are
the presence of' a bedded or fragmentary appearance on weathered
surfaces, and thegradual passage into less altered and unmista
kable ash.
   In the fourth division of his paper the author described some of
the lavas and ashes of Cumberland of Lower Silurian age.
    With regard to these ancient lavas the following was given as a
general de<U+FB01>nition :—The rock is generally of some shade of blue
or dark-green, generally weathering white round the edges, but
to a very slight depth.      It frequently assumes a tabular structure,
the tabulae being often curved, and breaks with a sharp eonchoidal
and <U+FB01>inty fracture.     Silica 59—61 per cent.   Matrix generally crys
talline, containing crystals of labradorite or oligoclase and ortho
clase, porphyritically imbedded, round which the small crystalline
needles seem frequently to have <U+FB02>owed ; magnetite generally
 abundant, and augite tolerably so, though usually changed into a
soft dark-green mineral; apatite and perhaps olivine as occasional
 constituents.    Occasionally the crystalline base is partly obscured
 and a felsitic structure takes its place.
    The Cumberland lavas were shown to resemble the Solfatara
 greystone in the frequent <U+FB02>ow of the crystalline base, and the
 modern lavas generally in the order in which the various minerals
 crystallized out. In external structure they have, for the most part,
 much more of a felsitic than a basaltic appearance.        In internal
 structure they have considerable analogies with the basalts.        In
 chemical composition they are neither true basalts nor true felstenes.
 In petrological structure they have much the general character of
 the modern Vesuvian lavas—the separate <U+FB02>ows being usually of no
 great thickness, being slaggy, vesicular, 0r brecciated at top and
 bottom, and having often a considerable range, as if they had <U+FB02>owed
 in some cases for several miles from their point of eruption. Their
 general microscopic appearance is also very different from that of
 such old basalts as those of South Stafford and some of those of Car
 boniferous age in Scotland.
    On the whole, while believing that in some cases the lavas in
 question were true basalts, the author was inclined to regard most
 of them as occupying an intermediate place between felsitic and
 doleritic lavas; and as the felstone—lavas were once probably tra
 chytes, these old Cumbrian rocks might perhaps be called Fclsi
  dolerites, answering in position to the modern Trachy-dolerites.
 l  A. detailed examination of Cnmbrian ash-rocks had convinced the
 author that in many cases most intense metamorphism had taken
 place, that the <U+FB01>ner ashy material had been partially melted down,
  and a kind of streaky <U+FB02>ow caused around the larger fragments.
 There was every stage of transition from an ash-rock in which a bedded
 or fragmentary structure was clearly visible, to an exceedingly close
 and <U+FB02>inty felstone-like rock, undistinguishable in hand specimens

  330     -        7       Geological Society.
  from a true contemporaneous       trap. Such altered rocks, however,
  were quite distinct in microscopic structure from the undoubted
  lava-<U+FB02>ows of the same district, and often distinct also from the
  Welsh felstones, although some were almost identical microscopically
  with the highly altered ashes of Wales, and, together with them,
  resembled the felstone-lavas of the same country.
     This metamorphism among the Cumbrian rocks increases in
  amount as the great granitic centres are approached; and it was
  believed by the author that it took place mainly at the commence
  ment of the Old Red period, when the rocks in question must have
  been buried many thousands of feet deep beneath the Upper Silurian
  strata, and when probably the Eskdale granite was formed, perhaps
  partly by the extreme metamorphism of the volcanic series during
  upheaval and eontortion. The author stated his belief that the
  Cumbrian volcanoes were mainly subaerial, since some 12,000 feet
  of ash- and lava-beds had been accumulated without any admixture
  of ordinary sedimentary material, except quite at the base, con~
  taining scarcely any conglomeratic beds, and destitute of fossils.
  He believed also that one of the chief volcanic centres of the district
  had been the present site of Kenwick, the low craggy hill called
 Castle Head representing the denuded stump or plug of an old
 volcano.
     The author believed that one other truth of no slight importance
 might be gathered from these investigations, viz. that neither the
 careful inspection of hand specimens, nor the microscopic examina
  tion of thin slices, would in all cases enable truthful results to be
  arrived at, in discriminating between trap and altered ash-rocks;
 but these methods and that of chemical analysis must be accom
 panied by oftentimes a laborious and detailed survey of the rocks in
 the open country, the various beds being traced out one by one, and
 their weathered surfaces particularly noticed.

 near Cairo.”     By Prof. Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
     The specimens described in this paper were obtained by Dr. Grant,
 of Cairo, in a block of the white limestone of the Cerithian N ummu~
 litic zone, quarried extensively for building-purposes in the Mokattam
 Cliffs. They consisted of a few fragments of the base of the cranium
 and a cast of the entire brain with the commencement of the myelon.
 The author discussed the characters presented by these remains,
 which he regarded as having belonged to an extinct Sirenian, pro
 bably allied to Halitherium, which he proposed to name Eolherium
 wyyptiacum. The characters of the brain, as deducible from the
 cast, were detailed, and shown to be sirenian.      By comparison with
the brains of other Sirenia, the author was led to trace a progress
in the cerebral characters of the animals of this type, from its

    The district treated of is that lying between the three rivers
Humber, Trent, and Ancholme.         The Liassic and Oolitic beds were
described, from the Keuper (found in the bed of the Trent) to the
Cornbrash (the highest Oolitic stratum existing on this line).     The
existence of the Rhaetie beds was held to be doubtful; the bone-bed
and the shell Avicula contorta have not been found.       On the other
hand, the Lower Lias has a large development; and the recently dis
covered Ironstones of Frodingham and Sennthorpe were shown to
lie in this formation, the zone being that of Amm. semicostatus.
Higher up the series the zone of 11mm. margaritams seems to be
wholly wanting, and the Marlstone series has dwindled to a bed of
8 feet thickness, locally termed the Rhynchonella-bed.      The Upper
Lias is represented by clays not much explored.

the rays having passed through a centimetre of water. The lenses
of the apparatus were also of rock—salt.
  , In these circumstances we have seen manifested distinctly, inthe
dark portion of the spectrum, four cold bands, the distances from
which to the extreme red were
                     19"8,     30"6,     42’,    52'.
These numerical indications have not, and cannot have, a degree of
precision equal to that obtained in determining the position of the
dark lines of the bright spectrum; but, such as they are, they make
known very nearly the spot where the pile must be placed in order
to <U+FB01>nd the band on which we wish to operate.
    Most frequently, in our experiments, the pile was 30 centims.
from the axis of the prism; and the breadth of the admission—slit
 was half a millimetre: viewed from the axis of the prism, it sub
 tended an angle of 5"7; and consequently each cold band made its
 effect sensible Within an angular space equal to its own angular
 breadth increased by 5"7.        But the minimum of thermoscopic
 effect was observed when the middle of the band nearly corresponded
with the middle of the aperture of the pile; and we always took
 for the position of the line that of the pile which corresponded to
 the minimum studied. We will add that the illumination-slit had
 also, in general, a breadth of half a millimetre.
     Subsequently to the researches of M. Lamanski on the cold lines
 of the dark spectrum of the sun, one of us had sought to determine
 the position of some of those lines; and, according to his measure
 ments, four of them are situated at distances
                                           '       from the extreme red
 sensibly equal to
                       19"1,    30',     44',    51'.
 These positions are the same as those of the cold bands developed
 in the spectrum of Bourbouze and Wiesnegg’s lamp by a layer of
 water of 1 centim. interposed in the path of the rays. The coinci
 dence here shown seems to assign to the water of the atmosphere
 a great part in the production of the cold bands in the dark portion
 of the solar spectrum.
     We afterwards made another series of experiments, with the aim
 of comparing the actions exerted upon dark spectra by diiferent so
 lutions, which consisted of a solvent nearly inactive with respect to
 the development of the lines and of a dissolved substance which, on
 the contrary, was capable of determining their formation.           The
 active substance was iodine; the inactive solvents were chloride of
 carbon, chloroform, and sulphide of carbon.          These three liquids
 dissolve iodine copiously ; and all three solutions have the same
 appearance.      Interposing them in the path of the rays, in layers of
  l centim. thickness, we obtained some results which we will put
 together in the form of a Table. In these fresh experiments the
  prism and lenses were of <U+FB02>int glass.

              EXPERIMENTS ON THE PLASTICITY or ICE.
                          BY PROF. DE. FR. PFAFF.
    The phenomenon of glacier-motion has induced most of the
natural philosophers who occupied themselves with it to institute
experiments on the behaviour of snow and ice in relation to pressure.
The brothers Schlagintweit and Tyndall were the <U+FB01>rst who made
experiments of the kind with respect to the behaviour of glaciers.
Subsequently Helmholtz described a series of beautiful experiments,
from which it resulted that, by strong pressure, snow could be con—
 verted into ice, ice broken small could be converted again into a
homogeneous cylinder, and such a cylinder be pressed through
 apertures of smaller diameter, and more of the like kind.            It was
thereby proved that ice under strong pressure can be brought into
any form desired, and consequently presents the same plasticity on
the small scale as is exhibited on the large scale by the mighty ice~
 streams of glaciers, which also adapt themselves to the narrowings
 and widenings of the valleys along which they <U+FB02>ow.             The pheno
 menon discovered by Faraday in 1850, which was afterwards so
frequently discussed under the name of regelation, gave the key for
 the explanation of this.       So far as  I   know, none of those named
 above, nor any other physicist has sought to determine the pressure
 under which ice changes its 'form ; all have worked with great
 pressure, which is in fact necessary              order quickly to obtain
 visible results.    Only Moseley* instituted several series of experi
 ments for the purpose of ascertaining at what pressure or pull ice
 is rent asunder, is crushed, and its plasticity becomes perceptible——

 that is, at :what pressure displacement of the ice-particles occurs.
 He found that, in order to rend a cylinder of ice, a. weight of from
  70 to 116 lbs., or from 5% to 9 atmospheres, per square inch of the
 cross Section was necessary, according to the temperature; to crush
 it by pressure 101'8 lbs. on the square inch were requisite ; and to
 produce shearing 97 '89—118 lbs., or a pressure of 7 '5-9 atmospheres,
 must act upon the square inch.       I have this winter (1875) made a
 series of experiments    in order to obtain somewhat nearer numerical
 values on the requisite degrees of pressure which are capable of
 altering still more demonstrably the form of ice, since for glacier
motion the important point is just this—what is the minimum of
 pressure under which ice is still plastic or yielding.
                          I
    The results which have obtained are, to any one who keeps in
vview the brittle nature of ice, quite as striking as the mobility of
such a mass of ice as a glacier appeared at <U+FB01>rst to every one striking
and wonderful. They show, namely, that even the slightest pressure
is suf<U+FB01>cient to displace the particles, if it acts continuously and the
 temperature of the ice and around it is near the melting—point.   Even
Moseley recognized the in<U+FB02>uence of temperature on the mechanical
'properties of ice, but clearly not to the full extent.
    It follows from my experiments that ice, near its melting-point,
behaves indeed like wax, and with a pressure of only two atmo
 spheres shows itself so yielding, that e. g. a hollow cylinder of iron
 of 11-5 millims. diameter and 1'7 thickness of the sides penetrated
in two hours, at a temperature between ——1° and 0°‘5, to a depth
 of 3 millims. into the ice.    Respecting the in<U+FB02>uence of the tempe
rature.  I  will cite only a few data from my experiments.
    The same cylinder, under the same pressure, with a temperature
between —4° and -—1°, sank in 12 hours to a depth of 1% millim.;
 while with the temperature varying between — 6° and —12° the
 sinking in <U+FB01>ve days, under a pressure of 5 atmospheres, amounted
to only 1 millim., consequently only 116 millim. in 12 hours!
    If the surrounding temperature rises above the melting-point,
 the softness of the ice becomes so great that in one hour the same
iron cylinder, under an equally slight pressure, sank to a depth of
3 centims., although it was completely enwrapped in snow, in order
to avoid the raising of the temperature of the cylinder above zero.
 That in fact melting of the ice (which of course, on account of the
 lowering of the freezing-point below 0° by pressure, cannot be
 entirely avoided) had scarcely a perceptible in<U+FB02>uence in this experi
 ment was shown by this—that the inner cylinder of ice <U+FB01>lled out
 the iron cylinder quite tightly, so that it would not fall out, but
 required to be pressed out, and scarcely a trace of liquid water
 appeared in the depression left when the iron cylinder was lifted.
    The pressure was applied, in all the experiments, by means of a
 one-armed lever, consisting of a steel bar of rectangular cross
 section and 86 centims. length, which was perforated at its hinder
 end and <U+FB01>xed on a. steel pin upon which it turned easily.       By this
 simple arrangement any pressure could be maintained constant as
long as desired.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              335
  In    another series of experiments, the temperature of the air being
2°'5    0., various hollow iron cylinders, and a solid piece of steel
whose base had a surface of exactly 1 square centim., were placed
upon ice, and this was then covered with snow to the height of
about 1 foot. With a pressure equal to            of an atmosphere upon
a  steel  piece  of 6'4 centims. super<U+FB01>cies it sank in 3 hours 14 millims.
into the ice, while the melting away of the surface during that time
was barely measurable, amounting to % millim.           The quadrangular
                                              i
solid prism of steel, exerting apressure of of an atmosphere, sank
4 millims. in 5 hours. It appears very clearly from all these ex
periments how considerable becomes the yielding of the ice itself
to the slightest pressure with a temperature near its melting-point.
We may hence infer that, at this temperature, the plasticity of ice
sinks to zero only when the pressure likewise becomes m'l, but with
falling temperature falls very rapidly.         To ascertain, however, in
what ratio this ensues, a greater number of precise experiments
than   I   have made would be needed.                                   _
    It is still constantly assumed, on the ground of some of Tyndall’s
experiments, that ice is destitute of extensibility and <U+FB02>exibility, al
though repeated observations recently made compel us to ascribe to
ice some <U+FB02>exibility.       The oldest observation of this kind known to
me originated with Kane, who remarked that a large lump of ice
with its edges resting on two others became curved in the course of
 some months.
   I   made several experiments in a. similar manner to that in which
nature had operated previously to Kane. A parallelepiped of ice
 52 centims. long, 2'5 wide, and 13 thick was placed with its two
 ends to the extent of 5 millims. resting on blocks of wood.         From
 the 8th to the 15th of February, the temperature varying between
 —12° and 3°‘5, the centre sank extremely little, yet decidedly per
 ceptibly, from day to day, on the average from 2 to 3 millims. in
 24 hours ; so that the total sinking amounted on the- l5th to 115
 millims.      From that time the temperature rose, but remained below
 zero till noon of the 16th ; yet even this rise of temperature effected
 a quick increase of the <U+FB02>exure, as in 24 hours (from 8 A.M. on the
 15th to the same hour on the 16th) the latter reached the
 amount of 9 millims. (consequently 205 in all).              No rending
 of the ice was anywhere perceptible ; even the under surface did
 not, on the most careful examination, show the minutest trace
 of a crack. Up to 2 o’clock P.M. the sinking increased 3 millims.
 The next inspection, at 5, during which time the temperature had
 risen to +3°, showed the bar broken into two pieces.
     Consequently, at the last observation, the bending in a perpen
 dicular direction (that  is,   the height of the perpendicular erected
 upon the chord of the are at last formed by the ice) amounted to
 235 millims., which certainly, considering that the length of the
 chord was but 51 centims., must be called very considerable, and at
 all events proves that ice     is not so unyielding towards stretching
 and pull, provided this acts with su<U+FB01>ieient slowness.
I       next endeavoured to determine the amount of extension of ice
 by   traction.     To prism of ice of the same dimensions as that em
                   a.

  336              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  ployed for the bending, a weight of 3 kilogrammes was suspended
  beneath, and left to itself for 7 days (from the 11th to the 17th of
 February).      It was suspended in this way : at a distance of 3 con
  tims. from each end an aperture was pierced with a hot wire ; and
 through this a string was drawn.          On the 16th, when the tempe
  rature rose, the resulting softness of the ice had this effect, that the
  string gradually cut through it. Yet, between two marks quite
 close to the ends, consisting of two pointed pieces of wood frozen
 into the bar and with only the points protruding, up to that time
 a lengthening of the cylinder 1 millim. appeared.           By the string
 cutting through, the marks also changed their position, so that the
 further extension until the ice parted could not be with certainty
                                     '
 determined.
     It is therefore shown here also that a pull continued for a longer
 time, even when it is slight, stretches ice, that near its melting
 point it shows itself like other bodies yielding to pressure as well as
 to pull, and especially that, towards the former, at a temperature
 in the vicinity of zero, it is to be regarded as an eminently
                                         '
plastic substance.
     The phenomena of the motion of glaciers will after this appear
less surprising ; and in like manner the behaviour of ice at diiferent
 temperatures towards pressure throws a new light on the fact that
 the velocity of glacier-motion rises with the temperature.      Since the
 glacier—ice and the air over it possess, at least in the summer months,
a temperature which departs very little from the freezing-point, a

       DEAR FRANCIS,
    Would you kindly permit        me, in your next Number, to express
my indebtedness to Mr. Sedley Taylor, Professor Mayer of Hoboken,
and Mr. Bosanquet for pointing out an error in the statement of
Helmholtz’s theory of Consonance in my eighth Lecture upon Sound ‘?
    It would be easy, if it were of any use, to show the origin of
this mistake. Suf<U+FB01>ce it to say that it has been long known to me,
that it has been corrected in the last edition of my work on Sound,        n
and that the corrected statement of the theory, though necessarily
brief, is,   I have reason to know, regarded by Helmholtz as “per
fectly clear and exact.”
    With regard to the experimental data referred to in my eighth
Lecture,    I  may have something to say on a future occasion.

  preserved.     Two holes, about T1,; inch wide, are drilled into the
  block from its opposite ends; they lie exactly as in continuation
  of each other, in a line parallel to the longest edges of the block,
  and midway between opposite faces; and they terminate in well—.
  rounded bottoms at the centre of the block, with a short extent
   (a quarter inch or less) of clear glass between them.      Two <U+FB01>ne
  pillars of glass rise from a stand on the table, distant an inch or
  two from each other.       The block is placed across the pillars (at
  about a foot from the table), its plate-faces vertical, and the line
  of borings horizontal; and in this position it is tied securely to
  the pillars by coils of silk thread.    Two thick wires of copper,
   sheathed in gutta percha, have their bared extremities inserted
   in the borings, down to the ends. As a provision against the
   strongest electric action applied in any case, these wires are
  coated very deeply with lac or sealing-wax at their junction with
   the glass, and an inch or more outwards.      The whole surface of
   pillars and block is well varnished with lac—except a small space
   which is left clean upon each of the plate-faces, to allow distinct
  vision through the centre of the block.
      When the dielectric has been thus prepared, its transparency
  is all that can be desired. Objects bright or faint are seen horizon
  tally through the central parts of the plate (between and around
   the ends of the borings) quite as well as through a <U+FB01>ne window.
      2. The electricity is obtained from a Ruhmkorlf’s induction
   apparatus, which gi-Ves a spark of» 20 to 25 centimetres.        The
  dielectric just described stands upon the table close to the induc
   torium.     The outer ends of the wires from the dielectric are
   screwed into the knobs of the secondary coil.        From the same
   knobs two wires are led to the other side of the intrument, and
   are connected with two insulated metallic balls, which act as
  spark-terminals.      The distance of these balls, or the actual
  spark-length in air, is under the observer‘s control at every
  instant.
       The ends of the secondary coil are separated thus at one place
   by so many inches of air, and at another place bya quarter inch
   of glass. When the primary circuit is closed in the usual way,
   through the oscillating rheotome of the instrument, the air be
   tween the spark-terminals is broken by a sensibly incessant dis
   charge, while the glass between the induction-terminals is tra
   versed by a strong electric force.     By simple increase or dimi
   nution of the distance between the spark-terminals, the intensity
   of electric strain thus produced at the centre of the glass block
   may be raised or lowered at once, and in any degree, as the ob
   server pleases.   I may mention that on several occasions, when
  the instrument was working at full power and the spark-termi
  nals were drawn 7% M8 inches apart, strong discharges burst

                        Electricity and Light.                           339
across between the two induction-wires, at the rate of about one
per second, without cessation of the principal discharge.          The
insulation was so good that the dielectric was not in any way
damaged.       The discharges took place through the air in dense
white sparks, from end to end of the block, a distance of 7 or 8
inches.      In these circumstances, the part of the glass block be
tween the inductiomterminals must have been subjected to a
 strain little short of the utmost it could bear.     Electric forces of
 such intensity were hardly ever applied in the experiments, were
 not indeed required.                                         .
     3. The polariscope consists of two Nicol’s prisms.           A <U+FB02>at
 para<U+FB02>in <U+FB02>ame, presented edgeways, is used as a source of light.
 Next to the lamp and close to it comes the <U+FB01>rst Nicol; then at a
 distance of 2 feet or more comes the dielectric of plate glass;
 then at a like distance comes the second Nicol.         The pieces are
 so arranged that the observer, looking horizontally through the
 polariscope, and keeping the <U+FB01>rst Nicol at the centre of the <U+FB01>eld of
 vision, sees the <U+FB02>ame through the centre of the dielectric, midway
 between the induction-terminals.         The light cresses the dielec
 tric at right angles to the -plate_faces, and therefore at right
 angles to the lines of force.
      4. Neutralizing Plate—Every very thick plate of glass which
I    have yet worked with, exerts at most of its points a slight de
  polarizing action upon transmitted light. When such a plate
  is inserted between the two Nicols without compensation, any
  thing like perfect extinction is generally unattainable, and the
  sensibility of the polariscope is lost.
      The principal section of the <U+FB01>rst Nicol being in any desired
  position, and that of the second Nicol perpendicular to               it,
                                                                      the
   dielectric (still unexcited though connected with the coil)                is
  inserted properly between the Nicols, and the light reappears
  well in the polariscope.
      The neutralizing plate,    a    piece of glass about        inches
                                                                    6
   square, taken from the same original plate as the dielectric,              is
   then placed upon     a  stand immediately in front of the second
   Nicol, and is    moved   by trial into such position that the re
                                              a
   stored light    is again extinguished perfectly        by  very small
                                                               a
   rotation of the analyzer.        The apparatus    is  now ready for
   work.
       5. The highest powers applied in the experiments are su<U+FB01>ici
   ently indicated thus :—battery in the primary circuit,        series of
                                                                    a

3&0            Dr.   J.   Kerr   on a new Relation between
   6. First experiment—The pieces are arranged in the order
and manner just described (2, 3, 4).         The spark-terminals are
<U+FB01>xed at a distance of 5 or 6 inches; the polarizing Nicol is
laid with its principal section at 45° to the horizon; and the
analyzer is turned, with the help of the neutralizing plate,
into the position of perfect extinction.       No piece of the ap
paratus is now touched, except the commutator, till the end of
the experiment.
   Looking through the polariscope, the observer closes the pri
mary circuit.     In about 2 seconds the light begins to reappear
                                                                             ,~'
through    the  dielectric, at its old place between the induction
terminals, very faintly at <U+FB01>rst; but it brightens continuously
for 10 seconds, 20, even 30, till it is almost brilliant.      When
the primary circuit is now broken by the commutator, the
light fades away continuously, at <U+FB01>rst rapidly, then more
slowly, to perfect extinction.        The time that elapses (in the
latter part of the experiment) between the opening of the pri
mary circuit and perfect extinction in the polariscope depends
very noticeably upon the intensity and duration of the electric
action, increasing as these increase.
    7. The light thus restored by electric action cannot be extin
guished again, at any stage of the experiment, by any rotation of
the analyzer either way.
   8. Second experiment—The polarizing Nicol is laid with its
principal section either horizontal or vertical; the analyzer is
turned into the corresponding position of perfect extinction ; all
the other arrangements and the procedure are as in the <U+FB01>rst ex
periment.     There is now no regular effect obtained in the polari
scope.    In many cases, indeed, even when the strongest electric
action (5) has been kept up for 20 or 30 seconds, any recovery
of the light is very doubtful, rather a guess than a perception.
    Small effects do sometimes present themselves ; but they are
tri<U+FB02>ing and irregular in comparison with those obtained in the
<U+FB01>rst experiment.      They are probably due to known causes, such
as imperfection    of adjustments, irregularities of molecular struc
ture in the dielectric, possibly also slight changes of tempera
ture.    If a small and irregular allowance be made for one or
more such disturbing in<U+FB02>uences, there is now no effect in the
polariscope.
   9. Third experiment—Distance          of the spark-terminals small
(say,  2 inches),  the  arrangements    otherwise   as in the <U+FB01>rst expe
riment.     The  electric  action is kept up  for a  minute or more, till
the intensity of the restored light       is certainly constant.     The
spark-terminals are then separated all at once         to a distance of 6
inches, and in a second or two there is an evident increase             of
effect in the polariscope.      Simple arrangements will be described

                                                                         .
                         Electricity and Light.                     341
 soon, which exhibit this increase of effect as a reappearance from
extinction.
     10. Fourth experiment.—The same as the <U+FB01>rst, except that the
 primary current, instead of being constantly in one direction,
is regularly reversed by the commutator at successive equal in
 tervals of time (say, every second). The optical effect is as good
as in the <U+FB01>rst experiment, if not better.
     11. Summary.—When plate glass is intensely dielectri<U+FB01>ed, and
traversed by polarized light in a direction perpendicular to the
lines of force, it exerts a partially depolarizing action: upon the
light, giving an effect which is much more than merely sen
sible in a common polariscope.          There is a good regular effect
when the plane of polarization is at 45° to the lines of force, no
regular effect when the plane of polarization is parallel or per
pendicular to the lines of force.      Electric force and optical effect
increase together.      The optical effect of a constant electric action
takes a certain time (apparently about 30 seconds in my obser
vations) to reach its full intensity, which it does by continuous
increase from zero ; and it falls again slowly to zero after the
electric force has vanished.       There is as good an effect with a
rapid succession of contrary (Ruhmkorf<U+FB01>an)            electrizations as
with a continued (Ruhmkor<U+FB01>ian) electrization in one direction.
    12. Optical Compensator.——Not        having a regular instrument
of this kind,   I supply its place by a simple slip of glass held in
the hands and subjected to varying stress. The action of strained
glass upon transmitted light has been exactly determined by ex
periment.      Compressed glass acts as a negative uniaxal crystal
with its axis parallel to the line of compression; stretched glass
acts as a positive uniaxal with its axis along the line of tension.
    Illustrative optical experiment—All the pieces placed as in the
<U+FB01>rst experiment (2, 3, 4), the plane of polarization at 45° to the
horizon, the extinction in the polariscope perfect, and the dielec
tric always unexcited.      Two additional pieces are introduced into
the course of the beam—say, between the dielectric and the neu
tralizing plate. The <U+FB01>rst is a small square of thin plate glass,
held edgeways in a vice with its surfaces perpendicular to the
beam, and feebly compressed in the direction of its length, which
is horizontal.    When this piece is inserted, the light is well re.
stored from extinction.     The second piece is the compensator—a
rectangular slip of plate plass, shaped like a common microscopic
slide, but generally larger.        It is held by the two hands in
front of the neutralizing plate, with its surfaces perpendicular to
the beam, and its long edges horizontal; it is gently bent by the
hands, the axes of the couples applied being perpendicular to the
plate-faces, so that (say) the upper parts of the slip are extended
horizontally, and the lower parts compressed; and it is lowered

342            Dr.   J.   Kerr   on a new Relation        between
or raised so that the light, after traversing the <U+FB01>rst piece, is trans
mitted to the analyzer through the upper or lower parts of the
second piece.        Through the extended parts the light is weak
ened, and,     with   a right degree of tension, extinguished perfectly,
and with     a greater tension restored again ; through the com
pressed parts it is always strengthened.
    Generally, when the directions of stress in the two pieces
are parallel,      compression and tension counteract each other;
two compressions or two tensions reinforce each other. When
the lines of stress are at right angles, two compressions or
two tensions counteract each other; compression and tension
strengthen each other.
     The action of a strained piece in the polariscope is most
 distinct when the direction of the stress lies, as it does here,
 midway between the principal sections of the two crossed Nicols.
 There is no action when the direction of stress lies in either of
these planes.
     There are several variations of the illustrative experiment that
 ought to be noticed here for their bearing on what follows.
 The <U+FB01>rst piece may be statiOned on the other side of the di
 electric; it may even be removed altogether, and the com‘
 pression or tension applied to the dielectric plate itself in a hori
 zontal direction perpendicular to the. beam ; the results are then
 the same as formerly.           It appears, thus, without reference to
 theory,   that   horizontal   compression of the <U+FB01>rst piece has always
 to be compensated in the same way (that is, by horizontal ten
  sion of the second piece), whether the <U+FB01>rst action is applied
 before the dielectric, or behind       it, or in   it.
     The illustrative experiment takes its simplest form when di
 electric and neutralizing plate are both removed.                It appears
  thus   that   horizontal     compression    ofa   <U+FB01>rst  piece   has to be
  compensated       in  the same   way  (that is,   by
                                                     horizontal    tension of
 a   second piece),    whether   the other  two   mutually balanced pieces,
  the unexcited dielectric and the neutralizing plate, are present
  or absent.      Accordingly, and without reference to theory, in
  proceeding to characterize the birefringent action of the excited
  dielectric  by   means of the compensating slip,         assume that the
                                                           I
  mutually balanced actions of unexcited dielectric and neutralizing
   plate are without effect, and therefore to be left out of account.
      13. The compensating slips used in the following experi
  ments were of different sizes.            But there was one which          I
   came at last to employ almost exclusively, as              Ifound    itwell
   adapted   to  the   whole  range  of effects  examined.    It was    arect
   angular piece of very good plate, {-6 inch thick,            inches wide,
                                                                    2
   and 10 long.        It had no sensible action in the polariscope while
  unstrained.

                         Electricity and Light.                     343
     14:. Fifth experiment—A lcompensating          slip is introduced
between the dielectric and the analyzer; all the other arrange
ments and the procedure are as in the <U+FB01>rst experiment               The
plane of polarization being at 45° to the horizon, and the initial
extinction in the polariscope perfect, the electric force is applied,
and the light is well restored.        When the compensating lip is
now raised into the course of the beam, and stretched horizon
tally, the light is weakened, and, with a proper degree of tension,
extinguished perfectly.         As the electric action is continued an
increasing    force has to  be  applied to the compensator to produce
extinction; but the force is always of the same kind—tension
exactly or nearly parallel to the lines of electric force, or com
pression in a direction exactly or nearly perpendicular.
    After a few trials  I  got this phenomenon to present itself with
perfect regularity.      The compensator is chosen carefully (l3),
 and inequalities of temperature avoided.           A strong electric
 action is kept up for any convenient time, 5 or 6 seconds to 30
or 40, till the light is well restored.      The slip is introduced as
in the illustrative experiment (12), and carefully bent, so that
 the part of it crossed by the light is stretched horizontally by a
 continuously     and. slowly increasing force.       In these circum
 stances, and constantly, the light fades away from a very consi
 derable brightness to an extinction as pure as I have ever got in
 a polariscope.     After this it is almost super<U+FB02>uous to say that,
 when the compensating slip is compressed in a direction parallel
 to the lines of force, the light restored by electric action is always
                                       '
distinctly strengthened.
     15. Sixth experiment—Distance of the spark-terminals small
  (say, 3 inches), the other arrangements as formerly.        The elec
 tric action is kept up for a minute or more, till the light in the
 polariscope is certainly constant.      The neutralizing plate is then
 moved about, and the analyzer turned (through a small angle in.
 any case), till the light is again well extinguished.       All the op
 tical pieces being left untouched, the primary circuit is broken ;
 the light reappears in a fewv seconds, and increases continuously
 up to a certain permanent intensity; but the compensator, to
 produce extinction at any stage of this increase, has to be com
 preSsed in. a direction parallel to the lines of force.     And this is
 evidently as it ought to be; for what the compensator has now
 to do is to reinforce the failing action of the dielectric, an action
 which has been proved equivalent optically to compression along
 the lines of force (14).
      16. Seventh experiment—Distance          of the spark-terminals.
  small, 1%- or 2v inches.     As in the preceding experiment (15), a.
  constant effect of electric action is obtained in the polariscope,
  and the light again extinguished by the neutralizing plate, which

344              Dr.   J. Kerr   on a new   Relation    between
 is then left untouched, as well as the other optical pieces, till
 the end of the experiment.         The electric action being still kept
 up, the distance of the spark-terminals is suddenly increased up
 to 5 or 6 inches ; the light soon reappears and is allowed time
 to come out distinctly.          When the primary circuit is now
 broken,    the  light  fades away to extinction, and afterwards re
 appears ;   but   before  and  after this passing extinction the light
 has contrary characters,      as  tested by the compensator, being
 extinguished in the former case by tension parallel to the lines
of force, and in the latter case by compression.
    17. From the last three experiments, or simply from the <U+FB01>rst
 of them, interpreted by the illustrative optical experiment (12),
 we infer that the dielectrization of plate glass is equivalent opti
 cally to a compression of the glass along the lines of electric
force.    Dielectri<U+FB01>ed glass acts upon transmitted light as a ne
 gative uniaxal with its axis parallel to the lines of force.
    18. Eighth emperiment.—All          the preliminary arrangements
are as in the <U+FB01>fth experiment (14).            A strong electric action
 (spark of 6 inches) is kept up without ceasing for 20 minutes,
and all the optical pieces are left untouched for an hour, the in
duction-terminals being connected with each other through the
secondary coil from <U+FB01>rst to last.           One thing very noticeable
under such conditions      is,the length of time which the light takes
to fade away to extinction.        In the present experiment there   is
a  distinct, though faint, effect in the polariscope, even as long as
30 or 40 minutes after the external electric action has ceased. The
effect has  a   constant character from <U+FB01>rst to last       the light re
                                                              :
stored     by electric action    is
                                  always   extinguished   perfectlyby   a
right degree of tension of the compensator in direction parallel
                                                        a
to the lines of force.        With the standard compensator (13),
there  is   not  a  very great effort required for extinction at any
time during the whole hour of observation.
    19. Ninth experiment—The analyzer               mounted in such
                                                   is                 a
way that    it   may be moved in different directions           at right

horizontal tension of the compensator.            As far as my means
would allow,,I have assured myself of the fact that, as soon as

                       Electricity and Light.                    345
there is a good virtual compression of the dielectric at the centre
of the <U+FB01>eld, there is an effect of the same kind, a virtual com
pression in the same direction, beginning to manifest itself all
along the equator, but more faintly as the distance from the
centre of the <U+FB01>eld increases.      Out of this equatorial line, and
well back from the wires, the direction of apparent compression
of the dielectric changes from point to point of the <U+FB01>eld, and is
at some points vertical, perpendicular to the line joining the
terminals.     Only at points very close to the induction-wires does
the compensator fail decisively to extinguish or greatly weaken
the restored light.
    20. In connexion with the preceding facts,       I  may mention
that under certain conditions, in the <U+FB01>fth experiment, the com
 pensator does not extinguish the restored light all at the same
 time, but produces a very dark broad band, which' descends from
 the outer parts of the <U+FB01>eld towards the centre as the tension of
the compensator increases.       This happens, for instance, though
 not very regularly, when the electric force is very intense from
 the beginning and the optical effect is just beginning to show
 itself; it happens also when the lines of force are inclined to the
 horizon, so that the <U+FB01>ne vertical band of <U+FB02>ame seen through the
 centre of the dielectric crosses the equator of the <U+FB01>eld at about
 45°.    In these cases there appears to be an unusually rapid
 variation of birefringent action through the part examined of
 the electric <U+FB01>eld.
     I have now done with the dielectric of plate glass. Half a
 dozen other solids were tried ; and    I  will conclude with a short
 account of the only two of them which gave results worth men
 tioning. The great di<U+FB02>iculty was to get a suf<U+FB01>ciently strong
  super<U+FB01>cial insulation, the masses being too small.         In only
 one case, that of Iceland spar, was the dielectric perforated by
  discharge without giving a clear effect ; but  I  think the crystal
 had received a predisposing <U+FB02>aw in the operation of boring.
     21. Dielectric 0fResin.—-This is a piece very similar to the
 dielectric of plate glass in form, size, and adjuncts.   A quantity
 of clear amber-resin is kept at a gentle fusion for some time till
 it is free from air-bubbles ; it is then poured into a suit
 able mould and left to cool.     Two thick stocking-wires of steel,
 previously <U+FB01>xed in the mould, along one line through its ends,
'remain imbedded as induction-terminals in the solid resin, leaving
 less than 41 of an inch of clear dielectric between them at the
 centre of the block.    The polarized light enters and leaves the
  central part of the block through small squares of thin plate
  glass, which are in optical contact With the resin and parallel
 to each other.

 of glass and extension of the resin always counteracted each

                                    s
   tion of dielectrics apply here very aptly.
      When the induction-terminals are charged, the particles of
   the dielectric throughout the <U+FB01>eld are electrically polarized, and
   tend accordingly to arrange themselves end to end, and to co
   here in <U+FB01>les along the lines of force, just as iron <U+FB01>lings do in
   a magnetic <U+FB01>eld.        As far as this tendency of the polarized
   particles towards       <U+FB01>le arrangement along the lines of force
   takes effect, there  is a new molecular structure induced in the
                               a
   dielectric.
       If. we neglect the in<U+FB02>uence of ordinary strains transmitted
    from point, to, point of the solid, and assume, as   a  good <U+FB01>rst ap
    proximation warranted           by
                                  facts (19), that the  change     of mole

   cular arrangement at each point is determined solely or princi
  pally by electric force at the point, we cannot easily suppose the
  new structure in a dielectric, originally isotropic, to be any thing
  else than uniaxal, symmetrical at each point with reference to
  the line of force through the point. And, even in the case of an
  aeolotropic body, we may assume, as a simple and sure approxi
  mation to the truth, that the effect of electric force is to super
  induce a uniaxal structure upon the primitive structure.
     The uniaxal structure thu induced by dielectrization has been
 experimentally detected and characterized by birefringent action
 in three cases.     As a matter of fact, it appears to be negative in
 glass   and  quartz, but positive in resin.
     The electric force has probably a certain resistance to over
 come, something analogous to coercive force in the case of mag
 netism.     A sensible time is therefore required for the develop
 ment of the uniaxal structure by electric action, and for its dis
 appearance after the electric action has ceased.            Under an in
 tense and long-sustained electric force, the new structure of the
 dielectric may assume the character of a very stiff and perhaps
 permanent set, analogous to permanent or subpermanent mag
 netism (18). We shall see afterwards, as might indeed be
 expected, that there is nothing similar to this in the phenomena
                                                           '
 presented by dielectri<U+FB01>ed liquids.
     Contrary electrizations rapidly succeeding one another exert
 contrary actions of electric polarization, but conspiring actions
 of molecular arrangement: they are therefore as effective as a
 continued electrization in one direction; and aRuhmkortf’s coil
 is as effective as an electrical machine of equal strength.
     I have made some experiments, and have had a good many
 re<U+FB02>ections, bearing on other explanations of the phenomena;
 and I think it not unlikely that strains due to the mutual actions
 of intensely charged shells of the dielectric, or strains due to
changes of temperature, may have something to do with the
 facts.    But in the meantime      I  offer the preceding remarks as a
 sketch of what appears to me to be the only probable theory.

XLI.     Studies on Magnetic Distribution.          By HENRY A. Row
    LAND, of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., U.S.A.
                         [Continued   from p. 277.]
                                     V.
           us now consider the case of that portion of the bar which
LETis covered by the helix.         First of all, when the helix is sym
metrically placed    on the rod,  equations (5) and (6) will apply. As

          Mr. H. A. Rowland         on Magnetic      Distribution.     3&9
Q". i the quantity which is usually taken to represent the dis
tribution of magnetism, being nearly proportional to the “ sur
face-density” of magnetism, I shall principally discuss it.                '
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, then, this equation (5) shows that the dis-
tribution of magnetism in a very elongated electromagnet, and
indeed in a steel magnet, does not change when pieces of soft
iron bars of the same. diameter as the magnet are placed against
the poles, provided that equal pieces are applied to both ends;
otherwise there is a change.         This result would be modi<U+FB01>ed by
taking into account the variation of the permeability Sec.
    Let us <U+FB01>rst consider the case where the rod projects out of the
end of the helix, as in Tables V., VI., and VII.                 By giving
proper values to the constants, we obtain the results given in the
last column of the Tables.        The agreement with observation is
in most cases very perfect. We also see the same variation of 1'
that we before noticed in the rest of the curves, and we see that
it is in just the direction theory would indicate from the change
of It.
    In these Tables we come to a very important subject, and one
to which I called attention some years back—namely, the change
in the distribution when the magnetizing force varies, and which is
due to change of permeability.       The following Tables and <U+FB01>gures
show this extremely well, and are from very long rods with a helix
a foot long at their centre, as in the last three Tables.          The bar
in both these Tables was '19 inch in diameter and 5 feet long.
 The zero-point was at the centre of the bar and of the helix.
The Tables give values of Q', for the magnetizing forces which
 appear at the head of each column, and which are the tangents
 of the angles of de<U+FB02>ection of the needles of a tangent-galvano
meter.     Table VIII. only gives the part covered by the helix.
Both Tables are from the mean of both ends of the bar.

   These experiments show in the most positive manner the e<U+FB02>'ect

complication introduced into magnetic distribution          the vari                            by
able character of magnetic permeability.
    In <U+FB01>g. 3
           I    have represented the distribution on half the bar, as
given in Table IX., the other half being of course similar.     Here
the greatest change        observed in the part covered    the helix,                           by
                                       a is
though there         is
                    also   great change in the other part.     These
Tables show that, as the magnetization of the bars increases, at
least beyond a certain point, the curves on the part covered      the                                  by
helix increase in steepness; and the <U+FB01>gure even shows that near
the middle of the helix an increase      magnetizing force may causeof
tire surface-density to decrease; and Table VIII. shows this even
better.     Should we calculate Q”, however, We should always <U+FB01>nd
it   to increase with the magnetizing force in all cases.      These
e<U+FB02>'ects can be shown also in the case where the bar does not ex
tend beyond the helix, but not nearly so well as in this case,
 seeing that here Q,” can obtain      greater value.         a

                           Mr. H. A. Rowland           on Magnetic Distribution.                 351
      Assuming that   is variable, the formula indicates the same
                                             p.
change that we observe; for as Q” increases from zero upwards,
y. will <U+FB01>rst increase and then decrease; so that as we increase
the magnetizing force from zero upwards, the curve should <U+FB01>rst
decrease in steepness and then increase inde<U+FB01>nitely in steepness.
In these Tables the decrease of steepness is not very apparent,
because the magnetization is always too great ; and indeed on this
account it is dif<U+FB01>cult to show it; but in Tables V., VI., and VII.
this action is shown to some extent by the values of r in the for—
mulae.    The change of distribution with the helix arranged in
this way at the centre of the bar is greater than in almost every
other case, because the magnetism of the bar, Q”, can change
greatly throughout the whole length of the helix, and thus the
value of r be changed, and so the distribution become different.
   The next case of distribution which I shall consider is that of
a very long rod having a helix wound closely round it for some
distance at one end.
   Table X. is from a bar 9 feet long with a helix wound for one
foot along one end. The bar was '25 inch in diameter. All except
the <U+FB01>rst column is the sum of two results with the current in
opposite directions, and after letting the bar stand for some time,
as indeed was done in nearly every case.      The <U+FB01>rst column con
tains twice the quantities observed, so as to compare with the
others.    The zero-point was at the end of the bar covered by the
helix.

  The value of Q”, between 0 and 1 includes the lines of force
passing out at the end of the bar, and is therefore too large.

                              Plot of Table X.
   In <U+FB01>g. 4 we have a plot of the results found for this bar. The
curves are such as we should expect from our theory, except for
the variations introduced by the causes which we have hitherto
considered.    Thus the sharp rise in the curve when near the end
of the bar has already been explained in connexion with Table III.
A small portion of      it,
                        however,    due to those lines of induction
                                         is
which pass out through the end section of the bar,- and in future
experiments these should be estimated and allowed for *.
   To estimate the shape of the curve theoretically in this case,
let us take equation (4) once more, and in        make s'=oo and

     When considering surface-density, we should also allow for the direct
action of the helix, though this     always found too small to be worth

To compare this with our experiments, let us plot Table X. once

    It is seen that these are all above the limit 2, as they should
lie—though it is possible that it may fall below in some cases,
owing to the variation of the permeability.                      As the magnetiza

   By experiment we <U+FB01>nd that the neutral point   in all the                       is,
case we have given in Table X., between 7'5 and 8-1 inches,
which are quite near the points indicated                        by
                                                  theory for the proper
values of 1', though we might expect curve                        D
                                                    to pass through the
point     x:   except for the disturbing causes we have all along
                9,
considered.
    Our formula, then, express the general facts of the distri
bution in this case with considerable accuracy.
    These experiments and calculations show the change in dis
tribution in an electromagnet when we place                piece of iron     a
against one pole only.       In an ordinary straight electromaguet
the neutral point       at the centre.
                               is         When       paramagnetic sub a
stance     isplaced against or near one end, the neutral point
mOVes toward it; but          the substance
                                     if           diamagnetic    ismoves                    it
from it.
    The same thing will happen, though in less degree, in the         a
 case of   asteel magnet; so that its neutral point depends on ex
ternal conditions as well as on internal.
    We now come to practically the most interesting case of dis
 tribution, namely that of       straight bar magnetized longitudi
                                           a

 and Green (Mathematical         Papers of the late George Green,
 p. 111, or Maxwell’s ‘Treatise,’ art. 439), though they apply
 their formulm more particularly to the case of steel magnets.
 Biot obtained his formula from the analogy of the magnet to                                        a

 “Though some of the steps of this investigation are not rigo
 rous,    it probable that the result represents roughly the actual
               is
 magnetization in this most important case.”           From the theory
 which have given in the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper we can deduce
          I
 the physical meaning of Green’s approximations;           and these are
 included in the hypotheses there given, eeing that, when my

            Mr. H. A. Rowland       on Magnetic        Distribution.        355
 formula is applied to the special case considered by Green, it
 agrees with it where the permeability of the material is great.
 My formula, however, is far more general than Green’s.
     It is to Green that we owe the important remark that the
 distribution in a steel magnet may be nearly represented by the
 same formula that applies to electrdmagnets.
     As Green uses what is known as the surface-density of mag
 netization, let us <U+FB01>rst see how this quantity compares with those
 I have used.
     Suppose that a long thin steel wire is so magnetized in the
 direction of its length that when broken up the pieces will have
 the same magnetic moment.             While the rod is together, if we
calculate its effect on exterior bodies, we shall see that the ends
are the only portions which seem to act.                Hence we may mathe
matically consider the whole action of the rod to be due to the
distribution of an imaginary magnetic <U+FB02>uid over the ends of the
rod.      As any case of magnetism can be represented by a proper
combination of these rods, we see that all cases of this sort can
be calculated on the supposition of there being two magnetic
<U+FB02>uids distributed over the surfaces of the bodies, a unit quan-                 ,
tity of which will repel another unit of like nature at a unit’s
distance with a unit of force.          The surface-density at any point
will then be the quantity of this <U+FB02>uid on a unit surface at the
given point ; and the linear density along a rod will be the quan
tity along a unit of length, supposing the density the same as
at the given point.
    Where we use induced currents to measure magnetism we
measure the number of lines of force, or rather induction, cut
by the wire, and the natural unit used is the number of lines of
a unit <U+FB01>eld which will pass through a unit surface placed per
pendicular to the lines of force.          The unit pole produces a unit
<U+FB01>eld at a unit’s distance; hence the number of lines of force
coming from the unit pole is 471', and the linear density is

These really apply only to steel magnets; but as in the case of
electromagnets the action of the helix is very small compared
with that of the iron, especially when it is very long and the iron
soft,*, we can apply these to the cases we consider.

  The constant part of Biot’s formula is not the same as this;
  but for any given case it will give the same distribution.
      Both Biot and Green have compared their formulae with
  Coulomb’s experiments, and found them to represent the distri
  bution quite well.     Hence it will not be necessary to consider
  the case of steel magnets very extensively, though                   I will give a
 few results for these further on.
      At present let us take the case of electromagnets.
      For observing the effect of the permeability,             I took two wires
 12'8 inches long and '19 inch in diameter, one being of ordinary
 iron and the other of Stub’s steel of the same temper as when
the helix, the number of lines of force is increased 32 times. The number
should have been, from a quite small number for a short thick bar and hard
iron to nearly 6000 for a long thin bar and softest iron.

to magnetize      again in the same direction than in the opposite

       The observations in Tables    XI. and XII. can be compared
together,   the   quantities being expressed in the same unknown
arbitrary unit. It        to be noted that the bars in Tables XI. and
                            is
XII. Were subjected to the same magnetizing force.
    First of all, from these Tables and <U+FB01>gures (p. 359) we notice the
change in distribution due to the quality of the substance,- thus
in <U+FB01>g. we see that the curves for steel are much more steep than
            5
 that of iron, and would thus give greater values to         in the for           r
mula—a result to be expected.         We also observe in both <U+FB01>gures
the great change in distribution due to the direction of magneti
 zation.    In the case of the electromagnet this amounts to little
more than change in scale
                  a                but in the permanent magnet there
                                             ;
is    real change of form in the curve.
       a                                       It seems probable that
this change of form would be done away with by using a suf<U+FB01>
cient magnetizing power or magnetizing                              by
                                                    application of per
manent magnets; for              probable that the fall in the curve
                                   it   is
E     due to the magnetizing force having been su<U+FB01>icient to change
      is
the polarity completely at the centre, but only partially at the
ends.
   On comparing the distribution on electromagnets with that
on permanent magnets, we perceive that the curve                 steeper                  is
toward the end in electromagnets than in permanent magnets.
At <U+FB01>rst thought might be due to the direct action of the
            I               it
helix, but on trial found that the latter was almost inappreci-I
able.      do not at present know the explanation of it.

on the distribution of magnetism on permanent magnets               and                          ,-

  The coincidence of these observations with the formula is very
remarkable; but still we see a little tendency in the end obser—
vation to rise above the value given by the formula.
  In equation (7), and also from Green’ s formula, we have seen
that for a given quality and temper of steel                                 p: I;    is a constant.
From Coulomb’s    experiments on a steel bar '176 inch in dia
meter (whose quality and temper is unknown, though it was
probably hardened) Green has calculated the value of this con
stant, and obtained '05482, which was found from the French
inch as the unit of length, but which is constant for all systems.
From Tables XIII. and XIV. we <U+FB01>nd the value of r to be '4674,

 comes harder this quantity increases, and can probably reach
about twice this for very hard steel.
    To show the effect of hardening,      broke the bar used in    I
 Table XIV. at the centre, thus producing two bars 6'4 inches
long.    One of these halves was hardened till  could scarcely be              it

    In <U+FB01>g. 7 have attempted to give the curve of distribution
 from Table XV., and have made the curves coincide. with
 observation as nearly as possible, making a small allowance,
however, for the errors introduced by the shortness of the
bar.     It is seen that the e<U+FB02>'ect of hardening in a bar of these
 dimensions is to increase the quantity of magnetism, but espe
 cially that near the end.         Had the bar been very long, no increase
in the total quantity of magnetism would have taken place; but the
distribution would have been changed.                     From this we de
                                                                           ~
duce the important fact that hardening is most useful for short
magnets.      And it would seem that almost the only use in harden
ing magnets at all is to concentrate the magnetism and to reduce
 the weight.      Indeed      I  have made magnets from iron wire
whose magnetization at the central section was just as intense as
in a steel wire of the same size ,- but to all appearance it was
less strongly magnetized than the steel, because the magnetism
was more diffused; and as the magnetism was not distributed
so nearly at the end as in the steel, its magnetic moment and
time of vibration were less.
    It is for these reasons that many makers of surveyors’ com
passes <U+FB01>nd it unnecessary to harden the needles, seeing these
are long and thin.
    We might deduce all these facts from the formulae on the
assumption that r is greater the harder the iron or steel.

    M. Jamin, in his recent experiments on magnetic distribu
tion, has obtained some very interesting results, although I
have lshown his method to be very defective.               In his experi
ments on iron bars magnetized at one end, he <U+FB01>nds the formula
e" to apply to long ones as          I  have done.     Now it might be
argued     that  as the  two   methods    apparently give the same re
sult, they     must   be  equally  correct.    But let us assume that
the attraction     of his  piece  of  soft  iron F varied as some un

which shows that the attractive force or any power of that force
can be represented by a logarithmic curve, though not by the
same one.       Hence the error introduced by M.         J amin’s method
 is insidious and not easily detected, though it is none the
 less hurtful and misleading, but rather the more so.
    However, his results with respect to what he calls the nor
mal magnet* are to some extent independent of these errors;
and we may now consider them.                                         >
    Thus, in explaining the effect of placing hardened steel lates
on one another, he says, “Quand on superpose deux fumes
aimantées pareilles, les courbes qui représentent les valeurs de F
 [the attractive force on the piece of soft iron] s'élevent, parce
que le magnétisme quitte les faces que l’on met en contact pour
se réfugier sur les parties extérieures.           En meme temps, les
deux courbes se rapprochent l’une de l’autre et du milieu de
l’aimant.      Cet e<U+FB02>'et augmente avec une troisiéme lame et avec
une quatrieme.         Finalement les deux courbes se joignent au
milieu.”
     In applying the formula to this       case of a compound magnet,
 we have only to remark that when the bars lie closely toge
 ther they are theoretically the same as a solid magnet of the
 same section, but are practically found to be stronger, because
 thin bars can be tempered more uniformly hard than thick ones.
 The addition of the bars to each other is similar, then, to an in
 crease in the area of the rod, and should produce nearly the
 same effect on a rod of rectangular section as the increase of
 diameter in a rod of circular section.         Now the quantity   1):];

is nearly constant in these rods for the same quality of steel,
whence r decreases as d increases; and this in equation (17) shows
that as the diameter is increased, the length being constant, the
curves become less and less steep, until they <U+FB01>nally become
straight lines.   This is exactly the meaning of M. Jamin’s
remark.
   Where the ratio of the diameter to the length is small, the
curves of distribution are apparently separated from each other,
and are given by the equation

which is not dependent on the length of the rod.    This is exactly
the result found by Coulomb (Biot’s Physique, vol. iii. pp. 74,
75).    M. Jamin has also remarked this. He states that as he
increases the number of plates the curves approach each other
and <U+FB01>nally unite ; this he calls the “normal magnet ;” and he
supposes it to be the magnet of greatest power in proportion
to its weight.    “From this moment,” says he, “the combina
tion is at its maximum.”      The normal magnet; as thus de<U+FB01>ned,

    By our equations we can <U+FB01>nd the condition for a maximum,

weight of the bar to be a <U+FB01>xed quantity in the <U+FB01>rst three.

    2nd. The attractive force at the end.
    3rd. The total number of lines of magnetic force passing from
the bar.
    4th. The magnetic moment, the length being constant and
 diameter variable.
    Either of these may be regarded as a measure of the power
 of the bar, according to the view we take. The magnetic moment
 of a bar is easily found to be

   We   see from all our results that the ratio     of the length of a
 magnet   to its diameter  in all cases is inversely as the constant p.
This constant increases with the hardness of the steel ; and hence
 the harder the steel the shorter we can make our magnets.           It
 would seem from this that the temper of a steel magnet should
not be drawn at all, but the hardest steel used, or at least that in
 which p was greatest.      The only disadvantage in using very hard
 steel seems to be the dif<U+FB01>culty in imparting the magnetism at
<U+FB01>rst; and this may have led to the practice of drawing the tem
per ,' but now, when we have such powerful electromagnets, it
seems as if magnets might be made shorter, thicker, and harder
than is the custom. With the relative dimensions of magnets
                                                                 '
now used, however, hardening might be of little value.
    We can also see from all these facts, that if we make a com
pound magnet of hardened steel plates there will be an advan
tage in <U+FB01>ling more of them together, thus making a thicker
magnet than when they are softer.          We also observe that as we
pile   them  up  the distribution  changes in just the way indicated
by M. Jamin, the curve becoming less and less steep.
    Substituting in the formula the value of p which we have
found for Stub’s steel not hardened, but still so hard as to
rapidly dull a <U+FB01>le, we <U+FB01>nd the best ratio of length to diameter to
be 33'8—and for the same steel hardened, about 17, though this
last is only a rough approximation.         This gives what M. Jainin
has called the normal magnet.         The ratio should be less for a
U-magnet than for a straight one.
    For all magnets of the same kind of steel in which the ratio of
length to diameter is constant the relative distribution is the
same; and this is not only true for our approximate formula,
but would be found so for the exact one.
    Thus for the “ normal magnet” the distribution becomes
                             K=C(635-e_3%),
where C is a constant, and a: is measured from the centre.                                 The

 Hence in two similar magnets the surface-density is the same
  at similar points, the linear density is proportional to the linear
  dimensions, the surface integral of magnetic induction over half
 the magnet or across the section is proportional to the surface
 dimensions of the magnets, and the magnetic moments to the
 volumes of the magnets.           The forces at similar points with
 regard to the two magnets will then be the same.                   All these
 remarks apply to soft iron under induction, provided the inducing
 force is the same—and hence include Sir William Thomson’s
 well-known law with regard to similar electromagnets ; and they
 are accurately true notwithstanding the amroa'imate nature of the
formula from. which they have here been deduced.
     Our theory gives us the means of determining what effect the
 boring of a hole through the centre of a magnet would have. In
 this case 11' is not much affected, but It is increased. Where the
 magnet is used merely to affect a compass-needle, we should
 then see that the hole through the centre has little effect

 the magnet is of the U-form, and is to be used for sustain

magnets for determining the intensity of the earth’s magne
tism, which may be thus made lighter without much dimi
nishing their magnetic moment.
    In conclusion, let me express my regret at the imperfection of
the theory given in this paper; for although the equations are
more general than any yet given, yet still they rest upon two
quite incorrect hypotheses; and so, although We have found
these formulae of great use in pursuing our studies on magnetic
distribution, yet much remains to be done. A nearer approxi
mation to the true distribution could readily be obtained; but
the result would, without doubt, be very complicated, and would
not repay us for the trouble.

    In this paper, as well as in all others which have published
on the subject of magnetism, my object has not only been to
bring forth new results, but also to illustrate Faraday’s method
of lines of magnetic force, and to show how readily calculations
can be made on this system.      For this reason many points have
been developed at greater length than would otherwise be
desirable.

 “On the Analytical Forms called Trees,” the principal chemical

 with any case where the carbon atoms form a. closed chain or

     In the discussion after the paper, Professor Cli<U+FB02>'ord said that
 a  paraf<U+FB01>n (or hydrocarbon of the form 0,, HM“) could not pos
 sibly form a closed chain or cycle of atoms, but must be a simple
 rami<U+FB01>cation, and, further, that in a hydrocarbon of the form

there are 4 cycles, viz. the three double bars and
the whole ring.                                                 / C
    (2)   I  now <U+FB01>nd that a general expression for
the number of loops* in a compound may be HO                        OH
established with great ease.          First of all, the         \C/
truth of Clifford’s rule is evident; for draw                     H
the graphic formula of (1,, HM“, and assume
for the present that it has no loops; the H atoms can only be
removed in pairs, and for every pair removed the two liberated
bonds close up, “ satisfying each other
                                              ” and
                                                     forming one loop.     ,0
Hence if 2w hydrogen atoms be removed, a: loops are obtained,
which is the rule.
    It is also evident that, whether a pair of liberated bonds unite
with an atom of oxygen or with each other, the number of leops
is the same, that an atom of oxygen may be inserted anywhere
in a chain without making a loop, and that a chain of oxygen
atoms can only act as a single dyad radical.         Hence the number
of loops in a compound is independent of the amount of oxygen
(or any other dyad element) which it may contain.            This proves
that no paraf<U+FB01>n can have any loops; for H2 has none, and they
can all be built up from H, by successive additions of CH9,
which is a dyad radical.
    Before proceeding to obtain a general expression for the
number of loops in a compound, it will be well to show by two
examples how the loops are to be counted.
                      BEB     has 2 loops, not  3;
and

    Let us now replace some of the hydrogen in a paraf<U+FB01>n by one
atom of a k-ad (denoted by K), so as to form the compound
C, KH,(,,+1_,)+N,),     where <U+FB01>le) has to be determined so that there
may be      m loops.
    Now, if    K is a dyad, we have seen that the term f(lc) does not
appear, or./(2) =0.
    Also if K is a tetrad, it will act simply as another atom of car
bon ; but another atom of carbon would add 2 to the su<U+FB02>ix of
H; therefore the tetrad must add 2, orft4)=2.
    These two equations practically give us f(k)=lc-2; hence
there will be .r loops in C” KH2(,,_,)+,..

If ratorns    of the k-ad   are  introduced      instead of 1, the suf<U+FB01>x of

So calcic oxalate, having 2 carbons and some dyads, will have 3
loops.
    Heterocline,    Si ('Mnmsou)", containing           7' tetrads, will have
8 loops.

                                                be arranged so that some
of the bonds cross each other, it is less easy to see how many

loops there really are; thus                 is   the   same    compound

 sight.'   In fact every crossing of the bonds introduces one spu_
 rious and unreal loop ; because such a crossing maybe regarded
 as a spurious tetrad atom, and each tetrad atom causes one loop.
 For instance, <U+FB01>g. 1 has 9 apparent loops; but as there E g' 1
 are 4 crossings the real number of loops is 5.                      c
     Apropos of this crossing of the bonds, Professor                     '

made to cross each other, whereas in the former they will be
very liable to do so.' The benzol chain might be projected out
of space as in <U+FB01>g. 2; and this form, though probably                I
less true, and certainly less convenient than the usual          Flg- 2
form, appears to offer certain advantages.        For if it be
considered experimentally established that the atoms
2 and 6 are similarly related to 1, then the fact is 5\4/3
                                                                0(T\a|

 plainly exhibited in the diagram.      Moreover it will be
 observed that 2, 4, and 6 are directly united to 1, while 3 and 5

                                          believe that 3 and 5 are con
 sidered to possess af<U+FB01>nities distinctly differing from the others
 when 1 is combined, say, with hydroxyl, as in phenol.
    In counting the loops of the above con<U+FB01>guration (<U+FB01>g. 2), it
 must be noticed that 3 crossings and a loop run together at the
 middle.     The apparent loops are therefore          but 7—3=4        ’7,                is
the real number.
    (4) To investigate the whole subject from          general point of a
 viewI    shall make use of the fact pointed out above, that when
 ever two bonds cross,       spurious loop

     (6) From an m-node 2m lines radiate; but an odd number of
 lines may radiate from those nodes in which a rod terminates
 without going through. Call these “ odd nodes.”           The smallest
 number of rods required for the construction of any jumble Wlll
 be half the whole number of odd nodes in it ; for a rod can always
 pass completely through an even node, but must ultimately stop
 at an odd node, even though it go through it to begin with.
    From this it follows that, since any arrangement of closed
 curves will have only even nodes, such an arrangement'may
 always be drawn without taking the pen off.         The same may be
 done if a diagram contains two odd nodes; but you must begin
 at one of them and will leave off at the other.       The    Fig. 5.

      (7) I shall  now represent graphic    formulae  by arrangements
 of rods.    An ordinary node will represent      a tetrad atom, and a
 node from which Is lines radiate, a k-ad atom; odd nodes will
 be called perissads, and even nodes artiads.         Every compound
 Will be supposed to be made of the minimum number of rods,
 viz. half the number of its perissad atoms.              Examples of
 these formula are given in <U+FB01>g. 6, which represents the com
-pounds carbonic anhydride, ethylene, nitric acid, calcic oxalate,
 benzol, acetic acid, and ferrocyanide of potassium.            I  con
 sider that such skeleton formulae may be useful in general inves
 tigations, where the atomicity of an element is the principal
 property to be attended to.        They have the advantage of being

 nodes; the K4 FeCyG has 5 rods.         Common alum has only 1 rod,
 10 nodes, and 10 loops.        A paraf<U+FB01>n requires n+1 rods.
    The nodes in these <U+FB01>gures are not to be confounded with a
crossing of the bonds; in them, as in other graphic formulae,
 the bonds do not cross. An atom exists at every node; and its
 atomicity, which is exhibited, is in general suf<U+FB01>cient to give its
 name.      Dyad atoms are like singular points or knots on the
 string   of § 4-.    (Professor Cayley’s'lree “knots” are tetrad
atoms.) There is no necessity for dotting in the hydrogen
 atoms; free bonds are best represented bv arrow-heads.

   Since the number of loops in a compound is determined by
its empirical formula, or number of atoms, it is evidently inde
pendent of the arrangement of those atoms; consequently all iso

   Further, thereis no reason why we should limit ourselves to
atoms of positive atomicity     in fact we have not done so; for we
                                        ;
shall see that monads are really negative.          Thus, take homo              a
geneous linkage of lc-ads, represent number of loopsias ordinates,
and number of atoms as abscissae; the curve                 straight line
                                                                  is   a

with the axes for lc=4i or tetrads, and again 45° in the other
quadrants for k=0 or no-ads, while for lc=2 the line              parallel      is
to the axis of .2“. Hence          the natural zero of atomicity (at
                                        2
                                        is
any rate in “loop ”-considerations), not 0.         If this natural zero
were used instead of the ordinary one, and            further the “pre
                                                             if
            ” were taken into account, all the
 sence-loop                                           expressions would
 simplif and become more symmetrical.               Every atom would

   Thus, then, monads have negative bonds, and subtract loops
instead of adding them. Whatever        + k)-ad does,  (2— k)-ad
                                                       (2                   a

one, and so on.
   Moreover there is no necessity for limiting our statements to

satis<U+FB01>ed* compounds as hitherto; they apply equally well to ra-i
dicals with free bonds, every free bond being counted as half a
loop.      (This is justi<U+FB01>ed either by experiment with the formulae,
or by remarking that 2 free bonds join together to form 1 loop.)
A (—1)-ad gives 1% negative loop. The removal of atoms of
any atomicity less than 2 increases the number of loops.                If we
replace    m  atoms   of hydrogen    in a para<U+FB02>in by     1' atoms  of a k-ad,

    The change of zero seems unnatural if the atoms are consi
dered individually and separate ; but then they do not naturally
exist in that condition.         If atoms be added to a line diagram
 (§  7), the  meaning    of  the change is evident-f: triads require one
bond to be drawn, dyads can be put in anywhere ; monads usually
necessitate some rubbing out, and always produce an abrupt ter
 mination.      If I  may be allowed to express myself rather wildly,
 it is as if the normal condition of an atom were to have two at
tractive centres, and as if a monad were in a stunted condition.
          I
Might suggest the term order for non-chemical use, instead of
atomicity or valency, which, though doubtless they do very well
 in chemistry, are not pleasant words? The change of zero
might be made at the same time, and atoms of tetravalent atomi
city he called atoms of the 2nd order, and so on. The word has
the advantage of an analogous signi<U+FB01>cation in geometry.

            only thoroughly saturated compounds     are the loopless ones, for

   1‘ It may be noticed that while dyad atoms can build up only dyad radi
cals, and artiad atoms only artiad radicals, triad atoms can build up radicals
of any atomicity whatever, and hence that, if the elements are composed of
some fundamental substance, the simplest supposition to make concerning
the atoms of that substance is, that they are triads, or atoms of the <U+FB01>rst
order.    In the article on Classi<U+FB01>cation in Watts’s ‘Dictionary of Che
mistry,’ Professor Foster has calculated the maximum free atomicity of a
compound, and points out that additional dyads do not increase it at all ;
triads increase it by l, tetrads by 2, and so on; which is similar to what    I
am saying above.

 rate at 280 millims., we must reject the two longest waves in
 adopting a constant, which, taking the mean of the two shorter

 of wave progress due to increased wave-length is somewhat more
 than counterbalanced. by' the increased path, so that the “ con

         The moving force in a simple pendulum is always equal to its
     weight, though this force is always applied partly to the point
     of suspension.     In the moving water the 'to-and-fro motion is
     due to the action of a variable difference of pressures (heights)..
     The law of oscillation, however, is preserved, although the un_
     dulations are the result of particle-motion          in the mass of the
     liquid, and although these particles in the case of stationary

waves,        as was pointed   out so many years ago by the brothers
Weber, do not complete their orbital motion, but themselves
swing, like the bobs of elementary pendula, to and fro in short
arc’d rhythmic sequence. Whenever the momentum and inertia
vary together (as in all cases of solid magni<U+FB01>cation—i. e. altera
tion of size, conservation of shape, and either conservation or
alteration of density), the pendular law must be preserved, and
this whether the mass to be moved is wholly active, as in the
pendulum itself, or more or less passive, as the logan oscillation
of a common balance.
   In rectangular troughs it is easily shown that, if the surface
is plane, the pendulum (elasticity) or torsion law must hold
good, and that the force of restoration is proportional to the
linear measure of disturbance.    If AB (<U+FB01>g. 5) be the level of

     The work done and potential at maximum excursion vary di
 rectly with displacement.     What is true for a plane is of course
 true for a rectangular trough.      It can also be shown to be true
 for disturbances in circular troughs from. <U+FB01>g. 3, § 11, and fol
lows indeed without further proof from the equal tetrahedron
 and wedge having been generated by the rotation of a triangle
 balanced about one of its lines of gravity.         The fact that the
 surface of both wave-systems is curved, and that this curve in
 volves the cohesion'and viscosity of the liquid, puts the exact
 solution of the question beyond the present power of analysis.
     § 24. Absolute comparison of circular waves with pendulum.—
 It appears that both the binodal waves in circular troughs
and the binodal waves in rectangular troughs follow the pendu~
  lar law, and that the mononodal waves in rectangular and
  circular troughs do so nearly.     It follows from §23, where it is
  shown that no dead weight has to be stirred, that, if the liquid
  has no viscosity, not only should the pendular or torsion law
  hold good, but the actual rate of undulation in the binodal
  system in the unhampered or circular wave should be the same
  as that of a pendulum of radius equal to half the wave-length—
  that      to thediameter of the cylinder.
            is,                                 If pendulum of length            a

      It appears,        therefore, that the binodal undulations in a rectan

    binodal vibration.—Brie<U+FB02>y,      has appeared that the differences
                                                    it
    between the wave-systems in circular and rectangular troughs,
    both being binodal, are as follows :——In rectangular troughs the
    nodes are one fourth of the trough-length from the ends; In cir
    cular troughs they are one sixth of the diameter.     In rectangular
    troughs the amplitude        very little more at the centre than at
                                           is   a

    that at the edges.   The rate of progression in both varies as the
    square root of the wave-length     and the rate of sequence, or n,

    varies inversely as the square root of the wave-length.         The
    waves of the circular system are isochronous with         pendulum                 a

 the circular wave l metre long will travel 83'1 metres in one
 minute if it preserves its wave-length ; ' while a wave 1 metre
 long between walls will only travel 747 metres in one minute.
 In answering the question as to whence this latter difference
 arises, a few preliminary experiments are useful.               That waves
 in circular troughs endure longer than waves of the same am
 plitude in rectangular ones may be attributed in great measure
'to friction.     That element of friction which is due to adhesion
 and cohesion can be directly compared as follows.               In a square
 trough in one complete undulation the surface rubbed by the
 two end lines of particles is 4a! if a is the amplitude and l the
 trough or wave-length.             The surface rubbed by the two side
 lines of particles is 2al. The whole surface rubbed by the four
 edges of the top layer of particles is Gal.          In the circular trough
 whose diameter is equal to l, the amplitude at the centre being
 a, the surface rubbed by the edge ring of particles in a com
 plete undulation is 2a1r§l or airl ; or the cohesive friction on the
 square trough is for the upper layer 1'9 times that of the cir
 cular trough for the same wave-length and edge-wave ampli
 tude. If such friction were the cause of the slower rate of wave
 progress in rectangular troughs, we should expect the effect to
 be less in wider troughs than in narrower ones, because, while
 the surface scraped would be the same, the mass of the water
 would be greater.                                                           .

was established produced no sensible variation in      Fig, 6,

none in wave-progression.                                                 YT.
   But a wave in a rectangular trough undergoes
a constraint   quite other than that of friction.
Its motion is repressed by the sides. It presses
equally and radially in all directions.    The wall
offers resistance perpendicular to itself.  The re—
sultant of the quadrant of the forces in <U+FB01>g. 6 makes an angle of
45° with the wall.            The lateral pressure on the wall                      is    2;;
of the total radial pressure; the onward pressure                    is   also equal to
    $5,   the total pressure.       The constant obstruction thus offered
by the walls      the cause of the preservation of amplitude.

the times of subsidence from one amplitude to                lower one a
in  a  circular and rectangular trough would be found to be
nearly the ratio of 83-1 to 747.          The measurements of rate
of subsidence cannot be made of (suf<U+FB01>cient exactness to test
this experimentally; but           clear enough that binodal waves

        §29. Compound motions.—The motion given to a glass of
    water when the axis is made to describe a narrow cylinder and
    then brought to rest, whereby a wave careers round the vessel,
    is a modi<U+FB01>cation of the mononodal.                If the node of such a
    system performs        one complete     revolution   during the phase-life
    of the mononodal wave, the crest reappears in the same place.
    In the trough B, which held 300 millims. of water, in each of
    three experiments the crest reappeared in the same place eighty
    four times in one minute.           The travelling of the node, therefore,
    makes no difference in the wave-rate.              The motion of the sur
    face resembles that of a disk which is at right angles to an
   'axis when the axis describes a circular cone.
(       If the water revolves on its axis in the trough, mononodal
    undulations are carried round in a similar manner.
        The revolution of the water does not interfere with the period
    of the binodal circular waves.          Thus the water in A, being 300
    millims. deep, was stirred round; and while in rapid rotation, it
    was impressed with the circular binodal wave-system.               In each
    of two minutes 107' waves were counted; and the last minute
    was immediately following the <U+FB01>rst.              At the end of the expe
    periment the water was still circulating at the rate of 12°
    p er 1”.

on the water, inasmuch as it causes the more rapid loss of am
plitude, might be supposed to e<U+FB02>'ect a retardation in the wave’s
progress.     Such is not the case, apparently; for a layer of olive
oil 5 millims. in thickness undulated with the water beneath it
in the trough B at such a rate as to give in three experiments
the numbers 123, 122'5, 1225.
    § 31. Viscosity.—Glue added in varying quantity up to 11b.
of the solid in the trough B did not change the rate from 123.
    § 32. Images on wall.—It can readily be imagined that the
sun shining on water or, better, water covered with oil in one
 of the states of motion above described, gives most elegant
<U+FB01>gures on the wall.      The circular binodal, for instance, shows
lateral andvertical loop-exchange; the cross binodal circularshows
a collapsing and expanding parallelogram ; the binodal rectan
gular exhibits bars of light which approach and recede with a
pause and slight regression.      From the distribution of light in
the images, the kind and, to some extent, the degree of curva—
ture can be ascertained.     Thus, when the circular binodal has
nearly subsided, the only alteration visible is the change of lumi
nosity in the centre, due to the alternating convexity and con
cavit .

    Mr. O. Lodge has been good enough to point out how com
         the phenomenon depends upon the relationship between
pletely ength and rate of wave-progress.
wave-                                        I  regard the results as
being   of value, in a great measure   because  they show,  I believe,
more conclusively than can      be  shown by   the  wave-progress on
open sheets of water, that this law, that the velocity of progress
is directly proportional to the square root of the wave-length, is a
true one. This they do by reason of the conservation of wave
length.
    In  Nature ’ of July 28th Lord Rayleigh discusses the theo
         ‘
retical aspect of the question, and shows that the wave-rate of
sequence which       I
                    had given for circular binodal waves corre
 sponds closely with the theoretical number deduced from the
hypothesis that in troughs of in<U+FB01>nite depths the variation of the
diameter is the only thing which affects the wave-rate or period.

  fragmentary orbits.     This has, of course, its counterpart in vi
  brating elastic rods.     The mathematical interpretation of the
  experimental fact is very valuable.     I do not suppose that such
  interpretation can be complete until account is taken of the co
 hesion and viscosity of liquids, to which, on the other hand,
  such experiments may supply a new weapon of attack.             The '
 other kinds of wave-systems, the rate of which Lord Rayleigh
 predicts mathematically, and which in rectangular troughs were
 described, but not investigated with regard to their period, in the
 elaborate work of the brothers VVeher,       I had already examined
 in regard to their period both in circular and rectangular troughs.
  In this respect it is safe to predict that every system of vibra
  tion of a square or round Chladni plate may be reproduced in a
 square or round vessel of water, and that the time-ratio will be
 preserved.     Further, in water-wave systems we can have mono
 nodal   vibration, which for automatic motion is inadmissible in
 vibrating plates. With the exception of those above studied,

 the more complex systems appear short-lived.
     34. That the wave-motion of the binodal circular system is
not only isochrouous with the radius pendulum, but also coin
cides with pendular motion throughout the whole course of
both, appears from the fact that the two sustain one another
when in direct integral mechanical connexion.           Fig. 8 shows
such an arrangement.         A tuning-fork, B, having the plane of

      It   remains to determine the constants of integration so as to
    ful<U+FB01>l prescribed conditions rendering the problem determinate.
    This we shall actually do for two typical cases:—<U+FB01>rst, the sea
    bounded north and south by two vertical cliffs; secondly, by two
    sloping beaches with gradual deepening from each to a single
    maximum depth along an intermediate parallel of latitude.
        12. First, let the ocean be a belt of water between vertical
    cliffs in two given latitudes, either both in the same hemisphere
    or one north and the other south.      The conditions of this case
    are that there is no north and south motion of the water at either
    of the bounding parallels of latitude ; and they are to be ful<U+FB01>lled

  400          Sir William Thomson       on the General Integration
 that this transcendental equation cannot have imaginary roots
 and has necessarily an in<U+FB01>nite number of real roots more and
 more nearly equidilferent when taken in order of magnitude
 from the smallest positive to larger and larger positive, or from
 the smallest negative to larger and larger negative.       In the
 case of s=0 the positive and negative roots are equal, unequal
 in all other cases (s: 1, s=2, &c.).
    15. For the convergency of the series in (50) and (51) it is
 necessary and su<U+FB02>icient (§ 9) that there be no root, real or
 imaginary, of         7:0
                        whose absolute magnitude is less than that
 of the absolutely greater of the two quantities p! and a”. But
 it is only when, with algebraic signs taken into account, there
 is a real root actually between a' and                ,u,”
                                                    to say, when  is

 all of these functions should be discontinuous in this case                                     is
 obvious:       the sea’s depth being zero along any parallel of
 latitude limits the physical problem to the side on which the
 depth    is  positive, or (case of equal roots of 7:0) separates the
 problem into two independent ones, to <U+FB01>nd the motions of the
 water on the two sides of      a   reef just “ awash.”        An imaginary

      XLV.      Remarks on     Mr. Croll’s “ Crucial-Test” Argument.

       HE      con<U+FB01>dence with which Mr. Croll asserts, in his recent
                                ‘

        a
           “   crucial test
                             ” of   the Wind  and Gravitation Theories of
 Oceanic Circulation, is not unlikely to mislead those who suppose
 that because Mr. Croll is an expert Arithmetician, he is to be
 equally trusted as an authority in Physics.
     I protest, in the <U+FB01>rst place, against his putting the two doc
*trines in antagonism.            I  no more believe that the vertical Ther
 mal circulation       can   explain all the facts of Ocean temperature,
 than that the horizontal Wind circulation is alone competent
*»to account for them.           The two circulations are not only compa
 tible, but mutually complementary;              and as  I    have so treated
 them in- all that      I   have written on the subject during the last
 <U+FB01>ve years, it is scarcely fair in Mr. Croll to ignore the fact that
 I  have explicitly recognized the modifying in<U+FB02>uence of the Wind
 circulation in the temperature of the North Atlantic, and also in
 that local peculiarity of the North Paci<U+FB01>c surface-temperature to
 which he specially directs attention as opposed to my views.
 How the vast and deep basin of the North Paci<U+FB01>c comes to be
 nearly <U+FB01>lled with glacial water in any other way than by gravi
tation, .Mr. Croll does not attempt to explain.                 I haVe clearly
 proved, by the example of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea,
 that depth per se has no in<U+FB02>uence on temperature, and that the
deepest water in any =locality will not \be colder than the iso
 chéimal of the locality unless it have <U+FB02>owed thither from a
                                                                         colder

   Dr. Carpenter    on Mr. Croll’s “Crucial-Test” Argument.        403
area.     That in the latitude of the Mediterranean the thermal
condition    of the North Paci<U+FB01>c should be totally different, can
only (as it seems to me) be accounted for by its free communica
tion with the Antarctic area; for the Mediterranean is no more
warmed by wind-currents than the North Paci<U+FB01>c, the Gibraltar
in<U+FB02>ow (as my own observations demonstrate) being much colder
than either the surface-water of the Atlantic outside the Strait,
or the Mediterranean water within.
    If  he could prove, as he asserts, that the Gravitation theory
makes water run up hill, this would doubtless be conclusive
against it.     But his asserted proof rests on an assumption which
is a mere petitio principii—that of the equilibrium of the North
Atlantic and the Equatorial columns—without which assump
tion no computation of their relative temperatures can possibly
make out the North Atlantic column to have a higher level
than the Equatorial.
    But further, even if their equilibrium were admitted, there is
a countervailing condition of which Mr. Croll does not seem to
have taken any account, viz. the inferior salinity of Equatorial
water, which will make a difference in the opposite direction of
about 1 foot in 1026, thus neutralizing Mr. Croll’s excess of 312‘
feet in a column of only 600 fathoms depth.                       _
  - Again, Mr. Croll’s assertion thatthe Gravitation
                                                        theoryrequires
a higher level for Equatorial water, rests upon the doctrine of the
 ‘F gradients”    necessary to keep water in motion, which theory
 and experience alike contradict.       The researches of which Mr.
 Froude gave an account at the Bristol Meeting of the British
 Association, show that water is so nearly a “perfect <U+FB02>uid,” that
 its “ viscosity ” may be practically disregarded when the question
 is one of the movement of water upon itself, not over solid sur
 faces.    And they thus con<U+FB01>rm the position          I have all along
 maintained, that a slow vertical circulation will be kept up_
through the whole length of a basin <U+FB01>lled with water that isv
 continuously subjected to surface-cold at one end and to surface
 heat at the other, without any appreciable difference of level be
 tween the two extremities.       As an instance of the slight differ
 ence in sp. gr. which will suf<U+FB01>ce to maintain such a movement,
 Mr. Froude informed me that in an extensive examination of bar
 bours, lochs, <U+FB01>ords, &c. he had found that a very small dilution of
 their contents by fresh water is suf<U+FB01>cient to produce an inward
 under<U+FB02>ow of sea-water, tending to restore the disturbed equili
 brium._
     The doctrine of a vertical Thermal circulation was <U+FB01>rst put
  forward by Lenz (well known to his contemporaries as a most
  able physicist) nearly thirty years ago, as the only one which would
  account for the phenomena of Deep-sea temperature ascertained

by  Pouillet and Arago;   and, though   put aside for the doctrine
of a uniform Deep-sea temperature of 39°, supposed to have been
established by the observations of D’Urville and Sir James ltoss,
it was <U+FB01>nally accepted explicitly by Sir John Herschel. Sir
Airy, in his Presidential Address for 1872, spoke of it as “certain
in theory and supported by observation.”        And Sir \Yilharn
Thomson, who has kindly allowed me on various occasions to
appeal to his profound mastery of the subject as a test of the
correctness of my own conclusions, most emphatically stated in
the Geographical   Section at Bristol, after hearing Mr. Croll’s
Paper and my reply to      that the doctrine “is not
                                it,                    matter of      a
argument, but of irrefragable demonstration.”

Until indorsed  some competent physical authority, Isubmit that
                    by
it rests on no better basis than his own inadmissible assumption,
which, as can be easily shown (see ‘Nature,’ Oct. 21), would
make the demonstrated inward nnder<U+FB02>ow of [Egean water in the.

     N   aNote recently published in your Magazine (September
     1875), Mr. 11. A. Rowland points out an error in Kohl
rausch’s determination of the Siemens unit of resistance, and
expects that      will account for the difference between Kohl
                  it
1'ausch’s result and that ofthe Committee on Electrical Standards.
   The correction, arising from self-induction of the circuit in
Kohlransch’s experiments, does indeed tend to reconcile the two,

results ; but it is far less considerable than Mr. Rowland seems
to expect.     More than a year ago, while reading (in Maxwell’s
‘                            ii.
  Electricity,’ vol.        361) the exact theory of VVebcr’s method,

          is an explanation of the Geological—Survey    Map of London
THIS
 ,and its      environs, and of the Geological Model of London inthe
Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, London.                The
map was one of the special geological maps. instituted by the late
Director—General SirR.I.Murchison, showing the super<U+FB01>cial gravels,
sands, loams, peat, &c., which arefusually ignored in common geolo—
gical maps, but are really of great importance to the agriculturist,
horticulturist,    and house-occupier, and to the constructors of
houses and other buildings, docks, canals, sewers, and surface-drains.
The model—one of the <U+FB01>nest and most accurate ever made—has a.
horizontal scale of 6 inches to the mile; and, having a. length of about
15 miles E. and W. and a. breadth of about 11 miles N. and S., re—
presents an area, in and around London of about 165 square miles.
This is divided into nine four-sided masses of unequal size, bounded
by lines known to aiford sections from wells and borings.        Five of
those portions can be raised by machinery, worked by a handle, so as
to bring up and show the sections along the inner sides of each. The
vertical scale was necessarily exaggerated, and is about 4'4 times
as large as the horizontal; but this does not appear excessive.      This
model was successfully made under the superintendence of Messrs.
Whitaker, Jordan, and Brion, and placed in the Museum in 1873.

    Of the lowermost strata found by the deep boring (1302 feet) at
 Kentish Town, in 1853, the lowest 188 feet consisted of clays,
 sands, sandstones, and conglomerates, mostly reddish, which have
 puzzled geologists, but at all events indicate
                                              a  deep-seated range of
 older rocks covered by the Lower Cretaceous deposits in a different
 condition and of different structure frOm that of the Lower Green
 sand on the north and south of the London area.        At Harwich   a
 boring, 1070 feet deep, also penetrated the Cretaceous rocks, and
pierced 44% feet into Lower Carboniferous (Posidonomya) rock.
 In relation to these facts, Mr. Whitaker truly observes at p. 16 :—
    “One of the most striking pieces of theoretical geology, or of
 philosophical inference from observed facts,is Mr. Godwin-Austen’s
 argument that the two exposures of the older rocks in the Ardennes
 (Belgium) and in our own Mendip Hills (Somerset) are parts of
 one. great axis or line of elevation, and that they are most likely
 connected underground by     a    hidden range of those older rocks
 nearly along    the  valley of the   Thames and the Wealden eleva
 tion—an important conclusion that was to great extent veri<U+FB01>ed
                                              a
 by the sinking of the Harwich well, and also by the doubtful nature,
 of the bottom beds in the Kentish-Town well. Although the fur
 ther argument, that veritable Coal-measures may occur along the
 lines indicated has not yet passed out of the domain of inference,
  and though, should beds occur, we cannot be certain they would
 contain workable coal, yet geologists are fully justi<U+FB01>ed in pointing
 to the whole chain of reasoning as one that shows how pure science

 may have a direct bearing on questions of the highest importance

    Many points of interest to the geologist, whether tyro or ad
 vanced, occur throughout this memoir.       The mistaken notion that
 half-taught students get of the so-ca-lled London “Basin” is held
 up to caution (p. 3), and the relation of this synclinal trough to the
 saddle—back of the Weald, and the hollow fold of the Hampshire
 area is noticed (p. 69), as well as the subordinate <U+FB01>exnres and faults
 at Windsor, Deptford, and Pur<U+FB01>eet (pp. 21 and 70), like that at
 Portsdown (we may add), though smaller, and others, which may
 affect the well-being of the proposed Channel Tunnel.        The sub
 terranean erosion of the Chalk by acidulated waters is noticed at
 pp. 25, 26. The nature of <U+FB02>int is referred to atp. 19 ; but not-hing
satisfactory or new is advanced ; and the very probable theory of
pseudomorphism of silica after limestone is not noticed, though
applicable even to the so-called vein—<U+FB02>int, where on both sides of
a. <U+FB01>ssure the chalk itself, with some of its fossils, is changed   into
<U+FB02>int, as in the nodules themselves.
    This admirably concise and useful memoir ends with a well—
 written page or two on “ Denudation, its nature and e<U+FB01>ects.” But
 we must be allowed to doubt whether the denudation, or surface
sculpture, of the London district has been wholly worked out by
 rain and rivers.    It was not so very long ago, geologically speak—
 ing, that a‘wide: expanse of shallow waters (whether marine, estu
 arine, or freshwater, is not yet clear) left banks and shoals and
 wide areas of gravel, sand, and loam spread out over all the district
 from Chalk-range to Chalk-range (referred to at p. 57). These
 shallow waters must have retreated, slowly or rapidly, uniformly or
 by <U+FB01>ts and starts ; and both river-currents and retreating tides leave
 valley-furrows on deserted shoals and banks of mud and shingle.
 Hence it would be strange indeed if the gravels, clays, and sands
 of this district, so near the present level of the sea and connected
 with British ground that has subsided even 1000 feet below the
 Glacial Sea and risen again, should not have been worn by the re—
 treating sea into valleys of drainage which have since been widened
 out and eaten further back by snow and ice and rain and rivers.
     For all who wish to understand the geology of London and
 its neighbourhood, the map, the model, and the memoir are in
 dispensable; and an intelligent interest, indeed a philosophic life,
 is imparted to the dry details of descriptive geology by the com
 Prehensive and well directed knowledge of the talented author of
the memoir.

rl‘HE l.  “ On the Femur of Oryptosaurus eumerus (Seeley), a Dinosaur
from the Oxford Clay of Great Gransdon.”                By Harry Govier
Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F .G.S., Professor of Physical Geography in the
Bedford College, London.                              .                .
   The author described this femur as showing a slight forward bend
in the lower third of the shaft, and as having the terminal portions
wider in proportion to the length of the bone than in any described
Dinosaurian genus.       He pointed out its differences from the cor—
responding bone in Megalosaurus, Igimnodon, and other genera.
The length of the femur was stated to be about 1 foot.
   2. “ On the Succession      of the Ancient Rocks in the vicinity of
St. David’s, Pcmbrokeshire, with special reference to those of the
Arenig and Llandeilo groups and their fossil contents.” By Henry
Hicks, F.G.S.                                    -
   In   the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper the author described the general
succession of the rocks in the neighbourhood of St. David’s from the
base of the Cambrian to the top of the Tremadoc group, and showed
that they there form an unbroken series.           The only break or un
conformity recognized is at the base of the Cambrian series, where
rocks of that age rest on the edges of beds belonging to a prac
Cambrian ridge.
   In the second part the author gave a minute description of the
rocks, comparing the Arenig and Llandeilo groups, as seen in Pom
brokeshire with each other, and also with those known in other
Welsh areas.
   Each group he divided into three subgroups, chie<U+FB02>y by the fossil
zones found in them.
    1. The Lower Arenig was stated to consist of a series of black
       slates about 1000 feet thick, and to be characterized chie<U+FB02>y
       by a great abundance of dendroid graptolites.
   2. Middle Arenig.       A series of <U+FB02>ags and slates, about 1500 feet
       thick, and with the following fossils—Ogygia scutatrz'x, 0.1m!
       tatu, Ampg/rc Salter-i, &c.
   3. Upper Arem'g.       A series of slates, about 1500 feet in thick
       ness, only recently worked out, and found to contain a large
       number of new and very interesting fossils belonging; to the
       following genera—viz. lllwnus, Illenopsis, Placqpaaia, Bar
      'randia, &c.
   4. Lower Llandeilo.        A series of slates and interbedded ash,
       equivalent to the lowest beds in the Llandeilo and Builth dis

410                       Geological Society    .-
       tricts, and containing species of Eglina, Ogygia, Trinucleus,
       and the well-known graptolites Didymograptus Murchisoni and
       Diplograptus foliaceus, &c.
    5. Middle Llandeilo.      Calcareous slates and <U+FB02>ags with the fossils
       Asaphus tyrannus, Trinncleus Lloydii, Calymene cambrensis, &c.
    6. Upper Llandeilo.       Black slates and <U+FB02>ags, with the fossils
       Ogygia Buchii, Trinucleus<U+FB01>mbriatus, &c.
   The Arenig series was <U+FB01>rst recognized in North Wales by Prof.
Scdgwick about the year 1843, and was then discussed by him in
papers presented to the Society.       The Llandeilo series was discovered
by   Sir R.  Murchison  previously  in the Llandeilo district; but its posi
tion in the succession was not made out until about 1844. The Goo
logical Survey have invariably included the Arenig in the Llandeilo
group; but it was now shown that this occurred entirely from a
mistaken idea as to the relative position of the two series, which
were now shown to be entirely distinct groups, the equivalents of
both groups being present in Carnarvonshire, Shropshire, and_Pem
brokeshire, but the Llandeilo group only of the two being developed
in  Carmar'thenshire.
   The lines of division in the series were said to be strongest at the
top of the Menevian group and at the top of the Tremadoc group, these
lines being palaeontologieal breaks only, and not the result of un
conformities in the strata.

   1. “ Descriptions of the Graptolites of the Arenig and Llandeilo
Rocks of St. David’s.” By John Hopkinson, Esq, F.G.S., and
Charles Lapworth, Esq., F .G.S.
   Commencing with a. brief historical account of the discovery of
Graptolites in the neighbourhood of St. David’s, from their <U+FB01>rst
discovery in the Llandeilo series in 1841 by Sir Henry De la Bechc
and Professor Ramsay, the authors proceeded to explain their views
on the classi<U+FB01>cation of the Graptolites (Guarromrnma,              Bronn),
which they place under the order Hydroicla, dividing them into two
groups :—Raannornona         (Allmau), comprising the true sieulate or
virgulate Graptolites, which they consider to have been free or
ganisms; and Cmnornona (Hopkinson), comprising the dendroid
Graptolites and their allies, which were almost certainly <U+FB01>xed, and
are most nearly allied to the recent Theoaphora.                         —
   The distribution of the genera and species in the Arenig and
Llandeilo rocks of St. David’s was then treated 0f ; and the different
assemblages of species in each of their subdivisions were compared
with those of other areas.
   The Arenig rocks are seen to contain a number of species which
ally them more closely to the Quebec group of Canada than to any
other series of rocks, all their subdivisions containing Quebec
species;    while the Skiddaw Slates, which before the discovery 'of
Graptolites in the Lower Arenig rocks of Ramsey Island in 1872

   Mr. H. E. Blanford onthe Plantibearing Series of India.           411*
were considered to be our oldest Graptolite-bearing rocks, can only
be correlated with the Middle and Upper Arenigs of St. David’s.
The Graptolites of the Arenig rocks of Shropshire and of more dis
tant   localities were also compared with those of St. David’s.
  '
    In the Llandeilo series of this district the Cladophora have now
for the <U+FB01>rst time been found,-—a fewspecies, with several species of
Rhabdophora, occurring at Abereiddy Bay in the Lower Llandeilo,
which alone has been carefully worked—there being much more to be
done in the Middle and Upper Llandeilo, from which very few species

of Graptolites have as yet been obtained.
     Some  of  the recently introduced terms, and altered or more de<U+FB01>nite
terminology, employed in the descriptions of the species were then
explained; and the paper concluded with descriptions of all the
species of Graptolites, collected in the Arenig and Llandeilo rocks of
St. David’s within the last few years, of which suf<U+FB01>ciently perfect
 specimens have been obtained, doubtful species being referred to in
 an appendix.
    Forty-two species were described, belonging to the following genera:
 -—Didymogra1)tus,      Tetragraptus, C'lemagraptus (gen. nov.), Dicellos
graptus, Olimacograptus, Diplograptus, Phyllograptus, Glossograptus,
 and Tn'gonograptus (Rhabdophora);           Ptilograptus, Dendrograptus,
 Callograptus, and Dictyograptus(01adophora).
     2. “ On the Age and Correlations of the Plant-bearing series of,
 India, and the former existence of an Indo-Oocanic Continent.” By
 H. F. Blanford, Esq, F.G.S.                                               .
     In this    paper the author showed that the plant-bearing series of
 India   ranges from early Permian to the latest Jurassic times, indi
 cating that, with few and local exceptions, land and freshwater con
 ditions had prevailed uninterruptedly over its area during this long
 lapse of time, and perhaps even from an earlier period.           In the
 early Permian there is evidence, in the shape of boulder-beds and
 breccias    underlying the lowest beds of the Talchir group, of a pre
 valence of cold climate down to low latitudes in India, and, as the
  observations of geologists in South Africa and Australia would seem
  to show, in both hemispheres simultaneously. -With the decrease of
  cold the author believed the <U+FB02>ora and Reptilian fauna of Permian
  times were diffused to Africa, India, and perhaps Australia ; or the
  <U+FB02>ora. may have existed somewhat earlier in Australia, and have
  been diffused thence.      The evidence he thought showed that during
  the Permian epoch India, South Africa, and Australia were con
  nected by an Indo-oceanic continent, and that the <U+FB01>rst two re
  mained so connected, with at the utmost some short intervals, up to
  the end of the Miocene period.       During the latter part of the time
  this continent was also connected with Malayana.         The position of
  the connecting land was said to be indicated by the range of coral
  reefs and banks that now exists between the Arabian Sea and West
  Africa.     Up to the end of the Nummulitic epoch, except perhaps
  for short periods, no direct connexion existed between India and
  Western Asia.

     1. “ On the Kimmeridge Clay of England.”            By the Rev. J. F.
Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
    The author described in considerable detail the development of the
Kimmeridge Clay in 'various parts of England, dwelling especially
upon the palaeontological phenomena presented by it in the different
localities. He arrived at the conclusion that the Kimmeridge Clay
in England is divisible only into two sections, Upper and Lower;
but when it is preceded by the Coral Rag, it possesses a basal series
of no great thickness, which may be designated the Kimmeridgo
Passage-beds.        He compared his Upper Kimmeridge with the lower
part of the “.Virgulien” of foreign authors.          It consists of paper
shales, paper slabs, bituminous shales, and cement stones, with
interstrati<U+FB01>ed clays, and may attain a thickness of at least 650 feet.
Its fauna is characterized by paucity of species and great abundance
of individuals.       It is thickest in Dorsetshire and Lincolnshire, but
thin or absent in-the inland counties. The author stated that no Fauna
comparable with that of the Middle Kimmeridge or
                                                           “ Pte'rocérien ” a
has been discovered in England, though some of its less-charac
teristic fossils occur associated with Lower-Kimmeridge forms. The
Lower Kimmeridge is a mass of blue or sandy clay, with numerous
calcareous
               “ doggers,” largely developed in Lincolnshire, the whole
                      “
representing the Astartien” of foreign geologists. Its thickness is
estimated at from 300 to 500 feet in Ringstead Bay, and about 400
feet in Lincolnshire.       The fossils of the Coral Rag extend up into
the Kimmeridge passage—beds, which are typically developed at Wey—
mouth, where they are about 20 feet thick.
    2. “ Note on Pelobatochelys Blakei and other Vertebrate Fossils

Harry Govier        Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S., Professor of Physical
Geography in       the Bedford College, London.
    The author stated the fossils referred to in his paper gave evidence
of three species of Ichthyosanrns (one larger than any previously
known to occur in the formation), a Pliosanrus, a Stereosanmts, a
small Ornithosaurian, and a species of Chelonian,'which he described
under the name of Pelobatochelys Blalrei.            The remains of this
animal indicated a. carapace 16 inches long by 14 inches broad, and
angularly arched posteriorly.          The pygal scute was divided as in
 Emys; and the hinder margins of the vertebral scutcs Were elevated
as in some species of Batagur.           The vertical scutes were nearly
twice as broad as long, and interlaced with each other by sawlike
margins. The costal plates were imperfectly ossi<U+FB01>ed.
   3.     “ On the Cambridge Gault and Greensand.”        By A. J. Jukcs
Browne, Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper has for its object to determine the true position of the       -
Cambrige nodule-bed in the Cretaceous series, and to investigate
                                                             '     ‘
                                                                        the
nature and origin of its peculiar fauna.

Mr.    J ukcs-Browne    on the Cambridge   Gault and Greensand.     413
    The <U+FB01>rst part of the paper deals with the stratigraphical relations
of the beds; and the author calls attention to the fact that in the
numerous arti<U+FB01>cial sections near Cambridge only two formations are
really visible, viz. the Chalk Marl with a pebble-bed of phosphatic
nodules at the base, and the stiff dark clay of the Gault, upon which
these rest.
    The so-called Greensand or nodule-bed passes up into the Chalk
Marl, but rests unconformahly on the Gault below, which presents in
fact a smface of erosion'; and there is therefore a break of inde<U+FB01>nite
length between the Cambridge Gault and Greensand.
    The nodule-bed continues to present much the same characters
and fossils through Bedfordshire as far as Sharpenhoe, a village
about 3 miles east of Harlington, on the Midland Railway. Here is
situated the most westerly coprolite pit or working in the Cambridge
beds ; and beyond this the Gault passes into Chalk Marl without any
such seam intervening.
    It is not until we enter Buckinghamshire and reach Buekland
near Tring, that any thing like true Upper Greensand appears, and
separates the Chalk Marl from the Gault.       From this point westward
the formation increases in thickness and importance; but its cha
 racters and fossils are quite different from those of the Cambridge
 Greensand.                                 -
    Although in Bucks no coprolites are found betWeen the Gault and
 Greensand, yet they occur in the Gault itself; and one bed may be
 traced towards the N.E., and is found to commence where the Cam
 bridge nodule-bed ends, thereby raising the presumption that it
 becomes con<U+FB02>uent with that bed, and has furnished many of the
 well-known fossils and nodules it contains.
     A consideration of these facts warrants the following general
 conclusions :—
     I. That the Cambridge Greensand or nodule-bed has no con—
        nexion with the Upper Greensand, its actual position being at
        the base of the true Chalk Marl.
     II. That the same bed rests unconformably on the clay below,
        and that its coprolites and fossils have been derived ’ from the
                          '
         Gault.
     III.   That in consequence of this erosion a great gap now exists in
        Cambridgeshire between the Lower Gault and the Chalk Marl,
         the whole of the Upper Gault and Upper Greensand           being'
         absent.
     The palaeontological evidence leads to exactly the same con.
  clusions. The fauna is divisible into 2 groups; and the fossils
  belonging to the one are preserved in dark phosphate, and being
  generally waterworn are clearly derived forms, while the others are
  of lighter colour and belong to the deposit. The former group is
  chie<U+FB02>y composed of Gault species, 70 per cent. of which belong to
  the upper stage of that formation; while the fossils proper to the
  deposit are also found in the Chalk Marl above.
      The author therefore feels justi<U+FB01>ed in concluding that strati
  graphically the bed is Chalk Marl, while palaeontologically considered
  its fauna is mainly derived from the Upper Gault.

  practically pure oxide of zinc, which,          I am informed by Dr. Percy,
  is well known as a crystallized blast—furnace product.
         An analysis gave 100'13 per cent. ZnO, with a trace of Ala 05
  and Fe2 03, possibly due to adherent particles of the brick which
                    “
  formed the gangue.”
         The crystals are yellow and greenish yellow in colour, transpa
  rent to translucent, and belong to the hexagonal system, the fol
  lowing forms being noticed :—

              METAL     (GALLIUM).       BY LECOQ DE BOISBAUDRAN.
         The day before yesterday (August 27, 1875)          I   found some indi
   cations of the probable existence of a new element, in the products
   of the chemical examination of a blende from the Pierre<U+FB01>tte Mine,
   Valley of Argelés, Pyrenees.
         I have at present ascertained as follows :—
   _ (1) The oxide (or, perhaps,
                                          a subsalt) is precipitated after some
   time by metallic zinc in a solution containing chlorides and sul—
   phates. It does not appear to be the metal itself reduced by the
   zmc.
         (2) The chloride is precipitated by a small quantity of ammonia.
   'In a mixture containing excess of chloride of zinc the new substance
   is precipitated before the zinc when the liquid is treated with an in;
   suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of ammonia to throw down the latter.                  After
   the second precipitate the proportion becomes minute,       '       almost the
                                                                               '
  whole being found in the <U+FB01>rst fraction.
         (3) Even in conditions which must correspond to a state of per
   oxidation", the oxide is soluble in excess of ammonia.

excess of which       does not seem to redissolve perceptibly the su1—.
phide formed.                                      .
    (5)v The salts are precipitated by sulphydric acid in presence of
acetate of ammonia and much free acetic acid.             In the presence of
zinc the new body is concentrated in the <U+FB01>rst-deposited sulphides ;
it nevertheless required six successive precipitations to e<U+FB01>'ect the
 almost complete disappearance of the sulphide of zinc.
    (6) Sulphydric acid in solution slightly acidulated by chlorhydric
 acid does not precipitate the salts.                                     -
_-
    (7) The oxide redissolves in excess‘of carbonate of ammonia,
together with the zinc.
    (8) The extremely small quantity of substance at my disposal
 has not permitted the isolation of the new body from the ac
companying excess of zinc.            The few drops of chloride of zinc
in which      I have concentrated the new substance give, under the
 action of the electric spark*, a spectrum composed principally
 of a violet line, narrow, readily visible, situated nearly at 417
 on the scale of wave-lengths.          I   also perceived a very faint line
  towards 404.
      I   am pursuing this investigation, and hope in a few days to
 procure a little more of the old material, in order to determine
 the reactions of the new substance.

 sitting of the Academy, Sept. 29.]
    The experiments which         I have made since August 29 con<U+FB01>rm
 me in the notion that the substance noticed must be considered
 a new element, to which        I propose to give the name of Gallium.
     (9) The sulphide is really insoluble in excess of ‘sulphydrate of
                   ‘
 ammonia.
    (10) Although the quantity at my disposal is still very small,
 I  have obtained the chloride in such a state of concentration
 that the line 417 is suf<U+FB01>ciently bright under the action of the
 induction-spark.
     (11) The chloride gives the line 417 in the gas-<U+FB02>ame, but more
 feeble than with the electric spark exploding upon the solution.
    (12) The salts are readily precipitated, without heating, by
  carbonate of barium.

 the new substance is thrown down by sulphydrate of ammonia,

THEfor the production       of but a few of the spectra of the simple
substances and of their compounds; by far the greater number
of the elements are vaporized at temperatures which can only be
attained by means of the electric spark.           The employment of
spark-spectra    in analytical  research  cannot  be dispensed with in
those cases where a new element is sought for7 or where indubi
table proof is required of the presence of substances possessed of
properties so similar as to render uncertain their detection and
separation by ordinary reagents.        So many di<U+FB02>iculties, however,
stand in the way of the employment of spark-spectra, that this
important method of analysis has not as yet obtained a practical
recognition in chemical laboratories.         Means have been wanting
for the production at any time of spark-spectra with the same
ease as attends the formation of <U+FB02>ame-spectra ; the <U+FB01>rst part of
this paper will therefore be occupied with the description of a
battery and spark-apparatus which supply this want.           The non
existence of Tables of spectra suited to all practical requirements
is another dif<U+FB01>culty in the way of the employment of these
spectra.

the experiments upon which the measurements are based is
doubtful.     On attempting to reduce to a common scale the
spectra. obtained by different observers working with different
dispersive powers, different breadths of slit, now at high, now at
lower temperatures, Tables are obtained which are altogether
useless for laboratory purposes.     In order to obtain a sure stand
ing-ground, preliminary researches into the purity of the mate
rial employed for fundamental observations are necessary, inas
much as doubts about individual lines can only be set at rest
when it is known that the material employed is perfectly pure.
Graphic representations of spectra are valueless for practical work,
if every uncertainty with regard at least to the principal lines
is not removed. The methods employed in the following research
for the production of perfectly pure materials are, where it ap
peared necessary, discussed in detail.
                I. BATTERY    AND SPARK-APPARATUS.
    No one who is in the habit of using currents of great intensity
with temporary interruptions of days, weeks, or months, but must
have experienced much inconvenience from setting up, taking to
pieces, and cleaning the constant batteries which are ordinarily
employed.      So long as the production of spark-spectra continues
to involve such tedious and troublesome operations, it is not to
be expected that these spectra will be generally used in chemical
 laboratories; the battery about to be described (which is without
 clay cells) is designed to do away with these dif<U+FB01>culties.
     I have already shown that a mixture of potassium dichromate
 and sulphuric acid may advantageously replace the nitric acid of
 the carbon-zinc battery without clay cells.     More recently Leeson
 and Warrington have proposed to use this mixture in a battery
 with clay cells, in such proportions as shall ensure the production
 of chrome alum (by the action of the sulphuric acid upon the
 dichromate) and the solution of this salt in the water present.
 Such a liquid is produced by mixing together-—
          Potassium dichromate      .   .  .   .  1'33 part.
          Concentrated sulphuric acid      .   .  1'0    ,,
          Water    .   .  .  .  .   .   .   .  .  6'0 parts.
     This mixture, however, is not so advantageous in batteries
 without clay cells. According as the green di-acid or the blue
 tri-acid modi<U+FB01>cation of chromium oxide is produced, the electro
‘lytic decompositions which occur may be arranged in one or
 other of the following schemes, in which the original constituents
 are placed to the left, and the products of electrolytic decompo
Sition to the right :—

     It is evident that in the liquids and 2 the proportion be
  tween the constituents before and after decomposition remains
  unchanged until exhaustion of the battery, and that one of the
  primary conditions of a constant current is therefore ful<U+FB01>lled—
  but that, on the other hand, if Vl'arrington’s liquid be used with
  out clay cells, the original conditions of current-production are
  no longer present as soon as the consumption of dichromate has
  reached 57' per cent.           This waste, amounting to not less than
  43 per cent., is accompanied by a yet greater disadvantage, viz.the
  fact that the acids present at the close of the action are not suf
  <U+FB01>cient to form soluble salts with the bases.           Deposits are soon
  formed on the exciting plates, whereby a polarizing action is in
  duced which is attended with a diminution of the current.               It
  is not, therefore, to be wondered at that the use of VVarrington’s
'
  liquid in the chromic-acid battery without clay cells gives very
  unsatisfactory results. Inasmuch as theory does not point out the
  in<U+FB02>uence exercised upon current-production by the formation of
  the green or blue modi<U+FB01>cation of chromium oxide, nor tell the
  quantity of water to be added in order to ensure the best result,
  it appeared necessary to decide these points by experiment.
     Ten liquids were prepared by the successive addition of mea
  sured quantities of sulphuric acid to Warrington’s liquid; and
  from each of these, <U+FB01>ve liquids were prepared by the addition of
  increasing measured quantities of water.             In certain of these
  liquids, systematically chosen, there was plaCed a single pair
  formed of amalgamated zinc and carbon, having a tangent-gal

    This liquid does not, when used, give rise to the formation of
chrome alum ; in contact with zinc it is coloured green ; it dries
up to a crystalline mass, which consists of sulphates of chromium,
potassium, and zinc.         By boiling with a large quantity of water
a precipitate is formed having the composition 2Cr9 O8 . 3S08.
Zinc, even when impure, dissolves in this liquid without evolu
tion of gas and with an extremely bright surface*.
    In order to prepare 10 litres of this exciting liquid, 0'765
kilog. of commercial pulverized potassium dichromate (which
usually contains 3 per cent. of impurities) are added, with con
 stant stirring, to 0832 litre of sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1836;
when the production of chromic acid and potassium sulphate is
complete, 9'2 litres of water are poured, in a thin stream, into
the mixture.       The liquid thus becomes gradually warmer, and
the crystalline precipitate is entirely dissolved.          In the researches
 to be described, the exciter for this liquid consisted of a rod of
the densest gas-coal, 4 centims. broad and 1'3 centim. thick,
and a rolled zinc plate 41 centims. broad by 0'5 centim. thick, the
latter being covered with a <U+FB01>lm of wax, with the exception of the
 surface turned towards the coal rod; this surface was amalga
 mated. The zinc and coal were each immersed to a depth of 12
 centims. in the liquid.        The distance between the coal and zinc
 varied, according to circumstances, from 3 to 10millims. Rather
unsatisfactory results, as regards duration and constancy of cur
rent, are obtained with this liquid if cells are employed of the              -
 shape and size ordinarily used in Grove’s or the zinc-carbon bat
 tery.    This is accounted for by the fact that in the nitric acid
 of those batteries there is stored up a much larger quantity of
 oxygen, which may be used for depolarization, than in an equal
 weight of the chromic liquid, and that therefore a proportionately
 much larger quantity of the latter must be used in order to pro
 duce an equal effect.       The cells of the chromic-acid battery must
 therefore be of three or four times the capacity of those of Grove’s
 battery.    The best shape for these cells is that of high narrow
 cylinders, which extend over no greater surface than equally
 powerful elements of the ordinary clay cells.               The column of
liquid, containing about 1'6 litre, reaches to a height of 0'28
 metre, and has a diameter of 0088 metre.                The zinc-coal pair
 is immersed in the liquid to half its height only, and presents an

   shows a battery of four such elements.         If this battery be closed
   with a connecting wire of low conduction-resistance, the forma
   tion of a dark-coloured <U+FB01>lm of liquid, extending outwards from
   the dissolving zinc plate, is observed; this dark liquid gradually
   sinks, and at last collects, in the form of a well-de<U+FB01>ned layer, at
   the bottom of the glass cylinder.        The original liquid has a spe
   ci<U+FB01>c gravity of 1'140, while the liquid laden with zinc sulphate
   which collects at the bottom has a gravity of 1'272. While the
   latter liquid sinks gradually downwards, its place is continuously
   supplied by fresh quantities of liquid which have not undergone
   electrolysis ; constant circulation is hereby ensured, upon which
   the constancy of the current greatly depends.            ,
      Ihave not considered it super<U+FB02>uous to inquire how far the
   proportion of 1 equivalent of free chromic acid to 6 equivalents
   of free sulphuric acid is maintained in the liquid while under
   going exhaustion by electrolysis.         The exhaustion of the liquid
   was allowed to proceed until the absolute intensity of the current
   had diminished from 36 to 6 ; for this purpose the battery was
   closed by a connecting wire of not very great resistance during
   a period of fourteen days. The composition of the liquids, referred
   to an equal weight of hydrated sulphuric acid, was as follows

       If the electrolytic process occurs in the battery in the manner
   already supposed, then the following equations must nearly hold
   good :—e= 3c and 6b = a —~ (0 + 11+ 20) ; i. e. for every equivalent
   of reduced chromic acid (Cre 06) three equivalents of zinc are dis
   solved, and the proportion between the two acids yet combined
   with bases during electrolysis of the liquid remains nearly con
   stant.     That this is really the case appears from the following
   numbers :—
                     3c=0'850,                   66:0'268,
                       e: 0840,    a—  (e + d+ 2c) =0'297.
       If all   the bases present be supposed to be in combination with
   sulphuric acid, then the proportion of free sulphuric to free
   chromic acid is in the original liquid 1 : 0424, and in the nearly
   exhausted liquid 1 : 0'320.        In the last instance, the rather too
   small value actually found for chromic acid may be accounted for
   by the formation of a small quantity of mercurous chromate by

peroxide during electrolysis, as also uncertainty in reading-off
the position of the needle, were obviated by amalgamation and
subsequent heating of the platinum plates of the decomposition
cell, which contained only a few grammes of water, and, further,
by beginning to collect the mixed gases only after decomposition
had proceeded for ten minutes, by which time the current had
become perfectly regular.    The gases were collected, at a con
stant pressure, in a measuring-<U+FB02>ask over water previously satu
rated with the same gases.     After observation of the volume of
gas, the pressure, and the temperature, the measuring-<U+FB02>ask was
carefully removed from the water and weighed with the <U+FB01>lm of

  sooner with the carbon-zinc or with Grove’s than with the c'hr-ol-v H
  mic-acid battery, because the depolarization       much more com     is

  the fact that, on shaking the chromic liquid, the current which
  had become constant        considerably increased.

under the above conditions, apparent and not real.         Polarization
is therefore not prevented in the chromic battery to so great
an extent as in the Daniell or Grove battery ; and the conditions
on which equations (2) and (3) are based are not rigidly ful<U+FB01>lled
during the increasing exhaustion of the exciting <U+FB02>uid. The ex
traordinarily large value of e for the chromic battery cannot,
therefore, be received without doubt.        That this value, however,
is not due to errors of experiment is evident when we <U+FB01>nd
that an equally high value is derived from an estimation of the
electromotive force by Lipmann’ s electrometer in the unconnected
battery.      Experiment gave the proportion between the electro
motive force of the chromic battery and of Grove’s as follows :—

 The chromic battery was allowed to remain at rest for a little
time before the experiment.       A solution of potassium dichromate
 and sulphuric acid, in those proportions which we have seen to be
 the best, is possessed of considerably lower conduction-power
 than the sulphuric and nitric acids used in the Grove cell.       This
 disadvantage,      however,  is completely    counterbalanced   by the
 absence    of  the proportionally large conduction-resistance caused
 by the clay cells of the ordinary batteries, and by the small dis
 tance which may therefore be maintained between the exciting
 p lates.
     For the purpose of comparison, a couple, consisting of a coal
 rod and zinc plate (covered on the back with wax and amalga
 mated on the other side) was placed, <U+FB01>rst in a Grove’s battery
 with clay cells, and then in a chromic battery without clay cells—
 the distance between the carbon and zinc being 15 millims., and
 the surface exposed 400 square millims., in each case.
    The conduction-resistance of the two elements was as follows:—
            Grove’s battery with clay cells     .  =O'64OI B.A.
            Chromic battery without clay cells      =O'5575 2)
     That   a just view of the economical effect of the chromic bat
  tery may be attained, it will be necessary to examine somewhat
  closely into the chemical processes which take place in this bat
  tery.    In an unconnected freshly <U+FB01>lled Grove’s battery the zinc
  consumption is extremely small ; it is only when, after long use,
  an electrolytic and endosmotic exchange has been established
  between the exciting liquids, that a consumption of zinc inde
  pendent of the production of the current becomes marked.            In
  an unconnected chromic battery, on the other hand, the con
  sumption of zinc is the same as is required for current-produc
  tion in the connected battery.       In order to avoid this waste of

zinc, it is necessary that a form be given to the chromic battery
such as shall render possible the removal of the plates from the
liquid each time the current is broken. Especial interest attaches
itself to a comparison of the consumption of zinc during current
production with that which takes place in the unconnected bat
tery, not only from a practical but also from a theoretical point
of view, inasmuch as theory alone a<U+FB01>'ords no basis for deciding
the question whether zinc dissolved in the unconnected is partly,
wholly, or not at all used for current-production in the connected
batter .
    In Zrder to decide this question, two exactly similar elements
-—one connected and having a tangent-galvanometer in the cir
cuit, the other unconnected—were immersed to an equal depth
in the same chromic liquid; the quantities of zinc dissolved in
each case were then estimated at equal time-intervals, while the
current-intensity of the connected elements was determined every
<U+FB01>fteen minutes.       The results of these experiments are contained
in the following Table, where column I. contains the times of
observation in hours (1‘), column II. the corresponding current
intensities   J in BA. measurement, column         III. the zinc-con

    From columns III. and IV. it is evident that, under the con
ditions of the experiments, rather less than half of the quantity

of zinc theoretically required for current-production in the con
nected battery is dissolved in the battery when unconnected,
and that only a part of the metal dissolved in the latter case is
employed for current-production in the former.     These facts are
the more worthy of remark when it is remembered that the che
mical processes accompanying the solution of zinc are altogether
the same in the open as in the closed battery; in neither case
does polarization take place on the zinc plate.
   These facts are entirely in keeping with the view which regards
solution of zinc not as the cause, but as a necessary condition of
the current.    The numbers in column VI. express, in percent
ages of the total quantity of zinc dissolved per hour, the propor
tion of zinc lost,    1'.e. not used in current-production.        The
amount of zinc thus lost, amounting to about 22'5 per cent.,
remains tolerably‘ constant during the exhaustion of the battery.
The amount of nitric acid which passes through the clay cell of
the Grove or carbon-zinc battery             by

surface in contact with sulphuric acid diluted with <U+FB01>fteen times
its weight of water, the amount of zinc hourly lost amounted to
only 0'3 grm.    ; in practice this might be overlooked.       On the
other hand, the best-constructed batteries, made on the above
principles, when employed for the production of long-continued
currents, show    avery considerable consumption of zinc, depen
dent upon the Formation of the current, and brought about             by
the electrolytic carrying over of nitric acid.      In order to arrive
ata   knowledge   of the  amount   of zinc lost  in  these batteries as
compared with the loss in       chromic-acid battery,

                                                  a
zinc battery: the loss of weight in the voltameter, which was
connected with    a  calcium-chloride tube in order to keep back
water vapour, was determined after the mixed gases had been
replaced by dry air.       The level of the nitric acid in the clay
cells (which were new and of the best quality) stood somewhat
under that of the sulphuric acid in the zinc cells; the capacity
of the clay cells was 120 cubic centims., of the zinc cells 250
cubic centims., and the active amalgamated zinc surface encom
passing the clay cylinders extended to 156 square centimsi

While, therefore, in the chromic-acid battery, arranged as already
described, the loss of zinc averaged 22 per cent., in the nitric-acid
battery employed in these experiments the mean loss amounted
to 48 per cent.
   The economical superiority of the chromic battery for regular
work is con<U+FB01>rmed by the results obtained in practice.            I am
possessed of a battery of 40 pairs with an active zinc surface of
only 40 square centims. in each plate ; by a simple handle
arrangement the plates are immersed in and withdrawn from the
liquid when required.      This battery has served for all lecture ex
periments throughout eight semestres, during which time neither
the zinc plates, the covering of wax, nor the exciting liquid has
been renewed, nor have the conducting connexions been cleaned ;
it has only been necessary occasionally to bestow a few minutes’
labour upon the renewal of the amalgamation of the zinc plates,
and from time to time to replace the water lost by evaporation.
The apparatus, to this day, gives an electric arc between carbon
points—not, it is true, su<U+FB02>iciently steady for optical projection,
but perfectly serviceable for photochemical lecture experiments.
The currents obtained from this battery after four years’ use are
yet, and are likely for some time to remain, strong enough for
electrolytic demonstration, production of spark-spectra, decom
position of gases by induction-sparks, &c. I need scarcely repeat

        Prof. H. Bunsen’s Spectral-Analytical Researches.                             429
that effects of such magnitude can only be hoped for by paying
strict attention to the easily observed rule of never allowing the
pairs to remain in contact with the liquid one moment longer
than the conditions of the experiment absolutely require.
    In <U+FB01>g. 2 is shown the special disposition of the battery for
spark-production. The apparatus consists of four pairs fastened

the carbon points are sealed into glass tubes, which again so pass
into holes bored in the corks           d,
                                         d as to be easily turned on their
axes; the corks themselves are supported on glass rods so that
they may be moved up and down or turned upon their axes.
These various movements allow of the quick and exact disposi
tion of the carbon points before the slit of the spectroscope. The
 observation of the spark-spectra            carried out as follows :——The

 of which have been once for all set at the proper height,                  so       is
 adjusted    by  the  right  hand   that the  spectrum     coincides with  the
 scale in the telescope.        The spark, rendered more vivid          meansby

of an intercalated Leyden jar, is allowed to pass horizontally
across the perpendicular slit; the length of the spark between
two thick platinum points is from 1 to 2'ccntims.
    The carbon points, for the reception of the liquids to be tested,
are prepared from the ordinary, but not too porous, drawing
charcoal.   In order to render them conductors, a number of
small charcoal rods are placed in a covered porcelain crucible,
which is set in a larger clay crucible and completely surrounded
with charcoal powder; the crucibles are then exposed to the most
intense white heat for a considerable time.         The small rods are
now pointed by    means   of  a  lead-pencil—sharper; and the little
cones thus formed are cut off with a <U+FB01>ne watchmaker’s saw.            A
supply of these cones suf<U+FB01>cient for many years may be prepared
without dif<U+FB01>culty, inasmuch as one worker can easily make ready
<U+FB01>ve hundred in one day.       The silica, magnesia, manganese, iron,
potassium, sodium, and lithium which may be contained in the
points require to be removed; for this purpose about a thousand
of the points are repeatedly boiled in a platinum dish, <U+FB01>rst with
hydro<U+FB02>uoric acid, then with concentrated sulphuric acid followed
by concentrated nitric acid, and <U+FB01>nally with hydrochloric acid,
each acid being successively removed by boiling with water.         The
carbon points are ready for use as soon as a hole,~of the same
size as the platinum supports, has been bored in the base of each
by means of a <U+FB01>ne three-edged borer.          For each experiment new
carbon points are placed on the platinum supports.           The liquid
to be examined is brought on to the points by means of a small
capillary glass tube warmed, if necessary, by a small gas-<U+FB02>ame.
    A carbon cone weighs about 0015 grm., and can absorb more
than its own weight of liquid.       The spark-spectra obtained with
these cones are of long duration ; so that, if the cone be thoroughly
impregnated, a renewal of the liquid by means of the small ca
pillary tube will not be necessary for a considerable time.
    Carbon points saturated with liquids giving simple spark
 spectra, and also those liquids themselves, should be arranged in
 special small glasses, so that the normal spectra may be available
 at any time for comparison.
    The spectrum-apparatus which had served for our earlier ob
 servations* was used for the production of the spectra in these
 researches. A small mica plate which could be easily removed
 and cleaned was used as a protection to prevent particles of liquid
 from being carried into the slit.

LI.    On Maps of the World.       By GEORGE DARWIN,        M.A., Fel
                low of Trinity College, Cambridge*.
                              [With  a Plate]
                      stereegraphic projection of the world in two
THE        ordinary
       hemispheres    is utterly worthless as giving a true impres
sion of the whole; for the linear scale at the margins of the
circles is twice that at their centres.         Its only merit is that
there is no angular distortion.         Mereator’s projection gives a
still more fallacious impression, except as regards the equatorial
regions.
    It appears to me therefore that there is a want, in the school
room and lecture-room, of some map which shall give a more
truthful representation of the globe than the above, and which
yet shall not be so expensive and cumbrous as a globe.
   A gnomonic projection on to the faces of a regular icosahedron
is but very slightly distorted, although a slight amount of
angular distortion is here introduced.        I  have been told that at
the recent Geographical Congress at Paris, some such projec
tions as this were exhibited, and that they were of old date.
Mr. Proctor has also made star-maps by projection on to the
faces of a regular dodecahedron ; but in 1872, when the idea
occurred to me of using this projection, I was not aware of the
fact.
    If the icosahedral projection be developed and arranged as a
band of ten triangles round the equator, with saw-like edges of
<U+FB01>ve triangles in the north and <U+FB01>ve in the south, a very fair
representation    of the globe is given. And the interstices
between the teeth of the saws may be arranged so as not to
damage the continents very severely.
    In this map the meridians are straight lines, but are broken
in direction at the junction of two triangles.         The parallels of
latitude become ellipses, which may be easily laid out by aid of
a property    of conic sections; viz. if a circular cone be placed
with its vertex at the centre of a sphere, and a section made by
a tangent plane to the sphere, the radius of curvature at the
vertices of this conic section is constant for all tangent planes,
and varies as the tangent of the semiangle of the cone.
    Now in our map the ellipses are represented with suf<U+FB01>cient
accuracy by the circles of curvature at their vertices; and the
radii of these circles may be taken direct with the compasses
from a sector, as the cotangents of the corresponding latitudes.
   Besides a map of this kind,      I  have also constructed a portable
quasi-globe with    this  method    of  projection.   The faces of the
                    ,*

icosahedron are made to hinge together, so that the whole can
be packed <U+FB02>at in the form of a half-hexagon.          Such a globe
was exhibited at the British-Association Meeting at Bradford.
When mounted, the icosahedron circumscribed a sphere of
25 inches diameter.      This form of globe might doubtless be
constructed much cheaper than a truly spherical one, because
the framework would be ordinary carpentry, and the twenty map
sheets might be printed <U+FB02>at like ordinary maps.
    In 1872    I showed the above described maps and globe to
 General Strachey ,- and he suggested that by cutting down the
iscosahedron in some way, a still more satisfactory projection
 might 'be attained.   It then occurred to us that by truncating
 the solid angles of the icesahedron, a solid <U+FB01>gure of 32 faces
 would be obtained, viz. 2O hexagons and 12 pentagon.
    If the truncation be carried on by slices until the truncating
 planes touch the sphere enclosed in the icosahedron, these
 hexagons are not regular, but have two sets of three sides equal
 to one another; a long side is always opposite to a short side.
 If unity is the radius of the sphere, the long sides and short
 sides are respectively '4913 and “3401.        The pentagons are
 always regular ; and at this particular degree of truncation the
 side of the pentagon is '4913, and a pentagon is therefore
 always contiguous to the long side of a hexagon ; whilst hexagons
 are always contiguous along their hort sides*.
    This projection was utilized by having a sort of umbrella-like
 stand, with a pentagonal face in the middle, surrounded by
 <U+FB01>ve hexagons; or else with a hexagon in the middle, surrounded
 by three pentagons and by three hexagons.          The maps were
 drawn on 32 separate sheets ; and the sheets required to represent
 any part of the world were mounted on the umbrella.
     By these means about one <U+FB01>fth of the globe is shown at
 once; and thus the equivalent of a very large globe might be
 used in a room of ordinary size.          The sheets may also be
 conveniently kept, since they are all <U+FB02>at, and will lie one on
 another.
     The <U+FB01>gures 1, 2, 3, 4 (Plate      show the forms of the various
                                         I.)
  map-sheets, together with the <U+FB01>gures required for laying out the
  meridians and parallels of latitude.    Besides those kinds shown
  in the <U+FB01>gures, there are two pentagons which close in the two
  poles; but  it   so easy to lay them out, that
                   is                                 does not seem

    * This leads me to observe that  if the angles of any one of the regular
 solids be truncated in this way, another one   isultimately produced. The
 20-hedron and lQ-hedron, the 8-hedron and cube, and the tetrahedron and
 tetrahedron are thus correlated. This property        of course due to the fact
                                                      is
 that the polar reciprocal of any regular solid   itself a regular solid. It
                                                 is                           is
 curious to observe the transitional forms as the slices are cut off the angles.

                Mr. G. Darwin     on  Maps of the World.            433
  worth while to give a <U+FB01>gure.       The meridians 0n the equatorial
 faces converge so   little that it is more convenient to set them
 out by <U+FB01>nding two points through which they pass.          The broken
 lines in the <U+FB01>gures are merely constructional.
     In order that the meridians and lines of latitude may fall
 symmetrically on each face, it is better to set them every 9° or
 6°, instead of every 10 as is usually done.       For the whole globe,
 there are required 10 equatorial hexagons, 10 equatorial penta
 gons (5 in N. and 5 in S.), and 2 polar pentagons.
           32-faced <U+FB01>gure is a very close approximation          to the
 gI'lllhis
    o e.
    The Murchison Fund of the Geographical Society (£440) has
 been granted for carrying this scheme out practically; and a
 Committee has been appointed, of which General Strachey and
 Mr. Francis Galton are members. The scale is large, the poly
 hedron being designed to circumscribe a sphere of 10 feet
 diameter.     The various sheets of the map are stretched on light
 wooden frames ; and they can be hasped on to a kind of umbrella,
 of which the handle is held horizontal.        It is expected that it
~will be <U+FB01>nished shortly; and it will,      I believe, be placed in the
 rooms of the Society.
     Another somewhat similar plan has occurred to me, and
 seems to me preferable, at any rate for somewhat smaller globes
 than the one above referred to.
     Suppose A B C to be one face of a regular icosahedron
 inscribed in a sphere (see <U+FB01>g. 5), and that we bisect the arcs of
 great circles subtended by the sides A B, B C, C A respectively
 in D, E, F. Then pass a plane through D E F, and three others
 through A E F, B D F, C D E respectively.             The face A B C
 may    be replaced by  the equilateral triangle   D E  F and the three
 isosceles triangles AE F, B D F, C D E.          If this be done with
 every face of the icosahedron, we have a solid <U+FB01>gure of 80 faces—
 20 equilateral triangles, and 60 isosceles (but nearly equilateral)
 triangles—inscribed in the sphere. If we project the globe on
 to this surface, with the vertex of projection at the centre, we
 obtain an excellent approximation to the true globe.
     Now this plan would be very complicated if it were necessary
 to have 80 di<U+FB01>'erent map-sheets.          Fortunately, however, the
 form of the triangles makes it advantageous to have four sheets
 united together, viz. the equilateral triangle and the three
 isosceles ones which have replaced the face of the original
 icosahedron.
     Fig. 6 represents one of these sets of four sheets when spread
 out <U+FB01>at.     These four sheets may be printed from a single plate,
 and may be pasted on to quasi-triangles, such as A B C (<U+FB01>g. 6),
 which are hinged or creased along the lines D E, EF, FD.

If  the scale on which it is carried out is suf<U+FB01>ciently small to
permit of the faces being made of cardboard, it would,           I think,
answer very well.         We should then have to select the <U+FB01>ve
appropriate sheets (each comprising four faces) and mount them
on the umbrella stand; the <U+FB01>ve sheets would then represent one
quarter of the globe.
    The map-sheets may be kept in a very small compass, because
the isosceles triangles may be folded down over the equilateral
triangles, as shown in <U+FB01>g. ’7.
    In the other scheme it requires six or seven sheets to represent
nearly one <U+FB01>fth of the globe: but it has the countervailing ad
 vantage of permitting a greater choice of the region which is to
 be in the middle; for, by having two umbrella stands, we can
 either place a pentagon or a hexagon in the middle.
    In the instrument as made for the Geographical Society, the
 same general framework serves for both umbrellas, which may
 be shifted with great case.       It was this advantage in choice of
 the central region displayed which induced the Committee to
 prefer the original 32-faced polyhedron.
    A similar construction may of course be applied to a dodecahe-         >
 dron inscribed in a sphere ; and we thereby obtain a 7 2-faced sur
 face, viz. 12 pentagons, and 60 obtuse~angled       isosceles triangles.
 Here, as before, the map-sheets might be printed in sets of six,
 viz. a pentagon surrounded by <U+FB01>ve triangles; three map-sheets
 will then give one quarter of the globe.             In this <U+FB01>gure the
 pentagons are so large compared           with  the  triangles that the
 approximation to the sphere is not very close.
     Models of the various plans explained were exhibited at Brad
 ford ; but, by an oversight, no abstract of this paper appeared
 in the British-Association Report.
  LII.   On a new Vertical-Lantern Galvanometer. By GEORGE

  upon    the Gramme machine, a new form of demonstration
  galvanometcr was devised for the purpose, which has answered
  the object so well that it seems desirable to make some per
  manent record of its construction.
     Various plans have already been proposed for making visible
  to an audience the oscillations of a galvanometer-needle;            but
  they all seem to have certain inherent objections which have
  prevented them from coming into general use.                Perhaps the
  most common of these devices is that <U+FB01>rst used by Gauss in

 1827, and adopted subsequently by Poggendortf and by Weber,
which consists in attaching a mirror to the needle.             By this
means a beam of light may be re<U+FB02>ected to the zero-point of a
distant scale, and any de<U+FB02>ection of the needle made clearly
 evident.   The advantages of this method are z—lst, the motion
of the needle may be inde<U+FB01>nitely magni<U+FB01>ed by increasing the
distance of the scale, and this without impairing the delicacy of
the instrument; and, 2nd, the angular de<U+FB02>ection of the needle is
doubled by the re<U+FB02>ection.      These unquestioned advantages have
led to the adoption of this method of reading in the most
excellent galvanometers of Sir William Thomson.          While, there
fore, for purposes of research this method seems to leave very
little to be desired, yet for the purpose of lecture demonstration
 it has never come into very great favour—perhaps because the
adjustments are somewhat tedious to make, and because, when
made, the motion to the right or left of a spot' of light upon a
screen fails of its full signi<U+FB01>cance to an average audience.
    Another plan is that used by Prof. Tyndall in the lectures
which he gave in this country.        In principle it is identical with
that employed in the megascope: i. e. a graduated circle over
which the needle moves is strongly illuminated with the electric
light; and then by means of a lens a magni<U+FB01>ed image of both
circle and needle is formed on the screen. The insuf<U+FB01>cient illumil
nation given in this way, and the somewhat awkward arrangement
of the apparatus required, have prevented itsgeneral adoption.
    A much more satisfactory arrangement was described by
Professor Mayer in 1872*, in which he appears to have made
use, for the <U+FB01>rst time, of the excellent so-called vertical lantern
in galvanometry.      Upon the horizontal plane face of the com
densing lens of this vertical lantern, Mayer places a delicately
balanced magnetic needle ; and on each side of the lens, separated
by a distance equal to its diameter, is a <U+FB02>at spiral of square
copper wire, the axis of these spirals passing through the point
of suspension of the needle. A graduated circle is drawn or
photographed on the glass beneath the needle; and the image
of this, together with that of the needle itself, is projected on
the screen, enlarged to any desirable extent. The defect of this
apparatus, so excellent in many respects, seems to have been its
want of delicacy; for in the same paper the use of a <U+FB02>at
narrow coil, wound lengthwise about the needle, is recommended
as better for thermal       currents.    Moreover a year later, 'in
 1873+, Mayer described another galvanometer improvement,
entirely different in its character.      In this latter instrument,
the ordinary astatic galvanometer of Melloni was made use of,

an inverted scale being drawn on the inside of the shade, in
front of which traversed an index in the form of a small acute
rhomb, attached to a balanced arm transverse to the axis of sus
pension of the needle, and moving with it. The scale and index
were placed in front of the condensing lenses of an ordinary
 lantern ; and their images were projected on the screen in the
 usual way by use of the objective.               This instrument is essen
 tially the same in principle as the mirror-galvanometer ; but it
 cannot be as sensitive as the latter, while it is open to the same
 objection which we have brought against this—the objection of
 unintelligibility.      In the hands of so skilful an experimenter as
 Mayer,     it seems,  however,   to have worked admirably.
      It was a tacit conviction that none of the forms of apparatus
 now described would satisfactorily answer all the requirements
 of the lecture above referred to, that led to the devising of the
 galvanometer now to be described, which was constructed in
 February of the present year. Like the <U+FB01>rst galvanometer of
 Mayer, the vertical lantern, as improved by Morton*, forms the
 basis of the apparatus.        This vertical lantern, as constructed by
 George Wale St Co., at the Stevens Institute of Technology, as
 an attachment to the ordinary lantern, is shown in the annexed

Duboscq’s vertical attachment, which was advertised in his catalogue in
18_70, the arrangement is similar, except that the beam received upon the
mirror is a diverging one, and consequently the horizontal lens  isof shorter

light    the screen.

  beneath the object-glass, and thence down to the side pillar
  which supports this objective, where it is fastened by a bit of
  wax, to facilitate adjustment.       The needle itself is <U+FB01>xed to an
  aluminium wire, which passes down through openings drilled
  in the scale-glass, the horizontal lens, and the inclined mirror
  and which carries a second needle near its lower end*.               Sur
  rounding this lower needle is a circular coil of wire, having
  a cylindrical hollow core an inch in diameter, in which the
  needle swings, and a smaller opening transverse to this, through
  which the suspension wire passes.         In the apparatus already
  constructed (in which the upper needle is <U+FB01>ve centimetres long)
  the coil is composed of 100 feet of No. 14 copper wire, and has
  a resistance of 02% ohm.           The accompanying cr0ss section

 a b, which passes directly through the
 scale-glass D, the condensing lens E, and
 the inclined mirror F at H, and carries,
 near its lower end, the second needle I.
This needle is shorter (its length is 2'2
 centimetres) and heavier than the upper
 one, and moves in the core of the circular
 coil J, whose ends connect with the screw
cups at K.      This coil rests on the base of
 the lantern, enclosed in a suitable frame.        It is obvious that,
 when the instrument is so placed that the coil is in the plane of
 the magnetic meridian, any current passing through this coil
 will act on the lower needle ; and since both needles are attached
 to the same wire, both will be simultaneously and equally de
 <U+FB02>ected.     Upon the screen is seen only the graduated circle and
 the upper needle; all the other parts of the apparatus are
 either out of the <U+FB01>eld or out of focus.        Moreover the hole in
    * After the new galvanometer was completed and had been in use'
for several weeks, I observed, in re-reading Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst paper, a note
stating that the idea had occurred to him of using an astatic combination
consisting of two needles, one above the lens and the other below the
inclined mirror—the two being connected by a stiff wire passing through
holes in the condenser and the mirror.      The plan of placing the coil
round the lower needle does not seem to have suggested itself to him.
Indeed it does not appear that the arrangement he mentions was ever
carried into practical effect.

438                -   Dr. G. F. Barker       on a new
the lens is covered by the middle portion of the needle, and
hence is not visible.   The size of the image                is,
                                                    of course,                  ‘
determined by the distance of the galvanometer from the
screen;  in class experiments,    circle  feet in diameter

suf<U+FB01>cient—though in the lecture above referred to the circle
was 16 feet across, and the needle was 14 feet long, the <U+FB01>eld
being brilliant.
   The method of construction             which has now been described     is
evidently capable of producing    galvanometer for demonstra
                                          a
tion whose delicacy may" be determined at will, depending only
on the kind of work to be done with it.  In the <U+FB01>rst place, the
  needles may be made more or less perfectly astatic, and so freed
  more or less completely from the action of the earth’s mag
  netism, and consequently more or less sensitive.              Moreover an
  astatic system seems to be preferable to one in which damping
 magnets are used, since        it   is   freer from in<U+FB02>uence      by   local
 causes—though,        ifdesirable   for  a coarser  class  of  experiments,
 the considerable distance which separates the needles in this
 instrument allows the use of        a    damping magnet with either of
 them.      In the galvanometer now in use, the upper needle              is
 the stronger, and gives suf<U+FB01>cient directive tendency to the
 system to bring the de<U+FB02>ected needle back to zero quite promptly.
 In the experiments referred to below, the system made 25
 oscillations per minute.
      Secondly, the space beneath the mirror         is suf<U+FB01>ciently large to
 permit the use of      a coil of any needed size.          Since, therefore,
 the lower needle       entirely enclosed within the coil, the <U+FB01>eld of
                       is
 for-,ce within which   it moves may be made sensibly equal at all
 angles    of  de<U+FB02>ection,   as in the galvanometers of Sir William
 Thomson.       Hence    the   indications of the instrument may be
 made quantitative, at      least  within certain limits. The circular
 coil, too, has decided advantages over the <U+FB02>at coil, since the mass
 of wire, being nearer to the needle, produces more intense <U+FB01>eld.
                                                         a
 Were  it   desirable,  a double coil, containing an astatic combina
 tion, could be placed below the mirror, the upper needle in that
 case serving only as an index.          The instrument above described
has   a   coil
             3    inches   in   diameter    and  1  inch thick, the dia
 meter of the core being       1    inch.    Since its resistance   is  only
about  a   quarter of an ohm,   it   is
                                        intended   for  use  with circuits of
small resistance, such as thermo-currents and the like.
     The results of few experiments made with this new vertical
                    a
lantern galvanometer will illustrate the working of the instru
ment, and will demonstrate its delicacy.              The apparatus used
was not constructed especially for the purpose, but was             a   part
of the University collection.
     1. Induction-currents.—The galvanometer was connected with

                   Vertical-Lantern Galvanometer.               439
a coil   of covered copper wire, N0. 11 of the American wire
gauge, about 10 centimetres long and 6 in diameter, having
a resistance of 032?) ohm.       A small bar magnet, 5 centimetres
                                                                    -
long and weighing six and a half grammes, gave, when introduced
into the coil, a de<U+FB02>ection of 40°. On withdrawing the magnet
the needle moved 40° in the opposite direction.
   2. A small coil, 20 centimetres long and 3'5 in diameter,
made of No. 16 wire and having a resistance of 0371 ohm,
through which the current of a Grenet battery, exposing 4
square inches of zinc surface, was passing, was introduced into
the centre of a large wire coil, whose resistance was 0295, ohm,
connected with the galvanometcr.        The de<U+FB02>ection produced was
20°.     The same de<U+FB02>ection was observed on making and break
ing contact with the battery, the smaller coil remaining within
the larger.
   3. A coil of No. 14 copper wire, 60 centimetres in diameter,
and containing about 40 turns, the resistance of which was 0'85
ohm, was connected with the galvanometer, and placed on the
<U+FB02>oor.     Raising the south side 6 inches caused a de<U+FB02>ection of
4°.    Placing the coil with its plane vertical, a movement of 2
 centimetres to the right or left caused a de<U+FB02>ection of 3°, and of
20 centimetres of 10°.        A rotation of 90° gave a de<U+FB02>ection
of 12°, and one of 180° of 24°. These de<U+FB02>ections were of
 course due to currents generated by the earth’s magnetism.
   4. Thermo-currents.——Two pieces of No. 22 wire, 15 centi
metres long, were taken, the one of copper, the other of iron
wire, and united at one end by silver solder.         On connecting
the   other ends to the galvanometer,   the heat of the hand caused
 a de<U+FB02>ection of the needle of 20°.          -
    5. A thermo-pile of 25 pairs, each of bismuth and antimony,
 was connected to the instrument.         The heat from the hand
placed   at 5 centimetres  distance caused  a de<U+FB02>ection of 3°.
   6. Two cubes of boiling water acted differentially on the pile.
At the distance of 5 centimetres the de<U+FB02>ection was 20° ; moving
one to 10 centimetres, the de<U+FB02>ection was reduced to 5°.
    7. Voltaic current.—-—A drop of water was placed on a zinc
plate. .While one of the connecting copper wires touched the
zinc, the other was made to touch the water.          The de<U+FB02>ection
was 16°.
   The claim which is here made for the instrument, however,
is rather for the general principle of its construction than for
the advantages possessed by the individual galvanometer above
 described, which was constructed at short notice, to meet an
 emergency.     The Comparatively small cost for which it may be
<U+FB01>tted to the vertical lantern, the readiness with which it may be
brought into use, the brilliantly illuminated circle of light

which it gives upon the screen, with its graduated circle and
needle, the great range of delicacy which may be given to the
instrument by varying the coil and needles, so that all ex
perimental requirements may be answered, and, <U+FB01>nally, the
satisfactory character of its performance as a demonstration
galvanometer, all combine to justify the record which is here
made     of it.

the Number for February last (1875) will give means of refer

indicates a certain relation between two differential equations,

block by drill and <U+FB01>le at right angles to the plate-faces.         The
tunnel is concentric with the block ; its two sides are sensibly
plane and perpendicular to the long edges of the block; its <U+FB02>oor
 and roof are slightly rounded.         The length of the tunnel, or
 thickness of the plate, is gof an inch, its width (horizontal) g of
 an inch, and its height (vertical) about 5} of an inch, so that there
 is a good margin of polished plate-surface all round each month.
 This tunnel, with its mouths properly closed, forms the cell ,- it is
 usually charged with liquid through a <U+FB01>ne vertical boring which
  leads into it at the centre of the roof.
      The <U+FB01>ne borings for the induction-wires lie here, as they did
  in the dielectric of glass, midway between the plate-faces; but
  they are not now horizontal; they pass from the two upper cor
  ners of the block obliquely downwards, and enter the tunnel at
  the centres of its opposite sides.
      The induction-wires are of copper, and about 910- of an inch
  thick. Each wire is bent at about an inch from the end, and
   closely doubled upon itself, so as to present a very well-rounded
   extremity.     This end of the wire enters from the boring a little
   way into the tunnel.      At the outer end of the boring each wire
   is bent closely upon the block, and tied very <U+FB01>rmly along
   several inches of its length to the upper part of the adjacent
   pillar. The parts of the two wires within the tunnel are easily
   bent by pineers into proper form and position (virtually <U+FB01>xed),
   so as to project from the sides of the tunnel towards its centre,
   in one line parallel to the long edges of the block, and to about
   % of an inch from       each other.    To an eye looking straight
   through    the tunnel, the  induction-wires  appear single, with per
   fectly rounded ends, exact images of each other, lying in one
   horizontal line, and projecting equally far from the sides of the
   tunnel.
       Two small panes of plate glass, each about 2 inches square
    and T13 of an inch thick, and of the best quality obtainable in
    the glass-shops, are placed on opposite faces of the block, so as
    to close the mouths of the tunnel with a good margin of contact
    between plate-surfaces all round.       Outside of each plate is a
    square of india-rubber cloth of the same size.       Outside of the
    cloths are two sti<U+FB01>' planks, each 2 inches (horizontal) by 4 (ver
    tieal), which are connected above and below by nail and nut, so
    as to form a weak screw-press.      The cloths and planks are per

448              Dr.  J. Kerr on  a new Relation     between
forated as in prolongation of the tunnel, or rather a little more
widely, so as to allow distinct vision through the whole cell
along the length of the tunnel.           When the press is closed, the
cell is perfectly tight.     The surface of pillars and block is well
varnished with lac, except the spaces covered by the closing
plates, which are kept clean.          The outer ends of the borings,
where the wires leave the block, are well closed with sealing-wax.
    The cell is <U+FB01>lled with liquid either through the central
boring, already mentioned, or otherwise—more easily in many
cases through a partially closed mouth of the tunnel ; it is
easily emptied by unscrewing the press, and allowing the liquid
to run off upon one of the glass plates, loosened and properly
directed. The only inconvenience (and a very serious one) which
I  have noticed in the working of this piece, is the di<U+FB02>iculty
of cleaning the cell perfectly when charging it with a new
li uid.
  q26. General Form of the Experimenta—The                   plate-cell is
charged with clean liquid.         The electric force is obtained some
times from the inductorium, but generally from an electric ma
chine.      In the former case the wires from the cell are connected
with the terminals of the secondary coil ; in the latter case one
of the wires is inserted in the prime conductor, and the other is
connected with a good discharging train.              A horizontal beam
of light, emitted by a narrow paraf<U+FB01>n-<U+FB02>ame, passes <U+FB01>rst
through a polarizing Nicol, then through the plate of dielec
tri<U+FB01>ed liquid, and then through a second Nicol, which acts as an
analyzing eyepiece.       The eye is generally so placed as to see the
<U+FB02>ame through the centre of the cell, midway between the induc
tion-terminals.       The light traverses the liquid in a direction
perpendicular to the closing-plates of the cell, and therefore per
pendicular to the lines of electric force.
    It will be observed that the arrangements and procedure are
much the same as they were in the former experiments, with the
dielectric of plate glass.       The transparent dielectric is now a
plate  of  liquid ;  and the  electric  forces applied are much less in
tense ; but there is no other material change.
                          Bisulphia'e  of Carbon.
   27. The plate-cell is charged with bisulphide of carbon; the
wires from the cell are connected with the knobs of the secon
dary coil 5 and all the other arrangements are as indicated
above.      The compound plate of thin glasses and bisulphide
(placed   in  almost any light and towards any object) is as purely
transparent to the eye as so much air; and when it is intro
duced properly between the two Nicols at extinction, it gives not

                           Electricity and Light.                     449
 the faintest restoration, unless the closing plates are unduly
 strained by the screw press.
     The primary circuit is closed, and the spark-terminals, placed
 at <U+FB01>rst in contact with each other, are drawn apart slowly till
 sparks pass through the liquid in the cell.        The spark-terminals
 are then pushed a little nearer to each other, till the discharge
 passes wholly through the air; the primary circuit is broken,
 and the apparatus is ready for experiment.            To obtain a good
 observation, the liquid should be very clean, the room some
 what darkened, and the light due midway between the ter
 minals.
    Plane of polarization at 45° to the horizon or to the lines
 of force: as soon as the primary circuit is closed, there is a
very distinct <U+FB02>ickering restoration of the light in the polari
 scope, the <U+FB02>icker keeping time with the oscillations              of the
rheotome.      The cleaner the liquid plate, the more distinct is
the effect; and when the liquid is sensibly without speck, the
restoration of the whole image of the <U+FB02>ame from pure initial ex
tinction is admirably clear and delicate.
    Plane of polarization at 0°, or at 90° to lines of force : gene
rally a small effect in the polariscope, much fainter than in the
former case, and tending to evanescence as the angular ad
justments are improved throughout the part examined of the
electric <U+FB01>eld.
    This was the <U+FB01>rst successful observation which        I   made upon
any liquid    dielectric.    All  the  following experiments are with
 the electric machine.
    28. The plate machine employed is a small one, strong enough
 to send sparks through the liquid in the cell when it is worked
 vigorously.     It will be remembered that the prime conductor is
 connected with earth by a copper wire, which is interrupted in
 the polariscope by  11;  of an inch of carbon disulphide.
    The only dif<U+FB01>culty in these experiments         is  to get the liquid
 clean enough.      At the beginning of series of observations the
                                            a
 cellis  cleaned thoroughly, washed with alcohol or other proper
 solvent, and rinsed repeatedly with ether, no cloth or other
 rubber being applied.        The cell is   then charged with fresh bi
 sulphide, many times in succession     if    necessary, the liquid being
 introduced through        a <U+FB01>ltering-funnel which has had its tube
 drawn to  a   <U+FB01>ne end.     In this way specks of solid matter which
 are present in the liquid as obtained from the apothecaries,
  specks also of organic <U+FB01>bre or of other dust which would other
  wise enter from the surrounding air, are kept out of the cell.
  But even when all precautions are taken, <U+FB01>nd very dif<U+FB01>cult
                                                I        it
  to get the liquid specklessly clean.        In many cases, as soon as
  the electric force begins to act, specks of dust formerly invisible

150            Dr.  J.  Kerr  on a new Relation between
are attracted from the most distant          parts of the cell, and show
themselves at once about        the  centre  of the <U+FB01>eld, either as a set
of sparkling and irregularly moving points, or as a chain con
necting the terminals and remaining always bright in the polari
 scope.    But whatever the form which they assume, they inter
fere very materially with the principal effect, if they do not mask
it altogether.
    29. First experiment—The room well darkened ; the light a
 narrow <U+FB02>ame immediately in front of the <U+FB01>rst Nicol; the two
 Nicols about 4 feet apart; the dielectric about a foot from the
 eye.    Before extinction by rotation of the analyzer, the light is
 seen through the plate of liquid as a narrow and very well
 de<U+FB01>ned vertical band, midway between the terminals.
     Plane of polarization at 45° to the horizon.               When the
 prime   conductor    is  charged,  the  light  comes   out  in the polari
 scope steadily    and   very clearly from   pure  extinction.   WV hen the
 prime conductor is discharged by         a spark upon    the  knuckle, the
 restored light disappears instantly and totally.          When the light
 is again restored by electric action, and a compensating slip of
 glass is introduced and compressed horizontally, the light is
 either extinguished or greatly weakened; when the compen
 sator is extended horizontally, the light is always strengthened.
     With one gentle turn of the plate, the light comes out conti
 nuously from initial extinction til], at the end of the turn, it is
 very well restored: in this case the extinction by compression
 of the compensator parallel to the lines of force is perfect.
     With a strong electric action, with or without occasional
 sparks through the liquid, the light is much more strongly re
  stored: in this case, compression of the compensator parallel
  to lines of force does not act so regularly, never extinguishes the
 light all at a time, but produces generally a very dark broad
 band, approximately straight and horizontal, which descends
 from the outer parts of the electric <U+FB01>eld towards the centre as
 the compression increases.         This proves that the amount of hi
 refringent action varies considerably throughout the part exa
 mined of the electric <U+FB01>eld. In the black band itself, the actions
  of the dielectri<U+FB01>ed bisulphide and horizontally compressed glass
 compensate one another; at other equatorial points of the <U+FB01>eld
 one or the other action predominates—that of the glass outside
 of the dark band, that of the liquid inside.
     Plane of polarization at 0° or at 90° to lines of force.           One
 gentle turn of the plate has generally no sensible effect, but
 sometimes gives a barely perceptible restoration from perfect ex
 tinction. A strong electric force gives generallya clear restora
 tion from extinction 5 the effect, however, is not nearly so intense
  as in the case of 45°, and it tends to evanescence as the lines of

                        Electricity and Light.                    451
force are'more nearly parallel or perpendicular to the plane of
polarization throughout the part examined of the electric <U+FB01>eld.
     30. Second experiment—All the arrangements are as in the
<U+FB01>rst experiment, except that the optical pieces are brought as
close together as the stands will allow.     The dielectric is only a
few inches from the eye.       The light is large and strong, and
extends well above and below the level of the terminals.           All
the observations made in the <U+FB01>rst experiment are repeated, and
 with similar results.
     The dark band given by the compensator is now more notice
able, and more regular in its appearance and movements.
     If the liquid contains a few specks of dirt, this experiment
 succeeds better than the <U+FB01>rst, sometimes indeed gives a good
 result when the <U+FB01>rst fails altogether.     The solid particles gene
 rally arrange themselves as a chain    between    the terminals.   In
 the <U+FB01>rst experiment, the principal effect is obscured and often
 obliterated by the light from the chain; while in the second
 the light is generally well restored above and below the level of
 the terminals, the place of the chain being marked by a patch of
 more intense light, which is not affected by the compensator.
 In this experiment and the preceding, the dependence of inten
 sity of optical effect upon intensity of electric action is very ob
 servable.     When the insulation of the prime conductor is not
 very good, it requires little irregularity in the working of the
 machine to make the light clearly glow and fade again with each
 turn of the plate.
     31. Third and fourth ewperiments.—The <U+FB02>ame is turned
 broadside-on to the polariscope ; and a screen is placed close to
 the lamp, which reduces the light to a narrow horizontal band :
 the arrangements are otherwise as in the <U+FB01>rst and second expe
 riments.     The results obtained are consistent with those already
  described, and add little to them.              I
                                          But as would rather give
 too much here than too little,      I add the <U+FB01>nal note which was
 taken at the time of observation.
     The liquid very clean; the light reduced to a narrow and
  sharply de<U+FB01>ned horizontal band, encroached upon at both ends
  by the terminals; initial extinction in the polariscope perfect.
  At 45° one gentle turn of the plate gives a good restoration of
  the band from terminal to terminal, and the restored band is
  well extinguished by horizontal compression of the compensator:
  at 00 and at 90° the same electric force gives no sensible e<U+FB01>'ect
vwhatever.      When the electric action is intense, the effects are
  somewhat similar: at 45° the restored band is very well extin
  guished by horizontal compression of the compensatoryexcept at
  points quite close to the terminals ; at 0° and at 90° the wires are
  tipped each with a narrow band         light, the intermediate part

452            Dr.  J.  Kerr on a new Relation  between
 of the electric <U+FB01>eld remaining, dark.        Hardly in any case of
 strong electric action is there absolutely no perceptible restora
 tion of the band at the centre of the <U+FB01>eld; but the effect is
 always comparatively very faint at 0° and at 90°, unless the
 angular adjustments are very imperfect.
    32. Fifth experiment—The optical pieces close together, and
the <U+FB02>ame broadside-on t0 the polariscope.        The light now <U+FB01>lls
the transverse section of the <U+FB01>rst Nicol, and extends well beyond
 the interterminal part of the electric <U+FB01>eld all round.     When the
principal sections of the two Nicols are at right angles to each
 other, there is a good initial extinction between and around the
terminals.
    Plane of polarization at 45° to the horizon : the electric
 action brings out a distinct illumination over a good extent of
 the <U+FB01>eld, very faint at the outer parts, but brightening towards
 the axis of the <U+FB01>eld, and rising into two patches of comparatively
 strong light at the terminals.     When the compensator is intro
 duced and compressed horizontally bya continuously increasing
force, it produces extinction <U+FB01>rst in the outer equatorial parts
of the <U+FB01>eld, then at the central parts ; and then, after a consi
derable increase of compression, it extin guishes or greatly weakens
the bright patches at the terminals.
    Plane of polarization horizontal or vertical: the electric'action
brings out a narrow border of glowing light along the outlines
of both wires, and a fainter illumination in other parts of the
<U+FB01>eld, leaving a broad equatorial band very dark.
    33. Summary.—Carbon        disulphide is birefringent when di
electri<U+FB01>ed, acting upon transmitted light as glass extended
along the lines of force.    The electrostatic force and the bire
fringent power increase together: they also vanish simultane
ously, the optical effect disappearing abruptly and totally at the
instant of electric discharge (not through the bisulphide).     Some
irregularities are observed in the experiments when the electric
action is intense; but these are certainly due in great part, if
not wholly, to the want of even approximate uniformity through
any considerable extent of the electric <U+FB01>eld.
    34. The optical effect with which we are now concerned can
not be attributed to specks of dirt, hOWever <U+FB01>ne ; for it im
proves in every respect as the liquid is made cleaner ; and
when any solid particles are visibly present, it improves for
some distance outwards from the axis of the <U+FB01>eld. Neither can it
be attributed to electric discharge; for the bisulphide is an excel
lent insulator, and any discharge which is known to pass through
it in the course of the experiments is very sharply disruptive.
The effect appears to be due simply to the action of electrostatic
force upon the molecules of the liquid.

                         Electricity and Light.           I
                                                                   453
    The character of the effect in the <U+FB01>rst and second experiments
(29, 30) is of some consequence in this connexion.           When the
liquid is perfectly clean and the initial extinction pure, the light
is brought out by electric action with remarkable distinctness
and delicacy, and without a trace of unsteadiness or distortion.
The whole surface of the visibly restored <U+FB02>ame is continuous, and
its outline beautifully sharp. These patent characteristics of the
effect in the polariseope are strongly suggestive of some regular
arrangement of the ultimate molecules of the bisulphide as the
immediate cause of the phenomena.          And the compensator con
<U+FB01>rms the suggestion, while it shows, further, that the new
arrangement of the molecules either is in itself, or is at least in
effect equivalent to, a positive uniaxal structure with its axis
directed along the lines of force.
    Of such a structure in the case of a liquid, I see no probable
explanation except that already advanced in the case of glass.
The particles of the bisulphide, when electrically polarized, throw
themselves into <U+FB01>les along the lines of force; and the system
of electric curves thus physically constituted gives the liquid a
new structure, which is symmetrical at each point with reference
to the line of force through the point.        If we adopt Faraday’s
theory    of electrostatic induction,  I think  that the common ex
periment of    the  magnetic    curves  affords  rather a proof of the
present theory than an illustration.        Another illustration of the
 same kind is afforded by the interterminal chain of solid particles
 in the present experiments.
    35. I may mention here that I found it very useful in some
 of the preceding experiments, and still more useful in some of
 the following, to draw sparks occasionally from the prime con
 ductor while attending to the polariscope.         The abruptness of
 the change thus produced in the <U+FB01>eld of vision adds remarkably
 to the delicacy of the observation.
                                 Benzol.
    36. The plate of liquid is very transparent, and an excellent
 insulator. A steady electric action of the requisite intensity is
 obtained from the plate machine.        Ruhmkorl'f’s coil is not suit
 able in this case, as a few of its powerful discharges through the
 cell are suf<U+FB01>cient to contaminate the liquid witha <U+FB01>ne deposit of
 carbon.
     Here again the only dif<U+FB01>culty is to get the liquid clean
 enough.     A few specks of organic <U+FB01>bre or of other dust from
 the air of the room or elsewhere, if they get into the cell, are
  sure to obscure the principal effect extremely, if they do not
  quite mask it.    When the specks are numerous enough, they
 form a chain between the terminals, as in the case of carbon

4154,         Dr. J. Kerr   on a new Relation between
disulphide.    In some plates the chain holds together perma
nently;    and in such a case, if the chain is not very coarse, a
good   effect may generally be obtained in the parts of the <U+FB01>eld
above and below the chain, as formerly in the second experi
ment upon carbon disulphide.      In other plates the chain breaks
up violently at the instant of discharge of the prime conductor
upon the knuckle; and in such a case I have sometimes obtained
a good effect by drawing sparks in rapid succession from the
prime conductor.      When the specks are so few and of such
forms as not to give a chain, they still interfere noxiously, pre
senting themselves as a set of sparkling points, which dart hither
and thither through the central parts of the electric <U+FB01>eld.
   After numerous trials, many of them ineffective, I got at
length some specklessly clean plates of benzol.       The principal
effects then presented themselves with beautiful distinctness and
perfect regularity.    The experiments were the same as those
upon    carbon  disulphide already described, and were often re
peated, particularly the <U+FB01>rst and second (29, 30); and the effects
obtained were exactly similar in kind and equally distinct, though
less intense.   Without more details, I give here the <U+FB01>nal note
which was taken at the time of observation.

                   Para<U+FB01>in and Kerosene Oils.
   37. Young’s Para<U+FB02>in Gib—This liquid is a strong insulator,
and gives a very transparent plate.     Its action is similar to that
of benzol, but much weaker. Benzol, as I have just mentioned,
gave me often a distinct principal effect above and below a <U+FB01>ne
interterminal chain of solid particles, but this liquid never. The
action, indeed, is so faint that there was only one of several
arrangements tried which gave a good regular e<U+FB01>'eet.
   Experiment—All the pieces are laid as in the <U+FB01>rst experiment
with carbon disulphide (29), except the dielectric, which is now
placed close to the second Nicol, a few inches from the eye, so
that no light is received from the lamp except through points
of the electric <U+FB01>eld very near the centre.      No result could be
accepted  as  decisive till the liquid was perfectly clean;- and the
observations were carried out accordingly.

   38. Kerosene Oil—This liquid is more purely transparent
than paraf<U+FB01>n, but not such a strong insulator.      When the plate
of liquid is specklessly clean, but not till then, the form of ex
periment just described in the case of paraf<U+FB01>n succeeds perfectly ;
and thejle<U+FB01>'ects obtained are similar, as might indeed be expected.

former cases, the restored light vanishes abruptly at the instant
of discharge of the prime conductor.
                       Spirits of Turpentine.
    39. Two samples of this liquid, of contrary photogyric powers,
were mixed in such proportions as to give a plate inactive in the
polariscope.    The plate was very transparent and a good insu
lator.   All the arrangements being as in the <U+FB01>rst and second

 lariscope was found to be perfectly regular, similar to that of
 benzol, but rather fainter, though not nearly so faint as the
 actions of para<U+FB02>in and kerosene.      Even when some specks of
 dirt were present, and formed an interterminal chain, there was
sometimes a good effect obtained above and below the chain.          I
had occasion to notice particularly while working with this liquid,
what   I  had already observed more distinctly in the case of
                                                                           '

   40. This liquid    is,
                       I   believe, the best insulator among the
 heavy oils;   and although coloured,    gives
                                          it     beautifully trans
                                                 a
 parent plate. I   have made    a good many experiments upon         it,
 at several times, <U+FB01>nding the material dif<U+FB01>cult to manage, and
 trying to assure myself perfectly of the interesting fact that its

456            Dr. J. Kerr  on a new Relation  between
action is contrary to the actions of the <U+FB01>ve preceding liquids.
The material employed latterly was the best olive-oil to be had
from the apothecaries.
   The oil was let into the cell through <U+FB01>ltering-papers, which
probably gave up some of their <U+FB01>nest <U+FB01>bres to the thick and ad
hesive liquid ; and one or two of these <U+FB01>bres, though very <U+FB01>ne
and short, were enough to mask the principal e<U+FB02>'ect.           From
very small <U+FB01>bres I could never cleanse the liquid perfectly till    I
applied a simple device for removing them by electric action, after
the cell had been closed and <U+FB01>lled.      Two <U+FB01>ne wires, properly in
sulated from each other near their ends by <U+FB01>ne (vaccine) tubes
of glass, were let doivn as one piece through the central boring
into the cell, one wire being connected with the prime conduc
tor of the slowly worked machine, and the other wire uninsulated :
the <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>bres were at once attracted, and arranged themselves
as a chain or woof between the bare ends of the two wires, which
were then withdrawn as one piece without being discharged.         It
was found unsafe to apply this piece a second time.         When a
second application was required, a new piece had to be made of
clean materials.
   The oil was in this way cleared of all visible specks of solid
matter; but it did not yet work well when examined under elec
tric action in the polariscope.    Sparkling points appeared in all
parts of the electric <U+FB01>eld, darting hither and thither irregularly.   *i
These were <U+FB01>ne air-bubbles, produced either by the preceding
operations upon the liquid, or by occasional spark-discharges
through the cell: they generally rose out of the way more or less
completely in a few minutes.      Accordingly it often happened in
these experiments,    that a plate of oil which gave no trace of the
principal effect at <U+FB01>rst, acted very well after it had been left un
disturbed for some minutes, giving the effect at last with per
fect distinctness and regularity.    But if the liquid was disturbed
anew by accidental discharge through the cell, things were at
once in much the same condition as at <U+FB01>rst.
   I may mention, <U+FB01>nally, that in the course of the experiments,
whenever the electric force reached any considerable intensity,
distinct movements were generally observed in the oil. They
bore no resemblance to the current-motions which are observed
 under similar conditions in alcohol and other imperfectly con
 ducting liquids; they rather presented the appearance of pulsa
tions, quick and irregular heavings of the liquid.         Whatever
 the nature of these movements, and whatever their relation to
 the electric force, I see no reason to think that they had any
in<U+FB02>uence on the principal effect.
   All the experiments on carbon disulphide were repeated with
olive-oil, the <U+FB01>rst (29) being most frequently repeated and espe

                           Electricity and Light.                  457
cially depended upon.          In my last series of experiments upon
this liquid, I carried on the observations with unrelaxed care for
several days, till the effects came out with perfect regularity.
The action was found to be, as distinctly as possible, contrary to
that of carbon disulphide,          and equal, or very nearly equal,
to that of benzol.        I give here the <U+FB01>nal note which was taken
at the time of observation.
    ()live- Oil—Plane of polarization at 45° to lines of force; strong
electric action : the lightis restored very distinctly from extinc—
tion, and is then extinguished regularly and perfectly by tension
of the compensator parallel to the lines of force, and strengthened
always by compression in that direction.          At 0° and at 90° not
a trace of effect in the polariscope.
                                 Castor- Oil.
    41. The liquid plate is very clearly transparent, and acts as a
Weak photogyre,       separating the blue and red perceptibly in the
polariscope.      This  oil is not nearly such a good insulator as the
preceding,     and  has  generally current—movements produced in it
by the electric action; and accordingly the results of experiment
upon this liquid were very irregular and imperfect.            The ar
rangements were generally the same as in the <U+FB01>rst experiment
 on bisulphide of carbon (29).
     Plane of polarization at 45° to lines of force : the light is re
 stored strongly from good extinction, and is then either pretty
 well extinguished or greatly weakened by tension of the com
 pensator parallel to the lines of force, and strengthened always
 by compression in that direction; but in most cases the re
 stored light is wanting in delicacy of outline, general distinct
 ness, and steadiness—a clear proof that the molecular structure
 of the oil is more or less roughly disordered by the electric
 action.     At 0° and at 90° the light is still restored by the elec
 tric action, and generally to almost as great intensity as in the
 case of 45°.      Judging from all the observations, I think that
 the action of castor-oil is similar to that of olive-oil.
     42. Suminary.-—Of the liquids examined, there are six which
 have given de<U+FB01>nite and constant results, namely these—car
 bon disulphide, benzol, paraf<U+FB01>n and kerosene oils, oil of turpen
 tine, olive-oil.    These bodies are distinctly birefringent when
 dielectri<U+FB01>ed, acting upon transmitted light as uniaxal crystals
 with axes directed along the lines of force, the uniaxal being
 negative in the case of olive-oil, positive in the other <U+FB01>ve cases.
 Dielectri<U+FB01>ed olive-oil acts in the same way as dielectri<U+FB01>ed glass,
 or as glass compressed along the lines of force ; the other <U+FB01>ve
 liquids dielectri<U+FB01>ed act as resin dielectri<U+FB01>ed,or as glass extended
 along the lines of force.          Compared among themselves with

458            Mr. L. Schwendler        on the General Theory
reference to strength of birefringent action, the liquids appear to
be very unequal—carbon            disulphide the strongest, para<U+FB01>in and
kerosene the weakest.          Compared with glass, they are much
weaker insulators ; but if allowance be made for this difference,
I  think that, for intensity as well as purity of e<U+FB01>'ects, carbon di
sulphide is far superior to glass.          In contrast with glass, all the
liquids are characterized by the absence of coercive force, and by
the rapidity of variation of birefringent action from point to
point of the electric <U+FB01>eld. The birefringent pOWer is sustained
in liquids by the present action of electric force at each instant ;
it seems also to be determined at each point simply by direc
tion and intensity of force at the point.
    43. Theory—After the explanations already advanced in the
<U+FB01>rst paper (24), and again in this paper (34),             I think  I need do
no more than enunciate the three following assumptions :—
    1. The particles of dielectri<U+FB01>ed bodies tend to arrange them
 selves in <U+FB01>les along the lines of force.
    2. Changes of molecular arrangement consequent upon rise
 or fall of electric action are effected slowly and with dif<U+FB01>culty in
 solids, easily and at once in liquids.
    3. The lines of electric force, or the axes of molecular <U+FB01>les,
 are lines of compression in one class of dielectrics (glass &c.),
 and lines of extension in another class (carbon disulphide 860.).
     The facts, when thus interpreted, afford a strong con<U+FB01>rmation
 of Faraday’s theory of electrostatic induction ; and in whatever
 way interpreted, they give promise of some new insight into
 that interesting subject, the molecular mechanism of electric
 action.
     I cannot conclude without eXpressing a hope, amounting almost
 to a belief, that the plate-cell charged with carbon disulphide
 will develop from the present rude beginning into a valuable
 physical instrument, a very delicate optical electrometer.

     The practical inferiority of the di<U+FB02>'erential method, when com
 pared with the bridge method, it will be clear at once, is that
 specially     constructed     receiving-instruments      on the differential
     “
        The differential method was originally invented, as stated before, by
 Mr. Frischen and by Messrs. Siemens and Halske.            A particular case of
 this method was patented by them in England in 1854.

460                   Mr. L. Schwendler    on the General Theory
principle         required, and that, therefore, the introduction of
                     are
 duple'x telegraphy based on the differential method would at once
 involve also a total change of the receiving-instruments       hitherto
 used.    This is clearly a serious disadvantage from an adminis
 trative and <U+FB01>nancial point of view.         But, besides this, without
 going into details, the differential method has also a very serious
 objection from a technical point of view.         While in the bridge
 method the balance is obviously independent of the resistance of
 the receiving-instrument,      in the differential method the balance
‘is clearly a function of the resistances of the two coils of which
 the receiving-instrument      consists; and as these two coils may
 alter their resistances independently, and not in proportion as
 indicated by the balance-equation, a new element of disturbance
 is introduced, which the bridge method certainly does not possess.
     Besides this, differential instruments are necessarily mechani
 cally more complicated than others, and require therefore supe
 rior workmanship, entailing greater expense to arrive at working
ef<U+FB01>ciency.
         General expressions           the two functions   “D”   and “ S.”
                                 for
   In order to obtain the two functions D and S, we have to
develop the general expressions for p, P, and Q, say for station I.
   p' in our particular case is the force exerted by the two coils
a' and b' on one and the same magnetic pole when station I. is
sending and station II. is at rest.    This force is clearly the dif
ference of the two forces exerted by the coils a’ and 6'.

P, and Q, we have to <U+FB01>x the signs of the two terms of which they
consist.    This is best done by considering the forces m and n as
absolute numbers, and determining the direction in which they
act with respect to one and the same magnetic pole by the direc
tion of the currents passing through the coils a and b.
   To <U+FB01>x the signs of the currents, we shall call, arbitrarily, that

        Rigid fulfilment of the two functions D=O and S =0.
    D can only become zero for <U+FB01>nite resistances of the branches
if
                                p = S :0,
i.  e. if
                                A=O.
    Now, to keep A=O, we may adopt two essentially different
modes of readjustment, namely :—
    Either leave the two coils and their armatures stationary, and
adjust balance by altering the resistances of the branches (a+h)
and (b+d) separately or simultaneously, or leave the resistances
of these branches constant and move the coils or their armatures.
These two cases are to be considered separately.
     (a) Reaztjustment of balance by altering the resistances of the
 branches.
     As a and b are resistances which in the form of coils have to
 exert magnetic force,'it is impracticable to suppose them vari
 able.    If they have been once selected, they must necessarily
 be kept constant, whence it follows that the readjustment of
 balance is restricted to a variation of one or both of the resistances
 h and d.
     But as p is a function of h and d, to establish balance by alter
 ing one of them only would invariably result in an alteration of
 p, and consequently immediate balance would become an impos
 sibility.
     Thus in order to readjust balance, and at the same time to
 keep p constant*, we must vary h and d simultaneously.
     Now it can be proved, in exactly the same manner for the dif
 ferential method as was done for the bridge, that in order to
 make the disturbance of balance for any given variation in the
 system as small as possible we must make p as large as possible,
 whence it follows from the form of p that
                                   f=  b + d,
                                 ” for the differential method.

                                      b+d+f
 keep a, b, and  f constant, and vary h and d; whence we should have
                  8p=(b+d+f)(b+d+f+8d)8h+f’8d=0,
 an equation which it is always possible to ful<U+FB01>l for any variations of h and
 d if taken of opposite signs, although it may be dif<U+FB01>cult to achieve it prac
 tically by asimple motion, such as that of turning ahandle.     The absolute
  value of these variations depends, of course, on the variation of c which
  disturbs the balance; and in order to have accelerated balance we ought to
  decrease h and increase d when 0 increases, and vice versd.

4-64          Mr. L. Schwendler     on the General Theory
    But, since
                                f=w+B,
it follows that to reestablish balance by an alteration of the
resistances h and d while a, b, B, and p keep constant, we have
to vary all the four branches h, d, w, and        f simultaneously in
such a manner that their variations ful<U+FB01>l the following condi
tion,
                         3f: 8d= 8w: — (28h),
which is simple enough to allow of its practical application, but
which nevertheless shows again the inferiority of the di<U+FB02>'erential
method as compared with the double balance; i. c., in order to
ful<U+FB01>l immediate balance, the key-equation, and the regularity-con
dition for the di<U+FB02>'erential method, we have to make the four
branches of the system simultaneously variable, while in the
double balance the same effect can be obtained by having only
 one branch variable (the b branch).
     It is worth while to mention here that there is a special case
of obtaining immediate balance for the differential method by the
 adjustment in one branch, namely when f=0; for then p would
 be independent of d, and therefore balance could be obtained by
 varying 11 without altering p.
     However, on account of the key-equation f=w+,8, it would
 follow from f=O that <U+FB02> must be zero also; which represents a
 physical impossibility,    inasmuch as the internal resistance of
 galvanic cells cannot be reduced to zero, not even approximately.
 Besides, the electromotive force requisite forduplex working being
 necessarily comparatively large, ,8 will always be a quantity which
 cannot be neglected against the other resistances of the system,
 even if the single cells were of small resistance.
     But supposing it were practicable to construct a battery of
 exceedingly low internal resistance, then, as f=b+d, it would
 be necessary to make b=0 and 11:0, another physical impossi_
 bility, as b must consist of convolutions to produce magnetism,
 and 11 must be variable to produce balance.
     This solution f=b+d=w+,8=0, or even each of these three
 branches of an only exceedingly small resistance, must therefore
 be rejected.
     (b)  Adjustment of balance by moving the coils or armatures.
     This, it will be clear, is the solution for immediate balance;
 for such a mode of adjustment would involve no relation between
 the resistance of the three branches, leaving their determination
 free for other purposes.      in order that the slightest movement
 of the two coils or their armatures may produce the required
  balance, it will be best to move both the coils or armatures simul
 taneously in the same direction.       In fact, to be able to produce

 balance no matter how great the variation in the resistance
 of the line may become, it will be necessary to make the coils
movable for the changes of seasons, and the armatures for the
 daily changes.
   It is clear that the differential method, when balance is ad
justed‘by the movement of the coils or armatures, can alone
 be compared in ef<U+FB01>ciency with the double balance; and the supe
riority of the latter is most striking. While immediate balance
and the ful<U+FB01>lment of the other two essential conditions can .be
obtained with the double-balance method within any given range
by a variation of the resistance in one single branch (h branch),
this same result with the differential method can only be arrived
at by either supposing four branches simultaneously variable, or
by supposing the coils and armatures movable—both presuppo
sing complicated mechanical arrangements requiring delicate
workmanship and being liable to get out of order.
 Rapid approximation of the two functions D and S towards zero.
  Supposing the ful<U+FB01>lment of the key-equation as one of the
most essential conditions, we know that
                           p=S          for each station invariably.

 468           Mr. L. Schwendlcr       on the General Theory
                                                    f
 which contradicts the regularity-condition =b+d so long as d
 is different from zero.
    Thus in order to ful<U+FB01>l the regularity-condition and the maxi
 mum current for the differential method simultaneously, we
 must put
                                   (i=0.
    However, it has been shown that in order to have immediate
 balance, when adjusting balance by a variation in the resistances,
 we have to alter the resistances of the four branches b+d, a+h,
f, and w+ B simultaneously according to a relation already given.
 Thus it is proved that adjustment of balance by an alteration of
 the resistances must be rejected, since, as pointed out before, a
 variation of the resistances of the coil b is impracticable.
    We are obliged therefore to adjust balance by moving the coils
 or their armatures ; and the further solution of the problem is
 only required when this mode of adjustment is adopted.
                       Maximum Magnetic Moment.
     It has now been proved that d is to be made zero in order to
 be able to ful<U+FB01>l the conditions of regularity and maximum cur
                            i
 rent simultaneously, and that therefore, to obtain immediate
 balance, readjustment of balance is to be effected by a movement
 of the two coils a and b or their armatures, and not, as has been
 generally proposed, by an alteration of the resistance in the
 branches (a+h and b+d).
    Hence h appearing in the denominator of P only, and h > 0
 not being any more required for adjusting balance, the best
 value we can give to h is
                                h=0,
 which will make P obviously largest*.
    Substituting therefore in the expression for         P

   * The resistances d and h, without
                                        exerting magnetic force, were origi
nally introduced in order to investigate the possibility of adjusting balance
by an alteration of the resistances in the branches.    But since it has been
shown that this mode of adjustment is to be rejected, it is of course clear
that the dead resistances in these branches should be made zero, when P
will become largest.

    The physical reason that this solution for the differential me
thod gives an indeterminate result,         simply due to the fact that  is
the force which produces the signals in the differential method
is  due to the combined magnetic actions of two separate coils
through which unequal currents pass, instead of to one coil as
in the bridge method.        On account of b=j,         follows that the                   it
current which passes through the coil             only half  of that pass
                                                                      b          is
ing through     the   coil.
                        a     Thus,  in order  to  make  the  most of the
arrived currents,      and  b  should be both equal to zero, or, in
                                f
other words, placing all the convolutions in          and nonein      must                a                   b
clearly give the greatest magnetic force.          Obviously, however,
such   a   solution could not ful<U+FB01>l the balance-condition           in the
sending-station.

 determines the adjustable resistance w.
    For instance, minotto cells can be easily prepared with an in¢
 ternal resistance of 10 B.A. U. per single cell.        Their minimum
 resistance, obtained            by
                             working,     never less than        B.A. U.
                                                                      is                              5              ;
 and  if the zincs are changed from time to time, their maximum

     The absolute value of       can be determined from the number
                                              13
 of cells which have to be connected up successively, in order to
 work 2    given instrument through        given line, when the circuita
         a
 <U+FB01>g.  is    adopted.    This absolute value of        will therefore not               B
  only depend on the electrical state of the line and the nature of
  the cells, but also on the absolute sensitiveness of the differential
 instrument employed.

472            Mr. L. Schwendler     on the General Theory
    To make B, therefore, as small as possible, a sensitive con
struction of the differential instrument becomes requisite; fur
ther, cells of high electromotive force and low constant resistance
are best adapted for forming the signalling-battery.            In order
to get the widest limits in the variation of w, it is clear that that
B should be selected which is calculated from the maximum
number of cells required to produce the signals with suf<U+FB01>cient
force.     The greatest number of cells is obviously required when
the line is at its lowest insulation in India, during the monsoon.
    The value   a: Z   is what has been termed the mechanical          ar
rangement of the differential instrument*.
    If'b=w+,8 has been determined by <U+FB01>xing B, then v has its
smallest value for L largest, which is the case when the line is
perfect in insulation—when the coil a must be closest to the
magnetic pole acted upon, and the coil b furthest away from it.
    The highest value of v we obtain by substituting the lowest
L, i. e. when the line is at its lowest insulation—when the coil
b must be nearest to the magnetic point acted upon, and the
coila furthest away from it.                                           ~
    Hence, the two limits of 0 being <U+FB01>xed by the known limits
between which L varies, the extent of movement of the two coils
is also <U+FB01>xed; and consequently, if q is chosen arbitrarily, the
construction of the di<U+FB02>'erential instrument is determined.            But
 even q is not quite arbitrary,      since we know the form, dimen
 sions, and resistance of the eoils which, for instance in Siemens’s
polarized relays on any given line, have to produce the magnetism
in single circuit to get the signals with engineering safety.
    The solution of the <U+FB01>rst problem of the differential method is
therefore :—
    1. Balance in each station must be obtained by a movement of
the two acting coils or their armatures, either singly or (better)
 simultaneously in the same direction, and not by an alteration of
the resistances in the branches.
    2.  If  this mode of adjusting balance be adopted, then the
solution is

    The additional reason why equation (VIII.) should be chosen

   N0te.-—Since   the 3rd of February, 1875, the main line from
Bombay to Madras has been successfully worked duplex by means
of the “ double-balance method.”

   The section of this line from Bombay to Callian           exposed to the       is
destructive in<U+FB02>uence of         tropical sea climate. Between Callian
                                         a
and Poona the line passes over the Western Ghauts the dense fogs                  ;
during the cold weather and the heavy rains during the south—west
monsoon on these hills seriously affect its insulation.        From Poona
to Sholapore and Bellary the line runs inland, and experiences a
climate 0n the whole favourable for the maintenance of constant
and high insulation.       Between Bellary and Madras, however, the
line again comes under the in<U+FB02>uence of most unfavourable climate,  a
especially just before and during the continuance of the north—east
monsoon, when the atmosphere at high temperature             a    saturated            is
with moisture and salt, leaving conducting deposits on the surface
of the insulators.
   Consequently during the south-west monsoon the resultant fault
is  near Bombay; during the hot weather                shifts towards the
                                                                        it

   By February next duplex working will therefore have been sub—
mitted to a. most severe test, applied as it will have been fora whole
year to a. long line the electrical condition of which is highly vari
able with respect to season and locality; and its practicability will
doubtless again be clearly proved, as has already been the case on
the Calcutta-Bombay line (1600 miles), where, under no more
favourable climatic conditions, duplex has for the past twelve
months not only ful<U+FB01>lled but surpassed the expectations formed of
 t. No dif<U+FB01>culties have been eXperienced, and, it is believed, never
will    be.
    Strange as it may appear from a theoretical point of view, it will
nevertheless be found in practice that a line worked duplex carries
more than double the traf<U+FB01>c of the same line worked singly; for it
represents two lines carried on different posts far distant from one
another, instead of two parallel lines on the same posts; and con
sequently the highly injurious e<U+FB01>ects of voltaic induction are eli
minated.                                                  .
    Further, the receiving signallers, not being provided with keys,
are unable to interfere with messages during their transmission.
    Corrections and repetitions do not necessitate a, stoppage of work ;
for they are obtained in the following manner :—--the receiving sig
 naller marks with a. cross or underlines the words to be repeated,
 and places the message by the side of the sending signaller, who
 calls for the repetitions directly he has <U+FB01>nished the message he is
 transmitting; and during this call the distant station may either
 send fresh messages or may also call for repetitions.         Consequently
 single working need never be resorted to, and the simultaneous ex
 change of messages and corrections becomes continuous.
    The Indian system of receiving (the sounder system which has
 now been universally recognized as the only right one for hand
 signalling) thus necessitates constant attention on the part of the
 receiving signallers ; for any inattention on their part at once be—
 comes known to the controlling of<U+FB01>cer.

   Moreover, if an equal similar area be taken in a limited conducting
    sheet, whose conductivity and thickness outside this area vary
   in any manner, the electrical state within the area will still be
   the same as in the previous case, if only the conditions at the
   boundaries remain unchanged; for evidently the electrical <U+FB02>ow
   within the area will depend on the actual electrical state of the
   boundaries, and not upon the way in which this state has been
   produced.       Consequently the truth or falsehood of conclusions
   arrived at, like those given in Part I. of this communication, on
   the assumption of an unlimited uniform conducting surface, may
  be tested by experiments on a conducting sheet of <U+FB01>nite size, if
   We can ensure that, at the edges, the electrical conditions are the
   same as they would be at the boundaries of a portion of the same
   size and shape taken in an in<U+FB01>nite sheet in which there is a
  known distribution of sources and sinks.
      44. In order to carry out such experiments, it is needful that
  theboundaries of the partof the conducting sheet examined should
  be formed either Wholly by equipotential lines, or partly by equi
  potential lines and partly by lines of <U+FB02>ow.       It is evident that an
  area within which there is a <U+FB02>ow of electricity (unless the circuit
  is complete within this area, as in a conducting plate moving in
  a magnetic <U+FB01>eld) cannot be bounded entirely by lines of <U+FB02>ow ;
 for in that case no electricity could enter or leave the area.
      Any line in a conducting sheet can be practically made to be
  an equipotential line by laying along     it,
                                              and in close contact with
  the sheet,     conductor whose resistance in directions parallel to
  the sheet   is ainsensible—for instance,     athick band of copper.
 And any line along which the sheet          bounded by non-conduc
                                           is is
 tors  (e. g. the free edges of the sheet)    necessarily line of <U+FB02>ow,
                                                               a
 since no electricity can pass across such      boundary in either di
                                                   a
rection. The experimental conditions can thus be chosen so that
a    conducting area may be bounded either             by
                                                     equipotential lines
 wholly, or partly    by  equipotential lines and partly         lines of
                                                                     by
<U+FB02>ow, placed so as to correspond to any given system of poles.
      45. Methods of testing experimentally the conclusions deduced
from theory, founded on the general principles above indicated,
 have been employed        byvarious investigators.    Thus Kirchhoff,
 in his paper of 1845 (Pogg. Ann. vol. lxiv.), traced the form and
 distribution of the equipotential lines on thin sheets of metal
bounded       byfour circular arcs, two of which, being free edges,
were lines of <U+FB02>ow and belonged to the same circle; while the
others, of much smaller extent than the <U+FB01>rst two, were equipo~
tential lines determined        by
                                 the contact of small cylindrical elec
trodes (conducting wires) with the margin of the sheet.               He
traced the course of the equipotential lines           by
                                                     <U+FB01>xing    wire con

nected with one terminal of          a galvauometer in succession at

 several points arbitrarily chosen, and in each case <U+FB01>nding, by trial
with a wire from the other terminal, a suf<U+FB01>cient number of points
having the same potential as the selected point.       To ascertain
the distribution required to make the difference of potential be
tween consecutive lines constant, be determined a number of
points along the straight line joining the electrodes, such that the
difference of potential between each one and the next was just
suf<U+FB01>cient to compensate the constant electromotive force of a
thermoelectric element.      The form of the equipotential lines in
some rather more complicated cases was determined in the same
manner by Quincke*, and in other cases again by students in the
Edinburgh University Laboratory-r. Schwedo<U+FB02>'I also has in
vestigated the direction of the <U+FB02>ow at various points in a rectan
gular sheet of tinfoil.
   Recently an elaborate series of experiments, by a method
similar to Kirchhoff’s, has been carried out by Professor W. G.
Adams §, who has also extended the same method of inquiry to
conductors of three dimensions by the employment of conducting
liquids (mercury, sulphate of copper, sulphate of zinc).
   Veri<U+FB01>cations by Kirchhoff and by Mach of the theoretical ex
pressions for the strength of the current at different parts of a
conducting sheet have already been referred to (see Part I. § 15,
footnote, Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xlix. p. 395).
   Experimental measurements of resistance, in addition to the
attempts of Kirchhoff already mentioned (Part I. § 1), have been
made by Gaugain       who measured the resistance of

    tion, after shifting the slider      Dalong the graduated wire, another
    equipotential    line  can   be  marked     out on the sheet; and any
    number    of lines  can  be  traced,  so  as to correspond to equal dif
    ferences of potential,      by shifting   the  slider through successive
    equal distances.
       48. In the actual experiments the connexions were not made
    exactly as shown in <U+FB01>g.          but the positions of battery and gal
                                    1,
    vanometer were interchanged.            This arrangement made           un    it
    necessary   to  usea  separate key     for closing   the battery-circuit, as
    the circuit  was   completed by     the  contact    of the pin    with the
                                                                             C
    sheet; and since these contacts were only momentary, no sen
    sible disturbance can have arisen from unequal heating.                The

        Electricity in    a uniform plane conducting Surface.                 479
battery used was a single cell of Smee ; the galvanometer was a
re<U+FB02>ecting one of low resistance.   The disk was a circular piece
of tinfoil, of 27-8 centim. diameter, pasted on the bottom of a
tray or shallow box of hard wood, on the edges of which rested a
wooden bar supporting the contact-pin C. This last slid in a.
vertical tube <U+FB01>xed to the wooden bar; a spiral spring inside the
tube kept the pin out of contact with the sheet except when it
was pressed down. When the right position on the sheet had
been found by means of the blunt point of the pin, this position
was marked by pressing the pin down harder, so as to make a
slight indentation in the tinfoil.
   The mode of making contact            at   A   and B which we found to
answer best is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.            AS      is a brass spring with a
projecting pin A, and a screw                   Fig. 2.
S with nut and washer. The
screw passes through the wood
of the trayand is fixed by screw
ing up the nut, the conducting
wire being clamped between
the nut and washer.        The rounded end of the pin A rests on the
tinfoil surface, pressing it <U+FB01>rmly and making a good circular
contact.     It-was found necessary to lubricate the bar carrying
C with    blacklead  to prevent its causing vibrations when sliding
on the edges of the tray, and so deranging the contact of the
 springs A and B.
    49. After a series of points have been marked on the tinfoil
 in the manner described, a line may be drawn through each set
 by hand.      A set of lines obtained in this way for the case of two
 equal opposite poles on the edge of a circular disk correspond to
 a portion of the diagram in Plate IX. (Part               I.)

ment.      A thincylindrical rod of brass, to which two wires could
be attached, slid vertically in a V-groove down the side of a rect
angular wooden block.         The lower end of the rod was <U+FB01>led accu
rately   <U+FB02>at  and   perpendicular to its length, so as to touch the
tinfoil with its entire surface. Constant pressure against the
tinfoil was maintained by placing a weight on a cap <U+FB01>xed to its
upper end.       Two such rods constituted the electrodes A and B ;
and tolerably constant contacts could be made with them after a
little practice.    Nevertheless individual readings are apt to vary
a good deal, and it is necessary to take the mean of several di
stinct experiments in order to get a single trustworthy result.
    The numbers given in the annexed Table will serve to illustrate
the variations occurring among single readings.               They refer to a
set of experiments in which the electrodes were placed approxi
mately at the ends of a diameter of a circular disk.

    It will    be    seen by this Table that the values of C deduced
from the several sets of experiments are not quite constant.                                         In
explanation of the discrepancies, it is to be observed that the
equipotential lines determined by the contact of the electrodes
with the tinfoil did not agree'quite strictly with equipotential
lines due to the arrangement of poles assumed in calculating the
values of L, except in the experiments (distinguished as Case 1)

488     Flow ofEectricity in    a uniform plane conducting Surface.
where both the electrodes were on the edge of the disk.          The
differences between the results of these experiments and those
with other arrangements of the electrodes are in the direction
which would be caused by the actual departure from the theore
tical conditions.
   The discrepancy is greatest in Case 5, where both the elec
trodes touch the edge of the disk.      In this case the additional
poles A' and B', required in an imaginary unlimited continuation
of the conducting sheet in order to make the circumference of
the disk a line of <U+FB02>ow, would be points outside the circum~
ference, but very near to it and to A and B respectively.     If, for
an instant, we regard the electrodes as mere points whose dis
tance from the circumference of the disk is very small compared
with its radius or with their distance from each other, the equi
potential lines for a short distance from A and B will be very
nearly indeed a system of lemniscatcs (see Part I. § 36, at the
beginning)——the node of the self-cutting curve, or lemniscate
proper, being sensibly on the circumference.          The circle of
contact formed by each electrode may be regarded as approxi
mately representing one branch of such a lemniscatc,        instead   if,
of taking its centre for the actual pole (A or B), we take     point        a
nearer the centre of the disk by (Mg—1w, where          the radius
                                                             p   is
of the electrode. A recalculation of  the experiments of Case in                5
this way reduces the mean value of 2C from 3'245 to 3'11; and
a  similar correction applied to Case     gives 2C=3'1O instead
                                             4
of 3'20. Thus corrected, the results of these experiments agree
fairly with those of Case 1.

J.  Clerk Maxwell indicated so long ago as 1856 (Brit.-Assoc.
Report, 1856, Trans. of Sect. p. 12; see also, for fuller develop
ments, Camb. Phil. Trans. vol. x. p. 27) the fundamental idea
of the method of treating questions relating to the <U+FB02>ow of elec
tricity in conductors of more than one dimension which was used
in the <U+FB01>rst Part of this paper,—and also to mention that problems
presented by <U+FB01>nite plane conductors, in cases which become un
manageable by the simple geometrical processes employed by us
 (as, for instance, the case of rectangular conducting sheets), have
been solved by Jochmann (Schlomilch’s Zeitscbr. f. Mathemat.
1865, p. 48) by a method founded on the superposition of the
effects of separate poles, and by Heine (Crelle’s Journal, 1874,
vol. lxxix. p. 1) by an application of the geometrical principle of
point-point correspondence (Abbildung) to Kirchhoff ’s results.

         there is a slight discrepancy between Muncke’s Table of
 ASthe expansion           of sea-water and that of Professor Hubbard,
 especially in reference to high temperatures,          I have been induced
 to compare the results obtained by the use of the latter Table
 with that by the former; and I <U+FB01>nd that they are almost identical.
Both give 2 feet 6 inches as the amount by which the expansion
 of column B (lat. 23° N.) exceeds that of the equatorial column.
 Muncke’s Table, as we have already seen, gives 3 feet 6 inches
 as the amount by which column A (lat. 38° N.) exceeds that of
 the equatorial, while according to Professor Hubbard’ s Table it
 is 3 feet 4 inches, being a difference of only 2 inches.
     Dr. Carpenter objects-)- to my result on the ground that               I
 have omitted the consideration of the inferior salinity of the
 equatorial column.         Had    I taken this into account, he thinks     I
 should   have  found   that   it makes  a difference in the opposite direc

     the whole 31,- feet of slope derived from temperature.                               I do not
     know upon what grounds he believes that the difference in sali
    nity is so great between the equatorial and Atlantic columns.

     Certainly the researches of the Challenger’ expedition do not
    Warrant any such conclusion.                    It is true that there is an exeess
    of salinity in the surface-water of the North Atlantic; but it
    does not extend to any great depth.                           This superior salinity of
    the warm upper stratum of the North Atlantic, it may be ob
    served, is an additional evidence that the water is of Gulf-stream
    origin.
        Through the kindness of the Hydrographer of the Admiralty
    I have been favoured with all the observations made in the
    ‘

    diate depths, between surface and bottom.                           From these observa

        The mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the equatorial column, as proved
    by the two soundings III. and IV. in the Table, is 1'026202:
    and 1'026211 of sounding I. of the Table may be regarded as
    the mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the North-Atlantic column A ; for
    the observations were made at a place on the same latitude and
    only about two degrees to the east of that column.                               Consequently

the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of column A exceeds that of the equatorial
by only '000009, a quantity which does not amount to 1 inch
in 1500 fathoms!       Sounding No. II. of the Table; made at a
place a few degrees to the east of column B of the section, gives
1'02623, which may be regarded as the mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
this column, and the more so as another sounding made in this
region gives identically the same mean value.         The difference
between the equatorial column and the Atlantic column B in lat.
23° N. therefore amounts to only “000028, or 3 inches in 1500
fathoms.     It must of course be observed that, as the speci<U+FB01>c
gravities in the Table are not taken at equal intervals, the mean
of the <U+FB01>gures does not represent the mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a.
 column.     The number of fathoms represented by each separate
 value must be taken into account in determining the mean value
 of the column.     My former result, therefore, is _not materially
 affected, even after  I have thus taken into account difference of
                                                                       '
 salinity, and computed the amount of expansion according to
 Professor Hubbard’s Table.        The surface of the Atlantic in lat.
 38°, to be in static equilibrium, must be 3 feet 3 inches above
 that of the equator, and, in lat. 23C, 2 feet 3 inches above it.
    It is perfectly true that, according to the gravitation theory,
 the ocean is never in a state of static equilibrium ; but it must be
 observed that, as the surface-flow according to this theory is from
 the equator polewards, it is the equatorial column that is kept
 constantly below the level necessary to static equilibrium ; hence
 were   I to make allowance for want of static equilibrium    I should
 make the slOpe greater than 3 feet 3 inches.         Dr. Carpenter’s
 objection that the force of my argument rests on the assumption
 that the sea is in static equilibrium, is based on a misapprehen
 sion of the problem ; for in reality, by not making allowance for
 want of equilibrium,    I give his theory an advantage which it does
 not deserve.   Were the surface-<U+FB02>ow from the North Atlantic to
 the equator, there would then be some grounds for his objection;
                                                           I
 for by leaving out of account the want of equilibrium should be
  making the slope greater than it should be.
     I  submit that the foregoing is a satisfactory proof that the
 North Atlantic must be above the level of the equator; and if
 so, it shows the mechanical impossibility of a surface-<U+FB02>ow pole
 wards in that ocean resulting from gravitation.

          angle  which a. plate of quartz, out perpendicular to the axis.
THE   rotates the   plane of polarization of light was determined by M.
Broch *, and more recently by M. Stefani", for rays of various re
frangibilities, between the limits of the solar lines B and H. We
have thought it would be interesting to extend those determinations
to the ultra-violet rays by means of the spectroscope with <U+FB02>uores
cent ocular formerly described by one of usj: We have also mea
sured the rotation in the least—refrangible part of the spectrum, for
the wave—lengths of the lines a and A, which, to our knowledge, had
not previously been examined in this respect.
    “7e have adopted the method of Fizeau and Foucault, which had
been also employed by Broch and Stefan.             The solar light, re<U+FB02>ect-ed
horizontally by a metallic mirror (glass silvered), was concentrated
by a convergent lens of 72 millims. aperture and about 1'15 metre                -
focal distance.      A little before reaching the focus of the lens the
pencil passed through a large Nicol prism, afterwards a quartz plate
cut perpendicularly to the axis, then a second Nicol <U+FB01>xed upon a.
graduated circle, <U+FB01>nally entering a spectroscope, the slit of which
was placed at the focus of the lens.                         ,
    The spectrum observed under these conditions is crossed, as is
known, by black bands, the closeness of which increases in precisely
the same ratio with the thickness of the quartz plate. By turning
 the analyzing Nicol, one of these bands can be brought into coinci
dence with such or such aline of the solar spectrum ; and from the
angle through which it was necessary to turn it the rotation of the
light of corresponding refrangibility can be deduced.            In the ultra
violet part of the spectrum, observed with the <U+FB02>uorescent ocular, the
 black bands manifest themselves in the same manner; and here we
 have been able to extend the determinations as far as the line N,
 which can be distinguished with suf<U+FB01>cient distinctness by employirg
 apparatus of optical glass and a. prism of white <U+FB02>int glass. For the
 observation of the lines a and A it suffices to place before the slit
 of the spectroscope a. plate of blue cobalt glass, which permits the
 extreme red to pass, absorbing the adjacent more refrangible radia—
tions.     These two lines are then readily distinguished, and, at least
for a, the measurements can be made with as much precision as for
the rest of the spectrum.
    The results which we have obtained with a plate of left-handed
quartz of 30-085 millims. thickness are recorded in the following

   The third, fourth, and <U+FB01>fth columns give, in degrees and decimal
fractions of a. degree, the values of the angle of rotation as obtained
in the three different series of observations, referred to a plate of
quartz 1 millim. thick.                    The second series of experiments was made
with two prisms to the spectroscope from A to E, with only one
for the more refrangible lines ; series I. and                           III.   were made with
but one prism.                The numbers given are most frequently the mean
of six observations, but sometimes of four, eight, twelve, or sixteen.
The values given in the eighth column were calculated by Boltz
mann’s formula, as we shall subsequently see.
   The accordance of the diiferent series varies a. little, according to
the lines, which are not all of equally easy adjustment.                                 For the
line H1, for example, there is some divergence, because the nearness
of the line H2 somewhat impedes the observation; and it is the
same with the numerous lines of the group L.                                   The lines M are
very distinct ; but the feeble luminous intensity of N considerably
lessens the precision.
   The results recorded in the seventh column approach very nearly
those obtained by MM. Broch and Stefan, viz.

Nevertheless our numbers a little exceed those of M. Stefan. These
slight divergences may, we think, be attributed to two causes :—
   (1) Our experiments must have been made at a. notably higher
temperature ; for we worked on some of the very hot days of this
summer (outside temperature 203 to 25° 0.), and, besides, the sun’s
rays concentrated by a lens upon the plate of quartz necessarily
raised its temperature.    Now it has been shown by Von Lang
(Sitzunysberichte der Wiener Alcaclemt'e, vol. lxxi. April 1875) that
the rotatory power of quartz slightly increases with its tempera.
ture ; and, to express the increment, he gives the formula
                         pt: ¢o(1 + '0000149t),
Where     and
        4),,      are the angles of rotation at zero and at t°.

admitting diiference of 200 between the temperature of M. Stefan’s
               a
experiments and that of ours the dilference between the results
would be reduced about       thousandths.
                                   3
   (2) The plate of quartz we use shows         slight imperfection in
                                                          a
its cutting, with respect to parallelism of the two faces and the di
rection of the- axis; and the rays did not pass through           quite         it
normally: they were rendered convergent by lens of long focus.    a
This little cause of error also tends to augment the numbers
 obtained.
   For the expression of the angle of rotation'¢ as function of the   a.
wave-length      the following formula has been proposed——
                   A,
                                         __ A+

in which A and are two constants. This formula, which accords
                          B
in manner but little short of satisfactory with the observations
    a
made between      and H, becomes inaccurate between more extended
                    B
limits.    When the values of A and      are calculated from those of
                                                     B
¢  for lines a and M,       found that, for rays of intermediate re
                              it   is
frangibility, the values given by the formula are constantly higher
than the numbers observed; the divergence exceeds           degree for      1
the line G. On the contrary, for the lines A and N the calculated
 values are lower than those resulting from observation.
    Starting from the idea that the rotation should be zero for an
in<U+FB01>nite wave-length, Boltzmann has proposed the formula
                               _B    D      c

He  has shown that, reduced to its <U+FB01>rst two terms,     conducts to         it
values well accordant with the observations of M. Stefan between
B  and H. We have found that     likewise agrees very satisfactorily

ON THERMIC        EQUILIBRIUM AND HEAT-CONDUCTION IN GASES;
    AND ON THE INTEGRATION          OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUA~
    TIONS  01"  THE FIRST ORDER.       BY PROF. LUDWIG BOLTZMANN.
    At the sitting of the [Vienna] 'Academy of the 14th October, Prof.
Boltzmann presented three memoirs. The <U+FB01>rst, “On the Thermic
Equilibrium of Gases when acted on by external Forces,” contains
the demonstration that, even in the case of the operation of external
forces, a function E exists of which the value cannot increase in
consequence of the molecular motion, and consequently must have
a constant minimum value; indeed this function is perfectly iden
tical with that which        ossesses this property when no external
forces are present ; on y the subsidiary conditions are different.
In order to furnish the demonstration, in the <U+FB01>rst place the general
 partial di<U+FB01>erential equation for the change of state in consequence
of the molecular motion is developed ; it contains some terms which
 also occur when no external forces act, and others which result
from the presence of the external forces. It is then proved that
the latter terms supply a vanishing quantity to the expression ob
 tained for the diiferential quotient of the function E according to
 the time, whence it follows that the laws of the variation of this
 function with the time undergo no change by the operation of the
 external forces. But the subsidiary conditions are different, inas
much as the equation of the 'uis viva must now contain also the
ergal of the external forces. By means of this proposition the dis—
tribution of state which enters in the case of thermic equilibrium
 can with facility be determined. In the second memoir, “ Remarks
 on the Conduction of Heat by Gases,” some theoretic considerations
 are attached to the experimental investigations of Stefan, Kundt,
 Warburg, and Winkelmann. Stefan already remarked that these
 observations seemed to indicate that the intramolecular motion
 takes part in a slight degree, as Maxwell assumed, in the heat-con
 duction.    This is here further elucidated ; and it is shown that
 perfect  accordance    with experiment is attained by assuming that
 the contribution furnished by the intramolecular motion to the heat—
 conduction amounts to only T33- of what it would be according to
 Maxwell’s hypothesis.      The author remarks that this is much less
 than what the intramolecular motion in consequence of the mere
 diffusion of the molecules would contribute to the heat-diifusion if
 the proportion of the vis viva of the progressn'e and intramolecular
 motions were in each layer the same as in a uniformly heated gas
 of the same temperature.       The observations hitherto made appear,
 therefore, to favour the opinion that such is not the case. It would
 hence follow that the constancy of heat-conduction is not entirely
 independent of the thickness of the conducting layer. In conclu

 sion, very general differential equations for the variation of the
vis viva of the progressive and intramolecular motions are advanced.
    The third memoir, “Integration of Partial Di<U+FB01>erential Equations
                                                        J
 of the First Order,” contains a new proof of acobi’s method
 of integration of that kind of partial differential equations.
 As is well known, these differential equations are integrated by
 <U+FB01>rst integrating a more general system of simultaneous partial dif
ferential equations, and then determining the arbitrary functions
 so as to satisfy also the differential equations originally given.   In
order completely to determine the unknowns, more limiting condi—
tions must be added to the former more general system than to the
one originally given.      In the memoir the demonstration is fur
nished that, by means of Jacobi’s integration-method, the limiting
conditions attached to the more general system coincide with one
required by the given differential equation, whence it at once follows
      J
that acobi’s solution coincides with a solution of the given differ
ential equation.—Sitzungbericht dm- k. Akademie der Wissenschaften

                         ON SOUNDING FLAMES.
    M. C. Decharme <U+FB01>nds that persistent and varied sounds may be
obtained by allowing a current of air to impinge on a jet of common
illuminating—gas    issuing from a tube 3 to 5 millims. in diameter,
and forming a <U+FB02>ame 30 to 50 centims. high. The air is conveyed
in a similar tube; and the character of the sound will vary accord
ing to the part of the <U+FB02>ame struck, the pressure of the air, and the
ratio of the diameter of the tubes.
    When the jet of air, striking the <U+FB02>ame near the top, gradually
descends to within about a decimetre of the ori<U+FB01>ce, we see the
column of <U+FB02>ame <U+FB01>rst divide, lower itself, then twist under the jet,
envelope it and let it pass, surrounding it with a blue <U+FB02>ickering
<U+FB02>ame; a continuous tearing sound is then heard from this lumi
nous veil. When the jet reaches within 2 or 3 centims. of the
ori<U+FB01>ce of the gas (the air-tube being held horizontally and being
directed toward the <U+FB02>ame), a loud hissing is produced. Finally,
when the tubes touch, the hissing becomes harsher, or, if the pres
sure is small, becomes a. very clear and agreeable musical sound.
    The experiment also succeeds well with a Bunsen burner after
closing the air-holes.     It is needless to add that no sound is pro
duced with the simple gas-jet if not lighted.       By varying the con
ditions, as the nature and pressure of the gas and air, the position,
diameter, form, and nature of the tubes, various modi<U+FB01>cations of
the sounds, and of the shape and colour of the <U+FB02>ame, are produced.
The rapid motions are readily analyzed by a revolving mirror.        It
would appear that the explanation of these facts depends not
merely on the mechanical, but in a great measure on the chemical
action of the air.——Uomptes      Rendus, vol. lxxx. p. 1602; Silliman’s

           LIX.   0n   the  Polarization of the Light of the Sky.
   By R. H. M. BOSANQUET, Fellow of St. John’s College, Ozfora'*.
            subject of the polarization of the light of the sky has
   THEbeen regarded        from two principal points of view—namely,
   as matter of observation, and as the subject of a theory based on
   Tyndall’ s experiments with attenuated vapours and smoke. The
   comparison of the observations of the sky with the experiments
                                                              I
   has not yet been carried out to any purpose, so far as am aware.
   It will be the aim of the present communication to discuss the
   results of observation of the sky in the light of certain elemen
   tary indications afforded by the experimental treatment.            A
  few words will be said on the general theory.           The subject of
  the construction of polarimeters will also be noticed, and some
  remarks made on the principles on which the interpretation of
  their indications may be made to depend.
      By far the most complete treatment of the matter by obser
   vation of the sky is that of Brewster.       His map of the lines of
                                                   J
_
  equal polarization    was  published  in  Keith    ohnston’s ‘ Physical
   Atlas,’ accompanied by a short explanation.          It has never, so
          I
  far as know, been unfavourably criticised, and is the authority
  to which probably any one interested in the subject would look
  in the <U+FB01>rst instance.      On inspecting this map it appeared to me
  so strange, that   I  thought it desirable to investigate the matter
  more closely; and        I  have now to present the considerations
  which lead me to the conclusion that it must be almost entirely
  rejected, not only as an exposition of the actual state of things,
  but even as a representation of the results of Brewster’s own
  observations.
      Brewster’s observations were subsequently published in the
  ‘Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’ 1864, vol. xxiii.
  p.213,and in the Philosophical Magazine for August I 865, p.118.

They appear to    have been taken straight from the note-book,
if we mayjudge from several uncorrected mistakes; this,of course,
materially enhances their value as observations. 1 have no doubt
that they constitute by far the largest and most reliable body of
evidence accessible on the most interesting parts of the subject ;
also it is clear that they actually were the evidence on which
his map and discussion were founded.
    The considerable work of Rubenson (Mc’moire sur la Polari
sation de la lumiére atmosphérique, Upsal, 1864) is devoted almost
entirely to the variations of the maximum intensity of the pola-'
rization of the sky, the time of day and year being connected
 with it by empirical formulae.       Although his instrument was
 almost of an astronomical character as regards the attempt at
 accuracy, and his series of observations are very extensive, these
 are not for the most part applicable to the determination of the
 points to which I have so far principally attended; in a more
 advanced stage of the subject his work may probably be of value.
    The summary of general results, as stated by Brewster, refers
 only to the plane through sun, zenith, and observer; and it is
 clear from the observations that points in this circle, and the
 point in the horizon at right angles to    it, were alone generally
 observed.     The normal   arrangement   of the  polarizationis  taken
 to be when the sun    is in or near the horizon (generally setting).
    Polarization is said to be positive when light       polarized in
                                                         is          a
 plane through sun, point, and observer; negative when polarized
 at right angles to that plane.
    Thus, in Tyndall’s experiments, the polarization of the <U+FB01>rst
 stage, where the blue light <U+FB01>rst appears, and the polarization      is
 parallel to the beam,      ispositive; in the subsequent stage the
 polarization of rays forming an acute angle with the beam           is
 negative.
     Now Brewster and all the observers are agreed in this, that
 the polarization of the region in and about      agreat circle at right
 angles to the sun    is always positive, and that the position of
 points of maximum positive polarization     is  always at right angles
 to the sun.                                ,
     They are also agreed that there are in the plane through sun,
  zenith, and observer at least three, neutral points :-—the point of
  Arago, between the zenith and antisolar point; the point of
  Babinet, between the zenith and the sun       ; and point called by
                                                      a
  Brewster’s name, below the sun.                                      ,
     Also that between Arago’s point and the antisolar point the
  polarizationis  generally negative; that between Babinet’ point
                                                               s
  and the sun the polarization   is  negative;   and between the sun
  and Brewster’s point the polarization     is  negative; though the
  observation‘of the negative polarization in the last case, and

consequently          of Brewster’s          point,       appears         to be of extreme
dif<U+FB01>culty.
    Brewster himself has occasionally seen a fourth neutral point
in the neighbourhood of the antisolar point; and there exist
isolated observations of other points.        But for the present pur
pose it will be su<U+FB02>icient to consider the three above named, as
they stand on quite a different ground as to evidence from the
others, and they are those on which Brewster founds his dis

 =18° 30'. Of course Brewster’s point would not really be
visible under these circumstances;        but it is assumed that that
would be its position if it were visible, for the sake of obtaining
a normal con<U+FB01>guration.                 I
                                 may here say that I have not been
able to <U+FB01>nd out how Brewster determined this value 18° 30'.

                                         and to the assumption that                                    >
the points are symmetrically situated (under normal circum
stances of course), as representing Brewster’s opinion on points
of fact but
         ;      I cannot get the number, or the symmetry, out of
the observations.      My impression        that he assumed the sym

   If the light thus polarized, with known values of ¢, be exa
mined with a glass-bundle polarimeter, it is possible to express
experimentally the inclinations of the glass bundle in terms of ¢,
where cos 2¢ is the numerical measure of the polarization.        This
is Ruhenson’s method.       The change of sign corresponds con
veniently with the expression “positive” or “negative” pola
rization.
 '
   Now Brewster’s measure of polarization is R, de<U+FB01>ned by the
relation R=<p—45° '(Ed. Trans. xxiii. 233, Phil. Trans. 1830,
136).     Hence the polarization indicated by R is cos 2(45°+ R),
or, disregarding sign, sin 2R ; so that R=4~5° represents com
plete polarization, R=O common light.            If the polarization
were negative, it would be represented by negative values of R.
    Brewster’s normal value of the maximum zenith polarization
is about 30° ; and he notices that the horizontal polarization at'
right angles to the sun (minimum maximorum) is somewhat
less.    1 have not been    able to <U+FB01>nd out how he got from the
observations the constants he employs in either case ; but they
represent the observations very fairly. We are now able to enter
on the method employed by Brewster for the construction of his
maps. _ It is explained, both in the text in Keith Johnston and
in the Philosophical Magazine, 1847', vol. xxxi. p. 451, where
a slightly different version is given; so there is no room for
 doubt that the procedure about to be described was that actually
employed.
    First was considered the section of the sky in the plane of zenith,
sun, observer, the normal positions being as given above, and
the maximum polarization being about 30°.           This distribution
was represented by the expression 33%o sin D sin D', where
D, D' were the angular distances from the two neutral points.
 _In   the zenith (where   D               18° 30')this gives   30,—1,°   nearly.
                               =D'=Zr2——
The law of variation           in any way determined; but the
                           was not
expression gives the required value in the zenith, and vanishes
at the neutral points.
   Having regard to sign, this expression represents the distri
bution of polarization in the plane of sun, zenith, and observer
suf<U+FB01>ciently well, except that we shall see reason to believe that
the polarization must vanish at the sun and antisolar point.
But    it necessary to make the convention that D, D’ shall be
            is
taken negatiVe when reckoned in the direction opposite to the
zenith.   The following <U+FB01>gure shows more clearly what       meant is           ;
the dotted lines represent negative, the continuous line represents
positive polarization.

   But the application of the formula to points out of the plane
of sun, zenith, and observer involves a pure assumption, viz. that
the neutral points are centres, or their radii vectores axes of the
polarization, so that D, D' may be applicable to distances from the
neutral points measured in any direction.     For this assumption
there is no foundation whatever; and it leads to the entire dis
regard of the convention of sign above alluded to, and to the repre
sentation of the polarization in the negative region as similar in
character, and, indeed, as continuous with, that in the positive
region.    The adoption of this assumption by Brewster led to a
distribution of the polarization entirely inconsistent both with
his own observations and conclusions, and with those of all other
observers, as well as absurd in itself.    In fact this is probably
the only case where geometers have for a considerable time been
content to acquiesce in the statement that the boundary between
two regions on the surface of a sphere is a point, or, as Rubenson
     it,   “ Ces deux
puts                   espaces du ciel, caractérisés par leur polari

this paper was read.
    Brewster made this assumption—namely,         that the above for

 sured.    Then in applying the case to the point in the horizon
 at right angles to the sun, of which he had observations, he
 found that the formula gave       polarization greater than that in

plane of the horizon, of II. on a vertical plane normal to the line

     We see now that these maps disregard entirely the existence
  of a'negative region.     For instance, the <U+FB01>rst line, corresponding
  to polarization R=1°'6, goes right round each point, through
  both positive and negative regions.      Hence each of the neutral
  points has positive polarization both above and below       it, which
is   contrary to all the observations.
     Again, suppose point taken anywhere in the positive region,
                     a
  and another in the negative.      It clear that, on any line joining
                                     is
  these, the polarization must pass through              zero value on
                                                         a

  separating   the positive and negative regions.    The extreme dif<U+FB01>

  been established   by   observation.  But  it     clear that

     Edinburgh Trans. xxiii. p. 214, June 10 :——“ At 3h 47‘“, when
  the sky was everywhere pure and free of clouds, the neutral line
  of the polarimeter was curved above the land horizon.       At 611 32'"
 the curvature was greater above the sea horizon, the deviation
 increasing towards the horizon.”

     In the <U+FB01>gure (p. 213) of the bands in the polarimeter, the
 appearance indicated      that of horizontal neutral line.
                          is        a
     Bubenson (p. 144) swept the horizon immediately after sun
 set; at very small distance from the sun he recognized well
         a                                                          a

 only observation he gives of the phenomenon.
     Probably the dif<U+FB01>culty of the observations may be the reason
  why no observer has searched methodically for neutral lines, but
  always for points; these may be merely the intersection of the
  neutral line with the circle in which the instrument sweeps.
  Rubenson was frequently unable to <U+FB01>nd any of the neutral points,
  and has no detailed observations of them.      We also <U+FB01>nd that
  Babinet regarded the observation both of      his  own point and of
 Brewster’s as of extreme dif<U+FB01>culty.
     Before proceeding to suggest    amore consistent interpretation
  of the data, will advert shortly to the principal points estab
             I
  lished in Tyndall’s experiments, and endeavour to gain some
  general principles for our guidance.
          I.
      Stage     Vapour of minimum density.      Blue colour.     Pola
  rization positive.   Light  emitted  normally   to  the illuminating
 beam perfectly polarized.
      Stage 11. Increased density of vapour, and probably increased
 size of particles.   Blue passes over into white.
     (0:) Light  emitted  normally     partially polarized positively
                                      is

504                    Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet   on the
(in the plane of the beam); the portion polarized negatively
 (passing through a Nicol which stops the positively polarized
light) affords the phenomenon called by Tyndall residual blue.
    (,3) If a point on the beam be observed from positions such
that the light examined diverges at an acute angle with the in
cident beam, a position can be found in which the emitted
light is neutral, or devoid of polarization.
    (7) If a point on the beam be observed from positions such
that the light examined diverges at a more acute angle than in
the last case, the light is polarized negatively, or at right angles
to the beam.
    In Stage II. there is a progressive change, which will be as
follows, if we suppose the density, or, as we may say with great
probability, the mean size, of the di<U+FB01>'racting particles continually
to increase.
    (a) If the beam be regarded normally,            the light, which
 throughout Stage I. was perfectly polarized, ceases to be so, the
proportion of polarized light thus normally emitted diminishes,
and eventually the light normally emitted is neutral ; this I take
to mark the conclusion of Stage II.
    (,8) The angle at which neutral light is emitted,           which
 throughout Stage I.     was  evanescent, gradually increases, till at
 the conclusion of Stage II. it becomes a right angle, viz. when
the light normally emitted is neutral.
     (7) The negative polarization of light emitted at angles less
 than the neutral angle, increases continually in intensity.
 Towards the close of Stage II. this negative, polarization is
 stronger than the normal positive polarization.         According to
 the experiments the direction of emission for maximum negative
 polarization seems always to have formed a very acute angle with
the beam.
    Stage       III.
                 A third stage appears to have been reached, in
 which the polarization was everywhere negative.         Here,
    (a) The polarization of light normally emitted, after vanishing
 at the conclusion of Stage II., reappears with changed sign;
1'.c. it    now negative.

 polarization  forms     very

   The description of the change of the direction of emission for
maximum polarization in (7) l. c. is as follows :—“ As the
actinic cloud grows coarser in texture, the direction of 2’ (emission
      “ maximum
for)                 polarization changes from the normal, enclosing
an angle more or less acute with the axis of the illuminating
beam.”      As this stands it would convey the impression that
this direction changed gradually from the normal.                There are
no detailed experiments with vapours on this point ; and they
would be very dif<U+FB01>cult to execute, on account of the in<U+FB02>uence of
the oblique incidence on the glass tube on the polarization.           But
here step in the experiments on smoke, recorded p. 4.37 (Radiant
Heat). No doubt there is an assumption in supposing that
these experiments are comparable with those on vapours; all
one can say    is,that the smoke experiments appear to correspond
with those on the vapour so far as direct observation of the latter
is  possible, and also generally in other respects. And, accord
ing to the smoke experiments, there            no doubt that what takes

very   acute angle   to  the beam.      Tyndall generally estimates this
angle of emission with the beam at 12°. But from his arrange
ments  it  seems doubtful whether this           not simply the smallest.
                                                 is
angle that could be conveniently observed. This point requires
more attention.       The observations seem to indicate an increase
of negative polarization close up to coincidence with the beam
-—a result which would appear impossible from the symmetry.

be the case when the cloud is homogeneous.                         (P. 435.) Tyndall
observed the track of a beam in air 18 feet                      long. The normal
polarization was the same                 throughout the whole length of the
beam.
     What is to be considered is really the nature of the emission
at any given angle with the axis of the beam.                          Instead, there
fore, of regarding the eye as <U+FB01>xed and the point of the beam
observed as variable, it is convenient to suppose a <U+FB01>xed point
of observation in the beam, and to imagine the position of the
eye varied, so as to observe rays making different angles with
the axis of the beam.                 We thus obtain the distribution of pola
rized light as emitted from a <U+FB01>xed point of the beam, and instead
of the neutral point of Tyndall we have a neutral angle.
     I  will take the description of three of Tyndall’s experiments
from p. 4-37 (‘Radiant Heat’).                    The laboratory was <U+FB01>lled with
smoke of some kind, and the electric beam sent through the
smoke.        The neutral angle and position of maximum polari
zation were observed, and the smoke gradually allowed to dis
perse.       The observation of the neutral angle was then repeated
at intervals.        Thus the earlier observations in each experiment
 correspond       to  the more advanced stage (coarser particles), and
the termination of each experiment to the less advanced stage
 (<U+FB01>ner particles).           Stage I. does not seem to have been reached ;
 and this might have been expected, as the <U+FB01>nest particles of
 smoke are probably coarser than the attenuated vapours of the
 exhausted tubes with which the phenomena of Stage I. were ob
 served.       I must remark that in the account of these experiments
 the actual character of the polarization (positive or negative) is
 not stated.        I  have assigned this by the consideration that, in
 the most attenuated condition of the smoke, the polarization of
light emitted normally is always positive.

   It is to be regretted that no observations are given, by the

uncertain, so far as these observations go, whether the pheno

of the beam, or symmetrical in the two quadrants.          The only

effect is perfectlyin accordance with all the other experiments ;
and the hypothesis which explains them, whatever it may be, will
also explain this.
   We have seen that, with three kinds of smoke, the variation
of the stage of advancement of the action is of a remarkably
limited character.     With the incense and gunpowder the
action was entirely within Stage IL, and the greatest variation
of the neutral angle was only 33° in the <U+FB01>rst experiment and
25° in the second.    It was only with the fumes of resin, “ ren
dered s0 dense as to he very irritating to the lungs,” that
Stage 111. was entered upon, and this, according to the descrip
tion, by only a little step.      This appears to indicate a certain
uniformity in the size of the particles which constitute the smoke
employed; and, at all events, the inference may be safely drawn
that smoke produced in any ordinary way is not likely to proceed
so far as the end of Stage II. Now what happened was that the
track of the beam in ordinary air was observed, not with a polari
meter, which would have given some sort of measure of the ratio
of polarized to common light, but with a selenite and Nicol, a
combination which gives no measure of the kind. For instance,
supposing light to contain half polarized and half common light.
Then, if the light he very faint, it will give with selenite and
Nicol a faint ring-system; if the light be stronger, the ring
 system will be stronger; in short, the indication depends as
much on the strength of the light as on its percentage compo
sition.   The indication of the polarimeter, on the contrary,              is,
or ought to be, independent of the strength of the light.
 Suppose, then, that into the faintluminosity of the beam in air           a
puff of smoke     is thrown in        state corresponding to the initial
                                      a
condition of experiments        or 2.

                                      is,
explanation; the increased light amply explains the increased
brilliancy of the ring-system.

that the particles may be of any size.        In fact, in the experiments
with tubes,  it was the natural course for them to begin, in Stage
I., much smaller than the smoke particles eVer are, and, passing
rapidly through Stage II. to indicate

to the sun, allowing for the variation in condition between those
beams that lie overhead and those that lie nearer the horizon.
We are thus led to the assumption of the line to the sun as an
axis instead of the two axes of Brewster drawn to the neutral
points.
   In the <U+FB01>rst instance we may regard as   small quantity the
                                                        a
variation between the maximum polarization     in zenith and
horizon.   Brewster allows only (30°—27°)=3° of his measure
R  for the normal difference.
   Employing, then, Brewster’s data, we may represent    to           R      a
<U+FB01>rst approximation thus :—
                 R=33<§° sin (0—181?) sin (0+1812~°),                        ‘
where   6   is  the angular distance from the sun of the point
observed.      This expression has the same value as Brewster’s
 <U+FB01>rst term throughout the plane of sun, zenith, observer, but re
 presents the rest of the sky as    traced
                                    if             by
                                                the revolution of that
 plane about the line to the sun.
    In the light of Tyndall’s experiments we now see that the
 diminution of maximum polarization from zenith to horizon
 may be regarded as due to    a  small advance in the stage or mean
 size of the diffracting particles.    It will be then best expressed
_by a  variation of the maximum polarization due to the zenith
 distance; and the formula becomes
        R: (335° — 3% sin     2)sin (0— 185°) sin     + 181,“).
                                                             (0
                                                                                     '
   The constant (3%) gives pretty closely the same horizontal
value (27°) as Brewster’s formula.        The observations do not
admit of any considerable accuracy    in fractions  of degrees.   The
variation from zenith to horizon deduced from some of Ruhenson’                  s
sets, and reduced to Brewster’s measure,          about 8°
                                                        is    and this

really accords better with some of Brewster’s observations than
the smaller value he employs.
   But, further,    it clear from the symmetry that the polariza
                         is
tion observed along the line to sun, excluding the effect of
indirect light, must be nil; for there      no reason why
                                              is                shouldit
be in one direction more than another.           We   must   therefore
introduce   afactor which will vanish along the solar line without

affecting the values in zenith and horizon at right angles to sun,
or the   evanescence at neutral points.       The formula now becomes
    R=   (33§°—3%° sin   MAW         .  sin (9—18%°). sin (6+18%°),
which represents all Brewster’s results, as well as the necessary
conditions inferred from the consideration of the experiments.
    n is here some large number which cannot be determined
without more evidence. The object is to get a factor which is
very nearly unity except for evanescent values of 0.
     For the sake of comparison, the following sketch (<U+FB01>gs.          III.
& IV.) is drawn on the same arrangement as Brewster’s maps,
showing the general course which the lines of equal polarization
must take under these circumstances.            Continuous lines repre
 sent the course of given values of positive polarization, dotted
lines of negative.
     The interval between the continuous and dotted lines represents
the neutral region, in which the neutral points lie.
     The projections of  III.  and IV. are the same as Brewster’s I.
and 11.    above  given.
     I have said that the symmetry requires the evanescence of the
polarization at the sun and antisolar point; and           I have repre
 sented this consideration in the above empirical formula by the
 factor \7 sin 0, where n is a large indeterminate number.               I
 have also pointed out that Tyndall’s experiments contain no
 evidence of this phenomenon.              There are, however, several
 observations of the sky which         I cannot attribute to any thing
 else.    About the antisolar point,       I  do not consider that the
 observations are of any value, as, strictly speaking, the direct
 rays of the sun can never fully reach the antisolar point when
 it is observed; but a neutral region immediately surrounding
 the sun has been observed on several occasions.                 Babinet
 observed    it as  a neutral  point    below  the  sun ;  Rubenson   ob
 served it above.     Babinet’s account is very clear (Comptes Ren
 dus, 1846, No. 2, p. 233).       Karsten, in Fortschritte der Pkysik,
 ii. (1846) p. 187, gives an account in which the neutral region close
 to the sun is explained as being Brewster’_ point ; the existence
 of negative polarization below it disproves this.
     Nothing has been said hitherto as to the variation of stage
 corresponding      to the variation of the zenith-distance of the
 observed point in the sky.       We have no polarimeter measures,
 in Tyndall’s experiments,     of the variation of the polarization of
 light normally emitted with the variation of the neutral angle.
 In the observations of the sky, however, we have some material,
 though not very direct, bearing on this point.           Observations of
 the distance of the neutral points from sun and antisolar point,
 at varying altitudes, occur in Brewster, and also observations of

              Polarization of the Light of          the    Sky.             .5l1

some few of these the general conclusion            may be drawn, that, in

Brewster infers that,     the sun were actually in the zenith,
                             if
the neutral points would coincide with it; but although he

512~               Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet         0a tlie
 states this as a fact, it is clearly only an inference.        If he had
 been led to connect the evanescence of the neutral angle with
 perfect polarization in a direction normal to the sun, he would
 hardly have said so.       As a general rule, the Zenith maximum
 polarization is about 30°, and the horizon maximum less, the
 zenith neutral angle small, and the horizon neutral angle about
 20°.    These data de<U+FB01>ne pretty nearly the relative stages.
     To gain some light on the general relation between the max
 imum polarization normal to beam and the neutral angle,                I
 formed a pair of corresponding values, by taking from Brewster’s
 observations eight sets of pairs of values, of four or <U+FB01>ve pairs
 each, all from good-days’ observations.        The polarizations taken
 were the horizon maxima.          Although observed in a direction at
 right angles to the neutral point, yet being about the same
 altitude (for Brewster generally observed the neutral point im
 mediately after it rose), in the mean of still days the air might
 be expected to be in the same condition in the two places.           The
 resulting pair of values     was :—
         Maximum polarization            Altitude of Arago’s point
              in horizon.                  above antisolar point.
                  25°                            20° 20'
    The observations of Arago’s Point are far superior to those
 of the other points, the observations of the latter being much
more dif<U+FB01>cult ;   I  therefore con<U+FB01>ned myself to the former.
    It was then natural to try and formulate the general relation
between the polarization and the neutral angle, bearing in
mind the terminal conditions, and requiring a somewhat close
agreement with the above normal value.           After numerous trials
I  hit upon the formula
                          sin a: tan (450— R),
where a is the neutral angle, and 45o—R the polarimeter angle
for normal emission.
    This satis<U+FB01>es the terminal conditions, making “=0 when
R=4~5° (Stage I.), and a=90° when R=O (end of Stage                  IL);
and fer R=25° we have a=21° 20', which is just a degree from
the value 20° 20' of the observations.
    To give some idea of the character of the observations the
following Table is subjoined ; it contains the eight means em
ployed above, each number being the mean of such observa~
tions on one day as have seemed to me to have been taken
under comparable circumstances.

             Considering the roughness of the methods of observation, and
          the considerable irregularities, the deviation of one degree from
          the result will not affect the representation of the general course
          of the observations.      I might extract any quantity of the ob
          servations;  but  it seems   better to leave them to be referred to

          is possible to represent their general course, as far as this point
          is concerned, better than by the above formula.       More nume
          rous and better observations may be hoped for at some future

          with the polarimeter, simultaneously with the observation of the

          furnish results the comparison of which with the above formula,

514                 Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet           on the
Rubenson’s observations are much complicated by the varia
tion of the time of day, so that there is a dif<U+FB01>culty in dis
entangling the effects ; and Brewster’s impression seems to have
been in favour of a smaller correction.    Some of his observa
tions, however, favour alarger one than he emplovs.      The point
will repay investigation.     Experiments made in Tyndall’s man
ner can hardly deal with this point.     In fact there can be no
doubt that when a beam is observed obliquely, the line of vision
travelling through a greater thickness of the beam than in the
normal position, the stage of the phenomenon is slightly more
advanced than in the normal position.                I
                                              have endeavoured to
imagine an arrangement of the experiments which should elimi
nate this eomplication*.       The case of the sky alone can at
present supply information on this point.     There we observe in
the zenith under the same conditions as in the position normal
to the experimental beam ; and in the horizon, at right angles
to the sun, we have the observation through an increased thick
ness, but still in a direction normal to the incident light.  This
advancement of the stage when the beam is regarded obliquely,
probably accounts in some measure for the fact that the direc
tion of emission for maximum negative polarization always forms
so small an angle with the incident beam.         The smaller this
was,      the greater will it be necessary to take n in the term
 (1/sin  in the above empirical formula.

   The theory of these phenomena has been treated by Lord
Rayleigh (see Phil. Mag. vol. xli. pp. 107, 274, 447, 519).
The few remarks     Ipropose to make on the general theory are
offered with dii<U+FB01>dence.    At present shall allude to only two
                                                 I

absurd in the idea of an inertia varying with the direction of
motion (p. 523).      But the physical hypothesis on which the
theory  then   proposed     built up

 principles of mechanics       so that any communication of energy
                                      ;
 between the tether and material particles must be effected by
 the action and reaction of pressures arising out of relative

                                          as far as can see, not      phy    I                    a
 sically conceivable   hypothesis.     And  when   we turn to the  mutual
 action, we have to make some additional hypothesis and intro
 duce forces originating in       different manner from the pressures
                                           a
 which act between any two bodies not mutually interpenetrable.
.Any hypothesis, for instance, which supposes mutual interpenetra
 tion excludes such analogies as that of Lord Rayleigh above re
 ferred to, in which the ellipsoid and surrounding <U+FB02>uid are cere
 tainly not supposed interpenetrable.          It seems to be that the
 hypothesis needed        something of this sort—that material bodies
                                 is
 are built up like     complex network in space, the interstices of
                             a
 which are considerable as compared with the space occupied by
 the material rods or points of which they consist.         The relation
 to the acther may be illustrated           supposing    such by  network                     a
 built up of rods like very <U+FB01>ne needles the whole could then be;
 pushed with ease into       mass of jelly.
                                      a         The jelly would separate
 before and close again after the rods as they passed through it.
 The separation of the jelly by the rods           not inconsistent withis
 its being substantially incompressible         but the result would be
                                                                   ;
 that the aether would be parted on each side of               solid body                 a
 moving through         to an extent depending on the ratio of the

 space occupied             by
                      the matter to that occupied by the aether within
 the body.        seems to me that some such hypothesis as this
                    It                                                                                 is
 necessary for any explanation of the facts of radiation and absorp
 tion;   and so far as     can see,
                                 I      would not be incompatible with

 the application of Green’s theory or of that proposed by Lord
  Rayleigh.          fully consistent with Lord Rayleigh’s treatment
                    It   is
  of the problem of the <U+FB01>rst stage of Tyndall’s clouds.             It also
  seems to me to afford an explanation of the phenomenon of re
  sidual blue.
     It only necessary to admit that the size of the particles in
       is
  the <U+FB01>rst stage     small, not only with respect to the wave-lengths,
                        is
  but also with respect to the amplitudes of the incident light.
  Consider then the stage at which the mean diameters of the
 particles        are equal to the amplitudes                      of the incident light.             (In
                                               L

5161                Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on       the
all cases in which residual blue has been observed, the diffract-»
ing matter has been in the state of vapour, and the particles
 would be spherical.)      Now the relative oscillation of a sphere
 through a space equal to its own diameter in a medium not en
 tirely penetrable by it must give rise to a displacement of the
 medium, some part of which will be at right angles to the direc
 tion of oscillation of the sphere ; and it is evident that the prin
 cipal term of this displacement will have a periodic time equal,
 to half that of the sphere itself.     (The relation has some resem
 blance to that between the vibrations of a tuning-fork and of a
 string attached to it at right angles to its length.) Under
 these circumstances a certain proportion of the incident red and
ultra-red rays would give rise to diffracted light of halved perio
 dic time, i. e. to ultra-violet and violet negatively polarized.
 This transformation, however, would soon disappear as the par
 ticles increased further in size.
     The second point I propose to allude to is as follows.       It ap
 pears to me that it is impossible that the inertia of the material
 particles can in general be the source of the diminished velocity
 of light within transparent bodies. For if the inertia of the par
 ticles acts in this way, they must, whether they oscillate them
 selves or not, absorb energy in the manner of a friction-brake;
 it is impossible that they should act as loads to the aether, and
not themselves absorb energy; and the energy so absorbed
must be converted into heat.        It should therefore always be the
case that the greater refractive index corresponds to the greater
absorption, if it be true that the inertia of the particles is always
the source of the refraction.        But this is not the case.      For
instance, in glass the absorption of rays of high refrangibility is
very small; whereas the heat-rays of low refrangibility are almost
entirely absorbed.     Other similar instances will occur to every
one.
    A  few words may be said as to the formula
                        sin a = tan (45°—I{)    .
a is the neutral    angle, sin 2B the polarization of light emitted
normally.
    Let A be the mean amplitude of the diffracted light in the
plane normal to the beam, B parallel to the axis of the beam.
In the <U+FB01>rst stage 13:0; in the second B increases up to B=A,
which marks the termination of the second stage.

and if we de<U+FB01>ne R by the condition that polarization = sin          2R,
we have at once 2¢=90°—2R, or ¢=45°—R.                  (Brewster’s  ¢ is

 simple law.    Regarding the experiments alone, there   nothing                                  is
to show that this explanation       not correct, except the pro

observed stratum,       connected with the advancement of the
                           is
stage.   But   the sky-observations are conclusive, and show at
once that this explanation will not hold; for there, as      have                                     I
already said, we observe directly the change of stage  due to the

    variation of thickness from zenith to the horizon, and it is quite
    insuf<U+FB01>cient to admit of this explanation.
       If we admit that A9 and A2 cos2 0+B2 represent the vertical
    and horizontal components in the case in which 9 is not the neu
    tral angle, we have for the polarization

       Now    it  true that this assumption

    The formula of Brewster appears to be founded on experiment.
It was <U+FB01>rst given in Phil. Trans. vol. cxx. (1830) pp. 136, 141,
The formula is cot ¢= cos?” (i—i'), where ¢=R+45°, so that
cot ¢= tan (45°—R) ; i is the angle of incidence, z" the angle of
refraction, and n the number of plates.         It would appear that in
Brewster’s paper(Edinb. Trans. vol. xxiii. p. 233) the formula is
erroneously quoted, the 2 in the index being omitted. Brewster
calculated by this formula the polarization corresponding to
various inclinations for the glasses he employed.
    In the paper of Professor Adams above referred to, Tables are
given for a few inclinations for four plates and for two values of
a, and general expressions are given for any case. The mode
of statement is more direct than that of Brewster.            It    how-.is,
ever, obvious that this method must always be subject to consi,
derable uncertainty.      It impossible, by any means with which
                                is
I  am acquainted, to verify the refractive index of the glass of
which the plates are composed; and looking to the mode in which
the plates are formed, the assumption even that the glass of all the
plates has the same refractive index must be of doubtful admis—
sibility while the asSumption that

sample of which the refractive index has been determined, seems
to introduce  a   still more considerable element of uncertainty.
At the same time there           no doubt that
                                is                  <U+FB01>rst approximation
                                                         a
to the truth may be got in this way.        The variationin the colour
of the light observed would also seem to be          source of error.

    The second method      is that employed             by
                                                  Rubenson, which has
been already alluded to.        The polarization corresponding to the
different inclinations of the glass bundle             determined
                                                             is                by   a
process   of graduation,   which     somewhat
                                     is          as follows.    Polarized
light issues  from a   N icol’s prism,  and falls  upon     quarter-wave
                                                                    a

cular to the axis on which the glass bundle turns, the bundle
being arranged so as to compensate the resulting polarization.
If, then, the angle between the plane of polarization of the Nicol
and the axis of the plate be        the intensities of the components

    The objections to this proceeding are :—-<U+FB01>rst, that we depend
on the accuracy of the quarter-wave plate, where we may have
error of workmanship, and must have error arising from varia

our determinations   ;   and strictly speaking we cannot trust the
 accuracy of this law beyond the point to which            has been car
                                                                    it

ried by actual measures; and, again, we make the assumption
that the polarization of elliptically polarized light is determined
by the same laws as the polarization of partially polarized light—
an assumption which it would seem desirable to avoid in deter
minations of an absolute character.           Now the measure of the
ratio in which polarized light and common light are mixed can,
theoretically at least, be performed by a direct process which
 does not involve any intermediate law, whether theoretical or
empirical.    It is only necessary to provide two apertures which
shall admit polarized and common light in known propor
tions, to superpose these lights, and determine by observation
the inclination of the glass bundle employed which will neu
tralize the polarization.      I  have not constructed any such ar
rangement;     I have been unable, in fact, as yet, to devote any
resources to the practical part of the question, in consequence of
the large demands made on me by the construction of instru
ments in another branch of inquiry; but           I propose to describe
the outline of an arrangement for this purpose which might be
                                                                     -
constructed.
   A simple lens of some feet focal distance is cut in half and
mounted in the manner of a heliometer; the micrometer arrange
ment is not required, only that the two images given may be
made to coincide and separate at pleasure.              In front of each
half of the lens a screen is mounted, with an aperture the area
of which can be regulated by a micrometer-screw.                 A Nicol’s
prism large enough      to  supply   the  whole  of one   of the apertures
with polarized light, is placed in front of it. A simple lens, or
Ramsden’s eyepiece, may be employed to view the images.                The
sun may be viewed through a dark glass or any ordinary source
of unpolarized light directly.        The images are separated, their
brightness   compared,     and  the  movable    apertures adjusted until
the brightness of the two images is the same.               This furnishes
the values of  the  two  apertures    which  admit the same amount of
light when the Nicol is in front of one. By the micrometer
arrangement either area can be altered in a known proportion,
taking care always to keep the aperture behind the Nicol a good
deal smaller than that of the prism.           The two images are then
superposed 3   and  a single  image  is thus  formed,  in which polarized
and    common    light    are   mixed    in  known     proportions.    We
have only to observe the inclination of the glass bundle of the
polarimeter required to compensate this polarization for varied
proportions of common and polarized light; and the instrument
will he graduated independently of instrumental data, except
such as can be veri<U+FB01>ed at any time and independently of any
hypothesis.

   The effectiveness of a polarimeter for the purpose of observing
values of polarizatiOn such as occur in the sky at right angles to
the sun is determined by different conditions from those required
for the observation of neutral points, and of negative polariza—
tion such as occurs in the sky. For the former purpose a very
sensitive test-object is not needed, but it is required to know
the values of the inclinations of the glass bundle.    For the latter
purpose, on the other hand, it is necessary to have a test-object
of the utmost delicacy ; and the glass bundle interferes so much
with the observations, that it seems generally best to discard               it,
and employ simply the most delicate polariscope attainable.                 I
have constructed      polarimeter out of the materials

and the glass bundle consists of ten thin plates.       If the values
of the inclinations of the bundle were known,        the  instrument
would be admirably adapted for the measure of maximum polari
zations, the overlapping portion of the biquartz forming         test   a
object of amply suf<U+FB01>cient delicacy.       But with this instrument,
observing certainly for the most part under very unfavourable
circumstances,  I   have never yet been able to distinguish the
 neutral points or negative polarization in the sky.
   Brewster’s test-object appears to have been much more sensi
tive.   The polariscope was presented to him                 by
                                                       Babinet.    To
give the appearance shown in the drawing of the neutral line at
p. 213 (Edinb. Trans. vol. xxiii.),        must have been of great
                                             it
delicacy.    It consisted of  the  well-known   arrangement of two
wedges   0f rock-crystal  with  the axes crossed.

sired that both observations and experiments should be insti

in bringing the subject before astronomers.          And we might
learn much     ifProfessor Tyndall were to resume, or some other
physicist to take up, the experimental inquiry.

                        that     given number be expressed in

has the same remainder to 8 as the given number has, n being
the number of integer digits in the given number, and 111 being
the number of digits on the right-hand side of the decimal
p oint.
   The simplest form of the theorem from which the above ex
pansion can be made is the statement as put forth in the <U+FB01>rst
paper on the subject*, namely :-—“ that if! he the tens’ and u the
units’ digit of a two-<U+FB01>gure number, and 3 be any integer less
than 10, then
                              —
                          (10   5)t + it
has the same remainder to 8 as 10t+u.”     The following proof
of this simplest statement is also applicable to the expanded
forms of the theorem.   By multiplication,
                (IO—8)t+u=10t-—3t+u= (10t+u)—8t;
but the latter expression_only di<U+FB02>'ers from (101+u) by an exact
number of times 8.     Further, if the digits be     u, the same    .9,   t,
istrue of (10—8)9s+(10—8)t+'u, and so on; for each time 10
occurs as    factor
                a             in
                       any term,      must be treated in the way
                                               it
above indicated.
   12. Another proof of the general theorem may be given, by
induction.          Itwell known that the addition of the two-<U+FB01>gure
                         is
digits (excepting 99) in the nine-times multiplication table
always gives nine.       If method of obtaining similar property
                                   a                            a
in other numerals were discovered, the remainders to division by
the said numerals would be found without using the operation
of division    for
                ;      the process left any unit, and
                         if                                  the unit were
                                                                    if
not already    less   than   the   divisor,     would
                                                    it  be reducible  to a
quantity less than the divisor, and therefore to the remainder
required,       by
                simple subtraction.         In the case of the nine-times
table, the following are instances :—9 3:27,’ and        .           7=9       2
                                                                               +       ;
and9.3+4=31, and 3+1=4.
   To oblige the multiplication table of any digit to constantly
yield the digit itself (by          process analogous to casting out
                                        a
the nines),   the   units   will   certainly have to be added; what
other operation the remainder of the digits must be subjected
to     the problem to be solved.
      is                                      The operation of addition
(when      does
           it     not  involve   factors)      clearly not suf<U+FB01>cient
                                                 is                    for,        ;
as an operation,         admits of remainders that are no function
                          it
of the divisor, except in the case of the nine-times Table.
This consideration, combined with the inspection of, say, the

eight-times Table, shows that it is the multiplier 2 which is
wanted for the tens digit, to reduce the series 8, 16, 24, 32,
&c. to the form 8, 8, 8, 8, 8w. ; for (calling the result of the
operation Usz'), U88=8, U816=2. 1 +6=8, U824=2.2 +4=8,
U832=2 . 3+2=8, &c. The foregoing points also tend to
prove that the operation for the S-times table (or Use) is clearly
one of multiplication by (10—8), in respect of the tens’ digit;
accordingly 3 is the multiplier for the 7-times Table, 4 for the
6-times Table, and so on.        On reducing the theorem to general
terms from these particular results, it appears that the remainder
to a given divisor (3)=(10—3)t+u, if the dividend be 10t+u.
This expression is now in a condition to be further expanded
into the formula given in article 11.              I
    13. In this place it may be convenient to elucidate the me
thods of unitation employed in practice, although this point was
alluded to in the <U+FB01>rst paper on unitation.           Practically, to uni
tate a given number, it is best to commence at the left hand,
using the multiplier appropriate to the base of unitation, and
adding in the next <U+FB01>gure to the right hand, at each step of the
operation.       As soon as any number higher than 9 arises, the
result should be reduced (by a continued repetition of the pro
cess) to a single <U+FB01>gure, and the operation itself continued until
only a single <U+FB01>gure results therefrom.           For example, 118313
has the multiplier 2, and the operation is
       2 . 3-l-1=7;      2 . 7+3=173 2. 1+7=9; 9—8=1;
           '.   U8313=1.
In this case all <U+FB01>gures higher than hundreds do not in<U+FB02>uence the
result.     Again, U7515 has the multiplier 3, and the operation is
       3 .5+1=16; 3. 1+6=9; 9—7=2;                    3 . 2+5=11;
              3 . 1+1=4.;        U,515=4.
In   some cases    it is simpler to obtain the unitate by dividing the
given number by the base of the system.
    14. In most arithmetical works, the St. Andrew’s cross, ems
ployed by Lucas de Burgo and others, is still used to formulate
the casting out of the nines.          The methods which unitation
discloses, all point to operating with the unitat-es in'the equa
tional form.       The following examples show this practical point.

the greater, the remainder would be exactly divisible by 9.           The
statement was then extended to deriving the second number from
the <U+FB01>rst by transposing the <U+FB01>gures of the <U+FB01>rst in any order.
The proof of this theorem by unitation presents some interesting
points, inasmuch as it shows how this property of numbers may
 be expanded still further.
     If B be the number thus derived from the given number A,
 then U9A=U9B.           For A and B have the same digits, and the
 order

 B   be greater than    A) gives no remainder.
     Further, the derived number may have either noughts, or
 nines, or multiples of nine in addition to or in defect of those
 in the original number, and the theorem will still be true.
                               '
 For example,
         105063259723       — 153362752     = 104909896971,     and
         U904)      =U(16—7).=9,
 which is the unitate of 1041909896971.
     16. The derived number may be formed from the given numd
 her by other methods, so that the remainder to the subtraction
 may have other properties ; unitation suggests these properties
 and furnishes proofs of the same.         If dots or marks be made at
  equal  intervals over   the  digits of the given number, or a part of
  the given number, and (having regard to the relative position of
  the marked digits in the number) if the marked digits be trans
  posed among themselves, the remainder will be exactly divisible
  by some number composed entirely of ones, as 1111 for instance,
  also by some other number composed entirely of nines, as 9999
  for instance, the number of ones or of nines in the divisor being
  a+ 1, if a be the number of intervals.         If the marks be placed
  over the 1st, 3rd, 5th, Ste. digits (leaving one interval), the re
  mainder will be divisible by 99 and 11, if over the 1st, 5th,
  9th, 13th, 860. digits (leaving three intervals), the divisors will
  be 1111 and 9999, and so on.
      For if the unitation formula (see article 11) be arranged so
  as to assume the form
                (IO—8)3'3l+ (10— 8)“o + (10-8)3r + u,
  and 111 substituted therein for 5, each term (when unitated to
  the base 111) will be found to have +1 for its coef<U+FB01>cient.            In
  this case the substitution gives negative values to every second
  term commencing with the second from the right hand; but the
   subsequent unitation of these values, taken as positive quanti_

ties, gives —1, showing that each coef<U+FB01>cient is —( -—1)= +1.
Other cases may be proved by similar means.       When 999 is
substituted for 8 in the above form, the coef<U+FB01>cients, reduced
                                                        '
ny unitation, are also = + 1.
   The following example illustrates this property in regard to
the divisors 111 and 999, the giVen number being the lesser
of the two.

  1’7.  Some years ago Mr. Henry Butter, of educational cele-i
brity, showed  the writer a property of the decimal equivalent to the
reciprocal  of 19.    The right-hand <U+FB01>gure of the recurring period
of this decimal   is 1 ; and the whole period may be constructed
from the right-hand end by using the multiplier 2 to obtain the
next <U+FB01>gure, towards the left, from the previous one, adding in the
tens’ digit that may be carried from the previous product.       The
decimal equivalent thus produced is
                      ,1, =~O5263157894736842i.
Considering this property with reference to unitation, and be
lieving the case not to be an isolated one, the writer has
ascertained that certain decimal fractions can be formed from
the right-hand end by means of the coef<U+FB01>cients of certain systems
of unitates.                              p

 temperature of the simple spark or non-luminous gas-<U+FB02>ame.
 With increased intensity of light continuous spectra are often
   roduced, in consequence of which many of the feebler lines,
 which would otherwise be perfectly apparent by contrast, more
 or less escape recognition.      The fact, <U+FB01>rst announced by Kirch
 hoff,  that  the relative intensity of the individual lines does not
 alter proportionately with increase in temperature of the source
 of light, explains the other fact that these lines, which are
 relatively feeblest in the <U+FB02>ame-spectrum, sometimes become the
 most marked in the spark-spectrum, as is especially the case
 with the spectrum of lithium. On the other hand, the appa
 rently contradictory fact has been noticed, that the <U+FB02>ame-spec
 trum of several substances is much sharper and richer in lines
 than the spark-spectrum ; for instance, the lines which are so
 characteristic in the <U+FB02>ame-spectra of caesium and of rubidium
 disappear, the former entirely, the latter to a less degree, in the
 spark-spectra of the same elements.           This, however, is easily
explained when we consider that the light proceeding to the slit
from the glaring mass of <U+FB02>ame (which is of larger dimensions
although not of so high temperature as the spark) is of greater
intensity than that which proceeds from the train of sparks,
where the quantity of gas is very limited although of extremely
high temperature.         Those substances whose spectra become
apparent at low temperatures are best examined in the gas
<U+FB01>ame, and not with the spark. The principal spectra belonging
to this class are those of the alkalies, of the alkaline earths, of
iridium, thallium, and some others.            Such spectra are most
perfectly produced by bringing         the  little beads to be tested
supported on the unlooped end of a very <U+FB01>ne platinum wire,
into the fusion-zone of a non-luminous gas-<U+FB02>ame.
    From these considerations it follows that the practical appli
cation of spectra necessitates the possibility of a variation in
the spark-temperature within not too wide limits, and the choice
of a breadth of slit, to be maintained throughout the observation,
by which a suf<U+FB01>cient separation of the characteristic lines shall
be secured without such a diminution of the light as may
prevent a clear perception of the spectrum.            In laboratories,
where one prism only is commonly used in the observation of
spark-spectra, these conditions are most easily ful<U+FB01>lled by nar
rowing the slit until the two characteristic bands of yttrium
chloride in the red are resolved into a distinctly perceptible mass

    In our <U+FB01>rst memoir on spectral analysis we stated that the
 spectra of the elements are by no means always identical with
 the spectra of their compounds.     Such an identity, it is true, is
often noticed, especially in the case of those elements which,
when in the state of glowing vapour, give out homogeneous
light; yet it appears to me that the question as to the apparent
or real nature of this identity has not as yet been deCided, in
                                                                      '

    Although sodium vapour, as have before pointed out, exhi
bits dark lines at the temperature of boiling mercury (much
below a red heat), and although these lines are observed, reversed
as bright lines, in the glowing vapour of all volatile sodium com
pounds, nevertheless we cannot as yet <U+FB01>nally decide whether
these similar spectra are derived from the element as well as
from its compounds, or whether they are derived from the
element alone, set free by the decomposition of the compound
bodies.     How this question may be solved is of little importance
in the practical application of spectral analysis.   It concerns us
merely    to remember that the spectrum of      an   element  is not
always independent of the compound in which it occurs, and
 that it therefore appears necessary to choose certain <U+FB01>xed com
 pounds for the recognition of the various elements.
    The chlorides were employed in these researches, as in our
<U+FB01>rst investigation, on account of their volatility, and of the ease
with which they may be prepared. The order in which the spectra
appear when a mixture of chlorides is vaporized by the <U+FB02>ame
or spark, depends upon the relative quantities and volatility of
the chlorides.    If a substance, volatile only at high tempera
tures and giving a well-marked line-spectrum,         be mixed with
increasing proportions of another, volatile at low temperatures
but giving no spectrum, the spectrum of the former is gradually
rendered less marked until at last it can scarcely be recognized.
If both substances give line-spectra, the spectrum of the more
volatile is generally <U+FB01>rst observed; and it is only when this has
become very faint by repeated moistening with hydrochloric acid
and strong heating, that the spectrum of the more di<U+FB01>icultly vola
tile substance comes into view. This phenomenon <U+FB01>nds its
explanation in the circumstance that the temperature of the
heated mixture is always equal to the volatilization temperature
of the least volatile of the substances contained in       it,
                                                             so that
those ubstances which are volatile at        a higher temperature
cannot as yet be vaporized.

    The carbon points of the spark-apparatus, when dry, or when
moistened with hydrochloric acid, gave no spectrum, provxded
they had been thoroughly cleaned by the method already
described; this was shown by the fact that the sparks passing
between them in an atmosphere of hydrogen showed only the
less characteristic lines of the latter.                               _
    The sparks which passed in the air during the spectral obser;
vations showed therefore only the air-lines of oxygen, nitrogen,
and hydrogen.
    This air-spectrum is given in the <U+FB01>rst line of each of the
spectral Tables (Plates III.—V.), so that no confusion may be
made between it and the lines which show the presence of
the individual elements.

           1. Spectra of the Elements of the Alkali Group.
    The pure chlorides, whose spectra are shown in Plates III. and
 IV.,  nos. 1 to 6, were prepared as follows :—
    Sodium chloride, prepared from hydrochloric acid and sodium
carbonate, was puri<U+FB01>ed by washing with concentrated hydro
chloric acid and repeated recrystallization.
    Pure potassium chloride was prepared by strongly heating~
potassium chlorate which had been six times recrystallized.
    The material with which I determined the atomic weights of
 caesium and rubidium, and which was prepared in a state of great
purity by a method described elsewhere, was used as the source
of the salts of these metals.
    Thallium chloride, precipitated by hydrochloric acid from the
 sulphate, was puri<U+FB01>ed by repeated crystallization.                   V
    The exceedingly pure preparation of lithium with which the
 atomic weight of that metal was determined by Mr. Diehl in my
 laboratory, served for the production of the lithium-spectrum.
    The whole of these chlorides were easily and completely
 volatilized when supported on platinum wire in the non-luminous
 gas-<U+FB02>ame.       Test quantities of them, prepared by fractidnal
 crystallization, showed not the smallest trace of impurities when
 tested in the spectrum-apparatus.      A glance at Plate  III. is suf<U+FB01>
 cient to convince one that all of the members of the alkali group
 may be recognized by their <U+FB02>ame-spectra much more easily than
 by their spark-spectra. Not atrace of the potassium-chloride lines
 appears in the spark-spectrum ; those of rubidium and caesium
 chloride are very faint; while, on the other hand, the <U+FB02>ame
 spectra of these substances are produced with the greatest clca‘i';
ness and beauty.                                                         _
    The elements of the alkali group are therefore always to be
                                                                    ‘

             Prof. R. Bunsen’s Spectral-Analytical  Researches.     531
       If  the whole of the six members of this group be present
   together, the recognition 'of lithium, thallium, and sodium is so
   little in<U+FB02>uenced by the presence of the others, that quantities of
   these elements which escape detection by any other means are
  rendered evident with ease.
     ‘ The detection   of traces of the other three elements when
  they are mixed with these, as is usually the case in nature, is
  not, however, so easy a matter, because in the presence of
  potassium and sodium continuous spectra appear, which greatly
V destroy the visibility of the other lines.
       The following precess is adopted in order to remove these
  continuous spectra—so far, at least, as to enable one to detect
  With certainty the smallest traces of potassium, caesium, and
  rubidium when present together, which can be recognized in no
  other way.
       The chlorides are precipitated with platinum chloride as doua
  ble salts: the precipitation must take place in a cold conceni
  trated solution, in order that the double salts may be thrown
  down in a <U+FB01>nely divided and, as far as possible, non-crystalline
  condition.      The precipitate is boiled in a platinum vessel, 20
  Or 30 times, with a little water, which is each time removed by
  decantation, 'a small quantity being tested at intervals in the
  spectrum-apparatus.       For this purpose a,few milligrammes are
  brought on to a little piece of moistened <U+FB01>lter-paper, which is
  then surrounded by a very <U+FB01>ne platinum wire and exposed to the
  upper oxidati0n zone of the non-luminous <U+FB02>ame until the paper
  is completely burned away; the salt is then brought into the
  fusion zone of the <U+FB02>ame placed before the slit of the spectro
  scope.     After the <U+FB01>rst treatment with boiling water, the potas
  sium-line generally appears beside those of lithium and sodium;
  as the boiling continues the caesium and rubidium-lines become
  gradually more and more apparent.          Small traces of thallium,
  which are often present in mineral waters, begin to make their
  appearance only towards the end of the washing with boiling
  water.
        2. Spectra of the Elements of the Alkaline-Earth Group.
       Nos. 7 to 10, Plates 1V. and V., show the spectra of the
  chlorides of calcium, strontium, barium, and magnesium.
       Sulphate of magnesium, puri<U+FB01>ed from lime and iron by
  repeated crystallization, served as the material from which mag
  nesium chloride was prepared.
       Barium and strontium chlorides, after repeated treatment
  with hot alcohol, were puri<U+FB01>ed by crystallization.
       Calcium chloride, prepared from limestone free from iron,
  magnesia, and manganese, was crystallized from absolute alcohol.
                                  2 M 2

             Prof. R. Bunsen’s Spectral-Analytical Researches.
    The characteristic      line of magnesium (Plate V. no'. 10),
corresponding with Fraunhof'er’s line b, appears only in the
spark-spectrum, where, however, it is situated so near to another
line (75) that it is with di<U+FB02>iculty distinguished from it.
      In order therefore to recognize magnesium, it is necessary to
substitute hydrogen or coal-gas for the air in which the spark
usually passes.         The little apparatus represented in <U+FB01>g. 5,
Plate II. serves for this purpose. The glass vessel A is furnished
with a good caoutchouc stopper, through two holes in which pass
platinum wires connected with the carbon-points a, B.             These
wires are fused into small mercury cups.        The glass tubes b and
c pass through two other holes in the stopper; 6 is connected
with a Dobereiner’s hydrogen-generating          apparatus; 0 carries
 off the replaced air, and is stopped (when      the  air has all been
 driven out of A) by an india-rubber cap.                        f
                                                  The <U+FB01>ne wire con
 ducts the current to the mercury-cup, whence it passes by the
 small platinum connexion to the carbon point, and so returns
 by the other wire g to the battery.
      In order to detect small traces of strontia and baryta when
 these occur (as is often the casein mineral waters and rocks)
 mixed with a large amount of lime, the bases are converted into
 nitrates and digested with small quantities of absolute alcohol.
 The small quantities of strontium and barium nitrates which
 remain, or which precipitate after some hours, are collected upon
 a very small <U+FB01>lter and washed with alcohol; the <U+FB01>lter is then
 surrounded by an exceedingly <U+FB01>ne platinum wire, and burned in
 the upper oxidation zone ; the ash is treated with a drop of hydro
 chloric acid, which is applied by means of a capillary tube; and
 the chlorides thus formed are examined in the <U+FB02>ame-spectrum.
 If, in addition to the sodium-line, the spectrum of strontium is
 alone visible, the substance on the wire must be repeatedly
 heated and moistened with hydrochloric acid; the barium-spec
  trum is then seen, if the minutest trace of that metal be present.
       Small traces of calcium and strontium may be detected in
  barium minerals by digesting the three bases, previously con
  verted into chlorides, with the smallest possible quantity of
  absolute alcohol and evaporating the liquid.      The residue, which
  is sometimes scarcely visible, is taken up by a slip of <U+FB01>lter
  paper; the paper is burned on a platinum wire, and the ash,
  while being repeatedly heated and moistened with hydrochloric
  acid,
    '
           is examined in the <U+FB02>ame-spectrum.
       If it he wished to detect minute traces of calcium and barium
  in strontium minerals, this may be effected by treating the
  chlorides with cold and then with hot alcohol.             Calcium is
  found in the <U+FB01>rst, strontium in the later, and barium in the
  last washings.

    The sulphates of the barium group are not suf<U+FB01>ciently vola
tile to afford <U+FB02>ame-spectra.     In order to convert these salts into
chlorides, the portion under examination is wrapped in several
folds of paper, supported on a <U+FB01>ne platinum wire and heated in
the oxidation-<U+FB02>ame until the paper is reduced to ash; the <U+FB02>ame
is then made luminous, whereby the sulphate is reduced to sul
phide; andthis salt is converted into chloride by a drop of
hydrochloric acid applied by means of a capillary tube.
    In these reactions the substance under examination should
be repeatedly heated in the oxidation-<U+FB02>ame and moistened with
hydrochloric acid in order to remove the sodium compounds,
the continuous spectra of which often greatly obscure the lines
in the spectra of the chlorides.
           3. Spectra of the Elements of the Earl/L Group.
    The chlorides of aluminium and beryllium do not exhibit
lines, either in the <U+FB02>ame- or spark-spectra, whereby they may
be recognized.
     The spectra of the chlorides obtained from the so-called cerite
 and ytterite earths are mapped in Plate V., nos. 11 to 14.
    As the separation of these earths presents very considerable
 dif<U+FB01>culties, and as the methods hitherto employed do not yield
 altogether satisfactory results, it appears to me to be necessary
 that  I  should say something concerning the preparation of the
 perfectly pure material with which the spectra hereafter de
scribed were obtained.
     Cerite from Utoe was pulverized and mixed in a Hessian basin
 with concentrated sulphuric acid in quantity suf<U+FB01>cient to <U+FB01>ll the
 basin to one third; the excess of acid was removed by strongly
 heating the dish,- the powdered residue was mixed with water at
 0° 0., care being taken that no rise of temperature should
 ensue; the solution was separated by <U+FB01>ltration from the solid
 matter, which was again treated with sulphuric acid, &c.       From
 the solution saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen (in order to
 remove arsenic,molybdenum,bismuth,       copper, and lead), strongly
 acidi<U+FB01>ed with hydrochloric acid and oxidized by chlorine, the
 oxalates of cerium, lanthanum, and didymium were precipitated
 by means of oxalic acid.        The oxides, obtained by strongly
 heating the precipitated oxalates, were dissolved in nitric acid,
 and the solution was evaporated to the consistence of a syrup
 over the water-bath.      By dissolving the mass after cooling in
 cold water, and boiling the liquid for some time with water con
 taining 2 cub. centims. of concentrated sulphuric acid per litre,
 the greater part of the cerium was precipitated as basic sulphate
  (three litres of the acidi<U+FB01>ed water were required for 250
 grammes of cerite).

534      Prof. H. Bunsen’s Spectral-Analytical     Researches.
    The precipitate was washed with acidi<U+FB01>ed water, dissolved in
a slight excess of dilute sulphuric acid, and the solution repre
cipitated by pouring into a litre of boiling water.      The solution,
precipitation, and washing were repeated two or three times
 before every impurity was removed from the precipitate.         After
these processes the greater part of the cerium remains in solu
 tion, so that- but a few grammes of the pure cerium compound
 are obtained from 100 grammes of the mixed oxides.
    A pure product may be obtained from the various liquids
 collected during the processes by treating them as described
above.
    The perfect purity of the substance thus obtained was shown
 by the following behaviour :—
    The pale-yellow hydrated oxide precipitated by caustic potash
 from the solution of the basic sulphate, when treated with
 chlorine in a concentrated solution of caustic potash, yielded a.
 deep orange-red oxidation product, without the solution (although
 saturated with chlorine) taking up the smallest trace of a foreign
 earth.   Cerium oxide, after being strongly heated in the air, is
of a pure yellowish white colour, which changes to orange while
the oxide is hot.       The sulphate does not give the smallest
precipitate (thorium oxide) when warmed with sodium dithio
nate.    The oxalate is to a considerable extent soluble in am
monium oxalate solution, but is entirely reprecipitated on dilu
tion with cold water. Small quantities obtained in this way by
 fractional precipitation, when converted into chlorides, showed
one and the same spark-spectra when examined, and gave no
indication of the lines peculiar to lanthanum or yttrium.          No
appearance     of the  absorption-spectra   of didymium     or erbium
could be obtained with any of the concentrated cerium solu
tions.
    In Pltae V. no. 13 e, is shown the spark-spectrum obtained
with the chloride of this pure cerium material; the most impor
tant lines, which are not, however, very characteristic,           are
situated at 68, 71, and '79.     The preparation of pure lanthanum
compounds is best commenced with the liquid from which basic
cerium sulphate has been for the <U+FB01>rst time precipitated by
means of boiling acidi<U+FB01>ed water.          This liquid is boiled with
natural pulverized magnesite, whereby the greater part of the
dissolved cerium oxide is precipitated.          After removing the
precipitate, oxalic acid is added to the liquid acidi<U+FB01>ed with
hydrochloric acid; the precipitate which is formed is strongly
heated in a porcelain crucible till the oxalic acid is decomposed ;
the oxides thus formed are dissolved in sulpphuric acid; the
solution is evaporated, diluted with water, and again boiled with
magnesite.     The liquid, which yet contains traces of cerium, is

    several times subjected to the same treatment with oxalic acid
    and magnesite ; the oxides are at last dissolved in sulphuric acid,
    the acid is removed by evaporation, and the salt is heated to
    incipient redness. In order to obtain from this salt a lantha
    num compound perfectly free from didymium, the original pro;
   cess of Mosander is the simplest and safest.              The dehydrated
    sulphate  is dissolved  in  small quantities   of  water  at 0° to 5° C. ,
   the liquid is warmed until the lanthanum salt precipitates in
   the form of a soft white mass of small needles; this mass is
   placed in a funnel heated to 100° C., and the mother liquor
    (which is set aside for the preparation of didymium salts) is
   removed by means of the water air-pump.                  The mass dehy
   drated at an incipient red heat is treated in the same way six
   or eight times.      A layer 0'2 millim. thick of a concentrated
                                                                         ‘
   solution of pure lanthanum sulphate shows no trace of the
   absorption-lines of didymium or erbium, nor, after conversion
   into chloride and testing in the spark-spectrum, any of the lines
   of cerium or yttrium. Samples of lanthanum oxalate, obtained
   from this material by fractional precipitation, exhibited, when
   converted into chlorides, no differences in the number, position,
   and relative intensity of their lines.
      Lanthanum oxalate comports itself towards ammonium oxa
  late in the same manner as the corresponding cerium salt; the
  fractional precipitates from ammonium oxalate show the same
  spectra throughout.         Lanthanum chloride gives no <U+FB02>ame-spec—
  trum ; but it is characterized by a very brilliant spark-spectrum
  rich in lines, no. 14 e, Plate V.
      The <U+FB01>rst mother liquor from the lanthanum sulphate is the
  starting-point in the preparation of pure didymium compounds.
  The methods hitherto put forward for the purifying of didymium
  compounds yield substances in which                 lanthanum is easily
  detected by the spark-spectrum.         The removal of these impuri~
  ties is carried out by me as follows :—If didymium sulphate,
  prepared according to Mosander’s original directions, be decom
_ posed by oxalic acid gradually added, the oxalates of didymium
  and lanthanum, which are at <U+FB01>rst precipitated, are again dis
  solved, until a point is reached when, upon the further addition
  of acid and shaking, the formation of a permanent crystalline
  amethyst-coloured       precipitate commences.          This <U+FB01>rst part of
  the precipitate    is  rich  in  didymium;     it  is  separated from the“
  other part, which contains larger quantities         of-lanthanum.     The
  precipitate is converted into neutral dehydrated didymium sul
  phate, which is again treated in the way just described; and
  this treatment is repeated until the last product does not exhibit
  any lanthanum-lines in the spark-spectrum.
  A The spark-spectrum        of pure didymium chloride exhibits, as is

536      Prof. R. Bunsends spectral-Analytical Researches.
seen   in Plate V. no. 15 e, faint lines in the neighbourhood of
70; but these lines are not suf<U+FB01>ciently marked to serve as
a test for the presence of this substance.     The absorption-spec
trum of the solid or dissolved didymium salts, however, is so
characteristic as to afford a means for detecting the smallest
trace of the element in any liquid which is not very strongly
coloured by foreign subtstances.      No. 15 a, Plate V., gives the
absorption-spectrum     of a crystal of didymium sulphate 0'4
millim. in thickness.
    Considerable doubt attaches itself to the purity of the
thorium oxide prepared according to the methods hitherto in
use. An inquiry into the behaviour of perfectly pure thorium
chloride in the spark-spectrum-apparatus       was therefore neces
sar  .
    %rangite, from Brewig in Norway, was dissolved in hydro
chloric acid; the silica was removed by evaporation, and the
metals precipitable by sulphuretted hydrogen by the passage of
that gas through the liquid 3 the solution was then oxidized by
nitric acid, precipitated by ammonia, and. the precipitate di
gested with oxalic-acid solution until the thorium oxalate pro
duced became perfectly white.      The oxalate was washed, ignited,
and evaporated with concentrated sulphuric acid; the resulting
sulphate, after dehydration at a high temperature, was dissolved.
in the smallest possible quantity of water at 0° to 6° C. By
heating to 100° a precipitate was produced, which, when col
lected on a <U+FB01>lter, repeatedly washed with boiling water by
means of the water air-pump, and converted into chlorides,
showed the most prominent lanthanum-lines in the spark-spec
trum.     All the portions of the sulphate obtained by fractional
precipitation at 100° C., asrwell as the mother liquor, showed
the lanthanum-lines; the last portion exhibited also the didy
mium absorption-bands and the spark-lines of cerium.          Frac
tional precipitation of the neutral sulphate by means of sodium
thiosulphate, yielded products which were not altogether free
from these impurities. A new way had therefore to be devised
for the removal of these foreign substances. The behaviour of
the oxalates of cerium, lanthanum, didymium, erbium, and
yttrium towards ammonium oxalate forms the basis of the
method.      A concentrated boiling solution of the latter salt
dissolves small quantities of the oxalates, which are entirely
reprecipitated on dilution with water and cooling; oxalate of
thorium, on the other hand, is easily dissolved under the same
conditions, and is not reprecipitated either on cooling, diluting,
or evaporating the liquid.      Thorium oxide remains when the
residue, obtained by evaporating this solution, is ignited in a,
platinum dish.      By repeating this treatment with the sub

  stance, which has been already puri<U+FB01>ed by several precipitations
 with sodium thiosulphate, pure thorium oxide may be obtained.
 \Vhen tested, as chloride, in the <U+FB02>ame- and spark-spectrum,
 thorium affords no characteristic lines.
     The discrepancies in the estimations of the atomic weight of
 thorium by different observers are probably to be accounted for
 by the presence of considerable impurities in the compound
 supposed to be thorium oxide.
     For the preparation of pure compounds of yttrium and erbium
 I  may refer to the method published by Bahr and myself *.
 The chlorides employed in the production of spectra were pre
 pared from the material with which the atomic weight of yttrium
 was determined to be 3085, and that of erbium to be 56'3.             As
 proof of the complete separation of the two earths, it may be
 mentioned that the whole of the chlorides obtained from the
 fractional precipitates by oxalic acid yielded spectra. in which
 the number and relative intensity of the individual lines were
 identical.     The same thing was true with regard to the frac
 tionally precipitated sulphates, and the last mother liquor
 remaining from these precipitations.           In these observations    I
 have looked in vain for traces of a third earth (terbia), which
 has been supposed by many chemists to exist in Gadolinite and
 to yield absorption-bands.
     Yttrium and erbium chlorides give no <U+FB02>ame-spectra ; while
 the spark-spectrum         of the former chloride is very rich in
 lines,  Plate   V. no.  l2e;    that of the latter is shown in Plate
 V. no. 11 e. Erbium chloride, however, is much more easil
 recognized by the absorption-spectrum             of its solution, Plate
 V. no. 11 a.        Erbium oxide belongs to the small group of
 substances which yield a discontinuous spectrum when heated
                                                    f
in the solid state; the clear lines no. 11 correspond to the
dark bands of the absorption-spectrum.                This oxide may be
thus easily and clearly distinguished from all other oxides.
    Spectral analysis affords the easiest and most reliable means
for recognizing the minerals which contain cerium and yttrium.
The method to be adopted will be seen from the following
examples.
    1. Cerite from the Bastmlis    Quarry.--A few centigrammes, eva
porated      with hydrochloric     acid  and taken up with the same
acid and water, gave a concentrated solution which behaved as
follows :—The light passing through it showed the characteristic
absorption-spectrum of didymium, especially the bands 55 and
75 (no. 15 a, Plate             As no trace appeared of the charac
teristic absorption-bands of erbium, 35 (11 a), the absence of
erbium in this cerite was proved.          The carbon points saturated

    with the liquid   gave a spark-spectrum, in which 10 lanthanum
    lines, and the cerium lines at 67'8, 70'9, 79'41 (no. 13 e),
    appeared clearly; the spark-spectrum in hydrogen showed no
    magnesium lines. The spectrum obtained by placing a platinum
    wire, on which a little of the liquid had been allowed to eva
    porate in the non-luminous <U+FB02>ame, exhibited faint calcium-lines
    (no. 7a); in the spark-spectrum the calcium line at 49 (7 e)
    appeared very faintly.
    -   2. Gadolinite from Ytterby.——The liquid obtained after sepa
    rating silica by evaporation with hydrochloric acid, gave the
    didymium absorption-spectrum,        the bands which appear at 55
    (15 a) being especially marked: the absorption-bands of erbium
   appeared faintly, especially 35 (11 a) ; 65 and 68 were very faint
   but yet visible. The calcium-spectrum appeared slightly, and
   the s0dium~spectrum very faintly when the liquid was placed on
   a platinum wire in the <U+FB02>ame.       The yttrium-lines appeared very
   plainly  in  the spark-spectrum, the characteristic group of lines
   between 40 and 50 (12 2) being especially visible.         The cerium
   line 709 (13 e) appeared in the same spectrum ; but the lantha
   num lines did not appear.          As the lanthanum-spectrum           is
   characterized by many and well-marked lines, it is evident that
   the mineral under examination either contained no lanthanum
  or but the smallest trace of that element.            Yttrium, erbium,
  didymium, cerium, calcium, and sodium          were therefore found in
  this mineral.
       3. Very pure oranyite from Brewig, treated as above described,
, showed faintly the characteristic bands of didymium         at 54 (15a).
  The cerium-lines 709 and 675 (13 a), and the lanthanum-line
  87 (14 a), were plainly visible in the spark-spectrum.          The cal
  cium-spectrum       appeared  when    the  liquid was    placed in the
  <U+FB02>ame.
       4. VVasite yielded a solution in which the absorption-bands
  of didymium, 55 and 75 (15 a), but no erbium bands appeared.
  The <U+FB02>ame-spectrum showed calcium-lines.           The spark-spectrum
  showed plainly only the cerium-line 709 (13 e).               In conse
  quence    of an excessive quantity of  alumina  and  iron  in the liquid,
  the lines of the other earths only appeared after treating the
  precipitate thrown down by ammonia with oxalic acid, igniting
  the oxalates thus formed, and dissolving the residue in hydro
  chloric acid. A very intense yttrium-spectrum, along with the
  characteristic cerium-lines 709 and 67'7 (13 e), was then rem
  dered visible.     No trace of lanthanum was discoverable.
      5. Euwem'te.—A small quantity was fused with sodium car~
 bonate, the mass was evaporated with hydrochloric acid and
  taken up with the same acid diluted with water.            The solution
  was precipitated by ammonia, and the precipitate digested with

the earths of the cerium and yttrium group,,re‘mained ; this
was treated with sulphuric acid, and the yttrium group separated
from the cerium in the usual way.                 Traces only of the cerium
group   were  obtained.     The    greater  mass,   consisting of the yttrium
group,   after  conversion     into    chlorides, showed the absorption
bands of erbium very plainly, and - also most distinctly the
yttrium-lines in the spark-spectrum.               The earths of the cerium
group, also converted into chlorides, showed the didymium ab
sorption-bands distinctly, but no recognizable traces of cerium
or lanthanum in the spark-spectrum ; a tolerably distinct yttrium
spectrum showed the de<U+FB01>ciency of the separation by the usual
method with potassium sulphate.

I
        My DEAR FRANcls’                Jermyn Street, Nov. 17, 1875.
     HAVE much pleasure in communicating to you for publi
      cation in the l’hiIOsophical Magazine the following account
by Mr. \IVilliam WVeston, of the use of phosphorus in poling
c0ppcr.    The process, which originated with Mr. Weston, is
novel, and, it seems to me, of much practical importance.          A
few months ago            I
                    visited Chatham, where it has been in opera
tion for a year or two, in order to inquire concerning      and the           it,
information which      obtained was highly satisfactory.
                          I
                                  remain   I
                                                    Very truly yours,
      William Francis, Esq.                                     JOHN Planer.
   The use of phosphorus in that part of the operation of re<U+FB01>ning
copper known as the poling process, which has been now for
some time carried out in the Government metal-mills at Chat
ham Dockyard,        attended with such
                      is                      marked effect on the
                                                         a
metal as to render     short notice of
                              a             desirable, both on the

ground of its scienti<U+FB01>c interest and probable practical importance.
   The primary object of the addition of phosphorus at Chatham
is to increase the density of the copper, with the expectation that
the sheathing made from      for the navy would be thereby rendered
                                      it
more durable.     Such increased density must greatly, improve
copper for many subsequent processes of manufacture; but, in

                                           i“                       ”                              543

                                                   thus accelerating the
process and rendering unnecessary much use of the ordinary
pole. When the experiment was <U+FB01>rst made the copper was at
once overpoled, and had to be exposed again to the oxidizing
aetionvof the air.     No attempt        made to effect the poling en

tirely     by
           phosphorus; and this does not appear so desirable as to
bring the metal near the tough-pitch point                 its agency, and    by
then complete the precess                          by
                                   the less rapid action of the pole, as
in this way the prOper point at which the metal should be cast                                      is
more easily reached.
    The phosphorus        added in the. form of
                                      is                rich compound of      a
copper and phosphorus containing_about                per cent; of phos   7

                                                               is
 the metal     poured, and
                     is          small hole for the escape of air.

 placed midway     bctWeen   the  bottom   and  cover,  thus   presenting                            a
 body of metal to absorb the escaping vapour of phosphorus.
    The proportion of phosphorus required varies with the dryness
 of the copper- after fusion.     At Chatham         cwt. of the phosphide1
 compound       added to charge of tons; and with this quantity
                     is is

 per cent.  of phosphorus;      and  about   half  this quantity       found                  is
 to be permanently retained.

 LXIV.      On the Mathematical Principles of Laplace’s Theory of
   Tides.    By Professor CHALLIs, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
   N three articles, contained in the Numbers of the'Philosophical
     Magazine for January, April, and June, 1870, I have dis
cussed the problem of the tides of an unboundedocean of small uni
form depth, including in the discussion several tentative solutions
of the problem, one of which I <U+FB01>nally considered to be essentially
correct.     In the course of endeavours to make the logic of that
solution as exact as possible,     I arrived at the proof of a general
proposition relating to oceanic tides, which, at the same time
that it answers the purpose intended, applies also in an impor
tant manner to Laplace’s mathematical theory of tides.               The
proposition may be thus enunciated z—Whatever be the circum
stances of the tides, it is necessary to suppose that mix + vdy + wdz
is an exact differential, the velocities u, c, w being resolved parts,
parallel to rectangular axes <U+FB01>xed relatively to the earth, of the
tidal motion at the point whose coordinates are x, y, z. The
proof above referred to is that which I now proceed to give.
   Since, on the principle of the supposition of small periodic
motions, the tides of the ocean, whatever he the forms of its
bottom and boundaries, are the sum of the tides which the sun
and moon would produce separately, we may calculate the effect
of the attraction of each luminary by itself.         Supposing at <U+FB01>rst
the attracting body to be the moon, let the earth’s centre, con
ceived to be <U+FB01>xed in space, he the origin of rectangular coordi
nates, its axis coincide with the axis of z, and the plane of its
equator coincide with that of my; and let the axes of a." and y
have given directions in space.          Then if .rl, yl, 2' be the coor
dinates of the moon’s centre referred to these axes at any time
t reckoned from a given epoch, the values of these coordinates
are obtainable from the Lunar Theory as functions of t.              Let
the axes of .r and y be now changed to others in the same plane,
but <U+FB01>xed with reference to the rotating earth, and let the positive
direction of 2 be from the plane of the equator northwards, that
of y from the earth’s centre to the meridian of Greenwich, and
that of .z' from the plane of that meridian eastward.         Then, sup
posing the new coordinates to be a! and             y',

    We have next to take account of the attraction of the earth
itself at the same point of the ocean. The amount and direction
of this force will depend on the composition and dimensions of
the earth, and on the form of its super<U+FB01>cies as determined                                     by
the mutual attractions of its parts, both solid and <U+FB02>uid, by the
moon’s attraction,            by
                           centrifugal force, and       its super<U+FB01>cial by
irregularities. Now, as we are here concerned only with central
forces emanating according to the law of gravity at each instant
from all the elements of the earth’s mass,       we call the resultant
                                                           if

attraction at    agiven point of the ocean.     At present we have to
take account of the hydrodynamical effect of centrifugal force—
that   is,the effect of its action on <U+FB02>uid in motion, the motion
being   such  as    peculiar to
                      is           <U+FB02>uid, causing the forms and rela

    The general conclusion from this argument is that, for the
calculation of tidal motion in any case whatever, udz+vdy+wdz
must be assumed to be an exact differential, the calculation
being restricted to terms of the <U+FB01>rst order, and u, 1;, w being
the components, parallel to axes <U+FB01>xed relative to the earth, of
the tidal motion at xyz, as it might at any time be actually ob
served and measured.
    In the Mécanigue Celeste, liv. i. chap. viii. art. 34, Laplace
asserts that “ in the theory of the <U+FB02>ux and re<U+FB02>ux of the sea we
cannot suppose udw+vdy+wd2 to be an exact di<U+FB02>'erential,
because it is not such in the very simple case in which the sea
has no other movement than that of rotation which is common
to it with the earth.”     It is true that if the values of u, v, w at
any point include resolved parts of the velocity at that point due
 to the motion of rotation which the ocean par-takes of in common
 with the earth, the expression udx+vdy +wdz cannot be an exact
 differential.  But this circumstance affects in no manner the
foregoing argument, by which I have shown, after fully taking
account of centrifugal force, and abstracting from the motion
of rotation, that if u, v, to be resolved parts exclusively of tidal
motion, udz+vdy+wdz          will be an exact differential.    Such
values of u, v, w are in fact just those which a theory of tides is
required to <U+FB01>nd.
   Consequently, if (dqb) be put for udz+vdy+wdz, so that the
equation of constancy of mass becomes

ence between the views recently expressed in this Journal by
two eminent mathematicians relative to certain points of Laplace’        s
theory, may be traceable to the needless complexity of the mathe
matics of that theory, and might be expected to disappear  I

nected with the poles of a battery, as there are equal currents
<U+FB02>owing at those two points, one into and the other out of the
sheet, the potential at any point of the sheet is proportional to the
diiference of the logarithms of its distances from the two points
or electrodes where the current enters and leaves the sheet.
   The potential is constant for a series of pointsif the diiference
of the logarithms of the distances of each of those points from
the electrodes remains constant, i. e. if the ratio of the distances of
each of those points from the electrodes remains constant.
   The curve joining this series of points is an equipotential curve.
   If r and r, are the distances of any point in the curve from the
two electrodes, and c a constant, then
                                 r=cr1.
 Hence the equipotential curves are circles with their centres on
the line joining the two electrodes; and the lines of force which
cut the equipotential curves at right angles are also arcs of circles
passing through the two electrodes.
   The lines of force may be regarded as distinct from one another,
but as <U+FB01>lling up all the space on the conductor between the two
electrodes; and the distribution would not be altered if we con—
ceive of them as divided from one another like separate wires con
ducting currents side by side. By taking out any space bounded by
lines of force, we shall increase the quantity <U+FB02>owing along the other
lines of force, but shall not alter the distribution of the current
among them. Hence we may cut out a. disk from an unlimited
sheet without altering the form of the lines of force, if the boun
dary of the disk be arcs of circles passing through the two elec
trodes ; so that for a circular disk with the electrodes on the edge
of it, the equipotential curves are circles having their centres on the
straight line joining the electrodes.
   The forms of the equipotential curves may be traced out expe
rimentally by attaching two battery-electrodes to       disk of tinfoil,

the equipotential curve     isto be drawn, the other maybe moved
from point to point to trace out the successive points, so that no
current may pass through the galvanometer. A comparison of the
experimental results with the theory shows complete agreement.

that, to every electrode on the limited sheet, there corresponds an

for this arrangement of electrodes inthe unlimited sheet, the edges
of the limited sheet will be some of the lines of force and so we                            ;

of the equipotential curves.    Where an electrode and its images

 This is an interesting case, as showing that the equipotential curves
 do not always out the edge of the disk at right angles. The curves
 around the centre of the disk are nearly ellipses of small eccentri
 city, with one focus in the centre; but on placing one tracing
 electrode at a distance from the centre
                              =(3  - 2 V 2)“,
 between the electrodes, where a is the radius, there is great uncer
 tainty in determining the form of the curve on the opposite side
 of the centre of the disk.
     This is explained by the fact that the electrodes were 1 millim.
 in diameter, and a, difference of distance of lmillim. between the
 electrodes near this point corresponds to a. large portion of the
 disk on the other side of the centre—this portion including an
 area of about 500 square millims. in a circle 36 millims. in radius,
    e. about one eighth of the whole area. of the circle.    On placing
 one of the galvanometer-electrodes at the extremity of the diameter
 through the battery—electrodes and tracing with the other, it is
found that the equipotential curve through that point cuts the
 edge of the disk at an angle of 45°, and that there are two branches
 cutting one another at right angles.
     These peculiarities are explained on tracing the curve
                                 r2=4arl
 corresponding to this case. The extremity of the diameter is a
 point through which two branches of the curve pass at right
 angles to one another.
     The forms of the equipotential surfaces and lines of force in space
 may be determined experimentally by taking a large vessel contain
ing a. conducting liquid and placing two points, the ends of two
covered wires, for battery-electrodes, at a. given depth in the liquid
and away from the sides and ends of the vessel, taking similar
covered wires, immersed to the same depth, for galvanometeri
 electrodes.
    For two electrodes, the equipotential surfaces will be surfaces of
revolution around the straight line joining them, and so will cut
any plane, drawn through this straight line or axis, everywhere at
right   angles.
    Hence we may suppose sections of the liquid made along such
planes without altering the forms of the equipotential surfaces.
This shows that we may place our battery-electrodes at the side of
a rectangular box containing the liquid, and with the points only
just immersed below the surface of the liquid; and the equipotential
surfaces will be the same as if the liquid were of unlimited extent
in every direction about the electrodes.
    ‘Ve shall obtain the section of the equipotential surface by taking
for galvanometer-electrodes two points in the surface of the liquid,
keeping one fixed and tracing out points of equal potential with
the other.

to pieces of wood, which could be clamped at the centre of the end
of the box, and could be brought to any required point in the line
joining the middle points of the end of the box. The galvanometer

a millimetre-scale placed on the ends and sides of the box.
   In the sulphate-of-copper experiments, covered wire with the end
exposed waslimmersed to half the depth of the liquid; in the ex—
periments with sulphate of zinc, the zinc electrodes were just im
mersed below the surface of the liquid.         The close coincidence
between the experimental curves traced out and the theoretical

   “ On the Liquation, Fusibility, and Density of certain Alloys of
Silver and Copper.”    By W. Chandler Roberts, Chemist of the
Mint.
   The author states that the most remarkable physical property of
silver-copper alloys is   molecular mobility, in virtue of which cer
                          a.
tain combinations    of the  constituents of     molten alloy become
                                                         a
segregated   from  the mass,  the homogeneous    character  of which             is
thereby destroyed.     These  irregularities of composition  have long
been known, and reference            made to them in the works of
                                        is
Lazarus Erckern (1650) and of Jars (1774).           A very complete
memoir was published in 1852 by Levo], who did much towards
ascertaining the nature and de<U+FB01>ning the limits of this molecular
mobility. He discovered the important fact that an alloy containing
71'89 per cent. of silver     uniform in composition.
                               is                         Its chemical
formula (Aga Cu,) and peculiar structure led him to conclude that
all other alloys are mixtures of this, with excess of either metal.
    The electric conductivity of these alloys was studied in 1860 by
Matthiessen, who doubted the accuracy of Levol's theory, and
viewed them as “mechanical mixtures of allotropic modi<U+FB01>cations of
the two metals in each other.”
    The author then described the experiments he made with                       a

 554!    .              .       Royal'Society:—
 view to determine the melting-points of a series of these alloys.
 He adopted Deville’s determination of the boiling—point of zinc
 (1040° C.) as the basis of the inquiry, and ascertained, by the method
 of mixtures, the mean speci<U+FB01>c heat of a mass of wrought iron
 between 0° C. and the melting—point of silver, which, as Becquerelv
 showed, is the same as the boiling-point of zinc.
    The mean of three experiments, which were closely in accor
 dance, gave 0'15693 as the speci<U+FB01>c heat ; and it should be pointed
 out that this number includes and neutralizes several errors which
 would affect- the accuracy of the subsequent determinations.
    The melting-points of several alloys were then determined by
 plunging an iron cylinder into them and transferring the iron to a
 calorimeter. These melting-points varied from 840° C. to 1330° 0.,
 or through a range of 490° C. The alloys which occupy the lowest
portion of the curve contain from 60 to 70 per cent. of silver.
 The results are interesting, as they show that the curves of fusi
                                                                                     '
bility and electric conductivity are very similar.
    The  author  states   that,    in  studying    the phenomena      of  liquation,
the alloys were cast in red-hot moulds of <U+FB01>rebrick in which the
metal (about 50 oz.) could be slowly and uniformly cooled.                       The
results showed that the homogeneity of Levol’s alloy is slightly dis;
turbed by this method of casting; and, on the other hand, that
alloys which contain more than 71'89 per cent. of silver hardly
show signs of rearrangement when the solidi<U+FB01>cation is gradually
eifected.   Two alloys were examined, which contained 63 and
333 per cent. of silver respectively. Both were found to be
far from homogeneous.             In the case of the former the arrange
ment was in<U+FB02>uenced by gravity, the base of the casting being
rich in silver.
   The density of pure silver and of Levol’s homogeneous alloy
while in the <U+FB02>uid state were then determined by the method de—
scribed by Mr. Robert Mallet*, the metals being cast in conical
vessels of wrought iron.          The results obtained were as follows :—

       Mr. T. E. Thorpe   on the Speci<U+FB01>c Volumes       of Liquids.   555
an element is invariable when in combination.         Exceptions to the
law occur, however, in the cases of oxygen and sulphur, each of
which bodies has two speci<U+FB01>c volumes dependent upon the manner
in which they are held in union. When contained “within the
radicle,” as in acetyl, CZHQO, oxygen has the value 122, but when
existing “without the radicle,” as in alcohol, it has the smaller value,
7 '8. Sulphur, when
                        “ within the radicle,” has the speci<U+FB01>c volume
28-6 ; when    “  without the radicle,” it has the speci<U+FB01>c volume 22-6.
    The cause of these variations may be thus stated in the language
of modern theory z—When dyad sulphur and oxygen are united to
an element by both their af<U+FB01>nities, their speci<U+FB01>c volumes become
respectively 286 and 122; when they are attached by only one
 combining unit, their speci<U+FB01>c volumes are 22'6 and 7'8.
    Phosphorus is regarded by certain chemists as invariably a triad;
 others maintain that it is sometimes a triad, at other times a pentad.
 In the trichloride it is a triad, in the oxychloride and thiochloride
it is a pentad. According to this view, the two latter compounds
 possess the following constitution :—
                          Cl                      Cl

If, however, phosphorus is invariably trivalent, the oxychloride and
thiochloride must possess the formulae

   It is possible to decide between the two modes of representing
the constitutionrof these compounds, it it be granted that the varia—
tion in the speci<U+FB01>c volume of oxygen and sulphur is due to the
manner in which these elements are held in union.           For, if the
phosphorus   in the  oxychloride and  thiochloride   be quinquivalent,
the oxygen and sulphur must possess the greater of the two values,
since both their combining units are united to the phosphorus ;
 if,on the other hand, phosphorus be trivalent, the oxygen and
sulphur must possess the smaller of the two values.

    l. “ 0n the Structure and Age of Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh.”
By John W. Judd, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author said that Arthur’s Seat, so long the battle-ground of
 rival theorists, furnished in the hands of Charles Maclaren a
beautiful illustration of the identity between the agencies at Work
 during past geological periods and those in operation at the pre
sent day.
    One portion, however, of Maclaren’s masterly exposition of the
structure of Arthur’s Seat, that which requires a second period of
eruption upon the same site, but subsequent to the deposition, the
upheaval and the denudation of the whole of the Carboniferous rocks,
is beset with the gravest dif<U+FB01>culties. The Tertiary and Secondary
epochs have in turn been proposed and abandoned as the period of
this supposed second period of eruption ; and it has more recently
been placed, on very questionable grounds, in the Permian.
    The antecedent improbabilities of this hypothesis of a second
period of eruption are so great, that it was abandoned by its author
himself before his death.      A careful study of the whole question by
the aid of the light thrown upon it in comparing the structure of
Arthur’s Seat with that of many other volcanoes, new and old,
shows the hypothesis to be alike untenable and unnecessary.
    The supposed proofs of a second period of eruption, drawn from
the position of the central lava column, the nature and relations of
the fragmentary materials in the upper and lower parts of the hill
respectively, and the position of certain rocks in the Lion’s Hauuch,
all break down on reexamination; while, on the other hand, an
examination of Arthur’s Seat, in connexion with the contemporaneous
volcanic rocks of Forfar, Fife, and the Lothians, shows that in the
former we have the relics of a volcano which was at <U+FB01>rst submarine
but gradually rose above the Carboniferous sea, and was the product
of a single and almost continuous series of eruptions.

    2. “The Glaciation of the Southern part of the Lake-district,
and the Glacial origin of the Lake-basins of Cumberland and West
moreland.”—Second Paper. By J. Clifton Ward, Esq., F.G.S.
    The directions of ice-scratches in the various dales having been
pointed out, the course of the several main glaciers were described ;
and it was shown how they must have become con<U+FB02>uent in all the
lower ground, forming a more or less continuous ice-sheet, which
overlapped most of the minor ridges parting valley from valley, and
was frequently forced diagonally across them.
    The positions of certain ice-grooves having an abnormal direction
were described; in several cases these cross lofty ridges at right
angles to their direction, and generally at passes or depressions
along a watershedding line.       Most of those noticed had a generally
east-and-wcst direction, and occurred at varying heights, from
1250 ft. to 2400 ft. The author, while acknowledging the dif<U+FB01>culty
 attendant upon any explanation, was inclined, though somewhat
doubtfully, to regard these abnormal markings as due to <U+FB02>oating ice
during the great period of interglacial submergence.             .
    The moraines were all believed to belong to the last set of
glaciers.
    The subject of the “Glacial origin of Lake-basins” was then
 entered upon, and the following lakes discussed           by means of
 diagrams drawn to scale, showing lake-depths, mountain-outlines,
 and the thickness of the ice—Wastwater,             Grasmere,   Easdale,
 Windermere, Coniston, and Esthwaite, together with several moun
tain—terns.    In the case of Wastwater, the bottom was shown to run
below the level of the sea for a distance of a mile and a quarter,
 and the deepest point to be just opposite the spot at which the only
side valley joins the main one.      While the greatest depth of the lake
is 251 ft., the thickness of the old glacier-ice must have been fully
 1500 ; and, all points considered, Prof. Ramsay’s theory of glacial
 erosion seemed to the author certainly to be upheld. In like manner
 the same theory was thought to account for the origin of the other
lakes mentioned, such ones as Windermere and Coniston being but
 long narrow grooves formed at the bottom of preexisting valleys.
     Mountain-terns were held to be due sometimes wholly to glacial
 erosion, sometimes to this combined with a moraine dam, and occa
 sionally to the pending back of water by moraines alone, or moraine
 like mounds formed at the foot of snow—slopes.

upper earth in this cave contained fragments of late pottery mixed
up (by rabbits) with bits of rude prehistoric pottery, a tooled piece
of stag’s horn, an iron spike, two worked <U+FB01>ints, a piece of jet, part
of a bone comb, and a bronze cclt of peculiar form, many bones of
Bos longifrons and goat, broken to get out the marrow, and remains
of hogs ; charcoal and human teeth also attested the occupation of
the cave by man.         There were also remains of fox, badger, cat,
water-rat, dog, red deer, duck, fowl, and hare.           Lower down were
remains of Bos longzlfrons, hog, red deer, wolf, and horse ; and
lower still, next the rock, more human teeth, remains of animals, and
a good <U+FB02>int.      The cave seemed to have been occupied from time to
time during a lengthened period, probably from the Neolithic age
into those of bronze and iron. A cave in Gelly or Hartle Dale,
contained, in blackish mould, bones (some broken) of goat, pig, fox,
and rabbit, and pieces of very rude prehistoric pottery.
    Of Pleistocene caves and <U+FB01>ssures the author described several.
One in Hartle         Dale furnished remains of rhinoceros, aurochs
(Bison priscus), and mammoth, lying in yellow earth. The bones
were probably carried in by water. A <U+FB01>ssure near the village of
Waterhouses,      in Sta<U+FB01>‘ordshire, is 6 feet wide, and <U+FB01>lled with the
ordinary loam.       Bones of mammoths and the skeleton of a young
bison have been obtained from it; and the author supposes the
 animals to have fallen into the <U+FB01>ssure while making for the river to
 drink. The Windy-Knoll <U+FB01>ssure is situated near Castleton, in a quarry
near the top of the \Vinnetts, and close to the most northern boundary
 of the mountain-limestone of Derbyshire.             The author described
particularly   the  situation   of this <U+FB01>ssure and  drainage of the district
in which it is situated.       The <U+FB01>ssure itself is <U+FB01>lled with the ordinary
loam, containing fragments of limestone, and enclosing an astonishing
quantity of bones of animals confusedly mixed together, those lowest
 down near the rocks being coated with and sometimes united by
stalagmite.     The author supposes that this was a swampy place
into which animals fell from time to time, and in rainy seasons their
 remains might be washed into it from the neighbouring slopes.

 ON THE DENSITIES        Ol“ PURE PLATINUM AND IRIDIUM AND THEIR
    ALLOYS.       BY H. SAINTE-CLAIRE DEVILLE AND H. DEBRAY.
         precise   determination of the density of bodies is of high im
THE   portance for science,     because the various isomeric and allotropic
 states of one and the same substance are each manifested by a par
 ticular value of the density.         In the present case it is especially
 so, on account of the diverse properties possessed by metals from
 the platinum-ores according to' their physical state and their mode
 of preparation.
    1. Plutinum.—It is very dif<U+FB01>cult, by known processes, to remove
 from impure platinum the iridium and rhodium which it always

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               559
contains. We had to have recourse to a new rocess, the accuracy
of which appears to be perfect as regards the e imination of iridium,
and which succeeds for rhodium on condition of a little of the pla
tinum
   ‘      being carried away with the latter.
     Pure lead, obtained by calcining pure acetate of lead, is the solvent
we employed to e<U+FB01>ect these separations.
     Let us suppose that some thin plates of that complex alloy which
is met with in commerce under the name of platinum are fused with
from six to ten times their weight of lead.       This latter will dissolve
the copper, the palladium, a Portion of the iron, and a small quan
tity of platinum.       These will be diSsolved, together with the excess
of lead, by pure nitric acid.     There will remain an alloy of platinum
and lead, which weak aqua regia will dissolve, carrying away some
rhodium.       The <U+FB01>nal residue will be a crystallized alloy containing
iridium, ruthenium, and iron, insoluble in lead.
     if the platinum is rich in rhodium, this, when combined with the
lead, will not be dissolved by concentrated aqua regia, but will be
 separated from the iridium mixed with iron          ‘
                                                       and ruthenium by
                                          '                        i
 boiling,  concentrated   sulphuric acid.
     The platinum will be separated from the rhodium and lead dis
 solved with it in the aqua regia by sal ammoniac ; but, to com—
 pletely eliminate the rhodium, the chloroplatinate of ammonia (or
 platinum yellow) must be precipitated in powder so <U+FB01>ne as to
 appear amorphous and nearly white.             It is to be washed with
 water acidulated with hydrochloric acid, which removes a small
 quantity of platinum.        This last method was communicated to
 ‘us by M. Stas.
      The platinum is fused, by means of our blowpipe, in a crucible of
 pure lime, or at least free from iron.        When the metallic mass is
 well lique<U+FB01>ed and has undergone the action of the ref uing-<U+FB01>re, we
 close briskly the two cocks which admit the illuminating—gas and
  oxygen, and thus solidify the surface of the ingot.      The lime, being
  strongly   heated,  keeps the lower  part  in fusion;  and the shrinking
  takes place on that side, most often so as to permit the cavities
  which form there to communicate with the exterior.           By working
  thus we have obtained the highest densities, measured upon masses
  of 200—250 grammes of pure platinum. If we had possessed greater
  quantities of platinum, we should have cast large ingots and taken
  specimens     of the metal from the centre or the perfectly sound
  parts of the ingots. On such specimens we intend to investigate the
  action of cold-beating and annealing—a subject of great interest.
      2. Iridium—The iridium made use of was extracted from mate
  rials belonging to M. Matthey, and prepared by our methods; we
  attacked it afresh, to clear it of the last traces of impurity.      This
 'iridium, <U+FB01>nely pulverized, either in a mortar or by dissolving it in
   zinc which was afterwards driven off by heat, was fused with lead.
   The ingot, treated with nitric acid, aqua regia, and boiling sul
   phuric acid, left the iridium crystallized and still containing some
   ruthenium (without a trace of osmium) and a little iron.          It was

   560                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   attacked by its weight of nitrate of barium and four times its weight
   of baryta, or else by <U+FB01>ve times its weight of binoxide of barium in
   a crucible of silver or porcelain.            The material, pounded, mixed
   with four or <U+FB01>ve times its weight of water, is treated with a cur
  rent of chlorine in a tubulated retort with an emery stopper. When
   it is supersaturated with chlorine, it is distilled in a very slow cur
   rent of that gas.        Volatile hyperruthenic acid is obtained, which
   passes at <U+FB01>rst in red crystals or minute drops, which afterwards
   dissolve in the water proceeding from the distillation.                The iridiate
   of barium is transformed into green perchloride of iridium and
   chloride of barium, with disengagement of oxygen. The liquor de
   prived of baryta by titrated sulphuric acid, is evaporated to dryness
   to separate the silica. The residue, taken up by water, consists of
 .red-brown bichloride of iridium, the green chloride having lost some
   chlorine during the evaporation. We precipitate it by sal ammo
iniac, and wash for a long time with a semisaturated sal-ammoniac
"
   solution the deep—violet chloro—iridiate of ammonia, which we after
  wards calcine in a current of hydrogen, and thus obtain metallic
  iridium.       This, treated with nitre and potash in a gold or silver
  Vessel, gives a violaceous mass which, taken up by water, 'colours
  it violet or deep blue. The residue is washed successively with
  water, dilute hydrochlorate of ammonium (which removes the
  potass), oxalic acid (to dissolve the iron), chlorinated water, and,
  <U+FB01>nally, ammonia to take up the gold or silver *.
      The iridium, strongly calcined in a crucible of charcoal puri<U+FB01>ed
  by chlorine, is afterwards fused in pure lime with the precautions
  indicated for platinum; only pure dry hydrogen must be substi
  tuted for illuminating-gas.
      Densities. (1) Pure Platinum.—To arrive at the determination of
  its density, we fused our ingots again a great many times, always
  obtaining numbers close to 215 when the ingots presented the
  proper appearance.           We here give the details of the experiment
  which gave the highest density          :-                                      ‘

      EXAMPLES OF CONTEMPORARY FORMATION OF IRON-PYRITES IN
           THERMAL SPRINGS AND IN SEA-WATER.                            BY M. DAUBRE‘E.
'
         It is known that iron-pyrites, though not usually forming large
     masses in the crust of the            earth, is extremely wide-spread, and
     disseminated in numerous rocks, Whether strati<U+FB01>ed, eruptive, or
     metamorphic. Yet it is only rarely that at the present time this
     mineral species is detected in course of formation.                          To the few
  - examples which have been               certainly ascertained,          I  can add some
     which will contribute to elucidate the conditions under which iron'
     pyrites can be or may have been produced.
         Production ofpyrites in the substructions at Bourbonne-les-Bains.
     ——The iron—pyrites has not been met with at Bourbonne—les-Bains
     among the various crystallized cupreous sulphurets deposited
    around the Roman medals,'but is produced at a little distance from
    those incrustations, and in dilferent parts of the subsoil.
        First, in making a sounding over the exact point of emergence of
    the spring, there were brought up some small pebbles and grains
    of quartz enveloped in iron pyrites.                  This substance is attached to
    their surface, sometimes as an amorphous shining yellow coating,
    and sometimes in eminently crystalline crusts in which numerous
    triangular faces are perceptible.
        What shows clearly that its formation is contemporary is, that
    it is attached, with the same characters, to some of the knife-shaped
    <U+FB02>ints worked by the hand of man which are found at the bottom
   pf the Roman cesspool with other antique objects. Moreover the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               563
 accumulation of quartzose sand beneath the cesspool, also brought
 up by the sounding-line, was subjected to a washing so as to sepa
rate from it the heaviest portions, when innumerable grains of
 pyrites were distinguished bristling with crystals, and less than a.
 quarter of a millimetre in diameter. b‘ome of these grains have
iregular shapes, and appear to be the débris of coatings unlike those
 which have just been described ; others are rounded, like miniatures
 of the nodules of pyrites met with in various beds.
    Further, on attentively inspecting the bricks of a Roman <U+FB02>oor
                                   I
of a conduit of mineral water, recognized pyrites there also. This
mineral has been produced in the midst of the lime which envelops
each brick, in small cavities, where it appears in globules of a
brassy yellow, terminated by crystalline faces ; but these faces are
 so minute that one could not be sure that they belonged to cubic
pyrites and not to marcasite : however, their <U+FB01>ne yellow colour and
their nnchangeability render the <U+FB01>rst supposition the more probable.
    Pyrites of contemporary formation exists in general in amor
phous coatings ; this at Bourbonne is distinguished by its crystal
line state.
    Formation ofJig/rites in calcareous pisolitcs at Hummrm-Mcslcoutine,
Province of Constantine—The thermal springs of Hamman-Meskou
tine, renowned for their high temperature (95° C), their copious
ness, and for the development and singular form of the incrusta—
tions which they continue to build up daily in the shape of cones,
have also generated pisolites comparable to the granules of Carls
bad or Tivoli.
    Some of these pisolites are enveloped in pyrites.      Nor is this de
posit- merely super<U+FB01>cial : when a number of the globules are broken,
in some of them pellicles of pyrites are perceived among the whitish
very thin concentric layers of which they are composed. The centre
is ordinarily a fragment of crystalline and lamellar limestone which
has served as a nucleus for the concretions.
                                     I
   From information for which am indebted to the kindness of M.
Tissot, Mining Engineer, it appears that these pyritous pisolites,
which are rare, seem to be formed in the ascending channels of
the thermal springs; they are therefore brought to light by the
force of the ascending water, nearly in the same manner as the
pyritous grains of, Bourbonne-les-Bains.          Although formed at an
elevated temperature, the carbonate of lime which accompanies
them is in the state of calcite, and not of aragonite ; for it does not
decrepitate before the blowpipe.
   Pyrites formed in wood immersed in sca-water.-——The third instance
of present formation of pyrites which       I  have to describe does not
belong to the action of thermal springs, but to that ofsea—water
mingled with fresh water.
   This pyrites was met with recently in England, in the interior of
a piece of wood from the royal yacht ‘ Osborne.’           It forms, in a
<U+FB01>ssure of the wood, a thin coating of a <U+FB01>ne yellow colour and bright

metallic lustre. For the specimen which present to the Academy
I  am indebted to the kindness of Professor John Percy, of the
School of Mines, London, well known by his important works on
Metallurgy.     Mr. Weston, Chemist to the Admiralty, has been
so good as to furnish me with information on the fact, which he
                                                     ’
was the <U+FB01>rst to observe.      The ship ‘ Osborne was built at Pem—
broke Dockyard, and sent to Portsmouth to be <U+FB01>nished. It was
there deemed necessary to increase her thickness; and it was in
preparing for that purpose a piece of wood situated near the keel,
that they discovered a cavity lined with pyrites.             Before being
used, this wood had lain, according to custom, for some time in a
'pit at Pembroke, or perhaps at Portsmouth;          at both places these
basins lie between high- and low-water mark and receive a mixture
of fresh and sea-water. It must be added that two sewers run
into the basin at Portsmouth; and probably the case is similar at
Pembroke; so that it is not impossible that, besides reducing and
sulphuretted substances, the sewers introduce into certain parts of
the basins, at least accidentally, a higher temperature than the
normal temperature of the sea.
    The surface on which the pyrites is deposited is much blackened,
so as to resemble an ulmic substance ; and this bears witness to the
reducing e<U+FB01>ect operated on the vegetable matter.                     .
    There is one mode 'of present formation of pyrites which is well
deserving of attention, but is usually passed over in silence in geo
logical works ; it is that described by M. Bunsen in his important
memoir on Iceland’“.       As shown by that eminent physicist, iron
pyrites is produced in several localities of that country by the
vapours of fumaroles charged with sulphuretted hydrogen; these
gaseous substances react upon the iron contained in the silicated
rocks through which they in<U+FB01>ltrate and which they attack, particu
larly palagonite and pyroxenic rocks. In this case the pyrites has
crystallized very neatly in innumerable minute cubes.            It is asso—
ciated with sulphate and carbonate of lime, of which the base has
been taken from the silicated rock and sometimes combined with
sulphur in excess.
    Although formed in the wet way, the pyrites of the Roman <U+FB02>oor
somewhat resembles that engendered by the Iceland fumaroles as
regards its mode of dissemination in the rock in which it was pro
duced.
    By the side of these instances of the present formation of pyrite-s
in nature, we must not forget that it was, long since. produced
