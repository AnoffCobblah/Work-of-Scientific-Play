                          United States, persons receiving copies should make
                          appropriate efforts to determine the copyright status
                          of the work in their country and use the work accordingly.
                          It is possible that current copyright holders, heirs or
                          the estate of the authors of individual portions of the
                          work, such as illustrations or photographs, assert copyrights
                          over these portions. Depending on the nature of subsequent
                          use that is made, additional rights may need to be obtained
                          independently of anything we can address. The digital

I. Of     the “subtilis ignis” of the Ancients—II. Of old chemicalliterature,
     and of the significance of the terms Sal, Sulphur, Mercurius, as em
     ployed by mediaeval Chemists.-III. Of the supposed nature of fire prior
     to the rise of the theory of Phlogiston; specially of Descartes's materia
     calestis, and of Hooke's theory of combustion.—IV. Of the ideas re
     garding the calcination of metals which prevailed prior to the rise of the
     theory of Phlogiston.—W. Of Becher and Stahl, and of the rise and
     development of the theory of Phlogiston.—VI. Of the syncretistic nature
     of the theory of Phlogiston.

2          Mr. G. F. Rodwell                            on the Theory                   of Phlogiston.
   Phlogiston was not a new creation; possessing other names,
and endued with ill-defined and varying functions, it had been
conspicuous in many physical systems.          The chief merit of
Becher and Stahl was that     they  extended       functions     one                        its                    in
direction, and conferred upon them       definitiveness which they
had hitherto lacked. The theory          phlogiston was not the          of a
result    of
           a sudden development,     did not owe its existence   it                                                         to
an  intellectual exploit, but    arose       process    itevolution,          by    a                of
        by gradual modus     development.          of

affirmed that the universe consists             four elements—fire, air,  of
water, and earth. We have good evidence that this theory pre
vailed prior       the fifteenth century B.c.; indeed
                     to                                       seems pro                              it

and the Hindu branches          the Aryan family. Zoroaster appears
                                               of
to   have introduced element-worship among the Medo-Persic
races, and         as      he
                       supposed is     have been      Scythian,

In   the ancient Brahmanical religion three gods, symbolized                                                                by
elements, were worshipped, and first              this trinity was Agni,      in
the god    offire. But while the Hindus adopted               polytheism,                            a
the   primitive   Magism    introduced         Zoroaster was developed   by
into a   monotheism,    and       fire was considered first and most
                                                   as
potent    ofthe elements,      became the one visible symbol

from whom proceeds “tomºbópov trip,” which diffuses itself

contest with much rejoicing, and put fire round about the statue;
the wax melted, the holes opened, and water gushing forth put
out the fire; hence the Chaldaeans were laughed               for their                        at

the account      Elijah and the priests

Thus fire was considered the most subtle, and         occupied the                   it
highest place; next        order came air, then water, and finally
                                 in
earth, most gross and occupying the lowest place.         Fire and
air, they said, are light; water and earth heavy.    All fire has                                              a
tendency upwards because          seeks   join that which

                            different philosophers. Thus Thales

Zeno held that there are two kinds           fire, the one, common
artificial fire, which requires nutriment; the other, “drekvekov

world, because it alone of the elements possesses innate motion.
Lucretius, who followed Epicurus very closely, asserts that
lightning is elemental fire, consisting of smaller atoms than our
earthly fire, and hence more subtle and capable of greater pene
tration*.    The pure fire was distinguished by various names—
among others, “subtilis ignis,” “ calestis ignis,” “tenuis ignis,” as
opposed to “common fire,” “mundane fire,” “gross earthly fire,”
&c. From a passage in the “Ned'éAat of Aristophanes, it would
appear that the ancients were in the habit of obtaining their
“mundane fire" from “celestial fire” by means of a burning
glassif; but the distinction would still seem to exist, for the pure
fire would only become visible earthly fire when associated with
some combustible substance.        According to Seneca, the Egyp
tians somewhat extended the four-element theory by assigning
to each element a masculine and feminine, an active and a passive

a mode    of thought different from that which had prevailed at any
prior period: these were the Chemists. Whatever their ultimate
object may have been (alchemy, iatro-chemistry, metallurgic
chemistry), their immediate pursuits led them to study the struc
ture of matter, the varying nature of different kinds of matter,
and the modus of their change under the most artificial and
forced conditions which could be commanded.                     Rejecting the
four-element     theory  as   expressed    by  the   ancients,   the chemists
adopted three principles, which they designated sal, sulphur,
mercurius, and before we go further it is important for us to un
derstand accurately the right significance of these terms.                 It is
not   unfrequently    imagined     that  they    are to be taken in their
literal sense; but no idea can be more erroneous, or more likely
to lead to false impressions as regards the early history of che
mistry.     The terms were used exactly as we now use the term
alkali or salt in chemistry; not one alkali, not common salt,
but      all
         bodies possessing certain qualities           common, and taking
                                                                      in

of “oleum sulphuris per campanum ”), a good deal of the ob

been introduced into the one class          writings soon found

   We still possess in the science of chemistry traces of the con
nexion which once existed between alchemy and astrology; for
the symbolic notation of chemistry undoubtedly originated from
the profuse system of symbolization employed in astrology. The
Chaldaeans at a very early period designated the stars by signs;
and the number gradually increased until astrological works
became one mass of symbolism.         The sun, moon, and prin
cipal planets were among the first to receive symbols; and
before the time of Geber the seven metals were designated by
 the same names and symbols, and each star was supposed to di
rectly influence the metal which bore               name.      its

extent this was appropriate; for what could better represent the

    Clerk Maxwell.        Already heat and light have been resolved into
 dynamic phenomena; and it is to be hoped that before long the
 indefinite term “imponderable fluid" will disappear from our
 text-books.        At a time when we appear to be progressing to
 wards a comprehensive dynamical system, I venture to assert
  that the Principia of Descartes and the ‘Whole body of Carte
  sian Philosophy’ of Anthony le Grand, may be perused by phy
  sicists with advantage, especially those portions relating to the
  inception, continuance, and transference of motion, and the
  various modes of motion possible to particles of matter. There
  is indeed some fanciful, and much imaginary matter in the
  Principia, and many relics of a bygone mode of thought; but
  there is also lucidity, accuracy of expression, and well-sustained
  reasoning. Let us in perusing it bear in mind that it emanated
  from an advanced mathematician, an accurate thinker, and one
  of the most philosophic intellects of               time.                 all

18                 Mr. G. F. Rodwell          on the Theory    of Phlogiston.
   Hooke's theory of combustion was published nearly five years
before the publication of Becher's Physica Subterranea (which
laid the foundation of the theory of phlogiston).      At this time
Stahl was four  years old;   yet M. Chevreul  asserts,  “On doit à
Stahl la première eaglication de la combustion ”*; and still more
recently Sir B. Brodie tells us that the theory of phlogiston was
the first chemical theoryt. While this idolum specus remains
                                              I
in the mind of the scientific, despair of a just recognition of the
services of Hooke—of a just appreciation of one of the most
sound and comprehensive theories which has appeared in the
 whole history of scientific thought.
IV. Of the ideas regarding               the calcination     of metals which prevailed
                    prior     to the rise of the theory      of Phlogiston.
       We have finally, before considering the rise of the theory of
phlogiston, to glance at the views which prevailed before and
during the time of Becher in regard to the calcination of metals.
    The process of calcination has always been one of the most
important operations in chemistry, and is prominently described
in      all
        old chemical treatises.       The term cala, originally applied
    lime, soon came                  wider meaning, and
a to                         have   to        a                was found      it
   convenient term         express  anything
                                   to          that was burnt     powder.          to
 Geber defines calcination           “the pulverization
                                              as                 thing        of   a              by

and this broad definition was        repeated   almost verbatim       che                   in

as  I have elsewhere stated *, appears to have                                            been his mode of
reasoning:—Air possesses weight; it may be                                               produced by heat
ing water, which during distillation separates          a heavier and                    into
a lighter part; hence as air approximates to      a liquid nature, it
may be supposed to be separated into a heavier and a lighter
part by the action of heat; now the heavier part (the “dregs”) of
 air   more nearly allied
       is                      liquid than air, for
                                                  to      has assumed

                                                       a
a “viscid grossness;”  and this  part attaches itself    calces during
the  process     calcination,

              be heavier than before calcination.           we calcine                           If
a    vegetable          or
                 animal substance, there             gain     weight, be  is    no              of
cause the assimilated thickened air        weighs  less than the volatile
 matter expelled      heat; but   by the case          metal the assimi

lated air weighs more than the volatile matter expelled, hence
there    gain
            is    weight. Thus
                            of           imagined that       he

                                 to   a attract this thickened air.
    Glauber some years later suggested that the gain may arise
from the coagulation        heat                            by
                                       the metal during calcination.

    Becher sometimes designates the three earths as “gradus sulphu
    ris”*,-the first “fixed sulphur,” the second “volatile sulphur,”
    the third “combustible sulphur;” this last he speaks of indis
    criminately as “sulphur adustibile,” “sulphur ardens,” or “sulphur
    $Aoyuatov,” the last word being simply the Greek representative
    of ardenst. The latter word is most used; indeed      do not think                         I
    the word $Noyuatów occurs once in the     Physica Subterranea, and
    certainly not half a dozen times in the Supplementum Primum
    and Supplementum Secundum.          Becher regarded the combus
    tible principle as an innate heat.      “Sulphur est metallorum
    calidum innatum,” he writes in the Supplementum Secundum;
    and, again, argentum vivum is pervaded “spiritu quodam sul
    phureo, archaeo minerali, igne interno, seu, ut Basilius loquitur,
    primo mobili metallorum.”       When argentum vivum is fixed by
    an acid, or otherwise, it loses this innate heat, and      particles                             its
    become motionless.
         Becher built               up
                          various substances from his elements                                                    in

         Then the following expressions will represent the composition
    of   a few well-known substances according          Becher:-                   to
         W+ S= the “universal acid.”

signed his professorship and went to reside in Berlin, where he
died in 1734.    Stahl was eminent as the expounder of new views
both in medicine and in chemistry; and it is difficult to say in
which science he was considered most to excel by his contempo
raries.  He was a very voluminous writer; the principal works
in which he developes the theory of phlogiston- are the fol
lowing:—
   Zymotechnia Fundamentalis, published in 1697.
   Specimen Becherianum+, published in 1703.
   Fundamenta Chemia, published in 1723.
   Experimenta CCC numero, published in 1731.
   In the Zymotechnia Stahl has roughly sketched out the theory
of phlogiston; in the Specimen Becherianum he has elaborately
annoted passages from Becher's Physica Subterranea, and has to
a great extent blended the views therein contained with his own.
The Fundamenta Chemia is a text-book of phlogistic chemistry,
while in the Experimenta CCC numero we have a number of ex
periments in support of the theory, and answers to supposed ob
jections. The diction throughout is most barbarous, the Lati
 nity utterly unpolished; and in the third part of the Fundamenta
 Chemiae Stahl not unfrequently introduces both German and
Latin sentences into the same paragraph. The following pas
sage is from the Fundamenta Chemia —
    “Sonstist, wic gesaght, das principium p}\oyuatov im phos
phoro, und muss daraus noch die kunst erfunden werden, mix
tiones oleosas pingues, seu mixtiones pinguedinum, per artem
zu machen, als oleum weil in ihm das pXoytotov purius zu
finden.”     It was this habit, exercised in a milder form, which
caused Becher to speak of his combustible principle as sulphur
 ardens and sulphur (b)\oytotov indiscriminately.
    Stahl followed the ancients in believing in the existence of
two kinds of fire—(a) ordinary visible fire, requiring combustible
                       its
                        nutriment, which      calls ignis  flamma,

and (8) the invisible fire (materia  ignis  phlogiston),  which be

assimilate its motion.

with substances rich in phlogiston, the latter is reabsorbed, and
the metal is the result.  Sulphur is composed of sulphuric acid
plus phlogiston; therefore sulphur minus phlogiston is sulphuric
acid.  Phlogiston is spoken of as possessing “predisposing affi
nity” for substances.    We perceive, by reference to the ideas
of Becher regarding the constitution of bodies, that he consi
dered sulphur a compound of the combustible principle with
the “universal acid,” the principle of acidity.     Stahl adopted
the idea of the “universal acid;’ and some of the later phlogis
tians regarded sulphuric acid in that light.
   Shortly before Lavoisier, by an admirable series of experi
ments, proved the fallacy of the theory, the principal properties
of hydrogen were made known, and in this gas the phlogistians
took refuge as a last resource.    Hydrogen, they said, is phlo
giston; when certain metals are dissolved in acid it visibly
escapes; and when the calces of these metals are heated in hy
drogen, they become metals again by absorbing the gas. The
analogy with hydrogen appeared complete in some respects; but
the properties conferred upon the supposed phlogiston of Stahl
were utterly different from those of hydrogen in many respects.
The perversion of the original theory did not, however, end with
the attempt to prove the identity of hydrogen with phlogiston;
for after the abandonment of the theory in France it still found
supporters in Germany; and some of the more ardent (among
them Gren) preferred to grossly garble the theory rather than
relinquish      When, however,
                   it.             1792 the Academy
                                                in       Sciences                   of
 of Berlin abandoned the  theory and  adopted the views    Lavoi                     of

the phlogistians and the antiphlogistians was virtually      end,                    at   an

      Having traced the development                         the phlogistic theory, let          us
 now consider its nature and influence.
   Phlogiston was new name fora     old principle. We have seen
                                                       an

 was another name for the “pure fire”      Zoroaster, the      of

that the calcination of a metal is the expulsion of    phlogiston,                                          its

of facts which carried with them its refutation. When                                                   the first

 proved the fallacy                  of
                        the theory, this blind adherence shut the

chemistry had arisen on the ruins of the older structure of me
diaeval chemistry; and from it arose modern chemistry.    Let us
be fain to remember that the mother died in giving birth to the

Semele; and while we worship the son, like the ancients we
have not forgotten to raise a statue to the mother.

  Of    the various modes in which the constituents                  of the mineral
may be arranged,      I
                    prefer the following, aid therefore, using
the notation employed in mineralogy, propose the formula
            2CaO SiO2+2(CaO2BO3, HO)+B08, 3 HO
as that of the new mineral to which          I
                                       give the name silicoboro
calcite, chosen as companion to that of matroborocalcite, the es
sential chemical difference between minerals found in the same
region, and even, as will presently appear, in the same matrix,
occasionally being clearly indicated by these appellations: the
formula of the latter, according to my own results, when re
written so as to include some grouping seen above, is
        NaO2BO3, 10HO +2(CaO BOA, HO)+BO9, 3 HO.
   For comparison’s sake, I add the formula of cryptomorphite
(the other borate found in gypsum here), also rewritten,
      NaO2BO3, 6HO-H-3(CaO 2BO9, HO)+B08, 3HO,
so that relations can be traced between              these geologically allied
minerals.
   The constituents of silicoborocalcite are those of datholite,
the only other known hydrated silicated borate of calcium, for
which Berzelius gave the formula
                     CaO BO3 + CaO2SiO2+ HO,
an expression exhibiting proportions very unlike those shown
above to exist in the new mineral.    In datholite, as in all sili
cated borates, the boracic acid is sometimes held to be basic *.
On this view, excluding water,
 In    datholite the ratio of   0 in    SiO4 to that in the bases is               4: 5
 In silicoborocalcite                  53        3.3           3.2                 4:    19
The ratio of the same to that in all the constituents is in the
former 2: 3, in the latter 2:12; the relations thus brought out
in silicoborocalcite are so unlike those in any known compound,
that silica cannot be the only acid present.     The formula I have
proposed contains two of Wollastonite, two of normal hydrated
biborate of calcium, and one of Sassolin. While datholite and
silicoborocalcite are quantitatively unlike and physically different
on comparing the ordinary crystallized specimens of the former
with the nodules of the latter above described, there is a remark
able resemblance between these and the exceptional state in
which Whitney found datholite in a greenish magnesian silicate
near Lake Superior.     I refer to the perfectly white and opake no
dules looking like the finest marble, or some kinds of Wedgewood

ware+.    In the case of silicoborocalcite the crystals may be found,
although it is best known in nodules; indeed, as will be mentioned
immediately, it does sometimes appear crystalline.           I carefully
examined a    specimen   of anhydrite and one of  gypsum,   not earthy,
holding the mineral, and detected in both a very small amount
of silica, perhaps some two- or three-tenths per cent.
    The small quantity of sulphuric acid recorded in the foregoing
analyses arises from the presence of a little selenite, which is
very frequently most intimately associated with the new mineral.
In the hard form in anhydrite thin bands of selenite are often
seen running through the nodules, which sometimes split so as
to leave a plate of it on the exposed surface.          In gypsum the
nodules are sometimes distinctly banded with alternations of the
two minerals, and are often quite cellular, walls of selenite stand
ing up between cavities retaining more or less borate. The sele
nite sometimes carries Arragonite; and this or calcite is occasion
ally observed on the surface of the anhydritic matrix. Natro
borocalcite occurs rather abundantly in an earthy gypsum hold
ing the soft silicated borate, the minerals being independent
nodules; and very well-marked coralloidal Arragonite or flos
ferri is occasionally found in cavities along with the borate in
gypsum : this newly observed fact is interesting, as it was in
gypsum of Arragon that Arragonite was first foundt. The
locality to which the preceding description refers is Brook
ville, a property about three miles south of the Clifton quarry,
close to Windsor, where natroborocalcite           was first observed.
Brookville is on the southern edge of the deposits of plaster
in this neighbourhood, and Clifton on the northern; the depo
sits extend east for more than forty miles; and I have found
silicoborocalcite in a pure-looking gypsum from a quarry on
their range at Newport, about six miles to the east of Wind
sor. Here it does not seem to be so abundant as at Brook
ville; and it differs somewhat in external character, since it
is in white flattened nodules of a glistening crystalline appear
ance, easily separable with a knife into rather gritty particles:
it is closely associated with selenite.         I identified it by the
blowpipe-reactions and by qualitative analysis; the powder
stirred with cold hydrochloric acid gelatinized perfectly.
    New localities of Natroborocalcite.—Both Brookville and New
port are new localities for this mineral, which has been men
tioned as occurring at the former in the soft blue earthy gyp
seous matrix of the silicated borate; it is much the more abun
dant of the two. It is in its characteristic nodules sometimes

has a decomposing action on the mineral.”      As regards purity,
I formerly found only a trace of chlorine in addition to the MgO
and SO” above named, and if any essential constituent had been
washed out it should have been the soda; but my results cer
tainly show no great deficiency of this, Respecting the whole
constituents, on comparing the statement above given of the
theoretical and actual percentages, I see no reason to abandon
my formula for matroborocalcite for that newly proposed.
   Probably this mineral will be found elsewhere in this district

    of sodium” in gypsum of Windsor, marked a resemblance be
    tween it and similar rocks containing glauber and common salt
    in Spain &c., and, as regards boracic acid, with some in Ger
    many containing boracite and Stassfurthite.        Now the nodules
    of silicated borate in anhydrite and in gypsum of Brookville,
    both rocks containing a little silica, and in gypsum of Newport,
    bring these into the same class, so far as silica is concerned, with
    some gypsums (originally belonging to secondary strata) in the
    Hartz, which, according to Fropolli, contain nodules of silicate
    of magnesia, and with those of Montmartre near Paris, which
    hold soluble silica, or flints and chertif.      Further analogy be
    tween these and other      sulphate-of-calcium    deposits is shown in
    the  fact, which     I
                        have  lately  learned, that nearly every specimen
    of gypsum and anhydrite here yielding borates contains carbo

    some extent of magnesia (of which traces appear in the borates as
    seen in my analyses), as well as in the detection now announced
    of Arragonite in cavities in gypsum, and of crusts of this mineral
    or calcite on the surfaces of gypsum and anhydrite, and also
    sometimes on the natroborocalcite and silicoborate in the former,
    and close to and underlying the silicoborocalcite of the latter.
       These mineral contents and the numerous brine-springs of the
    gypsiferous districts here point to sea-water as the parent of the
    gypsum ; but, as          I
                          observed in a former paper (1861) referred
    to  above,  ordinary   sea-water would not furnish boracic acid.

sometimes to originate indirectly from anhydrite by absorption
of water. Here we must remember, as Von Cotta says, that “the
supposed origin of gypsum from anhydrite leaves the greater
difficulty unsolved of the original deposit of anhydrous sulphate
of lime”*; and this rock we have here containing imbedded in
it hydrated minerals, namely selenite and silicoborocalcite. The
latter being in rounded nodules, may have been reduced to that
form before being included; but the angular, lustrous, and trans
parent crystals of selenite cannot have been subject to action
capable of so affecting a body originally angular as to render it
a pebble.    The nodules of hard silicoborocalcite are imbedded (so
 far as I observed—and           I
                            examined the accessible parts of some
 300 tons of quarried rock piled in a low heap for shipment, and
 also saw the mineral in situ) exclusively in anhydrite, the soft
 exclusively in gypsum ; there is an intermediate degree of hard
ness in the mineral found in a matrix composed of both these
rocks. We might hence conclude that the soft results from the
 hard borate in consequence of physical changes accompanying
the passage of anhydrite into gypsum : this is not impossible in ,
 some cases; but the gypsum holding the soft borate most abun
 dantly is not only so much less pure a rock than the anhydrite
holding the hard nodules that it could not have arisen by mere
absorption of water, but there are frequently imbedded in it
 separate nodules of natroborocalcite, which       have never seen in I
 anhydrite.    As regards the passing of anhydrite into gypsum,
 what proofs are there of            its

when there was a weight of 200 grammes in the scale-pan.        A
notched cork in a tube of 6 millims. diameter could draw a
weight of 70 grammes.
   The author assigns as the cause of these motions the oblique
propagation of the impulse of the transverse vibrations, produced
by the unevennesses of the moving body, although the motion
travels over the transverse modes.    As the motion ceases at the
longitudinal nodes, the longitudinal vibration may exert some
influence, but cannot produce the motion.
   If, in order to eliminate the influence of the longitudinalvi
bration, a glass rod be suspended by threads in two places, and
if by striking it or by drawing across it a violin-bow it be made
to vibrate, a notched piece of cork moves from one end to the
other in the direction indicated by the notching of the cork.
   The following experiment served for the direct proof of the
action of the oblique propagation of an impulse:—Through a
block about a cubic inch in volume an oblique aperture was bored
 about 10 millims. in diameter and at an angle of about 60° to
the base. The aperture was closed at the top by a metal plate
in which was a small hole; through this passed a wire fixed below
to a piece of wood which accurately fitted in the aperture.
Round the wire there was a spiral spring which pressed against
the plate at the top and against the piece of wood in the aper
ture. When this apparatus was placed on a sounding rod and
loaded by a weight, the spiral in the aperture was thereby com
pressed; and it moved, either on a longitudinally or transversely
sounding rod, always in the direction in which the spring was
inclined.
   That the motion oversteps the transverse nodes may be partly
explained by the circumstance that the nodal lines are not fixed,
but that the sand in a tube is often moved more than half an inch
while it is sounding, and partly that the contact does not take
place either at a mathematical point or in a mathematical line.
The motion at the transversal modes is also essentially slower
than between them, and on the longitudinal nodes it entirely
ceases.    On transversely sounding rods the moving force of the
shifting body is smaller than upon longitudinally sounding bars.
   The author has made a second series of experiments, on the
transference of the motion of longitudinally sounding bodies to
the air, and on a method based on this principle for determining
the velocity of sound in solid bodies and in gases.
  If    some lycopodium powder be distributed in a glass tube
about 4 feet in length and ; of an inch wide, open at both ends,
and if the tube, while held horizontally, be set in longitudinal
vibration, the powder collects at the bottom in places which
correspond to the spiral nodal lines.   If,  however, the tube be

closed by well-fitting corks, the dust, which has previously been
uniformly distributed, collects no longer in those nodes of the
glass, but forms a series of heaps, each of which consists of a
number of fine cross lines.                             If
                                  the tube be again rubbed, the
dust again whirls about, and, when the tone sounds, deposits
again in the same manner.       But if the sound be not allowed to
die out slowly, but be suddenly interrupted, by rapidly rubbing
the tube with a quick stroke and then suddenly clasping it with
the cloth in the middle of a stroke, the same periodical accumula
tions of dust are observed; but the delicate ripples have disap
peared, and the whole appearance of the figure is more indistinct.

    These dust-figures furnish a convenient means for determining
the velocity of sound in solids and in gases.
    Since the velocity of sound in air is known for a given tempe
rature, from the distance of corresponding places of two succes
sive heaps of dust, which is equal to half the length of the sound
wave, we get the number of vibrations of the tone of the column
of air, and, as this tone is the same as that of the tube, the num
ber of vibrations of the material of the tube.            Conversely, from
the known      velocity  of sound in the material of the tube, the ve
locity of sound in an enclosed gas may be calculated from the
observed length of the enclosed gas.            In tubes in which the ve
locity of sound is equal, and which are filled with different gases
and held in the middle while being rubbed, the velocities of
sound in the gases are inversely as the numbers of heaps of dust.
This mode of determination is sufficiently accurate.                 But the
desire to   get  still more accurate     results, and to be able to deter
mine the velocity of sound in solids, led M. Kundt to produce the
dust-figures, not in the sounding tube, but in an adjacent column
of air. Over the closed end of a glass tube a few feet in length,
a somewhat wider glass tube was pushed to a distance of a quarter
the length of this closed tube, and was here firmly fixed by a
cork. At the other end of the outside tube was a cork, which
by means of a rod could be moved backwards and forwards. If
now the first tube, by which the apparatus is held in the hand,
 be rubbed in the middle so that two nodes are formed, the vibra
 tions of the closed end set in motion the air of the tube sur
                to it,

of 5–10 measurements.       .
     I. Steel.—Three steel bars, of the same kind of steel as far as
could be ascertained, were used : one was 1002.7 millims. in
length and 10 millims. in thickness; the two others were 5 mil
lims. thick and 1001.7 millims. and 501 millims. long respec
tively.    Taking the the velocity of sound in air as unity, they
gave the velocities respectively
                     15:325,    15:334,        15-343.
     II. Brass.-A brass    rod, about a metre long and 5 millims.
thick, gave, in three successive experiments,
                       10-88,      10.87,       10-86.
A    second, similar one gave
                                   10-94,
and, with    a dust-tube not closed at the end,
   -
                                  10.90.
     III. Glass.-A thin glass      rod gave, in three successive expe
riments,
                       15:24,      15:25,      15-24.
     IV.  Copper.—For a copper wire above a foot in length there
was obtained
                                11,966
     Wertheim found for cast steel 14:961, for steel wire 15-108,
for copper 11-167, numbers which agree with the above as ac
curately as can be expected from the difference of the materials.
     In the case of gases the author did not use the external tube,
but filled different tubes with different gases and counted the
 dust-figures produced. There is thus obtained an easily repro
 duced image of the various velocities of sound, whose ratio can
only be obtained approximately by counting, yet with sufficient
 accuracy.

   A tube filled with air through which ether had passed gave
35 waves instead of 32; that                          is,

tained of a few invariable sizes. At the suggestion of the
author, the “Boston Belting Company” now manufacture an
excellent article, which they call “stopper-cord,” consisting of
conical rolls of very elastic rubber about 4 feet in length and vary
ing in diameter from , an inch at one end to 1% inch at the
other *.     From these rolls stoppers of any required size between
the limits named may be cut with an ordinary knife and bored
with a common brass cork-borer.              It is only necessary to
moisten the tools with water in order to prevent the adhesion
of the rubber. Stoppers of this material are absolutely air
tight even against a full atmospheric pressure, provided that the
surface of adhesion to the glass neck is at least half an inch in
length.
    Another material of prime importance in these experiments
is  sodium-amalgam,      which is most conveniently used when con
taining so large an amount of sodium as to form a hard solid.
 It is best prepared by gently heating a few ounces of metallic
mercury in a shallow iron dish and then cautiously adding one
twentieth of        weight  its

gases, we prove by the electrolysis of strong liquid hydrochloric
acid, having previously shown in the course of the lecture how
HCl is obtained from common salt, and that the liquid acid is

faucet and the gas burnt as      it is forced out through the over
flow-tube.
    We have now proved, first, that hydrochloric acid is composed
of hydrogen and chlorine, secondly, that these gases are present
in equal proportions by volume; and in order to complete our
demonstration of the constitution of this typical compound, we
have only to prove that when these equal volumes unite to form
 HCl there is no condensation.        This we may do either synthe
tically or analytically.
     The synthetical experiment is made by filling the absorption
tube as before with the mixed gases obtained by the electrolysis
 of hydrochloric acid, taking great care, as also in the previous
 experiment, that the tube shall be perfectly dry. It will of
 course be necessary to have two of these tubes if both experi
 ments are to be made in the same lecture.        The tube thus filled
 is to be exposed for some time to bright diffused sunlight, and
 afterwards directly to the sunbeam until perfect combination
 results.    If the glass is quite thick and the rubber stopper is
 forced   in very tight, the gases may even be exploded in the
 tube without danger, although this form of the experiment is
 always attended with some risk.         When the gases are in either
 way thoroughly combined, the end of the exit-tube is first
 opened under mercury, in order to prove that no condensation
 has taken place, and afterwards under water coloured blue by
 litmus, when a very rapid absorption takes place, and the red
 dening of the water will indicate that HCl has in fact been
 formed.
     The analytical experiment is made by decomposing HCl gas
 by means of sodium-amalgam.           For this purpose the carefully
  dried gas  is first collected over mercury   in a perfectly dry tube.
 This tube we assume is graduated, or at least divided into two
 parts of equal capacity.       The tube full of gas is now slipped
 over the mouth of a rubber cap, which has been previously
 filled with the amalgam (see fig. 5, left side of the woodcut), and
  sunk in the mercury-trough until the liquid is just level with
 the brim. This cap, which is easily made from the “stopper
 cord,” should be capable of holding 10 or 20 cubic centims.
 of the amalgam, and should tightly clasp the tube. Moreover,
 for this purpose, the solid amalgam above described should be
 reduced with mercury to the consistency of a thin paste.           The
 amalgam is now to be shaken up in the tube for several minutes.
 until the decomposition is complete, and then the mouth of the
 tube may be opened under mercury. The liquid will rise to
 supply the place of the chlorine which has been absorbed; and
 on sinking the tube in the mercury-trough until the level is the
 same within as without, it will appear that exactly one-half of

the volume has disappeared.      As this, however, would require a
deep cistern of mercury, and as the interior surface of the tube
is left in such a very dirty condition as to obscure the result, we
prefer to transfer the tube to a jar of water, which, when the
cap is removed, at once displaces the mercury and washes out
the interior without sensibly impairing the accuracy of the ex
periment.

it at this temperature during the
rest   of the experiment.     This is
most conveniently done by passing
through the outer tube the vapour
of amylic alcohol (fousel oil), which
may be generated in a flask placed
at one side and connected by a
glass tube with the upper end of
the apparatus.             The      tubulature
at the lower end of the tube should
at the same time be dipped into
the mouth of a glass bottle into
which the alcohol may flow as fast
as the vapour is condensed; and
since the latent heat of this vapour
is very small, this simple method
of condensation will be found am
ply sufficient.
   As soon as the temperature of
the eudiometer-tube is constant,
which can easily be told, because
the mercury-column will then remain at a constant height, mer
cury must be poured into the open tube or withdrawn from it
by the nipper-tap until the level is the same in both limbs of
the apparatus.     It remains now only to note the volume of the
confined  gas,   and to explode it by passing an electric spark
through the platinum wire already noticed—first, however,

      Ammonia.-The points to be illustrated in the                    case   of ammo
nia are indicated by the equation
   We demonstrate the composition of ammonia by the old
methods, which are familiar to every teacher, synthetically by
passing a mixture of nitric oxide, and hydrogen over heated
platinum-sponge as in the beautiful experiment of the late Dr.
Hare, and analytically by decomposing aqua ammoniae either by
electrolysis or by means of chlorine. For the electrolysis of
ammonia the decomposing-cell    (fig. 1) may be used, filling it
with the strongest aqua ammoniae and adding a not too small
amount of sulphate of ammonia in order to increase the conduct
ing-power of the liquid.        The reaction is less simple than in the
electrolysis either of water or of hydrochloric acid; but as the
final result the gases are evolved, very nearly at least, in atomic
proportions, three volumes of hydrogen to one of nitrogen.
They can be collected separately in graduated bells as in the
electrolysis of water.       In decomposing ammonia by chlorine, we
use with    very  satisfactory  results the apparatus shown in fig. 6,
and already described.         For this use, however, a tube should be
selected so thin that water may be boiled in it without risk of
breaking the glass.        The tube having been filled by displace
ment with     pure  and   dry  chlorine gas, we press down the lower
end into very weak aqua ammoniae (eight measures of water to
one of the concentrated solution) until the liquid, flowing in
through the overflow-tube, rises to the height of the first rubber
ring. We now quickly close the delivery-tube with                  rubber     its
cap and allow the absorption           continue until the tube

       V. On a   remarkable       Phenomenon observed at Rangoon.
                 By Dr. C. Collingwood, F.L.S.*
I   ACCIDENTALLY          heard mention by an eye-witness (a lady
      residing at Hong Kong) of a circumstance which struck me
as so remarkable and interesting that I collected the particulars
with care, allowing the narrator to tell her own story, and filling
up important particulars by putting questions as little as possible
calculated either to lead or mislead.
   It was in the year 1846 that she was on board her husband’s
ship the ‘Manook,” in the Rangoon River, and was walking up and
down the poop in company with the chief mate and a child four
years old, the poop awning being at the time spread overhead.
It was about half-past 7 in the evening, and then quite dark,
when suddenly, without any warning, a tremendous sheet of light
appeared   to rush across the bows of the vessel in a horizontal
direction.   The light was not like lightning, but appeared to
pass swiftly along, and had the aspect of a red thick flame, occu
pying the whole space left visible between the awning and the
ship. The suddenness and terrific nature of the glare was such
that she fell down upon the deck, believing, as she expresses                           it,
that the world had come        an end, while the child screamed
                                   to
aloud with terror.
   As this frightful luminous appearance rushed        the ship              by         a
considerable accession       of
                           heat was felt                by
                                            both the adult persons,
and a   strong sulphurous smell also accompanied       though how           it,
long this feature lasted cannot now                be
                                         stated with any  certainty.
But the    phenomenon    was  unaccompanied        any  sound,    by
                                                                and
                    it. on
sped noiselessly       nor could they see where      went,     what    it         or
finally became   of     ;
                        The whole affair lasted but some seconds,
the  light  having dashed past them with     speed only inferior
                                                        a                               to
lightning.
   The captain   of the ship, and Captain Brown, postmaster and
only European resident         the time, were
                              at                    the house in   the             of
latter, situated but    short distance from the shore and from the
                        a

                                                        a
heat, although they saw        light; and when told

            Sir W. Thomson on Volta-Convection by Flame.                 65
had pointed out that the effect of the flame of an insulated lamp
is to reduce the lamp and other conducting material connected
with it to the same potential as that of the air in the neighbour
hood of the flame, and that the effect of a fine jet of water from
an insulated vessel is to bring the vessel and other conducting
material connected with it to the same potential as that of the
air at the point where the jet breaks into drops.            In a recent
communication to the      Royal   Society  “On a   Self-acting    Appa
ratus for Multiplying and Maintaining Electric Charges, with
applications to illustrate the Voltaic Theory,” an experiment
was described in which a water-dropping apparatus was employed
to prove the difference of potential in the air, in the neighbour
hood of bright metallic surfaces of zinc and copper metallically
connected     with one another, which is to be expected from
Volta's   discovery of contact-electricity. In the present commu
nication a similar experiment is described, in which the flame of
a spirit-lamp is used instead of a jet of water breaking into drops.
   A spirit-lamp is placed on an
insulated stand connected with               A-------------------
a    very   delicate    electrometer.
Copper and zinc cylinders, in
metallic connexion  with the
metal case       of the electrometer,
are alternately held vertically
                                                                 in
in such a position that the
flame burns nearly in the cen
tre of the cylinder, which is open
at both ends.          If

cylinder surrounding the flame,
                                                                 §

served with the zinc cylinder
surrounding the flame indicates
positive electrification of the in        s§
sulated stand bearing the lamp.
   It is to be remarked that the
differential method here follow
ed eliminates the ambiguity        in
volved in what is meant by the
potential of a conducting system
composed partly of flame, partly
of alcohol, and partly of metal.
In  a merely illustrative experiment, which the author has already
made, the amount of difference made by substituting the zinc
cylinder        for
               the copper cylinder round the flame was rather
more than half the difference  potential maintained
                                    of                      by a      single

cell of Daniell’s.   Thus, when the sensibility of the quadrant
 divided-ring electrometer* was such that a single cell of Daniell’s
 gave a deflection of 79 scale-divisions,        the difference of the
 reading when the zinc cylinder was substituted for the copper
 cylinder round the insulated lamp was 39 scale-divisions.
 From other experiments on contact-electricity made seven years
ago by the author, and agreeing with results which have been
published by Hankel, it appears that the difference of potentials

earth, and the other (the receiver-spring) with an insulated
piece of metal called the receiver, which is analogous to the
“prime conductor” of an ordinary electric machine. The point
of contact of the earth-spring with the carriers is exposed to the
influence of an electrified body (generally an insulated piece of
metal) called the inductor. When this is negatively electrified,
each carrier comes away from contact with the earth-spring,
carrying positive electricity, which it gives up, through the re
ceiver-spring, to the receiver.     The receiver and inductor are
each hollowed out to a    proper  shape, and are properly placed to
surround, each as nearly as may be, the point of contact of the
corresponding spring.
   The inductor, for the good working of the machine, should be
kept electrified to a constant potential. This is effected by an
adjunct called the replenisher, which may be applied to the main
wheel, but which, for a large instrument, ought to be worked by
a much smaller carrier-wheel, attached either to the same or to
                                              -
another turning-shaft.
   The replenisher consists chiefly of two properly shaped pieces
of metal called inductors, which are fixed in the neighbourhood
of a carrier-wheel, such as that described above, and four fixed

the inductors is generally connected with the earth, and the other
insulated). They are so situated that they are touched by the car
riers on emerging from the inductors, and shortly after the con
tacts with the receiver-springs.        If any difference of potential
between the inductors is       given to begin with, the action of the
carriers, as is easily seen, increases it according to the compound
interest law as long as the insulation is perfect.       Practically, in
a few seconds after the machine is started running, bright flashes

duced by disconnecting the two inductors from one another and
connecting them with the two plates of a single Daniell’s cell,
when either the zinc or the copper lining is left in one of them.
These differences are very approximately in simple proportion
to the differences of potentials between the pairs of the opposite
quadrants of the electrometer in the different cases. The dif
ference between the effects of zinc and of copper in this arrange
ment is of course in the direction corresponding to the posi
tive electrification of the quadrants connected with the spring
whose point of contact is exposed to the zinc-lined inducing
surface.    It must be remembered, however, as is to be expected
from Hankel’s observations, that the difference measured will be
much affected by a slight degree of tarnishing by oxidation, or
otherwise, of the inner surface of either inductor.              When the
copper surface is brought to a slate-colour by oxidation under
the influence of heat, the contact difference between it and
polished zinc amounts sometimes, as I found in experiments
made seven years ago, to 125, that of a single cell of Daniell’s
being called 100.

  The principal subjects discussed in the second lecture are the
physical difference between noises and musical sounds, the nature
of musical pitch, the connexion between the pitch and wave-length
of musical sounds, and the limits of pitch within which sounds are
audible and available for musical purposes.
    The whole of the third lecture is devoted to the explanation of the
laws of vibrating strings.        Some beautiful experiments in illustration
of this subject, which were made known a few years ago by Professor
Melde of Marburg, have been extended by Professor Tyndall with
wonderful ingenuity, so that he is able in this lecture to render stri
kingly visible the separate effect of each of the conditions upon
which the rate of vibration of a stretched string depends. For their
 combination of intrinsic beauty with demonstrative value, the expe
riments described in this lecture are perhaps on the whole the most
remarkable in the book; and the verbal explanations of the phenomena
 they are intended to illustrate are not less excellent. The production
 of stationary vibrations, by the combined action of direct and reflected
 progressive waves, however, is a subject which, considering                      im                           its
 portance, might with advantage have been discussed rather more fully.
    The fourth lecture treats of the transverse vibrations of rods and
 plates; but, though full               excellent matter,          presents less

    “The most marvellous flame hitherto discovered is now before
 you. It issues from the single orifice of a steatite burner, and reaches
 a height of 24 inches.      The slightest tap on a distant anvil reduces
 its height to 7 inches.     When I shake this bunch of keys the flame
 is violently agitated and emits a loud roar. The dropping of a six
 pence into a hand already containing coin, at a distance of 20 yards,
 knocks the flame down.         I cannot walk across the floor without
 agitating the flame.      The creaking of my boots sets it in violent
 commotion.       The crumpling or tearing of a bit of paper, or the
 rustle of a silk dress, does the same. It is startled by the patter of
 a raindrop.     I hold a watch near the flame, nobody hears its ticks;
 but you all see their effect upon the flame. At every tick it falls.
 The winding up of the watch also produces tumult.         The twitter of
 a distant sparrow shakes the flame down; the note of a cricket
 would do the same.        From a distance of 30 yards I have chirruped
 to this flame and caused it to fall and roar. I repeat a passage from
 Spenser:—
           “Her ivory forehead, full of bounty brave,
               Like a broad table did itself dispread
             For love his lofty triumphs to engrave
               And write the battles of his great godhead.
             All  truth and goodness might therein be read,
               For there their dwelling was; and when she spake,
             Sweet words, like dropping honey, she did shed;
               And through the pearls and rubies softly brake
               A silver sound, which heavenly music seemed to make.’
    “The flame picks out certain sounds from my utterance; it notices
 some by the slightest nod, to others    it bows more distinctly, to some
 its obeisance is very profound, while to many sounds it turns an en
 tirely deaf ear.”
    The seventh lecture treats of the phenomena which result from
 the coexistence of two or more sets of vibrations in the same me
 dium, namely interferences, beats, and resultant tones.
    In the eighth lecture the principles previously explained are ap
 plied to elucidate the physical causes of harmony and discord, and
 the distinctive characteristics of the principal musical intervals.
 Professor Tyndall of course adopts Helmholtz's view that rapid beats
are the cause of discord, and that resultant tones are an independent
phenomenon; but his explanation of the different effects upon the
ear of resultant tones and of beats is not quite accurate.       In order
to account for the disturbing effects of the latter as compared with
the perfect musical character of the former, we are told (p. 299) that
whereas “the impulses of ordinary sonorous waves are gently gra
duated, in the beats, on the contrary, the boundaries of sound and
silence are abrupt, and they therefore subject the ear to that jerking
intermittence which expresses itself to consciousness as dissonance.”
Very little reflection upon the way in which beats are generated, or
a glance at figure 145 (p. 269), is sufficient to show that the sudden
alternations of sound and silence here spoken of do not exist. The

                    Notices respecting New Books.                               77
real cause of the disagreeable effect of beats upon the ear is no doubt
that suggested by Helmholtz when he compares it to the unpleasant
effect produced on the eye by frequent alternations of light and dark
ness. Resultant tones, on the other hand, are probably perceived, just
as though they were primary tones, through the agency of quite a dis
tinct set of ear-fibres (Corti's fibres) from those affected by the gene
rating tones. In the same lecture (p. 301), speaking of the unsa
tisfactory musical character of simple tones, such as the tones of
tuning-forks or of stopped-diapason organ-pipes, Professor Tyndall
contents himself with saying that such tones “would be like pure
 water, flat and dull, . . . . . . . and would not satisfy the demand of
the ear for brightness and energy.”         The reason of this—namely
that, with such tones, the difference between pure and impure inter
vals is revealed to the ear only by resultant tones, generally of the
 second or third order—is not alluded to.        On pages 305 and 306
 Professor  Tyndall   has  reproduced     Helmholtz's diagrams showing
 the relative degrees of consonance and dissonance resulting from the
 combination of the tone middle c with every possible tone up to
 treble c, and of the latter with every tone up to c in alto.      In the
 explanation of these diagrams, it should have been stated, not
 only that the marks es and as “are the German names of a flat third
 and flat sixth,” but also that b stands for a flat seventh, our by and
 6 being respectively represented in German musical notation by b
and h.

German Obertöne and Combinationstöne, and we receive them grate
fully. We cannot, however, say much for clangtint

place, it  appears to   usunnecessary, the word quality having already
  perfectly well-understood technical meaning coincident with that

and  pressures   are considerable.

    It
     thus appears that hydrogen is the chief constituent of the stars
of this group.    The peculiar phenomena in y Cassiopeia, where, in
stead of the dark line f, there is a bright one, might be explained
by the fact that hydrogen gives at low temperatures a continuous spec
trum in which the line fis bright, and that hydrogen, when present
in small quantity, does not invert the spectrum. There are doubtless
other lines between those of hydrogen, but they are relatively very
feeble; the most prominent are those of magnesium and of sodium.
The second type, that of a Herculis, is far less numerous, but is re
markably constant.     Direct measurements gave exactly the same
                                                       in all
lines in the same places in    stars    this type. The only difference    of
is
in        the circumstance that                                 the normal stars                 a    Herculis,       [3   Pegasi,

    From this Table an identity is manifest, as accurately as can be
proved by a comparison of the fundamental lines, between the various
red-coloured stars, and between the yellow stars and our sun.                                         The
Table also shows the difference in the position of the lines in the white
stars of the type of Vega.
    It is curious that red stars of the seventh magnitude, like Lalande
12561, give a measurable spectrum, while this is not the case with
white stars of the same magnitude. This arises from the feeble dis
persion of their light, by which separate bright lines are formed
pretty much as in the nebulae.                      A light which is not dispersed,
though it be feeble, retains a remarkable intensity.                                  Thus I could
distinctly see the separate sodium lines in the flame of an ordinary
small candle at a distance of 2 kilometres.
    It is to be remarked that in the red stars the dark lines are really
bands like those which the absorption of our atmosphere produces
in solar light. Thus the line D is enormously broadened, far more
than the very fine sodium line.                   This proves that these stars are
surrounded by very absorbent atmospheres, the nature of which
cannot be made out until chemists can distinguish what belongs in
the spectrum to the nature of the substance from what depends on
the temperature.—Comptes                  Rendus, vol. lxiv. p. 774.

tability of volatile liquids by M. Drion; and in the Philosophical
Magazine for May 1864. I have shown, by a graphical analysis
of M. Drion’s results, that they indicate, as a general law of
liquid expansion, that the inverse of the absolute increment of
volume diminishes regularly as the temperature ascends.    For
example, if a liquid expands                              Tºm at

reference to the absolute increment          of volume, not to the relative
increment,      as  I  had at first deduced from my own observations
in sealed tubes at high temperatures.
   § 2. This was a fortunate discovery, because, on extending
the inquiry to the numerous chemically pure liquids experimented
upon by M. Pierre”, other relations make their appearance that
confirm the general law, and further develope an interesting con
nexion between molecular volume, liquid cohesion, and saturated
vapour-density, which we are enabled to trace distinctly by means
of M. Regnault's great and admirable labours published in the
twenty-first and twenty-sixth volumes of the Memoirs of the
French Academy.                                    -
   § 3.   Although        a good deal of labour is required to bring out
the numerical results from the observations, the thermomolecular
relations are simple enough in their nature.            I will endeavour to
explain them concisely by diagram before proceeding to give the
evidence upon which they are founded, and for simplicity will
confine the attention to two liquids chemically analogous,                 the
hydrobromic and hydriodic ethers.

rate at a of the second liquid; but we have to keep in mind that
the unit of volume, as well as the increment of temperature, is
#    time the absolute value of the unit and increment of the first.
   Thus the behaviour of the two liquids and their saturated va
pours are precisely the same at absolute temperatures proportional
to their liquid molecular volume.
   The evidence is nearly complete that in the same category are
to be found hydrochloric ether and chloroform.

                              be remarked

cut the axis of temperature at —82°7, being 3°7 lower than
the water-line.
   § 19. There are nine sets of points in Plate II., marked
Sl O'44-18(H0%),      &c., which                               are

water-node,  and the static series to the ether-node.   The obser
vations above 0°, both by Regnault and Faraday, point to the
ether-node.   The line of sulphide of carbon cuts the zero ordi
mate at 0712.    The points given by the observations on hydro
chloric ether range in a regular curve; so they cannot strictly be
held to conform; but the hydrobromic and hydriodic ethers give
points very exactly in a line. The methyloxalic-ether points
range pretty well in a line that is directed to the water-node.
The pyroxylic-spirit points are not so exactly in range as the best
of the others: two lines were drawn; the intersection of one is
at 1:18, and of the other at 1:27; the mean is 1:225; so there is
no doubt that its mode is the same as that of water.
    § 21. It will be remarked (Plate         that above the boiling     I.)
point the observations decline below the straight line; this quite                                         is
consistent with the deviation from the law of Mariotte disco
vered       by
             Regnault. The pressure      less than the density would
give    if that law were maintained                               at is
                                          high pressures; and, vice

tubes throughout was satisfactory.     The series of vapour-den
sities derived from them led to the discovery of the law; the
points are laid down on the chart in the Archives of the
Royal Society for 1852. The line produced downwards will
be found thereon to cut the axis of temperature at –79°, being
eacactly the same as the line of water-vapour in Plate II.  It is
marked off on Plate                       III.;

denotes the point of transition found afterwards by another set
of observations in short tubes.
    § 24. Another specimen of dilute alcohol (62 per cent. water
and boiling-point 86°5) was tried in four tubes up to 190°.
The points will be found in the same chart, and to range fairly
in a straight line that, when produced, cuts the axis at –73°.
   § 25. A specimen of sulphide of carbon that boiled at 49° was
tried up to 160°; the points and line drawn through them are
also to be found on the chart. It is curious that the line pro
duced downwards cuts the zero ordinate at 0715, almost the
same as the line drawn through the points      of Regnault's obser
vations below the   boiling-point.    Both in     node and     upper            its                     its

 cuts the axis at –274°.     The dichloride was also tried, in two
 tubes but the   points did not range well; the general trend was
 parallel to the chloride. It may be that the true line converges
 to —274°, certainly not to the ether-node.

    § 29. The following are the extracts from an unpublished
 paper giving an account of these observations, made in 1852.
    “The chief object of the following experiments was to as
 certain if the law of density of saturated vapours holds good up
 to that point where, according to M. Cagniard de la Tours's                                                  in
 teresting researches, the liquid condition seems to terminate
 suddenly. The observations were made on the same principle
 as those which were the means of detecting the general law of
density, the details of which have been communicated to the
 Royal Society. The tubes were mostly from 2 to 3 inches in
length. The graphical method was employed to compute vapour
density and liquid-volume (see Phil. Mag. vol. xxvi. Appendix                                                 II.

vapour from 0-14 to 0-18.
    “Dichloride of Sulphur.—Four tubes; transition temperature
estimated at about 500°, at which the liquid and the vapour are
of the same density, nearly 0.35 (the liquid unit density at 29°5).
    “Turpentine shows singular phenomena of change of colour
 (becoming scarlet before transition) and decomposition.         On
cooling, after transition, the liquid was thick and oily, deep
green by reflected light, and reddish brown by transmitted.      On
opening the point of the tube there was a violent rush of gas
and effervescence of the liquid, which had first the odour of pitch,
then of creosote, and then naphtha, but had lost that of tur
pentine.
   “It    was remarked         in these observations that near the transi
tion-point the rate of apparent liquid-expansion becomes so very
great that it is difficult to keep the liquid surface steady; it rises
and falls like a sensitive air-thermometer. The capillary attrac
tion ceases, and from being concave the surface becomes first
quite flat, then convex like mercury.”
   § 30. The law of saturated vapour-density thus appears to be
strictly maintained from the zero of vapour up to the transition
point. It is not altered by the liquid becoming solid (Regnault),
and is uninfluenced by the abnormal expansion of water.           The
liquid molecules of water are abnormal in their change of volume,
while the vapour-molecules       in contact with them behave as if
they were subject to the influences common to               the other  all
liquids expanding        the normal manner.

projected  to t in thirteen cases, which include the most accordant,
Nos. 1 to 8, and the least accordant, Nos. 12 to 13. The most
remarkable is sulphurous ether, No. 6.           The first series of
five observations are in perfect accordance with the theory, and
prove the extreme accuracy of M. Pierre in this and several
others, which are almost as good.       In other cases, as Nos. 11,
12, 13, where the law of continuity is not maintained, it appears
as if some chemical disturbance had taken place in the liquid
during the process of heating.

measured at t temperatures,                       are proportional                to the h tangents
(§ 4) respectively.
   § 39. To find this tangent, we take two points in the line of
vapour (Plate I.), and measure by scale, first the difference m of
the ordinates at those points, and second the difference 6 of the
                             The quotient                              Thus the easy plan is to

select the points so that m= 1, which gives                                 6–h,      the constant     of
that particular line of vapour.
   § 40. As a convenient point through which to draw the line
parallel to the axis upon which t temperatures have to be mea
sured, we may take the intersection of the muriatic-ether-line
with 0°C. This is drawn on Plate III. It intersects the hy
drobromic-ether-line at 27°4. The vapour-density of this ether
is 54-5 (on hydrogen scale), and spec. grav. at 0° 1'473; the
volume at 27°4 by Pierre's observations is 1.0387 (volume at 0°
unity). Hence, to find the liquid molecular volume at 27°4, the

  The hydriodic-ether-line intersects the T line at 62°4, at which
temperature the volume is 1-082; the vapour-density is 78, and
spec. grav. at 0°               1975;       we have                            =42.73–p of hy

  Now h of the first is 1586, and of the second 177 (as may be

 multiplying this value of C by o, the vapour-density or molecular
 weight (not atomic weight) of the body, we obtain a number that
 represents the cohesive integral of a molecule of that body at the
 T temperature.
    Performing this computation for several bodies and comparing
 the numbers with the respective values of h and of u, if it is
found that they follow the same ratio, that                                                      Co is      a constant

tional to the square of the electromotive force divided by the
entire resistance of the circuit. This holds good so long as the
current performs no other work than the production of heat.
That this law deduced from experiment is correct may be re
garded as proved, since, as Clausius has shown”, it may be
theoretically deduced.    But if the current at the same time that
it produces heat performs other work, the quantity of heat de
veloped must be diminished by an amount corresponding to this
work. Hence, if we have a voltaic battery of given electromotive
force, whose poles are joined by means of a solid conductor, and
if besides the electromotive force we know both the internal and
external resistance of the battery, the quantity of heat developed
during a certain time may easily be calculated.      Assume, now,
that part of the external resistance is removed, and in        place                                  its

tromotive force and the resistance will have undergone          alte                                   no
ration. Yet the heat    produced   cannot          great      before,   be     so                 as
since the current, along with the production         heat, performs                of
the mechanical work necessary for chemically decomposing the
water.   This      is
                 due    the circumstance that, when water
                                 to                               de                                    is
composed into   hydrogen   and oxygen, there           absorption              is      an                       of
heat, and that this absorption       equal      the heat produced
                                                         is              to

current must be greater in the former case than in the latter
case, though the entire quantity in circulation is the same in both

Hence in the luminous arc the current performs a mechanical
work which is not compensated by the absorption of heat which
takes place there.
    We assume a voltaic battery of given electromotive force and
its poles connected by a solid conductor with a definite resistance.
The quantity of heat which is then produced by the current in
a given time is likewise determined. If now we assume that a
part of the solid conductor is taken away, and that in                       place                         its

must be smaller than that which can be calculated from the electro
motive force and the resistance; for now the current, along with
the production              of
                       heat, performs the mechanical work necessary
for detaching the material particles from the poles. This dis

pressed as electromotive force of the battery.    If the latter be
denoted  by E and the electromotive force in the luminous arc
by D, we have
                     E
           12.285-1-8-4= 20.685
                                   -T20,685–6-7–13-985’
                                            E–D
from which we obtain D = 0-3239 E.
   Eageriment II. When the resistance M was increased to
14:176 units, and 11-0 units of the rheostat were interposed in
the circuit, the intensity was =Tg. 45° 30'. The following re
sults were obtained with this intensity:—
      Length of the arc    = 3 divisions.         Resistance   = 10:4
                               2                               = 9-8
                               I
              92     39             33                29
              29     3.3            35                33.      = 9-2
   For this intensity we have thus a+3b=10:4, a +2b=9-8,
and a + b =9-2, from which a-8-6 and b = 0-6.
   Calculating D in the same manner as in the preceding expe
riment, we have
                            D=0.3416 E.
   Eaperiment III. In this experiment M was made = 21:29
units.   When 13.5 inches of the rheostat was inserted in addi
tion, the tangent-compass indicated 36° 22' in the mean. The
entire length of the rheostat was 13.5 inches; so that, retaining
the value mentioned for M, the intensity could not have been
made smaller by means of the rheostat.       When the length of
the luminous arc amounted to 2    divisions, the deflection of the
galvanometer was 33°40'.      From this the resistance in the             lu
minous arc may be readily calculated.     For we obtain:—
      Length of the arc = 2 divisions.        Resistance       = 16*66
             35    33      =   1   95                33        = 14.76
We thus obtain, since the intensity is =Tg.83°40', a +2b=16.66
and   a   +b=1476, from which      a- 12.86 and b-l'9.
   From this we obtain, in the same manner as the first experi
ment,
                            D=0.3336 E.
   5. It results from the preceding eageriments that the electromo
tive force D in the luminous arc is independent of the intensity of
the current, and that the essential resistance of the luminous arc is
proportional to    its
                    length, and increases     as
                                             the intensity diminishes.

112             Prof. E. Edlund’s Investigation                       of the Electric Light.
   That D should be independent of the intensity, at first sight
seems unexpected; closer consideration      shows, however, that
this entirely agrees with other properties of the voltaic current
which are connected with it. The work which the current exerts
in disintegrating the points of the poles is measured by the di
minution in the total heat developed by the current which re
sults from the electromotive force D caused by the disintegration.
If E is the electromotive force, and L the resistance for a certain
intensity when there is no luminous arc,                                            the intensity, and

When 0-6 inch of the rheostat was interposed in the circuit and
the carbon points pressed hard against each other, so that the
contact was complete, the deflection of the compass amounted to
60° 35'. When 135 units of the rheostat were interposed, the
deflection was 42° 55'. From this we can calculate that the total
resistance external to the rheostat, or M, amounted to 13.62
units of resistance.      Taking as unity the electromotive force
which for the resistance 1 produces a deflection of 45°on the tan
gent-compass, the electromotive force of the battery or E=25-22.
   When 0-6 inch of the rheostat was interposed in the circuit,
and the luminous arc was 4 divisions of the scale in length, the
tangent-compass remained at 48°5.            When 9 inches was there
fore interposed and the carbon        points  pressed to contact, the
same number of degrees was obtained.          The resistance in a lumi
nous  arc  of the  length  of four divisions was  thus =8-4.
   Retaining the same     intensity  of current, the following results
were obtained    for shorter  arcs:—
                                                                                  = 7.8

observed that the   points became  strongly oxidized, by which the
conduction in the arc was less and the intensity diminished, so
that it was difficult to obtain an accurate and trustworthy mea
sure for the resistance of the luminous arc.     Between two suc
cessive experiments the oxide had to be removed with a file.
   The following numbers were obtained before a thick coating
of oxide had time to form.

the galvanometer amounted to 62°6'; and when 13 units were
interposed, 37° 44'. From this are obtained M'-8:425, and
E= 1591. When 0-6 inch of the rheostat was in the circuit,
the following result was obtained:—
        Length of the arc = 2 divisions.    Resistance   =89;
and for the same intensity,
        Length of the arc = 1 division.   Resistance   = 8.1.
    From experiment VIII. we get D = 0.279 x E = 6:34, and
from Exp. IX. D=0.407 × E! =648. This series leads, there
fore, to the same result as Series 2, namely that D is indepen
dent of the electromotive force of the battery.

    8. The magnitude of the development of heat in the luminous
arc depends upon the intensity of the current and the resistance
of the arc, and is proportional to the latter. Now, since the
actual resistance is not greater than the preceding experiments
indicate, and it only amounts to a small fraction of that which
has hitherto been assumed, it might perhaps be doubted whether
this resistance is great enough to explain the formation of the
high temperature which takes place in the luminous arc. The
following experiments were undertaken with the view of investi
gating this.
    The platinum wire used in my previous experiments on gal
vanic expansion (1150 millims. in length and 0.542 in diameter)
                                            -
indicated a constant expansion of 138 divisions when a current
passed through it whose intensity was         Tg. 43° 21'. In the
first second after the cessation of the current the wire cooled
so   that it shortened by 12.94 divisions (almost exactly corre
sponding to 7° of temperature).      Since a current of the strength
in question was sufficient to keep the wire at a constant length,
this current must have produced an increase in temperature in
the wire of 7 degrees in each second, which corresponds to a de
velopment of 1:27 thermal unit, if the gramme is taken as unit
of weight. The resistance of this wire was now measured with the
rheostat used in ExperimentsWIII. and IX.; and it was found that
it amounted to 0-35 unit of resistance—something less, therefore,
than that of a luminous arc of the length of one division of
the scale (0.4 millim.) in Experiment VIII. In this experiment,
in which the intensity was considerably greater than in the experi
ment on galvanic expansion, more than 1:27 thermal unit was
developed in each division of the luminous arc in one second.
This quantity of heat (1.27 unit) is sufficient to raise the tempe

rature in a piece of platinum wire of the length of 0.4 millim. to
more than 2000 degrees, if this could happen without the wire
melting or being changed into gas.      It is thus evident that the
resistance which,  from what  precedes,  is actually present in the
luminous arc is sufficient to explain the production of the high
temperature which is observed there.

   9. When carbon points were used in the formation of the                                         lu
minous arc, the intensity was not constant during a long time,
but changed after short intervals. This was due to the circum
stance that the luminous arc was not steady, but passed from
one point to another on the carbon points; and this displacement
was often accompanied by a crackling sound.            The magnetic
needle hence began to move, by which the reading         was rendered         off
more difficult.    Hence       not unfrequently happened that for
                                   it                                                              a
single observation     pretty long time was needed, because the
                             a
reading-off had         to   be
                        delayed until the needle was       rest.  The             at
experiment was made with several kinds           carbon; yet      pre
                                                                 of                          all
sented this inconvenience, which only entirely disappeared when
a  couple    ofthick copper wires were used instead           charcoal                 of
points. The intensity was now constant, and only diminished
as  the distance between the wires was increased.         The subse
quent determinations furnish the result        the experimentsof made
with the copper wires.

From this are obtained M'-7-08, and E' <U+2192> 14:43.
  When l'4 inch of the rheostat formed the resistance, and the
luminous arc was six divisions long, the magnetic needle indicated
44° 30'. With this intensity the following results were ob
tained:—
        Length of the arc       = 6 divisions.            Resistance   = 6-2
              22    2,             4.     92                  95       = 5:9

From this we obtain a = 5:3 and b =0:15.
  The electromotive force calculated from this is found to be
                                 53E       s.
                         D
                               = 11.65   – 9 21.
As 4:45 and 5:21 are equal within the limits of possible errors
of observation, we find from this series also that D is indepen
dent of the electromotive       force of the element.
  10.    Itfollows from the above that D is smaller if copper is
used for the pole-points than when they are formed of solid
and hard carbon.        This may arise from the circumstance
that the copper before being detached is in a fused or half-fused
condition, owing to which the work which the current performs
in the disintegration is less. Experiments were also made with
carbon of very porous structure; but, as no constant results
could be obtained with them, I do not think them worth com
municating.     Yet they showed that with the less-dense kinds of
carbon D was smaller. The experiments made with tin gave
also a smaller value for D; but the results obtained with this
metal were less certain, because the quantity of oxide of tin
formed disturbed the steadiness of the light and caused irregu
larities in the intensity.
   Since the two points have different temperatures, it was pos
sible that a thermo-electric force might be at work in the lumi
mous arc.     Probably also the aqueous vapour in the air was de
composed by the voltaic current; and if the products of decom
position (hydrogen and oxygen) were deposited on the poles, this
would give rise to a polarization current opposite in direction to
the principal current. But even if both these sources of electricity
are present in the luminous arc, they can only form an insig
nificant fraction of the above-found electromotive force D, even
supposing the polarization to have reached                  its
                                                    maximum inten
sity. To get rid   of    all
                           polarization, the experiments would have
had to   be made either    in  vacuum
                               a                or

of f, a partial differential equation of the first order involving
two independent variables; and substituting this in the equation

we shall have the first integral of (1).

tains q; but the results above derived from those equations fail
if f'(p) =0,    since in that case the foregoing elimination    of A and
B   from the equations (5) becomes illusory.

XIV.     Observations on the Humming Sound produced on Mountains

     N    the 22nd of June, 1865, leaving Saint Moritz (Grisons),
         I  made the ascent of the Piz Surley, a mountain com
posed of crystalline rocks, of which the somewhat conical summit
attains the height of about 3200 metres.         During the preceding
days the wind had blown steadily from the north, but on the
22nd it became variable, and the sky charged with scattered
clouds. Towards midday these clouds increased in number and
collected together over the highest peaks, elsewhere remaining
so high that they did not hide the greater number of the spires
and summits of the Engadine, on which soon fell some local
showers. Their appearance, that of dust-like vapours, semi-trans
parent, made us think that they were but showers of snow or frozen
sleet (grésil).    Indeed, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, we were
ourselves overtaken by a fine hail thinly scattered, at the same time
that similar showers enveloped the greater part of the spires of
such rocks as the Piz Ot, Piz Languard, &c., and the snowy tops
of the Bernina, and that a heavy fall of rain poured down on the
valley of Saint Moritz. The cold increased; and at half-past 1,
when we had reached the summit of the Piz Surley, the sleet
becoming more abundant, we disposed ourselves to take our
repast, and laid our alpenstocks against a little cairn of dry
stones which crowns the summit of the mountain.               Almost at
the same instant I felt at my back, in the left shoulder, a very
acute pain like that produced by a pin lightly pressed into the
flesh; and when         I
                       put my hand there, without finding anything,
a similar    pain was felt in the right shoulder.        Supposing my
cloth overcoat to contain pins,     Ithrew it off, but, far from finding
myself relieved, I found that the pains increased, extending from
one shoulder to the other across the whole back.              They were
accompanied by pricking sensations and sharp shooting pains,
 such as a wasp crawling over my skin and covering me with
stings might produce. Taking             off
                                         my second coat,       found no

thing which could wound the flesh.          The pain, which was con
tinuous, took then the character            burn. Without thinking

more about        it,
                   I fancied, without being able         explain
                                                           to         it,

my flannel waistcoat had taken fire, and was about              throw off
                                                                 to
the rest     ofmy clothes, when my attention was arrested                   by   a
sound recalling the reverberations           diapason.

     I understood   at once that my sensations were from a strong
flow of  electricity  taking place from the summit of the mountain.
Some improvised experiments produced no spark from our sticks,
nor light perceptible by day; they vibrated strongly in the hand,
and gave out a very pronounced sound; whether held vertically,
the point upwards or downwards, or, on the other hand, ho
rizontally, the vibrations remained identical, but no sound escaped
from the soil. The sky had become grey over                    whole extent,            its
though unequally charged with clouds.                 Some minutes after
wards  I  felt my hair and beard stand out, causing me              feel sen                   to        a
sation like that   resulting    from     razor passed

A  young Frenchman who was with me cried out that                      felt the                     he
hair   ofhis moustache growing, and that strong currents were
flowing from the tips                  of
                                his ears.     Raising my hand,        felt cur                 I

currents      electricity flowed from our staves, clothes, from our

                                       to

the rainy season, and it was almost imprudent to attempt the
expedition at that time. We reached the summit without the
sky appearing threatening, although we saw some cumuli float
ing about, and fogs for a moment skimmed close over the spires
which crown the mountain. We seated ourselves at the edge of
the crater to recover our strength and enjoy the grand view
which was spread below us.                From the top of the slope we
looked down into that vast amphitheatre whose hearth, long cold,
is now filled by two little lakes, towards which we made ready to
descend.      A cold and disagreeable wind blew up from the gulf;
and while we took our scanty meal we saw a thick cloud pene

126           M. H.         de Saussure            on the Humming            Sound
tain was something disquieting. This phenomenon lasted some
five or six minutes; soon the rain and the thunder recommenced
anew.     When we had reached the upper limits of the forests
the storm became more endurable, though there fell one of
those diluvial rains characteristic of the hot season within the
tropics.    M. F. Craveri, an Italian physician established at
Mexico, who had made the ascent of the Nevado de Toluca before
me at the commencement of the rainy season, told me that he had
been witness of the same facts, which he remembered with terror.
The electrical phenomena were yet more violent. On the 19th
of May, 1845, that traveller ascended the Nevado de Toluca by
the south-east side, starting from Tenango, and descended b
the north-west slope on Toluca. The south-west side of the
mountain was free from snow at that season.
   The electrical phenomenon was brought on suddenly by a
cloud coming from the west, and which perhaps had been gene
rated on the snow-fields of that slope.        Scarcely were the tra
vellers enveloped in it ere they felt the sensation electricity
produces ; and this was almost immediately followed by a dull
sound.     They felt at          all
                             their extremities,     the fingers, nose,
                                                                    at
and  ears,  confused electrical currents.     The fear which seized
them, then       the midst
                  in           those lofty
                                        of solitudes,  made them im
mediately commence the descent with hasty steps. The thun
der did not yet growl; but      the end      five minutes there fell
                                              at              of
snow like rice, and, the cloud communicating              electricity         its             to a
the soil, there arose from    the same sound that
                                         it                have before       I
described.    This sound was very  loud,  and appeared general over
the mountain. The long hair                         of
                                      the Indians became stiff and

expected pleasure from this expedition.        The     singular sound    so

knowledge:–
  In 1767 H. B. de Saussure visited the summit                                of    the Brévent

                   produced on Mountains by Electricity.                                         127
in company with Pictet and Jalabert*. The travellers were then
electrified to such           an extent that, on stretching out their hands,
they felt pricking  sensations at the end of their fingers; the
electricity escapedthence with a certain vibration; soon sparks
could be got from  the button of some gold lace which was round
the hat of one of the party, as well as from the iron point of a
mountain-staff.   These effects were attributed to a great storm
cloud which occupied the middle region of Mont Blanc, and
stretched itself, little by little, above the Brévent. At 80 feet
below the top of the mountain the electricity was no longer felt.
The storm growled around Mont Blanc, but on the Brévent
there fell but one slight rain-shower of short duration, and the
storm dispersed.
   It is easy, by this account, to see that the storm did not
reign over the Brévent at the moment of observation, since there
fell no rain; but the electricity discharged itself in a continuous
current from the summit of the mountain.
   In July 1863, Mr. Spence Watson, visiting the Jungfrau with
some guides, was overtaken by a hurricane accompanied by hail
and snow. The staves began to sing; the travellers felt sensa
                                                                                            all

      128         On the Humming produced on Mountains by Electricity.
          We will not here speak of the storm during which Colonel
     Buchwalder and his aide were struck dead on the Sentis, be
     cause then a phenomenon was involved belonging rather to the
     nature of a discharge of lightning.       But the lighting up of
     the rocks  by   night is probably  due to a flow off of electricity
     from the highest points.       M. Fournet cites on this point
     the beautiful illumination of the rocks of the Grands Mulets
     (Mont Blanc) observed by Mr. Blackwall on the night of the
     11th of August, 1854, and which was accompanied by sparks.
     And, besides, the phenomenon of electricity seen on the lakes and
     very dry plains of elevated plateaus appears to us of the same
     nature.   Finally, the curious fact of moving electricity coursing
     over the prairies observed by M. Quiquerez near Courtamon may
     be likened to a kind of lightning, a discharge in miniature, re
     sulting from the electrified cloud brushing over the earth and
     discharging itself over      whole surface    itsthousand sparks      by   a
     which were seen                     to
                          course over the meadows.          possible                    It      is
     that these phenomena   ought       divided into several catego

   On the Piz Surley and the Nevado de Toluca there fell frozen
sleet, or snow like rice; and on the Jungfrau the snowfell hissinglike
hail, which would seem to point to sleet rather than snow having
fallen.    No doubt we ought to take into consideration the higher
temperature of the valley, where hail about to fall turns to rain;
but we think that the cases we have just pointed out, of rain in the
valleys and frozen sleet on the isolated mountain, show that the
condensation is not one taking place over the whole sky accord
ing to the same law. Thus, in particular, during the observa
tion of the 22nd of June, 1865, I saw on the horizon                the                             all
needles, though far distant from each other, enveloped            dirty                           in
sleet, which lasted for      very long time, whilst

the tops      the rocks was very different from that occurring

the valleys.    Around the pyramids there were columns           frozen                          of
sleet, fine and very thinly scattered;     the  valley, rain heavy

           of
also more persistent than       the rest    the sky.

      propose in this paper to apply this theory to the explana

chemical relation between the density of a gas and         equiva                                     its

ciples of Le Sage to gases and to light. A more extensive ap
plication of the theory of moving molecules was made by Hera
pathik. His theory of the collisions of perfectly hard bodies,
such as he supposes the molecules to be, is faulty, inasmuch as
it makes the result of impact depend on the absolute motion of
the bodies, so that by experiments on such hard bodies           we                                   (if
could   get them)     might         we

impact     their molecules, and has calculated the velocity which

      Mr.       J.       C. Maxwell on              the   Dynamical Theory                       of Gases.               133
of gravity of themolecules, and whose magnitude is represented
very nearly by some function of the distance of the centres of
gravity.             I
            have made this modification of the theory in conse
quence of the results of my experiments on the viscosity of air
at different temperatures, and I have deduced from these expe
riments that the repulsion is inversely as the fifth power of the
distance.
    If we suppose an imaginary plane drawn through a vessel
containing a great number of such molecules in motion, then a
great many molecules will cross the plane in either direction.
The excess of the mass of those which traverse the plane in the
positive direction over that of those which traverse it in the
negative direction, gives a measure of the flow of gas through
the plane in the positive direction.
     Ifthe plane be made to move with such a velocity that there
is no excess of flow of molecules in one direction through                                                                it,
then the velocity           the plane
                                    of      the mean velocity is          the gas                           of
resolved normal          the  plane.

   There will still       molecules moving
                                 be                 both directions through
                                                                         in

   The quantity                 of
                         momentum thus communicated                  the gas                                              on
the other side         the plane during

and by myself in steel wires.
   In the case of a collection of moving molecules such as we
suppose a gas to be, there is also a resistance to change of form
constituting what may be called the linear elasticity, or “rigi
dity" of the gas, but this resistance gives way and diminishes
at a rate depending on the amount of the force and on the
nature of the gas.
   Suppose the molecules to be confined in a rectangular vessel
with perfectly elastic sides, and that they have no action on
one another, so that they never strike one another, or cause each
other to deviate from their rectilinear paths. Then it can easily
be shown that the pressures on the sides of the vessel due to the
impacts of the molecules are perfectly independent of each other,
so that the mass of moving molecules will behave, not like a
fluid, but like an elastic solid.   Now suppose the pressures at
first equal in the three directions perpendicular to the sides,
and let the dimensions a, b, c of the vessel be altered by small
quantities, 8a, 3b, &c.
   Then if the original pressure in the direction of a was p, it

    When, after their mutual action and deflection, the molecules
have again reached a distance such that there is no sensible action
between them, each will be moving with the same velocity rela
tive to the centre of gravity that it had before the mutual action,
but the direction of this relative velocity will be turned through
an angle 26 in the plane of the orbit.
   The angle 6 is a function of the relative velocity of the mole
cules and of b, the form of the function depending
                                             -        on the nature
of the action          between the molecules.
    If
     we suppose the molecules to be bodies, or systems of bodies,
capable of rotation, internal vibration, or any form of energy
other than simple motion of translation, these results will be
modified. The value of 6 and the final velocities of the mole
cules will depend on the amount of internal energy in each
molecule before the encounter, and on the particular form of
that energy at every instant during the mutual action. We
have no means of determining such intricate actions in the pre
sent state of our knowledge of molecules; so that we must con
tent ourselves with the assumption that the value of 6                                               is,     on   an
average, the same      for pure centres

 which determines the plane in which V and b lie.      From V and
b we can determine   6, if we know the law of   force; so that the
 problem is solved in the case of two molecules.
   When we pass from this case to that of two systems of moving
molecules, we shall suppose that the time during which a mole
cule is beyond the action of other molecules is so great compared
with the time during which it is deflected by that action, that
we may neglect both the time and the distance described by the
molecules during the encounter, as compared with the time and
the distance described while the molecules are free from disturb
ing force. We may also neglect those cases in which three or
more molecules                 are within each other's spheres                              of action at the
same instant.

THEexperiments       has led me to adopt as the best for preparing
 silver looking-glasses.
    Solution of Silver.—One part of fused nitrate of silver is dis

chlorine is neutralized with sesquicarbonate of ammonia and the
solution diluted to the specific gravity 1-115. For 37 parts of
nitric acid of 1:29, 14 parts of sesquicarbonate are wanted; yet,
as the sesquicarbonate does not always contain the same amount
of ammonia, the proportion is not quite definite.
   Nitrate of ammonia may be advantageously                                               replaced by            sul

    In silvering,    the plates are placed    in pairs vertically in the
trough, the silvering-solution A is mixed with water in a sepa.
rate vessel, the reducing-liquid mixed, and the trough filled; in
winter it is convenient to use warm water, so that the tempera
ture may be from 20° to 28°.
    Glasses for optical purposes must be silvered in a horizontal
position, so as to touch the surface of the liquid; the silver
surface must be transparent with a blue colour; it must be bril
liant, and must adhere so firmly that it is not rubbed off when
polished.
    This mode of silvering is calculated for the manufacture of
mirrors the cost of preparing which shall not exceed that of
the commonest sorts.         Special determinations show that with
these mixtures      perfect  mirrors can be prepared with a quan
tity of silver not exceeding 3 to 3% grammes in a square metre.
    Without the addition of copper this cannot be effected; am      I
not in a position to give an explanation of this. The action of
copper is at once recognized, if a very dilute solution free from
copper be mixed with solution of sugar and allowed to stand;
the deposit of silver is then full of white spots and of holes; if
a trace of copper be present, the deposit is lustrous and free
from faults; and with more copper no silver is deposited.              In
this case there are actions of adhesion at work quite out of the
range of theoretical considerations.        The point is to give the
particles of the liquid less adhesion to the silver than is possessed
by the particles of the glass whose surface is moistened by the
liquid; when the adhesion of the particles is greater, the glass
is not coated.
     The silvering in a large looking-glass manufactory near
Nuremberg has been effected by the above process for more
than a year, and produced very beautiful articles, which, how
 ever, met with no sale. It is to be expected that in the course of
 time the prejudices against silver looking-glasses will disappear.

consisted of four small crucian carp with a gold carp.         Several
freshwater mollusks, principally Planorbis corneus and Limneus
palustris, were also introduced to act as scavengers and consume
the decaying vegetation. The tank was loosely covered with a plate
of glass, so as to allow of a free admission of the external air, and
at the same time keep out a great deal of the soot and dust of the
London atmosphere and impede the too rapid evaporation of the
water. As the Trichomanes were stated to delight in shade, a thin
muslin blind was placed over the covering glass.
   The aquarium was located in a window-way having an eastern
aspect, but, being surrounded within a few yards by the high walls
of adjoining houses, the direct rays of the sun only reached it for
about three hours in the morning during the months of June and
July. It was established in January 1851, and has not since been
disturbed, except by occasional supplies of distilled or rain-water,
to replace the loss in volume arising from evaporation.        It had
been my custom to weed out the excessive growth of the Wallisneria
during the summer, and also to remove some of the flaky deposit of
calcareous matter from the surface of the glass nearest the light;

but as considered that such disturbances might interfere with the
course of the investigation, these operations were discontinued.

sidered that the Cotham section afforded very decided evidence of
the Bridgend series being above the Rhaetic beds, and in the Pla
morbis-zone.    He also described a horizontal section of the deposits
between Ashley Down and Cotham, and remarked on the physical
conditions which had combined to produce the phenomena observed
in the district.
  2. “On the Lower Lias beds occurring at Cotham, Bedminster,
and Keynsham, near Bristol.” By C. O. Groom-Napier, Esq.,
F.G.S.
        The author described in detail sections exposed in two quarries
at Cotham, and noticed others seen at Bedminster and Keynsham,
He had made an extensive collection of fossils from the several beds,
and he now exhibited a table showing the names and ranges of the
several species.  The conclusions at which he had arrived were :—
that the Sutton-stone is a Liassic rather than a Rhaetic bed, and
belongs to the Planorbis-zone; and that the Planorbis-zone and the
Sutton series are subdivisions of the White Lias. Mr. Groom
Napier also described two new species from the Planorbis-zone of
Cotham (namely, Avicula Sandersi and Anatina Cothamiensis), and
one (Hinnites minutus) found in a stratum at Cotham associated
with Monotis decussata.
   3. “On the Dentition of Rhinoceros Etruscus,” Falc.     By W.
Boyd Dawkins, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
  The number of teeth possessed by R. Etruscus is the same as
that of the three species already described by the author.
  The first premolar, if present at all, disappeared very early in
life, leaving no trace of     its  existence. This character separates        it
from all other known Miocene species.               Of the milk-molars the
author has not yet sufficient material          attempt

 ON AN IMPROVED                     METHOD OF DIVIDING ALCOHOL AND OTHER

   In the manufacture of thermometers for low temperatures, con
siderable difficulties are experienced owing to equal increments of
temperature not causing an equal increase of volume of the fluid
employed; and this unequal expansion gives rise to considerable
errors even within limited ranges of temperature.

  To do this, take any right-angled triangle, A B C, and divide the
sideA C into ten equal parts by straight lines drawn from B.
                                                                   B

   Then,     a straight line, as A'C', be drawn parallel to AC, it
             if
will be divided into ten equal parts; but if it be drawn not paral
lel to AC, it will be divided into ten unequal parts.
   To apply this to the thermometer to be divided, draw a trans
versal  LMN cutting A C produced in L, at an angle q, so that

   On doing this, it becomes evident that such a line, so placed,
will be divided into ten unequal parts, proportionate to the law
governing the series, and we can in the same manner, by using
the same formula, divide any number of spaces with equal
accuracy.
   It  remains, therefore, mechanically to transfer such divisions
to our thermometer, previously marked off at equal intervals
of temperature, in order to secure its correctness to even second
differences.
   This mechanical            copying can be done by the dividing-engine
before referred to; and it is worthy of note, that the formula and
engine equally apply to the more correct dividing of mercurial
thermometers having unequal or varying diameters of bore, as also
                  ...
to the construction of hydrometers of absolute accuracy.
   I can easily understand that whilst the mathematician may ap
preciate the         thus introduced, and also its successful applica
tion, those accustomed to the construction of thermometers would
hesitate to adopt       it,
                     from the fact that the plan involves   series      a        of
calculations for each thermometer, which would involve consi

series  oftables;       this was attended with only partial success,
My attention was then directed           the mechanical solution
                                               to                                of

 piece of apparatus, which may be called a computer, consisting of
 a sliding-rule, index-arm, and scale.   Suppose we wish to divide
 accurately the space a, formerly given; we set the distance from
 P to Q on the slide, to that of Q to R on the fixed scale, and the
 index-arm at once points to the angle on the scale which M N must
 make with A C on our divided triangle.
    In use, this computer is found both trustworthy and simple,
        º
 and facilitates what would otherwise have been tedious to perform
 and liable to inaccuracies when done.
     Having devised a method of dividing a thermometer-tube accu
  rately,     I
             next turned my attention to the most suitable strength
  of alcohol to be employed in filling these thermometers; and as
 but little can be gained by referring to our scientific writers on
 this subject,          I
                   undertook a series of experiments to satisfy myself
 on this   point.
     Now it is well known that the expansion of alcohol by heat is
 not                    to      change      its
                                            temperature; and we are con

cation upon the most sensitive membranes* which       have used.                      I
I have thus found that:—
  (1)    In  gas-pipe at Ivry, having the internal diameter of 0.108
              a
metre,   the explosion is heard at the other end at a distance of
566.7 metres, but the sound is very faint.          If the further ex
tremity be hermetically closed with a piece of sheet iron, and if
the ear be placed at the end where the pistol was discharged, it
requires the utmost attention to catch the sound of the return
wave.     So that in a straight cylindrical tube of 0-108 metre in
ternal diameter a length of 1150 metres is sufficient to extin
guish entirely the sound produced by the discharge of a pistol
containing one gramme of powder.
    (2) In a gas-pipe in the Rue militaire, 0.30 metre in diameter,
the discharge of the pistol is heard very clearly at the other end
at a distance of 1905 metres.     If this end be closed by a sheet of
iron and the ear be applied to the end where the discharge takes
place, the reflected wave is indeed heard, but with extreme diffi
culty. In this case the wave has traversed in the pipe a distance
of 3810 metres.
   (3) In the great pipe of the St. Michel sewert, of 1:10 metre
diameter, the wave produced by the discharge of the pistol gives
an intense sound when it reaches the other end B after having
travelled 1590 metres.      After one reflexion at Bit returns to the
point A, whence it started.     Its entire path has then been 3180
metres. Its sound is found to be weakened, but it still has suffi
cient intensity to be heard outside without there being occasion
to remove the membranet which closes the opening A. After a

                     If                            would follow that the       it
velocity       of   a   wave      ina   gas     is   the same whatever                      be    the pressure             to

which the gas is submitted.       The only direct experiments which
can be here cited in confirmation of this law were made in the
open air.    They are those of H.H. Stampfer and Myrbach in
1822 in    Tyrol,  between two stations having a difference of level
of 1364    metres,   and those of MM. Bravais and Martens, per
formed in Switzerland in 1844, at two stations whose difference
of level was 2079 metres. Unfortunately the mean barometric
pressures which the air suffers at the two places does not differ
sufficiently from the pressure at the level of the sea.
   I have, in my Memoir, given two series of experiments to de
termine the velocity of propagation of sound in the air when
under various pressures, and contained in tubes of 0-108 metre
diameter.
   The first experiment was made with the gas-pipe of the route
militaire near Ivry, having the length of 567.4 metres.               The
pressures varied from 0.557 to 0-838, and the consequent densi
ties of the air from 1-0 to 1-5.
   The second experiment was made in a little horizontal tube in
the court of the Collége de France, the length of the tube being
only 70.5 metres.       The pressures varied from 0.247 to 1-267;
consequently the density of the air varied from 1 to almost 5.
   It was not possible to establish any sensible difference in the
rate of propagation of sound in air under these very different
pressures.    My experiments accordingly confirm the exactness
                     I
of the law which have just enunciated.
   VII. If we compare W and Wi (the velocities of the same wave in
two different gases having the same temperature and being under
the same pressure), and if further we assume that they obey
Mariotte's law, that they have the same coefficient of dilatation,
that they satisfy Poisson’s law, &c., in short that they are per
fect gaseous media, we ought, according to theory, to have*
                               WV =T  VV/i<U+017F>
So that, if one of the gases is atmospheric air, and if 8 represents
the density of the other gas compared with air, we have
                               V-V.
                               V- V        3.
   Hitherto no direct experiment has been made to determine
the rate of propagation of a wave in any other gas than atmo
spheric air. Attempts have only been made to prove the exact.
ness of the above law in an indirect way, founded on the theory
of somorous tubes.

  In my Memoir I give two      series of direct experiments upon
those gases                 I
            which have been able to prepare in sufficientouantity.
   The first series was made upon the tubes of 0.108 metre dia
meter in the route d'Ivry, the available length of which is 567-4
metres.                          I
           This tube was able to fill successively with hydrogen,
carbonic acid, and coal-gas.
   For the second series,                     I
                           made use of the little tube in the Col
lége de France, which has the same section but a length of only
70.5 metres.            I

   On comparing the Tyddynglwadis mineral, however, with a
specimen of the aphthonite from Wermland, the external charac
ters differed so considerably as to lead to the inference that it
was not this mineral, but some other variety of polytelite.
   Unfortunately it was found quite impossible to obtain the
mineral sufficiently free from the associated galena to enable
confidence to be placed either in the determination of        specific                                   its
gravity      exact chemical composition.

being      true polytelite was satisfactorily proved

rarely,     ever, altogether absent from any tetrahedrite), but does not

                                  British Mineralogy.                                                      173
silver, galena, chalcopyrite, blende, iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites,
and quartz.     It may be stated here that the crystallized galena
in immediate proximity to the rich polytelite contained upon
assay only 0.08 per cent. of silver.
   The geological position of this mineral lode is close to the
junction of the Cambrian rocks with the Lingula-beds of the
 Lower Silurian formation. The main lode runs nearly N.W. and
 S.E., dipping to N.E., and cuts through the Menevian group
 with its associated diabases: the Paradoxides Davidis is found
in abundance in the slates within a few yards of the outcrop of
the lode.
    Before concluding this notice of the occurrence of polytelite in
Wales, it may not be out of place to add here a few lines on the
importance of such an inquiry when considered from a practical
or economical point of view.
    Upon reading the report of the proceedings of a meeting of
the Tyddynglwadis Mining Company in 1864, a statement will
be found, in the agent’s report of “surface” operations                     15),                     (p.
to   the following effect:-" Our slime-pits are very deficient.
would strongly recommend your attention here, because some                                                  of I

                            is                         the precious metals.”
                                                                  in
The     perusal   of this   paragraph        once  gave
                                                     at  rise    the suspicion       to
that the bad results obtained from the               dressing-machinery      and
operations employed              by
                                 the Company

of   this mine might         in part       leastat    due      the silver being to
 mainly present        in the ore          in
                                       the state      polytelite  (specific gra
 vity about 4:8), and not,               previously supposed, contained
                                            as                                                               in
 the galena (specific gravity 7-7).            This suspicion, corroborated
 by   the small    percentage          of
                                      silver  found,     before stated,   as the                      in
 pure galena crystals when assayed, was still further confirmed                                              by
 the result  of   the following experiment.
  A      portion  of  the ore, mainly consisting            galena with quartz
                                                                           of
 and  a   talcose  mineral,   along   with some minute specks           iron py             of
 rites, polytelite, blende, and chalcopyrite, was pulverized, and                                            by
 the use  ofa    sieve brought             very uniform powder, which was
                                           to    a
 then    carefully   washed        in small batea until
                                       a                       was divided into it
 two portions     of   different specific gravity.
     The most metallic-looking and heavier                  these two products
                                                                           of
 appeared    on   inspection          to
                                    consist   mainly                      of
                                                          clean galena, whilst
 the   lighter or   more     earthy   portion    would contain        the other           all
 substances present          in
                       the ore.
   This latter was now submitted            similar washing, using
                                                           to

                              than     the former case, and
                                                          in   this                                   by
 means was     in   its
                  turn subdivided into two products. The smaller
 or heavier and more metallic portion, when examined with    mag                                     a

174                      Mr. D. Forbes's         Researches in
 nifier, consisted of polytelite, along with some little galena and
 considerable amount of iron pyrites, blende and copper pyrites,
 and a little quartz sand; whilst the lighter or earthy portion con
 sisted chiefly of quartz and rock débris, along with some few
 specks of polytelite, copper and iron pyrites, and blende.
    The assay of these three ultimate products of this experimental
washing now showed the distribution of the silver as follows:—
     (1) The heavier or argentiferous galena, which corresponded
to the dressed ore obtained on the large scale in the Company’s
operations contained 60 ounces of silver per ton, along with
about 80 per cent. of lead.      On the large scale it is stated, in the
before-mentioned    report,  that the results varied from 55 to 78
per cent. of lead, along with from 45 to 53 ounces of silver per
ton washed ore.
    (2) The less dense metallic part, which evidently contained
most of the polytelite, and the greater part of which would, in
the ordinary process of washing on the large scale as adopted at
Tyddynglwadis, have been carried away and lost, was far richer
than the preceding, and contained 182 ounces of silver to the ton,
with a little lead and more copper and zinc.
    (3) The third product consisted of the lighter non-metallic
particles, chiefly quartz and rock débris, along with traces of the
lighter metallic compounds, and only contained a mere trace of
silver.

    Locality:  nickel mine in the woods above Inverary Castle,
Argyleshire;   the mineral occurring in a lode running nearly east
and west with a dip of about 42° to the north, which traverses
the metamorphic slates and schists.
   The characters of this mineral were as follows:—massive;

    Considering the nickel to be present in this mineral in the
 state of protosulphide (which is probable, both as that compound
is known in the mineral kingdom in the pure state as Millerite,
 and also as, in the Gap mine, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania,
 Millerite is occasionally found in the nickeliferous pyrrhotine
which forms the object of the exploration), the exact state of
sulphuration of the iron is still somewhat uncertain; for whilst
some mineralogists have regarded this mineral as being merely
a protosulphide of iron in which the iron is in part replaced by
the nickel, the larger amount of sulphur shown in this and many
other analyses, as well as the strongly magnetic properties of the
mineral, appear to indicate the probability of the iron being
really present as pyrrhotine or magnetic sulphide of iron (Fe7 Sº).
Taking both these views into consideration, the following per
centage composition would approximate to the numbers found
experimentally:—

pyrrhotine with more or less Eisennickelkies; but as this latter

not  crystallized, appeared to the eye (and when magnified also)
to be perfectly homogeneous, and did not in any way convey the

    The rock-matter (14.63 per cent. in all) contained a consider
 able amount of quartz, along with no less than 52 per cent. mag
 nesia in combination, but only a trace of lime.
   Iron Pyrites.—In the sulphide of iron and nickel obtained
from this mine it is very usual to perceive that the bronze colour
of the mineral is blotched or studded over with brass-yellow spots
more or less round, and varying in diameter from one-sixteenth
up to even occasionally half an inch across; the colour and hard
ness of these parts confirmed the supposition that these spots
were iron pyrites. It was, however, only when, after the lapse of
some years, the pyrrhotine had become quite broken up and dis
aggregated, that it was easy to obtain these portions of the spe
cimens for analysis.
    When the pyrrhotine fell to powder by the action of the atmo
sphere these particles were quite unaffected, and were seen to be
so many irregular spheres of cupriferous iron pyrites which ex
ternally retained still a sort of skin or crust of pyrrhotine, but, on
breaking, at once showed that the mass possessed the bright
brass-yellow colour characteristic of pyrites.
   Upon making a determination of the specific gravity, it agreed
with that of pyrites; for, several of these globules being taken,
pulverized, and the magnetic external crust of pyrrhotine removed
by a magnet, the mineral was found to possess the specific gra
vity 4.93 at 60° F.
   The analysis was conducted in a similar manner to that of the
last mineral, excepting only that the copper was precipitated by
sulphuretted hydrogen; and the nickel and cobalt present were
separated from one another by treating the mixed oxides obtained
in the course of the analysis by Plattner's process before the
                            -

     A   comparison   of the results of this analysis of the globules of
 iron pyrites with those of the nickeliferous pyrrhotine in which
 they occur imbedded is very interesting. They contain nearly
the whole of the cobalt and copper present in the ore, along with
a little of the nickel, and would appear to have segregated out
of the general mass, carrying with them the copper and cobalt.
In the case of the Craigmuir nickeliferous pyrrhotine, where
these segregations do not occur, the cobalt is found still remain
ing with the nickel in the ore.
     A curious metallurgical incident may tend to throw some

180                 Mr. D. Forbes's Researches in
pyrites and magnetic pyrites taken from mineral lodes and erup
tive rocks, proved that nickel was very rarely found in iron
pyrites (FeS2) when not accompanied by pyrrhotine, but that
cobalt was very commonly present in small quantity,+and, on
the other hand, that cobalt was equally seldom in magnetic py
rites (Fe7 Sº) if unaccompanied by iron pyrites, also that when
both these metals were present in a specimen of pyrites, the
nickel greatly preponderated when the pyrites in question was
magnetic (pyrrhotine), whilst the reverse was found to be the
case when it was the bisulphide of iron or ordinary so-called iron
pyrites.
    Sulphide of Iron and Nickel from the Craigmuir mine on the
side of Loch Fyne, about eight miles below Inverary, the lode
traversing metamorphic strata,and disturbed by intersecting trap
pean dykes.—The specific gravity of the pure mineral was found to
be 4.602 at 60° F. The general characters of the mineral corre
sponded very closely with those of the specimen from Inverary,
the colour alone differing in having a somewhat more dark-bronze
tint, probably due to the entire absence of iron pyrites in the
specimen submitted to examination.            The blowpipe reactions
were   quite  identical with those of the   Inverary  mineral, and the
chemical analysis was conducted in precisely the same manner.
The results of the analysis of a specimen (as pure as possible)
taken out of the lode in April 1855 was as follows:—Mineral
employed 34:15 grs., which yielded 0.13 gr., or 0.38 per cent.
insoluble matter, consisting entirely of quartz with a few flakes
of silvery mica; 0.03 gr. free sulphur; 94.26 grs. sulphate of
barytes; 24.04 grs. sesquioxide of iron, from which 0:02 gr.
arsenic acid was subsequently separated by precipitation with
sulphuretted hydrogen in the state of sulphide. Another por
tion, 2003 grs. in weight, was employed for the determination
of the nickel and cobalt, and yielded 2.81 grs. of the mixed
oxides, in which the cobalt was determined by Plattner’s method.
These data make the chemical composition, when tabulated, ap
pear as  follows:—
                     Sulphur    .  .  .   .    37.99
                     Iron       -              50-87

                                             100-31
   The results correspond closely with those obtained when the

Inverary mineral was examined; and although several other
specimens of the purest mineral obtainable were assayed for
nickel, none of them yielded a higher percentage of that mineral
than the above.
                                 Gersdorffite.
   Locality: Craigmuir nickel mine on the side of Loch Fyne,
eight miles below Inverary, Argyleshire, where it was found by the
author in April 1855, occurring in a small string or crosscourse
intersecting the main lode of sulphide of iron and nickel. This
mineral does not appear to have been previously observed as a
British species, and is not noticed in Greg and Lettsom’s ‘Mine
ralogy of Great Britain.”      It is not improbable, however, that
the smaltine which, in page 302 of that work, is stated to occur
in “Argyleshire, at Essochossan Glen, two miles from Inverary,
dispersed in small bright patches in Eisennickelkies,” may in
reality prove to be this mineral.
   The specimen here described was broken out, in the deepest
part of the mine, from a small string of nearly pure Gersdorffite,
about from 1 to 2 inches wide.        It was a compact aggregate of
minute indistinct crystals along with quartz and a talcose mine
ral. In places patches and strings of copper pyrites were visible;
but little or no sulphide of iron and nickel occurred with          not              it,
withstanding that this last-mentioned mineral formed the mass
of the main lode, and the object        the explorations. The Gers

in   nitrohydrochloric acid, a quantity of iron added and dissolved
in the solution, which then was precipitated in the cold by car
bonate of barytes; after filtration the excess of baryta was re
moved from the solution by the addition of sulphuric acid. The
filtrate was then precipitated by colourless sulphide of ammonia,
and the manganese separated from the sulphides of nickel and
 cobalt by acetic acid, and, after precipitation from the acid solu
 tion by sulphide of ammonium, was determined as usual. After
 boiling the filtrate and separating some free sulphur by filtration,
 the magnesia was precipitated as ammoniacal magnesian phos
 phate and determined as pyrophosphate of magnesia.               The sul
 phides of nickel and cobalt were dissolved in nitrohydrochloric
  acid and precipitated as oxides by caustic potash; the amount of
  cobalt in the same was then determined by Plattner's method.
      II.  For the sake of confirming the results, a second analysis
  was made by a different method, namely:-A weighed portion
  was dissolved in nitrohydrochloric acid; a small amount of silica
  and free sulphur remained undissolved, which were determined,
  and afterwards the amount of free sulphur determined as ignition
  loss.    To the filtrate was added chloride of barium in order to
  throw down the sulphuric acid, which was then determined as
   sulphate of baryta.     The excess of baryta was now removed from
   the solution by adding sulphuric acid and filtering; the solution
   was treated with a current of sulphuretted hydrogen passed
   through it for several hours, during which it was kept on a warm
   sand-bath; it was then allowed to stand some eight hours, and,
   after again passing a current of hydrogen through                it,

 a   weighed amount          iron, was precipitated

   When the gas moves in mass, the velocities now determined
are compounded with the motion of translation of the gas.
   When the differential elements of the gas are changing their
figure, being compressed or extended along certain axes, the
values of the mean square of the velocity will be different in dif
ferent directions. It is probable that the form of the function

 which is the equation of equilibrium in ordinary hydrostatics.
    This equation, being true of the system of molecules forming
 the first medium independently of the presence of the molecules
 of the second system, shows that if several kinds of molecules
 are mixed together, placed in a vessel and acted on by gravity,
 the final distribution of the molecules of each kind will be the
 same as if none of the other kinds had been present.              This is
 the same mode of distribution       as that which Dalton considered
 to exist in a mixed atmosphere in cquilibrium, the law of dimi
 mution of density of each constituent gas being the same as if
 no other gases were present.

   The dimensions of D are evidently LPT-', where L and T are
the standards of length and time.
   In considering this experiment of the interdiffusion of car
bonic acid and air, we have assumed that air is a simple gas.
Now it is well known that the constituents of air can be sepa
rated by mechanical means, such as passing them through a
porous diaphragm, as in Mr. Graham's experiments on Atmo
lysis. The discussion of the interdiffusion of three or more
gases leads to a much more complicated equation than that
which we have found for two gases, and it is not easy to deduce
the coefficients of interdiffusion of the separate gases.  It is
therefore to be desired that experiments should be made on the
interdiffusion of every pair of the more important pure gases
which do not act chemically on each other, the temperature
and pressure of the mixture being noted at the time of expe
riment.
   Mr. Graham has also published in Brande's Journal for 1829,
pt. 2, p. 74, the results of experiments on the diffusion of va
rious gases out of a vessel through a tube into air. The co
efficients   of diffusion deduced from these experiments are—
                Air and hydrogen          .   .     .    .026216

   The value for carbonic acid is only one third of that de
duced from the experiment with the vertical column.      The
inequality of composition of the mixed gas in different parts
of the vessel, however, is neglected; and the diameter of the
tube at the middle part, where it was bent, was probably less
than that given.
   Those experiments on diffusion which lasted ten hours,                    all
                          than those which lasted four hours; and

this would also result from the mixture             of

being imperfect.
                    Interdiffusion through    a    small hole.
   When two vessels containing different gases are connected                 by
a small hole, the mixture        of
                             gases     each vessel will

uniform except near the hole; and the inequality        the pres   of

or the masses of the individual molecules are proportional to the
density of the gas.
   This result, by which the relative masses of the molecules can
be deduced from the relative densities of the gases, was first
arrived at by Gay-Lussac from chemical considerations.       It is
here shown to be a  necessary  result of the Dynamical Theory   of
Gases; and it is so, whatever theory we adopt as to the nature
of the action between the individual molecules, as may be seen
by equation (34), which is deduced from perfectly general as
sumptions as to the nature of the law of force.

    The whole increase of energy is therefore that due to the
action of the external forces minus the cooling due to the ex
pansion of the mixed gases.    If the diffusion takes place without
alteration of the volume of the mixture, the heat due to the
mutual action of the gases in diffusion will be exactly neutra
lized by the cooling of each gas as it expands in passing from
places where it is dense to places where it is rare.

       Mr. J. C.   Maxwell on the Dynamical Theory               of Gases.   211
 in which the    molecules move in straight lines without acting on
 each other at all, deserves notice from those who speculate on
 theories of physics.
     The fluidity of our medium is therefore due to the mutual
 action of the molecules, causing them to be deflected from their
 paths.
     The coefficient of instantaneous rigidity of a gas is
        therefore p.                                                        136
    The modulus of the time of relaxation is T.                        .   (136)
    The coefficient of viscosity is usepT.
    Now p varies    as the density and temperature conjointly, while
 T varies   inversely  as the density.
    Hence u varies as the absolute temperature, and is indepen
 dent of the density.
    This result is confirmed by the experiments of Mr. Graham on
the Transpiration of Gases *, and by my own experiments on the
Wiscosity or Internal Friction of Air and other Gasest.
    The result, that the viscosity is independent of the density,
follows from the Dynamical Theory of Gases, whatever be the
law of force between the molecules.                  It was deduced by myselff
from the hypothesis of hard elastic molecules, and M. O. E.
Meyer § has given a more complete investigation on the same
hypothesis.
    The experimental result, that the viscosity is proportional to
the absolute temperature, requires us to abandon this hypothesis,
which would make it vary as the square root of the absolute tem
perature, and to adopt the hypothesis of a repulsive force inversely
as the fifth power of the distance between the molecules, which
is the only law of force which gives the observed result.
    Using the foot, the grain, and the second as units, my experi
ments give, for the temperature of 62°Fahr., and in dry air,
                               p   = 0.0936.
    If  the pressure is 30 inches of mercury, we find, using the
same units,
                              p=477360000.
    SincepT=p, we find that the modulus of the time of relaxation
of rigidity in air of this pressure and temperature is
                                 l               of a second.

    This expression is reduced to p, when p,-0, and to p, when
p,5–0.    For other values of p, and p, we require to know the
value of  k, the coefficient of mutual interference of the molecules
of the two gases. This might be deduced from the observed
values of a for mixtures; but a better method is by making ex
periments on the interdiffusion of the two gases. The experi
ments of Graham on the transpiration of gases, combined with
my experiments on the viscosity of air, give as values of k, for
air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid:—

on the interdiffusion of                   air

    The numbers given are the ratios of the transpiration-times of
 mixtures to that of oxygen as determined by Mr. Graham, com
         with those given by the equation (140) deduced from our
 theory.
             Conduction     of Heat in a Single Medium                ().
    The rate of conduction depends on the value of the quantity
                               38p(#94-#1,”--É?),
 where #3, #m”, and Éº denote the mean values of those functions
 of É, m, & for all the molecules in a given element of volume.
    As the expressions for the variations of this quantity are some
 what complicated in a mixture of media, and as the experimental
investigation of the conduction of heat in gases is attended with
 great difficulty, I  shall confine myself here to the discussion of a
 single medium.

and neglecting terms of the forms                &m   and   #9  and Ém” when not
multiplied by the large coefficient            k,   we find    by equations (75),

The first term of this equation may be neglected, as the rate of
conduction will rapidly establish itself. The second term con
tains quantities of four dimensions in É, m, , whose values will
depend on the distribution of velocity among the molecules.                            If
the distribution of velocity is that which we have proved to exist

XXIII.     Addendum      to Contributions to the Mineralogy of Nova

            III.     On Borates in Gypsum and Anhydrite.
 MY         attention has been drawn by Principal Dawson to some
            particulars mentioned in the paper named above which
I   shall be glad to state; at the same time                    I
                                                       am enabled to give
  some   interesting    facts he has   kindly   communicated,    and take
  the opportunity of giving an analysis of gypsum bearing on one
  of them, and of adding a few remarks on other points.
                               I
     In the first place have inadvertently named Cape Canseau
  as a locality of plaster, I should have said the Gut of Canseau.
  The former is some thirty miles south of the latter; and, as
  stated by Dr. Dawson, a large part of the peninsula, terminating
  at Cape Canseau, is occupied by white fine-grained gneiss with
  veins and masses of granite; there is also much mica-slate and
  dark-coloured slate; it is in fact quite destitute of gypsum. The
  Gut of Canseau is the narrow strait between Nova Scotia proper
 and Cape Breton; and on the Cape-Breton side is situated Plas
 ter Cove, where the beds referred to are seen.             They are thus
 described in a    passage   of ‘Acadian   Geology,’ which am sorry to   I
 have overlooked at the time when it would have been of great
 service to me.        “About two-thirds of the thickness of the bed
 consist of crystalline anhydrite, and the remaining third of very
 fine-grained common gypsum.             The anhydrite prevails in the
 lower part of the bed, the common gypsum in the upper; but
 the greater part of the bed consists of an intimate mixture
 of both substances, the common gypsum forming a base in
 which minute crystals of anhydrite are scattered, and bands
 in which anhydrite prevails alternating with others in which
 common gypsum predominates.”               In a subsequent page (283)
 an  explanation     is given  of the mode in which the gypsum and
gypseous marl may have been formed from sea-water containing
sulphuric acid in varying quantities, and the fact stated that
anhydrite must have been deposited with the gypsum, and that
it seems difficult to account for              its
                                              production, unless      may     it
have been formed          byacid vapours and scattered over the bed                of
the sea.     Dr. Dawson does not think the existence                     of
                                                               salt proves
anything   as   to  the origin     the gypsum,

                                                     under any probable
hypothesis, the rock must have been formed                the sea, and,
                                                                    in             as
the marls and sandstones seem             indicate,

tected boracic acid in sea-water and in sea-weed ; but where,                I
cannot say, as  I have not access to his paper.
   To the minerals found in gypsum, Dr. Dawson says,   may add  “I
peroxide of iron and bituminous and carbonaceous matters.” As
                        I
regards the former, should certainly have stated that it no doubt
exists, and is the cause of the pink and red tints often observed,
especially in fibrous gypsum.     At one quarry, at Wentworth,
Hants    county,  there is found a deep-red crystalline gypsum.
With reference to the bituminous matters,                I
                                                  on one occasion
analyzed    a nearly black gypsum from near Walton, Hants
county, with the following results:—

   Interesting additional facts are given by Dr. Dawson, who
mentions that at Gay's River, Colchester county, a very sin
gular bed of gypsum exists containing pure quartz-sand, and
also that he has in his cabinet a specimen of gypsum from Cape
Breton enclosing a crystal of mispickel.
   With reference to the formation of gypsum from anhydrite,
Dr. Dawson has long suspected, from the unusually disturbed
condition of the beds near those of gypsum, that part of this
rock, at least, may have resulted from absorption of water by
anhydrite, or some similar process involving increase of bulk; but,
owing to the obscurities caused by denudation and the unequal
erosion of the gypsum, he has not been able to satisfy himself
fully on the subject. The whole question as to how the beds of
anhydrite could have been formed he thinks well worthy of study.

when     f,does not involve U_1.
   A reference to my former paper will show, it being observed
that the m there used is the reciprocal of that above employed,
that the above equation of condition is identical with that which
must be satisfied in order that the given equation may be capa
ble of being derived from a single partial differential equation
 of the first order.   Also

    The foregoing result depends upon the assumption that                f,
 and A do not contain U_2. Let us now assume, on the contrarv,
 that these functions contain U_2.
    If we had
                       f,-f(ryU_g),
 we should have
                      f,0)=f(x)+<U+017F>,(U-2U-3.

which last is impossible unless ma–mp a particular               case    of
which we may at present omit the consideration.
   But, if A involves U_g, assume

ceeded even when the aperture of the upper plate was 0.5 millim.
smaller or greater. Even when a suitably bent strip of lead was
placed on one side of the jet at a proper distance from the
aperture, notes were formed which changed with the distance of
the strip.
   When small apertures were used, the notes produced with the
smaller cylindrical apparatus A were more easily obtained, and
were richer and more varied as to height and quality; while
those produced with the apparatus B fitted on the cask were
feebler, but altered more uniformly with the pressure of water
and the distance of the plates.    More powerful jets also produced
more   powerful  tones in the  larger  apparatus.
   The size and     shape  of the  aperture   influences the character
of the tone produced; so that with another aperture, other

a decrease in the height of the tone with increasing distance of
the plate.   They do not, however, seem to justify the establish
ment of the law just laid down.
   The author's view as to the origin of the notes is the same as
that given in his former experiments on the sounds of the jet of
air.   He regards “the jet emerging from the aperture, as a
moving rod which by friction against the edges and angles is set
in longitudinal vibrations, just like wooden rods and horsehairs
when drawn through the fingers;” and only that part has to be
taken into account which lies between the two rubbed parts. That
the jet acts as a special substance differing from the surrounding
medium, follows from the circumstance that the notes are not
formed merely when the
                                              jet
                                   issues into water, but also when                                       it
flows into air.         the jet ascends

      “Description of a Hand Spectrum-Telescope.”          By William
Huggins, F.R.S.
   The instrument described in this paper was contrived in the sum
mer of 1866, for the purpose of observing the spectra of meteors and
their trains. The special suitability of this apparatus, as a hand
spectroscope, for the examination of the spectra of the lights which
may be seen about the sun during the total solar eclipse of next year,
induces me to offer a description of it to the Royal Society.
   The apparatus consists essentially of a direct-vision prism placed-
in front of a small achromatic telescope.
    The achromatic object-glass, marked a, is 1:2 inch in diameter,
and has a focal length of about 10 inches. The eyepiece (b) con
sists of two plano-convex lenses.           As a large field of view is of great
importance, especially for            use    itsmeteor-spectroscope, the field

   Unfortunately was prevented from making the use of the instru
ment which             I
                 had intended at the display of meteors in November
 1866.      I
            have, however, great confidence in the suitability of the
apparatus for the prismatic observation of meteors and their trains.
   As the instrument is not provided with a slit, it is applicable
 only to bright objects of small size, or to objects so distant as to
subtend but a very small angle.       It is obvious that if the object has
a diameter smaller in one direction than in any other, as would
usually be the case with the trains of meteors, the instrument should
be rotated to take advantage of the form of the object. The most
favourable position will be when the smallest diameter of the object
is perpendicular to the height of the prisms.          In this way I have
seen the lines of Fraunhofer in the        spectrum   of the moon when a
very narrow crescent.
    In the case of objects which appear as points, a small breadth may
be given to the spectrum by a cylindrical lens fitted in a little cap
which slips over the eye-lens, and is placed next to the eye.
   As some of the advantages which this instrument possesses over
an ordinary spectroscope, or over a prism held before the eye, may
be stated the comparatively large amount of light which the object
glass collects, the great facility for instantly pointing the instrument
to the object desired, which the large field of view affords, and in
some cases the magnifying-power of the instrument.
   It may perhaps be mentioned that secret signals might be con
veyed at night by means of the temporary introduction of certain
suitable substances, as preparations of lithium, copper, strontium,
 &c., into the flame of a lamp giving a continuous spectrum; the
presence of the bright lines due to these substances would not be
perceived except by an observer provided with a spectrum-telescope,
to whom they might convey information in accordance with a pre
vious arrangement.
   This little instrument, held in the hand and directed to the place
of the sun during                its
                           eclipse      1868, might enable

the important question whether the bright prominences are self
luminous       reflect solar light.

with one very extraordinary one ; it is comprised in Lalande's cata
logue (2–4h 54" 10', 3= +0°59'). Its spectrum is very curious:
the red is divided into two bands by one large dark line, the golden
yellow is reduced to a very clear and very bright line; after a large
dark band follows a large dark-greenish-yellow band, and then, after
another dark space, a third zone.     I imagine that this spectrum is
only an exaggeration of the third type; I have at present no exact
measurements, the instrument being only arranged at present for
preliminary observations.                        -

   Although have not yet examined the entire heavens, think it                    I
pretty probable that but few of these stars will be found, and that
they will be of the family of the red and of the variable stars.
    Sirius, which is very high just now at a convenient time, has
 been examined by the new spectroscope with a cylindrical eyepiece;
 the beautiful dark line in the extreme red is seen sharp and precise,
like      line F, and like those of the violet. This just confirms what
        the
I saw    at the outset, when         I
                                only used the prism with the telescope
 without any eyepiece.       Between this and the line D of sodium,
 which is easily seen in the spectrum of Sirius, a band tolerably
 spread out is seen nebulous and badly defined, and several other fine
 lines in the green, already noticed by Mr. Huggins.
    I hope soon to be able to give exact measurements for these lines;
 but a general review of the heavens must first be made, so as to ascer
 tain the most remarkable stars.—Comptes Rendus, January 20, 1868.
    ON   OXYCHLORIDE OF ZINC AS A CEMENT.                              BY DR. TOLLENS.
  Soret has, as is well known, used the solid mass resulting from the
mixture of chloride and oxide of zinc, more, however, in making
small objects than as a cement.       It has also been used for stop
ping teeth.
   This cement is admirably adapted for the laboratory; by       means                its
a vessel may      closed perfectly air-tight

out needing any repair.      To attain this, however, care must be be
stowed on its   preparation   and application.
    Commercial zinc-white is mixed with half its volume, or an
equal weight, of fine sand, and rubbed in a mortar with solution of
chloride of zinc of 1:26, so as to form a homogeneous paste, which
is applied as quickly as possible.      The weight of the solution re
 quired will be about the same as that of the oxide of zinc.
  If   the solution is of this strength, there is time to apply it to the
vessel, and, on setting, it will have an adequate degree of hardness;
with a greater degree of concentration, the hardening proceeds too
rapidly, while with a less the hardening is insufficient.    The cork is
pressed a little in the neck of the apparatus, so that there is a hollow
space of 2 to 3 lines about the glass tube; after moistening this
with the solution, it is filled up with cement, which is laid on a little
round the tube. Owing to the rapid hardening of the oxychloride,
the apparatus can be used a few minutes after.
    In disengaging chlorine, there is scarcely any annoyance from the
 gas, so that a change of workmen is not necessary, as was formerly
 the case.
    It may be used for many other purposes—cementing glass lutes
 in metal tubes, closing slits in metal apparatus, &c.
    The cost is not great; with less than an ounce of zinc-white,
 and the same quantity of sand and of solution, a pretty large wash
 bottle may be made tight.—Zeitschrift für Chemie, September 1867.
EXPERIMENTS         ON      THE PERMEABILITY OF CAST IRON BY THE
   GASES OF COMBUSTION.            BY MM. H. SAINTE-CLAIRE DEVILLE
   AND TROOST.
    General Morin has done us the honour of calling for an exact analy
sis of the air which circulates round a strongly heated cast-iron stove.
We have found that this air contained considerable quantities of hy
drogen and of carbonic oxide.       This fact is completely explained by
the permeability to gases of cast iron at a high temperature, and by                       its
property   of  condensing carbonic oxide discovered                   by
                                                             Mr. Graham.
It  shows, moreover, that the air which            contact with strongly
                                                         to in

heated iron surfaces may become injurious          respiration.
    We proposed        ascertain whether the porosity             of
                                                          cast iron would

 which, resting in grooves on the top and bottom of the stove, forms a
 chamber round it which is only connected with the external air by
 the interstices in the grooves between the envelope and the cylinder.
    To investigate the nature of the gases which might pass from
the stove proper into the room, the following arrangements were
adopted. The gases which transpire into this chamber are aspired
into a meter placed at the end of a series of absorption-tubes;
 they deposit their carbonic acid and aqueous vapour in U-tubes,
some filled with pumice soaked with strong sulphuric acid, and
some with pieces of potash. Thus purified, they pass over oxide
of copper heated to redness; the hydrogen and carbonic oxide
they contain are converted into aqueous vapour and carbonic acid.
These substances are weighed by being successively passed through
tared tubes, the first containing pumice impregnated with concen
trated sulphuric acid, and the second potash.          The gases are then
drawn into the meter, which sends them into the atmosphere.
    [It would seem, from an extensive Table furnished by the authors,
that 1000 litres of air drawn through the tubes contained, on the
average, about ; a litre of hydrogen and # a litre of carbonic
oxide.     These gases therefore pass through the sides of a cast-iron
stove heated to dull or to bright redness.]
   These results are readily explained if we remember the porosity of
iron, and the greater porosity of cast iron*.
    Graham's experiments have shown, moreover, since our own of
1863, that iron absorbs at a red heat 4:15 times its volume of oxide
of carbon when it is exposed to an atmosphere of this gas.
   The oxide of carbon absorbed on the inside of the stove dif
fuses on the outside into the air; and the effect is continuous;
hence the disagreeable nature of the air in rooms heated by cast-iron
stoves, or by air in contact with red-hot plates.—Comptes Rendus,

   Any one who has employed Gibbs’s process for the separation
of the metals which are associated in platinum ore must have re
cognized the extreme value of this compound as a reagent, and
the great importance of being able to prepare it with certainty
on the large scale. The literature of the subject, unfortunately,
supplied only the converse of these two conditions; but the ge
neral nature of the reaction whereby the body is usually formed
could be perceived without difficulty. When an ammoniacal
solution of cobaltic chloride is mixed with sal-ammoniac and ex
posed to air, the first expenditure of chemical force with which
we are here concerned is devoted to the formation of the a-pent
ammoniotrichloride (roseochloride); on further effort, the      8
pentammoniotrichloride (purpureochloride) is produced; and,
lastly, the appearance of the hexammoniotrichloride represents the

taken in connexion with the fact that a lower cobaltic oxide than
the sesquioxide had been formed, naturally led me to look for
hydric nitrate in the filtrates. The sodic solution just mentioned
was evaporated to dryness, and hydric nitrate determined in it
by Stein's method”. The percentage number obtained (0.06)
is of sufficient value to show that the quantity of nitrate is ex
tremely small, and adequate to account for only a minute frac
tion of the missing substance.
   The presence of hydric nitrate in these liquids may also be
shown qualitatively by boiling them with pure sodic hydrate
until   all  free ammonia has been expelled, employing Har
court’s  process, and applying Nessler's test     the distillate.                to

or to 0.38 per cent. for the equation
             4Cl2 + NH8+3H2O= HNO3+8 HCl.
  It      has been seen, however (continuation                            of Exp. X, Sect. I.),
that the actual yield of hydric nitrate is not by any means
accordant with the number (1:41) which flows from the latter
consideration; neither does the corresponding quantity of am
monia neutralized and oxidized in nitrification (HNO”:9NH*::
0.06:0:14) go far to account for the loss. The same experi
ment fortunately suggests an additional explanation.     On com
paring the percentage of free ammonia found with that indicated
by theory, there is a difference of 1899–11:96=7:03,       which
number is to the cobalt in the filtrate (9-07) nearly as 6NH4 to
Co°.   It may be inferred that the compound

really existed in the filtrate, and that through                                 its      agency   tetra

   The evolution of a small quantity of ammonia during ebulli
tion was the only very noticeable feature in the reaction.        Its
occurrence is evidently owing to the interference of the products
of decomposition with each other. The precipitation of dicobaltic
teroxide instead of tetracobaltic pentoxide was manifestly due to
atmospheric oxidation; and the numbers show that considerably
more than half of the cobaltic chloride was decomposed.          The
discrepancy between the statement of Frémy and that of Gibbs
and Genth (see Sect.         probably finds   I.) solution here,                its                            it

precipitate with ammonic polysulphide,-a result which is quan
titatively corroborated by the above numbers. As in the former
case, there has been considerable oxidizing action from external
sources, viz. the air in the closed vessel and the hot air in the
desiccating bath; yet this has not proceeded to such an extent
as to mask entirely the real nature of the process.                   Although
the oxide   Co"O",    as thus   generated,   is evidently     more prone to
oxidation than as at first obtained, yet the oxide actually analyzed
still shares with it the property of deriving at the same time
from cobaltic dichloride and terchloride.

 hexammoniochloride was transferred to a weighed filter and dried

 5 per cent. of that substance. Special comparative experiments

moniochloride; and that, consequently, that ammonia which con
stitutes the difference between them is not the same in proper
ties as free ammonia.    Hence, as has been already seen, ammonia
does not convert the     pentammoniochloride     into hexammonio
chloride unless water be present to effect a decomposition.
    (6) If we consider the nature of the oxides which these poly
ammoniacal cobaltic chlorides generate when decomposed by
heated water, we shall perceive that the formulae of the latter
ought to be doubled, the argument being in principle the
same as that for doubling the formula of ferric chloride if it
were written FeCl”.     The illegitimacy of rational formulae having
the  general  character
                           a NH3. CoCl3
for these bodies is also evident when we call to mind that an
ammoniacal salt and an oxidizing agent are not only their pro
ducers, but their products of decomposition,-facts to which such
formulae do not refer, while they represent reactions which have
not yet been recorded by a single experimenter.

264    M. R. Rühlmann                  on the Alteration produced by Heat
Fraunhofer's results—much more so than mine. This fact, taken
in conjunction with the great discrepancy between different ob
servations made under like circumstances, throws an unfavour
able light upon their accuracy.    On this account it was not pos
sible for me to regard the problem as solved—the less so because
Gladstone and Dale had not even taken the trouble to deduce a
lawin the form of an interpolation formula from their experiments.
It is not possible to determine the source of the above pointed
out inexactness, because the numbers upon which the results are
based are nowhere given, and we are thus debarred from the
detection of any possible considerable error arising from inad
vertence or miscalculation.
    The next investigation which must, at                              all   events for the sake
of completeness,             be   mentioned           is      by   Schmidtº, who had occa

guarantee        of    its
                     remaining constant during the observations.

266        M. R. Rühlmann           on the    Alteration produced by Heat
    In fluor-sparalone the index of refraction diminishes with
increase of temperature, as is the case with liquids and gases.
   An explanation and solution of this peculiar contradiction is
subsequently attempted.
   The method adopted by Fizeau to determine the numbers he
obtained     is the following:—
  The substance is cut into plates whose parallel surfaces are
about 1 to 10 millims. apart.  A pencil of homogeneous light
falling perpendicularly upon the plate gives rise to two reflected
rays (repeated reflexion being neglected) which produce pheno
 mena of interference.      Since most surfaces which the mecha
nical optician endeavours to grind flat are almost invariably
more or less convex, the interference-fringes have usually a cir
 cular form. The difference of path of the two luminous rays is
caused by the fact that the first is reflected directly at the front
 surface of the glass, while the second, entering the glass and
being reflected at the back surface of the plate, has to pass back
wards again through the thickness of the glass to reenter the air.
We have accordingly here to consider the difference of the velo
city with which the paths in the air and in the glass are tra
versed, and the difference of phase suffered through the reflexion.
When the plate is warmed, the fringes are of course moved; and
this motion is measured.       This motion is owing to two causes:
 (1) an expansion of the plate perpendicular to                     its
                                                          surfaces, and
   consequent alteration                its
                                   thickness and  consequently         the          of
                                in in
a
path; (2)                                    refraction itself, whereby
                 is an
                alteration     the index             of
the velocity      altered with which the ray traverses the altered
path.      If
            the thickness           of
                                 the plate      given temperature
                                                      at  a                              is
known, we can deduce the alteration         the index from the num
                                                     in
ber   ofthe displaced fringes.

formula
               n=   1°33696–0-00006909t–0-000000851318.
   As this method requires the exact determination of the law of
alteration of the angle of the axis of the crystalline plate, and is
therefore rather complicated, and, further, as every error in the
determination   of this law is introduced into the determination
of the  index, I do not think that the method will receive very
extensive application to the determination of the dependence of
the refraction of liquid bodies upon their temperature. These ob
servations relating to Fraunhofer's line D and water are marked
                                                                 -

     If
      we cast a glance back at the above experimental researches
which have been hitherto published, we are forced to admit
that the chief fundamental facts have been indeed established
by Fizeau for solid bodies and by Gladstone and Dale for liquid
ones, but that the results are, to a very considerable extent, de
ficient in accuracy.   The question cannot be regarded as solved
until not only the refractive index (with exactness within cer
tain limits), but also the law of alteration has been given in the
form of an interpolation formula.                             This interpolation formula
is best given in the shape

the  greatest  accuracy and the agreement       the formula with           of
the observations has been established.    For solid bodies, Fizeau
has furnished these data, while for liquids the only data hitherto
given are those     Müttrich, and these merely between
                       of                                      and                            0°

270         M. R. Rühlmann on the Alteration produced by Heat
the application of the phenomena of interference in thick plates.
A plate with parallel faces is cut into two parts. One of these, Pl,
is fastened in a stand and receives a pencil of parallel rays. A
ray of light from A (fig. 1, Plate W.) is partly reflected upon the
front face of plate Pi, and partly on the back one, and is thus
divided into two pencils, which are delayed in regard the one to
the other by the passage in the glass plate, and the loss of phase
caused by the reflexion at the back surface.          At some distance,
and in the   path   of the two   parallel rays, the second half, P2, of
the   glass plate  is set up   in a position  parallel  to the first one.
Then the original ray (always apart from manifold internal re
flexions) is divided into four, two of which appear perfectly coin
cident both in phase and direction. One of these two is the one
which is reflected at the front surface of the first glass and at
the back surface of the second glass; the other is reflected at the
back surface of the first and at the front surface of the second
glass (fig.           the intermediate space the two rays are sepa

ment which a ray of light experiences in passing through a known
thickness of a horizontal liquid layer. This experiment is per
formed by the observation of a mark at the bottom of a vessel
before and after it is filled with a liquid.               -
   Although it has been repeatedly shown that this method of
determination is defective, and that a small error in the observa
tion of the displacement gives rise to great differences, because
great magnitudes are determined by small ones, yet of late re
course has been frequently had to various modifications of this
plan”.   Its value was stated to consist especially in the fact
that the luminous ray can at once enter the exposed surface of
the liquid from the air; while in investigating by means of
prisms, alterations of the density may occur just at the important
terminal surfaces.   According to Poisson’s view of capillarity,
such a condensation must certainly take place at the surface of
contact between the liquid and the glass; but such condensation
would undoubtedly take place in layers parallel to the confining
glass surface.   It would vanish at a short distance from the
glass, and the liquid would soon assume      normal density,                              its
                                                                                                                   by               If,so

has been exactly determined, then the refracted image of the
slit illuminated by the sodium-flame is brought to coincide with
the vertical thread of the telescope.    It is well known that at
the minimum refraction the rays, on emerging, diverge in the
same manner as if they had proceeded directly from the slit ; so
that, since the difference in the paths is very small, the slit may
be seen directly and distinctly.                           If
                                     the instrument is accurately
adjusted, the refracted and direct images of the slit must appear
at the same height in the telescope.       the difference is consi    If
derable, the interval must be measured by means of the vertical
circle, and the angular reading divided by the cosine of the dif
ference in height.

and that employed by Fraunhofer, Baden Powell, and others
consists in the complete separation of my prism from the tele

be used without correction.

    When       I
               began my measurements with the apparatus con
 structed in this manner, the inconvenience at once declared itself
 that, in order to maintain the flat glass plate tight up against
 the glass tube, it was necessary to screw the three screws very
 hard. In consequence of the great pressure to which the plates
were thereby subjected, the images of Fraunhofer’s lines at
higher temperatures appeared indistinct, and the reflexion of
                                                                        all

278        M. R. Rühlmann                   on the Alteration produced by Heat
increase of temperature, and also that a slight touching of the
glass plates might cause such to take place, because the plates
are connected to the tube with scarcely any friction.     Accord
ingly, along with the measurements of the angle of least deviation,
continuous measurements must also be made of the refracting
angle of the prism.    For this reason the arrangement of the                                                     in
strument shown in   fig. 2, Pl. W. was chosen.
   The hollow prism itself showed by the most careful testing
absolutely no proper refraction, so that it was not necessary to
apply any correction on this account%.
   (5) The thermometer used for measuring the temperature in
the inside of the prism was a little one by Greiner (Réaumur,
with paper scale) divided from –55° to 80°.       It was possible
to judge to one-tenth of a degree, without, however, being sure
of the accuracy to two-tenths of    a degree, since the thermometer
had often to be read   very rapidly, and the degrees were not quite
1 millim. apart.    Only the lower part of the thermometer dip
ped into the liquid.      From —55° it was below the sheet of
cardboard, by which it was protected from the heat radiated or
convected from the prism or the lamp beneath.          It was neces
sary, therefore, to correct for the projecting portion of the scale;
and for this purpose the formula given by Kopp was employed,
                                    T=T--v. 2(t–t),
where T is the temperature read off, t the temperature of the scale,
o, the apparent   coefficient of expansion of mercury in glass
(0.000154), and v the number of degrees in the projecting
partf.

      (6) The slit.—In order to obtain a straight line of light, an
ordinary moveable interference-slit was employed, the two edges
of which were about ; a millimetre apart. This was so fastened
to a holder on a screen as to be moveable in two directions at
 right angles to one another.
     (7) The source of light.—The choice of the source of light
 also demanded much consideration and many experiments.                         It
 would have been best, in order to come to a clear conclusion
 about the alteration of the refraction with the temperature, to
 have used sunlight, and to have taken Fraunhofer's lines as the
 fixed data.        As, however,    I  made my experiments in winter, and
 as considerable time was necessary for each one of them,                   I was
 obliged to dispense with this light, because in our climate the
 sun is very often invisible for weeks together, and I did not
 choose to be so dependent upon the weather.                Fraunhofer's lines
 in diffused daylight, even when a condensing-apparatus is used,
 are so feeble that they could not be employed.                  I  contemplated
 next making use of the absorption spectra of gases, such, for                in
  stance, as nitrous acid, which Hankel, Grailich, and Weiss had
  used in their experiments.             The coincidence of some of their
                                         U 2

280        M. R. Rühlmann       on the Alteration produced by Heat
lines with Fraunhofer's has been proved by Grailichº. A later
observation of A. Weiss has shown that, on altering the tempe
 rature or density of the vapours, displacements occur in the lines in
 such a way that some of them disappear and new ones are formed.
 The method is also not much to be recommended, because on
 employing artificial light, the more refrangible part of the spec
 trum beyond F contains too few rays. To procure another sort
 of homogeneous light, such as Fraunhofer suggested and Dutirout
 employed, requires rather a complicated arrangement. The reader
 is therefore referred to the original communication.
     The simplest means which appeared to me to remain was to
 make use of the bright lines which appear in the spectrum-appa
 ratus caused by the flames of incandescent metals. The sodium
 line appeared at once for the Fraunhofer line D. All other me
 tals, such as potassium, strontium, calcium, &c., gave lines which
 were too weak to be seen at a distance of 8 metres by means of
 my best telescope; so that there only remained the red lithium
 and the green thallium-line.          The brilliant lines of caesium,       in
  dium, and other newly discovered metals could not be employed,
  on account of the dearness of their preparations.
     The three lines of hydrogen gas incandescent in the induc
 tion-current of a Ruhmkorff’s coil passing through a Geissler's
  tube, such as Landolt used, could not be employed, on account
  of practical difficulties.
     As in calculating the formula of dispersion it was necessary to
  know the undular length of the homogeneous light, an attempt
  was made to estimate this quantity under             the hypothesis       that
  the undular length for the line D (AD=0.0005888 millim.) was
  known. I made use of a Fraunhofer's lattice, and measured the
  distance of the first refraction-images         from one another.          Ac
  cording to the theory of the refraction-spectrum, the sines of the
  angle of deviation must be proportional to the lengths of the
  waves.      Unfortunately it was not possible to measure exactly
  to less than 10" with the theodolite.        Moreover it was rather diffi
  cult to catch the feeble lithium-light line, and the only momen                *
  tarily appearing line of the volatile thallium. The measurements
  obtained are the      following:—

 XXXI.            On the Direct Transformation                         of Chloriodide of Ethylene
           into Glycol.        By Maxwell SIMPson, M.D., F.R.S.*
        OME       years agot       I discovered           a compound              having the           compo
             sition C2 H4ll
                                    F.   which        I    called       chloriodide of ethylene.
 With this body I have tried a great many experiments, in the
 hope of being able, whilst retaining one of the metalloids in its
 place, to substitute a monatomic radical, such as hydroxyl,                                                  cy
 anogen, &c., for the other.     These experiments have     failed.                                all
   have found that the metalloids      this compound always act                                               in

 radical without          at   the same time replacing the other.                                      One     of
 these experiments        I      will now describe,     produced        as   it                    a   definite

   In distilling the product of the foregoing reaction, observed                        I

cept by supposing that the chloriodide decomposed the water
which was present, as well as the oxide of silver (of which there
was only one molecule), and that both reactions gave the same
product. The following equation will make this intelligible:–

   In order  to determine                this point I exposed one part by weight

   Magnus has endeavoured to show that hydrogen has a specific
and preeminent conducting-power.
   The examination of the conducting-powers of liquids is mainly
due to Rumford, Murray, and Despretz.
   The well-known experiment of Rumford, in which water is
boiled over ice, led that experimentalist                            to conclude that water
does not conduct heat.
     Murray placed the bulb of a thermometer under a layer of                                                  oil

above.     He concluded that both liquids conducted heat, and
that mercury did         more readily than water.

   The accompanying figure shows the apparatus which     have                                      I
 employed for showing, comparing, and approximately measuring
 the conducting-powers of various liquids.
    A and B are two conical copper bottles
 having very thin and perfectly flat bottoms
 of exactly the same size.      The two vessels
 are fixed so that their flat surfaces are per
 fectly horizontal and at a little distance (say
 two or three millimetres) from one another.
 The liquid under examination is introduced,
 by a pipette, between the two surfaces at W,
 where it remains, supported by adhesion.                                       II.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.T. W.
 The neck of the vessel A is fitted with two
 tubes like those of a washbottle.     The lower
 vessel B serves as an air-thermometer, its
neck  carrying   a tube T which dips into a
reservoir of water R.     Steam, or a current
of warm water, is passed through the ves
sel A.    By this means                    its

metallic pieces that when     a sufficient   intensity of charge has been
reached, sparks pass across the air-intervals.              Hence to give a
commencement of action to Mr. Warley's instrument, one of the
inductors must be charged from an independent source to a con
siderable potential (that of several thousand cells for instance),
to make sure that sparks will pass between the carriers and the
metal piece (corresponding to one of my connecting springs) which
it passes under the influence of that inductor. In my “Reple
nisher,” however well discharged it may be to begin with, electri
fication enough is reached after a few seconds (on the compound
interest principle, with an infinitesimal capital to begin with) to
produce sparks and flashes in various parts of my instrument. In
Mr. Varley's instrument, what corresponds to my connector is de
scribed as being connected with the ground; and the effect is to
produce positive and negative electrification of the two inductors.
In this respect it agrees with the self-acting apparatus for multi
   ing and maintaining electric charges, described in a commu
nication to the Royal Society last May”.               From this arrange
ment    I passed  to the  “Replenisher     ”  by using   a wheel with car
riers as a substitute for the water-droppers, and arranging that
the connectors might be insulated and one of the inductors con
nected with the earth, which, of course, may be done in Mr.
Warley's instrument, and which renders it identical with mine,
with the exception of the difference of spring-contacts instead
of sparks. This difference is essential for some of the applica
tions of the “Replenisher,” which          I  described, and have found
very useful, especially the small internal replenisher, for reple
nishing, when needed, the charges of the Leyden jar of my hete
rostatic electrometers.       But the reciprocal-electrophorus        prin
ciple, which seemed to me a novelty in the communication to the
Royal Society and in the Philosophical Magazine article of last
                                 I
January referred to, had, as now find, been invented and pub
lished by Mr. Varley long before, in his patent of 1860, when it
was,  I  believe, really new to science.

    Glasgow College, March 20,        1868.-In looking further into
Mr. Warley's patent,     I find that he describes an arrangement for
making spring-contacts instead of the narrow air-spaces for
sparks,—and that he uses the spring-contacts to enable him to
commence with a very small difference of potentials,                and to
magnify on the compound-interest principle.                 He even states
that he can commence with such a difference of potentials as can

    I have endeavoured    to account for the influence which liquids
submitted to electrolysis exert upon the distribution of heat in
the voltaic circuit.     For this    I  have investigated this action,
allowing for (1) their degree of concentration, (2) the distance
of the plates immersed, (3) the extent of the moistened surface,
(4) the nature of the liquids.

containing 101.55 grims. of sulphuric acid (SO*H) in a litre, which
served as a standard of comparison, and with equal volumes of
this liquid gradually more and more diluted.         I reached a dilution
of   ris, the liquid  containing   then  only 0.0793 grim. of sulphuric
acid in the 100 cubic centims.      employed.     I took care to have the
experiments made with the more or less diluted acid succeeded
or preceded by experiments made with the acid which served as
standard of comparison.
    I  have varied the distances, so as to ascertain the part to be
assigned to the heat produced in the work of giving a definite
  º
position to the molecules of the electrolyte in the body of the
liquid.

worked as follows:—
    I have  retarded, as much as possible, the chemical action of
the battery, by placing in the calorimeter which contains it a

rheostat with great resistance; and have successively introduced
into the exterior of the circuit voltameters with plates of copper,
 of cadmium, and of zinc.      I have taken care to precede or succeed
 each of these experiments by another in which the voltameter
 was dispensed with.      In a second series of experiments placedI

of experiments  I suppressed  the rheostat.
   Replacing the solution of sulphuric acid in the voltameter
with platinum plates by an equivalent solution of nitric acid, and
working alternately with each solution, I found that nitric acid
borrows for         its
               decomposition about 1062 thermal units less than
sulphuric acid, and that consequently the radical      0°,   com                    N°        in

   The deflection of the needle of a tangent-compass, as well as
the duration of operation, may well show the quantity of che
mical action produced in each couple in equal times; but the
calorimeter alone can give the quantity of heat at work in the
element—a quantity which in the same time and for the same
deflection of the needle increases with the number of couples.
The use of several calorimeters, containing the battery and the
various parts of the interpolar, enables us to measure the distri
bution in the circuit of the motive force developed in the battery,
and to assign their respective parts to the complicated reactions.
   If we admit that the tangent-compass measures the number
of electrodynamic vibrations in the voltaic circuit, we are led to
the conclusion that the calorimeter measures the magnitude and
velocity       of these          vibrations.
  The compound metalloid radicals either decompose water in a
manner opposite to that of the alkaline metals, combining with
 its
   hydrogen and thus reproducing the acid decomposed,     they                                      or
decompose into oxygen (which        liberated) and body (such        is                        a
as SO" for the radical SO") which combines with water and also
reproduces             the decomposed acid.

ing through the corks which stop the tubes, and then through
a stout upright board so as to support the bulbs. Of the thick
wires, one from each tube is soldered to one thick copper wire,
and the other to another thick wire. These last wires are con
nected with the poles of a battery        of one or two large Grove's
cells.
   The current then divides itself, and a portion flows through
each wire proportional to the conducting-power of that wire.
This current heating the wire causes the air in the bulb to ex
pand and depress the liquid in the tube attached by an amount
nearly proportional to the conducting-power of the wire. If the
tubes were filled at first to the top, the liquid will, when the
current is flowing, fall through different amounts.      Fig. 1 shows
the curve when the wires are gold, silver, and various alloys of
gold and silver.      If the connexions are changed so that the
same current flows in succession through every wire, the liquid
will be depressed by an amount nearly proportional to the resist
ance of each wire.

   The metal bars are at their other end secured in a box of
boiling water.    The heat conducted by the bars from the box of
water to the bulb depresses the liquid in the tubes, and a curve
is formed by the tops of the columns of liquid of nearly the
same shape as was formed by the heated wires.
   It is well to protect the bulbs in both cases by enclosing them
in little compartments formed of blackened tin-plate. These

   These experiments were undertaken with a view to determine the
resistance of the air to some forms of heads of elongated shot which
were likely to be of practical use. The chronograph used was the
one described in the Proceedings of the Royal Artillery Institution
for August 1866*, which was constructed on the plan of the Green
wich instrument.       Ten screens were placed in a line at intervals of
150 feet, the first being 75 feet from the gun.              The following were
the forms of the heads, and ten shot of each kind were prepared:—
      (1)    Hemispherical       .... .. .... .. .. .. .. --- - --        solid.
      (2)    Hemispheroidal (axes as 1 : 2) . . . . . . . . . . . .       solid.

      (5)    Ogival (1 diameter) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  hollow.
      (6)    Ogival (2 diameters) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hollow.
   (3) and (5)      as well as    (4) and (6) had respectively the             same
external forms, but the solid were nearly double the weight of the
hollow shot. The gun used was a 40-pounder M.L., and the dia
meter of the shot was 4.7 inches.
   It was found, as in the trial experiments of 1865, that, if s be the
space described in time t after passing the first screen, then, approxi

   All  the hollow shot were fired, giving eighteen out of twenty suc
cessful shots.     Only a part of the solid shot prepared were fired; and
they did not give nearly such good results as the hollow shot, pro
bably in consequence of the superior angular velocity of the hollow
shot—because, as a 5-lb. charge was used throughout, the lighter
shot had a higher initial velocity, and consequently a higher corre
sponding angular velocity.
   Tables are given showing for every round:—(1) the experimental
determination of the time of passing each screen, supposing the first
screen   to be passed     when t=0; (2) the velocities at the middle
points between successive screens; (3) the weights of the shot; and

resistance at 1300 feet per second       is only 9.94 lbs. per square inch,
whilst, according to that hypothesis, the back resistance alone would
be 15 lbs. per square inch.
   It is suggested that the true reason of the great increase of resist
ance may be found in the fact that a wave-impulse cannot be pro
pagated at a greater velocity than 1100 feet per second, and that
consequently a great condensation of air must take place in front of
the projectile at               all
                        velocities exceeding this, and the resisting force
of  such condensed air will increase             greater rate than indicated

   February 14, 1868.-" On Vanadium, one of the Trivalent Group
of Elements.”   By Henry E. Roscoe, B.A., F.R.S.
   The metal vanadium (so called from Vanadis, a cognomen of the
Scandinavian goddess Freia) was discovered in 1830 by Sefström in
the celebrated Swedish bar-iron made from the Taberg ore. From
this source, even when using many pounds of the iron, Sefström
obtained only minute quantities of the new substance; but he found
it in somewhat larger amount in the slag or cinder produced in the
reduction of the iron ore.       Sefström ascertained some of the most
peculiar characters of the substance, proved it to be a new element,
and prepared some of its compounds in the pure state. The reac
tions by which vanadium can be separated and distinguished from
all the other elements are:-(1) The formation of a soluble sodium
vanadate when the vanadium compounds are fused with sodium car
bonate ; (2) the formation of an insoluble ammonium vanadate when
sal-ammoniac is added to the solution of a soluble vanadate; (3) the
production of a splendid blue solution when this ammonium-salt,
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, is warmed with reducing agents such
as oxalic acid.
    Sefström, not having leisure to prosecute the full examination of
the properties of the new metal, handed over his preparations to
Berzelius; and it is to the investigations of the great Swede (1831)
that we owe almost          all

reliable information respecting the character of vanadium, have only
served to throw doubt upon some of the conclusions of Berzelius,
and thus to show that our knowledge is even less complete than it ap
peared to be.
   Hence it was with much satisfaction that in February 1865 the
speaker came into possession of a plentiful source of vanadium in a
by-product obtained in the preparation of cobalt from the copper
bearing beds of the lower Keuper Sandstone of the Trias at Alderley
Edge, in Cheshire.    The manager of the works was puzzled to know
why a blue solution, supposed by him to contain copper, did not de
posit the red metal upon a strip of zinc ; the speaker recognized this
reaction as due to the presence of vanadium, and secured the whole
of the by-product, which he found to contain about 2 per cent. of
the rare metal. The exact position of the vanadium mineral in the
sandstone beds cannot now be stated, as the mine (at Mottram, St.
Andrews) from which the cobalt ore was obtained is now closed and
cannot be entered. The general characters of the deposit, however,
are well known, and exhibit points of great interest; they have
been well described by Mr. Hull as follows:–
   “The ‘edge’ or escarpment of Alderley rises from the eastern
side of the plain of Cheshire gradually towards the east, but with a
steep and abrupt ridge towards the north.        This northern bank is
richly wooded, and has a very beautiful aspect when viewed from a
distance, as it contrasts strongly with the almost level plain which
sweeps away to the northward and westward from              base.   The           its                  º
ridge has here been upheaved along the line           large fault, bear  ofa

                                          base the red marl, and     the                          on
other side bringing             up
                         the soft sandstone     the Bunter, capped by
                                                                  of
   mural cliff   lower Keuper conglomerate, which often breaks out
                   of
in aconspicuous masses through the foliage.       The beds rise from
the plain towards the east         angle at     an
                                            about from       of10°; and           5°    to

    The beds in the above series which claim the greatest share of our
attention are those at the base of the Keuper series, for in these
occur the copper and other minerals. The copper, as both blue and
green carbonate, occurs disseminated throughout the sand, the ore
coating the outside of the grains of sand and the pebbles of quartz.
In   addition to copper, bands containing lead, both as carbonate and
sulphide (galena), occur, also bands and veins of cobalt-ochre, oxide
of manganese, and iron-ochre in workable quantity. The copper is
extracted from the ore by solution in hydrochloric acid and precipi
tation as metal by scrap iron. The ordinary copper liquor, as well
as the oxide of iron precipitated by lime from the solution of the
chloride, does not contain any trace of vanadium; nor was the speaker
able to detect any of this metal in the ore as at present worked.
    Following, in the main, the process of preparation adopted by
 Sefström, the speaker obtained from the above-mentioned lime preci
pitate several pounds of pure ammonium vanadate, from which all
the other compounds of vanadium can be prepared.
    What now were the conclusions to which Berzelius arrived from
his experiments concerning the constitution of the vanadium com
pounds?        He corroborated Sefström's statement, that the most cha
racteristic feature of the substance is the existence of an acid-forming
oxide, termed vanadic acid, produced whenever any of the oxides are
heated in the air.       Berzelius also discovered two other oxides of
vanadium (of which he ascertained the composition), and likewise a
volatile chloride.     To the highest oxide he gave the formula VO",
to the second VO", and to the lowest (or suboxide) WO ; whilst the
chloride was represented by VCl”. The atomic weight of the metal
he ascertained to be V = 68-5.        Berzelius came to this conclusion
from the    following experimentally  ascertained facts: (1) that on pass
ing hydrogen over heated vanadic acid a constant loss of weight
occurred, and the suboxide was formed; (2) that when dry chlorine
was passed over the suboxide thus prepared, the volatile chloride was
formed, and a residue of vanadic acid remained which was exactly
equal in weight to one-third of the acid originally taken for reduc
tion. Hence, assuming that the lowest oxide contains one atom of
oxygen (an assumption borne out by the analysis of the chloride),
the acid must contain three atoms of oxygen”; and the following for
mulae represent the composition of these compounds according to
 Berzelius:—
            VO,       VO",       VO",     WC13.       (V=68-5.)
The interest attaching to the conclusions which Berzelius fairly
 drew from his experiments was much heightened by an observation
 made by Rammelsberg in 1856, as to the exact crystalline form
 of the mineral vanadinite, a double salt of lead vanadate and lead
 chloride.
    So long ago as 1780, Werner had observed the identity of crystal
    * Berzelius concludes that the acid does not contain two atoms of metal,
 inasmuch as no alum could be formed with potassium sulphate correspond
  ing to those formed by well-known sesquioxides.

                 one   of the Trivalent Group of Elements.                311
chemists have only been justified in assuming the former alternative
to be the correct explanation.
   The speaker stated that, in order to endeavour to clear up this
question, he had most carefully repeated Berzelius's experiments, and
that he had confirmed them in every particular; but having pursued
the subject further than Berzelius, he had at last come to conclusions
concerning the constitution of the vanadium compounds totally dif
ferent from those drawn by the Swedish chemist, and had succeeded
in obtaining the key to the enigma presented by the above anoma
lous crystallographic relations.
    The speaker has proved that the substance supposed by Berzelius
to be vanadium, V =685, is not the metal, but an oxide, and that
the true atomic weight of the metal is 68.5–16=52.5 (or rather,
 according to the speaker's exact determinations of the atomic weight,
 67°3–16=51-3)*. The highest oxide, the vanadic acid, VO", of
Berzelius, hence becomes a pentoxide, V*O", corresponding to Pº O*
 and As" O', and the isomorphism of vanadinite with the pyromor
 phite group of minerals is fully explained. The suboxide of Berze
 lius is a trioxide, V*O", whilst the terchloride (V Cl") of Berzelius is
 an oxychloride, having the formula VOCl", and corresponding to
 oxychloride of phosphorus, PO Cl”. The oxide supposed by Berze
 lius to be the metal contains 51.3 parts by weight of vanadium to
  16 parts by weight of oxygen; and the vanadic oxide of Berzelius
 also exists, containing 51.3 parts of the metal to 32 parts of oxygen;
 to these oxides the empirical formulae V* O” and W*O' may be given.
 Thus we have the following as representing the true composition of
 these vanadium compounds:–
              Dioxide. Trioxide. Tetroxide. Pentoxide.    Oxytrichloride.
  W=51.3 V2O2           V2 O2      V2 O4         V2 Oº       V O Clº
   Each of the four oxides can be obtained in the anhydrous state;
the dioxide is prepared as a grey metallic powder by passing the va
pour of the oxytrichloride mixed with hydrogen over red-hot carbon.
The trioxide is obtained by the reduction of vanadic acid in a cur
rent of hydrogen; and the tetroxide is formed by the slow oxidation
of the trioxide.
   The lowest, or dioxide of vanadium (V* O”), is obtained in solution
by the reducing action of nascent hydrogen evolved from zinc, cad
mium, or sodium-amalgam upon the sulphuric acid solution of va
madic acid, which, passing through        stagesall  blue and green

  *   In   his paper   on
                        Vanadium, read before the Royal Society (Dec. 19,
 1867), the author ventured      predict that the difference between the num
                                to
 ber  he obtained (67.3) and that found        by
                                                Berzelius (685) was probably
 owing      the fact that the vanadium compounds employed
           to                                                     by  Berzelius
 contained traces     phosphorus, which render the perfect reduction
                     of                                                  of the
 vanadic acid   in hydrogen impossible.    Most fortunately this supposition
 has been singularly verified, inasmuch   as Dr. Frankland has kindly placed
     the speaker's hands    small specimen
                                               to of
 in                         a                  vanadate     of
                                                            ammonia found     in
 Faraday’s collection, and labelled “Sent       me     by
                                                        Berzelius, 1831.”. On
 examination, this sample was found      to contain considerable quantities   of
 phosphorus, thus confirming the speaker's previously expressed opinion.

312        Royal Institution:—Prof. Roscoe on Vanadium,
colour, ultimately assumes a permanent lavender tint. This solution
of V*O” in sulphuric acid acts as a most powerful reducing agent,
bleaching indigo solution and other vegetable colouring-matters as
rapidly as chlorine; it also absorbs oxygen with avidity from the
air, forming a deep-brown solution.        The other oxides of vanadium
may be obtained in solution by the action of various reducing agents
on the sulphuric solution of vanadic acid. Thus, by the action of
nascent hydrogen evolved from magnesium a permanent green tint is
obtained, and the vanadium is contained in solution as the trioxide,
V*O'; whilst if moderate     reducing agents, such as sulphurous acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen, or oxalic acid are employed, the colour of the
liquid does not pass beyond the blue stage, and the vanadium is con
tained in solution as tetroxide, V* O**.      The different colours of so
lutions   containing  these oxides was exhibited by means of the mag
nesium light.
    The fact that the lemon-coloured chloride (the terchloride of Ber
zelius) contains oxygen was clearly demonstrated during the dis
course by passing the vapour from a few grammes of the substance,
together with perfectly pure hydrogen gas, over red-hot carbon.          A
portion of the oxygen of the oxychloride unites with the carbon to
form carbonic acid, and the presence of this gas was shown by the
precipitation of barium carbonate in clear baryta-water contained in
two test-tubes placed one before the other. At the commencement of
the experiment the carbonic acid was entirely absorbed by the small
 quantity of baryta-water contained in the first test-tube; but after
 some time the hydrochloric acid gas simultaneously produced by the
decomposition of the chloride saturated this liquid, expelling the
 carbonic acid gas, which, being carried forward into the second test
tube, threw down a bulky precipitate of barium carbonate, thus show
ing that the turbidity could not possibly be due to the presence of any
vanadium compound.         It was found quite unnecessary to place a
tube   containing  heated copper  oxide after the red-hot carbon for the
purpose of oxidizing any carbonic oxide gas which might be formed,
inasmuch as carbonic acid was always left in sufficient quantity
 to give a considerable precipitate.     No methed has been found for
 separating the whole of the oxygen from the oxychloride; and hence
 it has been impossible to make the above experiment quantitatively.
 Solid oxychlorides are obtained by the action of hydrogen upon the
 oxytrichloride, one of which resembles mosaic gold, possessing a
 bright metallic bronze-like lustre, and having been taken for the metal
by Schafarik.
    * In his communication to the Royal Society (Bakerian Lecture, Pro
 ceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xvi. p. 220), the author gave the empi
rical formula VO and VO" to the first and third oxides of vanadium, as
the molecular weights of these oxides have not been determined, and it is
uncertain whether they obey the law of even atomicities, or, like the only
 corresponding compounds, the nitrogen oxides, are exceptions to this law.
    On consideration, the author has, however, thought it best to adopt the
 double formula, as urged by Sir Benjamin Brodie on the occasion above
referred to.

                 one  of the Trivalent   Group  of Elements.            313
    The atomic weight of vanadium was determined (1) by reducing
the pentoxide to trioxide in a current of hydrogen, (2) by the ana
lysis of the oxytrichloride.     The atomic weight obtained as the mean
of a   large number of   well-agreeing    experiments is 51°3.
    The metal itself has not      yet  been obtained; but a compound of
vanadium     and nitrogen has been prepared, shown by direct analysis
to contain    14 parts by weight of nitrogen to 51.3 parts by weight of
vanadium,     corresponding to the formula VN. The existence of this
compound      is proof positive of the true atomic weight of the metal;
and the nitride serves as the point of departure from which to seek
for the metal and the true chlorides of vanadium, one of which, VCl”,
has already been prepared by the action of chlorine upon the nitride.
It is a dark-brown liquid, which decomposes when thrown into water,
forming a green solution containing V* O°. The speaker demon
 strated the fact that the oxychloride, V O Cl", when thrown into
water decomposes with formation of a yellow solution of vanadium
 pentoxide, V*O'; whilst the trichloride, V Cl", on being similarly
treated, yields a green solution containing the metal in solution as
trioxide, V*O”. He then compared these reactions with the decom
position of the corresponding phosphorus compounds, PO Cl” and
PCl”, forming Pº O' and PO", and rendered these reactions visible
by obtaining a precipitate of yellow silver phosphate in the first case,
 and of black metallic silver in the second.
    The characters of the vanadates themseves bear out the analogy
 of the highest oxide with the corresponding oxides of phosphorus
 and arsenic.     In the first place, all the naturally occurring vanadates
 are  tribasic;  secondly,  the true character of vanadic acid is shown to
 be tribasic by the fact that, when the pentoxide is fused with sodium
 carbonate, three atoms of CO2 are liberated, and the normal or ortho
 vanadate, Na’ V* O° (corresponding to Na"P" O”), is formed; thirdly,
 the so-called monovanadates are monobasic salts, corresponding to
 the monobasic phosphates, and may be termed metavanadates, thus,
 Na VO" and Ba 2 VO", whilst the so-called bivanadates are anhydro
 salts.
     All the reactions by which Berzelius explained the facts he dis
  covered can equally well be represented according to the new atomic
  weight and constitution, thus:–

   The speaker stated that the foregoing facts clearly pointed out
that vanadium, hitherto standing in no definite relation to other ele
ments, must be regarded as a member of the well-known Trivalent
or Triad class of elementary substances, comprising nitrogen, phos
phorus, boron, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
   It is true that we are still but imperfectly acquainted with many
of the characters of vanadium; but the more its nature is studied, the
more points of family resemblance will be discovered, and the more
close will the ties be found which bind it to the great Triad family.

   After adducing evidence, both stratigraphical and palaeontological,
to prove that no portion of the Speeton clay is of Gault age, the
author showed that this great series of clays (probably over 1000
feet thick) belongs to no less than seven formations, viz. Upper,
Middle, and Lower Neocomian, Portlandian, and Upper, Middle,
and Lower Kimmeridge.       These formations, as displayed in Filey
Bay, were described in detail; lists of the fossils from each (drawn
up with the assistance of Mr. Etheridge) were given, and their
equivalents, both in this country and on the continent, pointed out;
and the author concluded his paper with appendices on the fossils
and the economic products of the Speeton clay.

   Referring first to the difficulties formerly experienced in attempt
ing to explain the origin of the Boulder-clays      and Northern drifts
more than   forty years  ago,  without the aid of  glaciers and icebergs,
the author expressed his belief that the lowest gravels, resting on
the chalk at Hessle, are of Praeglacial date. He stated his opinion
that there is no evidence of the beds in question being marine;
while the abundance of mammalian remains offers a strong pre
sumption against this interpretation.       Beds of this order, composed
of chalk and flint   fragments,   not  only are unknown to occur in the
midst of the Boulder-clay, but can hardly be imagined to exist there.
Further, the Boulder-clay rests on them without conformity.          Pro
fessor Phillips also observed that if the Hessle clay be the upper
part of the great Holderness deposit, and not met with beyond the
outcrop of the chalk, it must be designated a third Boulder-clay; and
he concluded his paper by a detailed description of his original ob
servations of the Hessle cliff more than forty years ago.
 February 5th, 1868.-Warington       W. Smyth, Esq.,    M.A., F.R.S.,
                        President, in the Chair.
  The following communication was read:—
   1. “On the Geological Structure of Argyllshire.” By His Grace
the Duke of Argyll, K.T., D.C.L., F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
   The object of the paper was to set forth some of the author's
reasons for not accepting the views propounded by Mr. Geikie in his
“Scenery of Scotland viewed in connexion with Physical Geology.’
His Grace believes that, although the atmospheric agencies of waste
have produced great modifications of the surface, the form of the
hills and valleys has in the main been determined by the action of
subterranean forces.
   In illustration of his opposition to Mr. Geikie's theory, he de
scribed a supposed case of the formation of a valley by atmospheric
agencies, observing that, if the crumplings of the strata have not
affected the present surface, a subsequent submergence and a fresh
unconformable deposition filling in       all
                                         the inequalities must have
ensued, and that these new deposits must have been again raised

316                             Geological          Society:—
along different lines of elevation.   Taking this new deposit to be
the Old Red Sandstone, the author asks how it was removed, and
points out difficulties in the way of supposing the removal to have
been either by submergence or by subaerial agencies.
   His Grace then stated that Mr. Geikie admits that the agencies
of erosion have been guided in their work by the prevailing strike
of the strata, which strike is followed along the same line by the
larger faults, and by the anticlinal and synclinal axes, at least as
regards the general trend.     He then pointed out that in reality all
the great physical features of Scotland take the same N.E. and
S.W. direction. He therefore considered that Mr. Geikie had
understated the case of the coincidence of certain physical fea
tures, and had entirely omitted          mention    allothers, such      of
                                                                        the                    as
appearances              of
                  subsidence and dislocation              observed   to the   be               in
Western Islands, and the relations existing between dislocated sedi
mentary strata and apparently intrusive rocks.
     Insupporting his argument by special facts the Duke             Argyll               of
endeavoured              to
                   show that the whole       valley-system      Argyllshire        of
may       be
         accounted for either             by
                                   faults, foldings, subsidences,      anti                or
clinals, mentioning       particular that Loch Tyne occupies the bed
                               in
of    anenormous fault, that Loch Awe lies along the line             great              of
                                                                                         a
subsidence       the metamorphic
                     of              slates,  and that the    gorge      the                   of
Brander Pass lies along the line          great fracture connected with
                                                    ofa
the subterranean movements which brought up the granites                Ben                    of
Cruachan, with many other instances              like nature,  ofdiscussing
                                                                 a                  in
which      he
           especially demurred       Mr. Geikie's theory that the trans
                                              to
verse valleys and gorges have been formed by two streams, each
working backwards towards                     its
                                     own source, until the ridge which
divided them was finally destroyed.
   His Grace also remarked that the mineral condition of the
granites        at
             the time               of
                            the subterranean movements was such                                     as
would facilitate    the transmission       earthquake-waves, and the
                                                          of
condition of the slates was such as necessitated fracture when
those waves were propagated beneath them.
   In conclusion the author contested Mr. Geikie's statement of the
symmetry       river-valleys and uniformity
                    of                           mountain-heights, and
                                                                    of

advocates of subaérial denudation.

     1.                   on
                the formation                  of
                                 the Parallel Roads                                of   Glen Roy.”

  Accepting the theory that these roads were formed       the margin               on

      a                                        which this formation  in
took place, objecting                                      its
                                        having occurred through the

    Mr. Babbage expressed his opinion that the material        which                      of

       Mr. C. Babbage      on the Parallel Roads   of Glen Roy.      317
the roads    are formed was brought down by snow and ice slowly
descending the hills until arrested on the margin of the frozen lake.
On the melting of the snow and ice, it was tranquilly deposited
without any further descent, and thus lay in a horizontal line.
    In conclusion the author adverted to the theory of the change of
isothermal surfaces within the earth, an account of which he had
published in the Society’s “Proceedings’ for 1834, as affording the
necessary explanation of the causes which had produced the changes
of climate in the district of the Parallel Roads.
    2. “On the origin of smoothed, rounded, and hollowed surfaces
of Limestone and Granite.” By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author argued that smoothed surfaces are produced by the
action of water charged with sediment and stones, and that “hol
lowed surfaces” are the result of coast-ice containing stones fol
lowing the course of the advancing and retreating tide.
    3. “On a striking instance of apparent oblique lamination in
Granite.” By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
    Lines of stratification and lamination were stated by the author
to be discernible in the granite rocks of Hountor, of the Kestor
group, and of the Blackstone rock; and he added that they support
the idea of the aqueous origin of granite.
    4. “On the Encroachment of the Sea in the Bristol Channel.”
By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
    Mr. Mackintosh       has obtained   information   showing that at
Watchet, where the cliffs average 50        feet in height,  the sea has
gained at least 200 yards during the last 150 years.             He also
showed that at Weston-super-Mare the sea is converting the slopes
into cliffs, and he concluded with a notice of the caves and raised
beaches near that town.
    5. “On   the two Plains of Hertfordshire and their Gravels.”      By
T. M.K.    Hughes, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    The high ground near Hertford Heath, Brickenden, &c. forms
the higher of the two plains which Mr. Hughes described; out of it
a great valley has been excavated, the bottom of which forms the
lower plain; and out of this, again, the valleys of the existing streams
have been scooped.
    The gravels of the upper plain are a marine deposit, and indicate
a marine denudation of great antiquity, followed by an emergence,
during which the old valleys were scooped out of that plain. The
gravels of these valley-plains were formed during a subsequent sub
 mergence;      they contain bands of clay and loam passing into
 Boulder-clay, and are probably marine. This submergence con
 tinued until the Boulder-clay was deposited on the top of the higher
 plain gravels; and then succeeded a period of emergence, during
 which the present valleys were scooped out of the lower plain.

            ON   THE DURATION OF INDUCTION-CURRENTS.
                          BY P. BLASERNA.
                                                                         generally
IN allowed—
   the theory          of induction-currents    it has hitherto   been
     (1) That they are formed at the very instant the primary circuit
is closed or opened.
   (2) That their duration is infinitely small.
     I
    endeavoured to verify these two points experimentally by means
ofa rotating apparatus, the construction of which is like that which
M. Guillemin used in his researches on the propagation of the cur
rent of the battery, and also like that which M. Hipp used in his
experiments on the velocity of induction-currents in the- great tele
graphic lines.
   Two wooden cylinders, A and B, 8 centims. in diameter and 1 cen
tim. in length, were fixed on the same axis, which could be rotated
with a velocity of from 20 to 150 turns in a second. On the circum
ference of the cylinder A a brass plate was let in which occupied
about half the circumference (almost 180°); on that of the cylinder B
there was also a very thin brass plate which represented a degree of
the circumference.    To vary the conditions, I had several spare cy
linders with larger and smaller plates. To each cylinder there was
firmly fixed a cylinder (a, b) of much smaller diameter, made of box
wood and entirely covered with brass. Thus the whole apparatus
consisted of the small cylinder a. of the cylinders A and B, and of the
small cylinder b arranged on the same axis, and with a good metaliic
contact between a and A, and between B and b. Four metal springs
rested against these four cylinders to break or make contact. They
were pressed by paper cushions, which stopped the vibrations.
   The primary current, furnished by several Bunsen's elements,
passed by a commutator, by the thick wire of a small induction-coil
(without a contact-breaker), through a tangent-compass, by the
springs of the cylinders a and A, and returned to the pile.       It was
thus opened or closed according as the spring A rested on the wooden
cylinder or on the brass plate. The induction-current was then
formed in the coil, passed by the springs B and b, then through a
very sensitive galvanometer, and then back to the coil.          It was
measured on the galvanometer.       By varying the velocity of rotation,
and giving to the plate in B any position whatever behind that of A,
the mode of formation of induction-currents could be studied.
     I
     will mention the principal results I have obtained, intending
meanwhile to continue my researches with a much more perfect forin
of apparatus, which        I
                       am now constructing.
   (1) The moment the primary current is opened or closed, an                 in
duction-current is formed. The time which elapses between the
closing or opening of the principal current and the moment at which
                                                          I
the induced current is produced is so small that have not been able
to determine     it.    In
                      any case       less than grºup
                                     it  is                   of
                                                           second.a

     (2) But at this moment the induced current is not terminated;
it   still increases, then diminishes pretty rapidly, and continues for a
certain time, becoming very weak.
    (3) The total duration of the induced current is always appreciable.
                           I
In some cases have observed a feeble current as much as gºt of a
second after the primary current was closed; and it is probable that it
lasts even longer.
    If we wish to represent graphically the induced current, taking
the times for abscissae and the corresponding intensities for ordinates,
we have a curve formed, for times less than stºrm of a second, of a
 straight line almost perpendicular to the axis of the abscissae, which
 curves while still ascending, soon attains a maximum, then rapidly
 descends, and, after bending indefinitely, approaches the axis of the
 abscissae without                  its
                       being possible       exactly the point     which

it  becomes merged       this axis.  in any case this point corresponds

count for the fact that certain liquids give currents in which the
wire surrounded by a luminous sheath becomes negative, or rather
that they transmit simultaneously, but in unequal proportions, the
two systems of inverse induced currents, it is necessary that the
conducting-powers and the effects which take place at the passage
of the current through the electrodes and the gaseous matter change
with the nature of the gaseous matter. M. Bouchotte has observed
that the light produced when the currents pass thus between a fine
platinum or iron wire was more or less brisk; with chloride of mag
sium, more especially, the light is very brilliant, and indicates a polar
decomposition of the salt, as well as the presence of this compound
in the spark.
    The same luminous effects may be observed with an ordinary                                     in
duction-coil when a rapid succession of sparks are made to strike
between a positive platinum wire and a liquid containing an easily
decomposable salt, like chloride of sodium, of potassium, calcium,
strontium, copper; and then the sparks are coloured so as to ex
hibit the characteristic shades observed with saline substances vola
tilized in flames.    This effect is so definite that, by arranging small
tubes of 10 to 15 millims. in diameter containing various aqueous
saline solutions, and producing, by means of an induction-coil, a very
rapid succession of sparks which form a kind of arc between the
point of the platinum wire (which is suitably insulated from the glass
tube) and the surface of the liquid, we may, by means of a spectro
scope, observe the nature of the substances dissolved.
    To make the experiment with facility, a tube closed at the bot

    ON   THE WOODWARDITE OF CORNWALL.                                   BY M. F. PISANI.
  Among the new minerals recently discovered                                in   Cornwall, Mr.
Church   *   has described        a   substance which he calls Woodwardite.                        It
                                                                       iv.

waxy surface, and about 5 to 8 millims. in diameter. Its composi

   According to the formula assigned by Mr. Church to this sub
stance,  it is a sulphate of copper associated with a hydrate of the
same base along with a hydrate of alumina.
    Having this year received from Mr. Talling, to whose researches
we owe the discovery of several interesting minerals in Cornwall,
a substance found under the same conditions of deposit as Wood
wardite, and strongly resembling it in aspect and texture, though of
a brighter green colour, I thought it interesting to make a compara
tive study of this mineral with that described by Mr. Church.
   The qualitative test gave, besides the elements of Woodwardite, a
quantity of silica sufficiently great to produce a jelly with concen
trated hydrochloric acid; but the colour of the solution shows that
it contains   much less copper.
    I thought thence that Woodwardite was not a well-defined mine
ral, but merely a mixture in varying proportions of a subsulphate of
copper with a hydrate of alumina.                         Yet on examining for silica, I
found it in a      quantity      too small to constitute a silicate with alu
Inlina.
    An analysis of Woodwardite gave me the following numbers:–
                                                                 Oxygen.     Ratio.

             Silica .    . . . . . . . . . e e           1.2
             Water.
    The ratio of the sulphuric acid and the oxide of copper are as
3: 4.    This is the same as that I gave for Langite.
    The following is the result of the analysis of the new mineral re
 sembling Woodwardite:—
                                                                 Oxygen.     Ratio.

                                                   101 °3
    It will be   seen from this analysis that the quantity of alumina
does not    correspond      to that found in Woodwardite, while the quan

 tities of sulphuric acid and of oxide of copper are proportionally
 the same ; we may thus consider the new mineral a mixture of
 Langite (4CuO, SO"+4HO) with a very basic silicate of alumina
 analogous to Scarbroite or to Schrötterite (varieties of allophane), or
with a hydrate of alumina mixed with a silicate of the genus allo
phane or Halloysite.        Woodwardite is to be considered an analo
gous mixture, in which there is a hydrate of alumina with a little
silica in the place of a very basic allophane.
    The Langite found in Cornwall as killas must then, under certain
circumstances, have been deposited along with a hydrate of alumina
or a very basic silicate to form those mixtures of a variable colour
which constitute Woodwardite and the mineral which resembles it.
    It must be concluded from these facts that Woodwardite can in
no way constitute a new species; and just as we frequently see in
various localities allophanes coloured by more or less oxide of cop
per, there are also in Cornwall allophanes or hydrates of alumina
mixed with Langite, as is the case with the two minerals I have exa
mined. Moreover, the quantity of silica in the allophanes being very
variable (10 to 24 per cent.), nothing militates against the supposi
tion that the varieties poor in silica contain a mixture of hydrate of
alumina, which predominates in Woodwardite, the allophane of which
would have a minimum of silica, completing thus the analogy of
the two minerals which form the subject of this note.—Comptes

   DIALYSIS   OF INDUTION     CURRENTS.       NOTE BY M. BOUCHOTTE.
    We have already” called attention to the remarkable fact that the
introduction of a voltameter, containing acidulated water, into the
circuit of a magneto-electrical machine gives rise to very marked
phenomena of polarization; that to obtain this result it is suffi
cient to use as electrodes platinum wire sufficiently fine; that
one electrode, being immersed to a depth of from 7 to 8 millimetres
in the liquid, the other being completely submerged, becomes sur
rounded by a luminous sheath, and acquires positive electricity.
    To regulate more easily the contact of the platinum wire and
the liquid, the electrode may be introduced into a glass tube, in
which it is made to slide, the metal outside the tube being alone
exposed to the electric action.      By this arrangement, all the parts
of the voltameter     may be tested; and it can be shown that the effects
of the polarization of the current are independent of the position
of the electrodes.                             -     - -
     Continuing these researches, the following results have been
obtained:—                                        - -
     1. When a second gas-voltameter is brought into the circuit, it
 yields hydrogen and oxygen gases in the proportion of 2 to 1,–

                Intelligence  and Miscellaneous  Articles.          323
showing thus that the electrolytic decomposition which takes place
is under the conditions which characterize the ordinary voltaic pile,
or a magneto-electrical machine with adjusted currents.
   In a sulphate-of-copper voltameter, metal is dissolved at one pole,
while copper is deposited electro-chemically at the other.
   2. In the dialyzing voltameter, acidulated water is not essen
tial for the production of the phenomena. Most salts we have
used modify the normal action of alternating currents; but all of
them po sess the property of rectifying the extra currents of one
SerleS.
   The   use  of a solution of chloride of magnesium gives rise to a
light of the greatest beauty. The electrode, which is immersed to
a depth of a few millimetres, immediately becomes covered with
metallic   magnesium, which      is at once burned with the produc
tion of a   bright light.   In this experiment, the platinum wire may
be   replaced  by  one of iron, which then itself burns slowly,      in
creasing the power of the light; in spite of that, if the iron is placed
gradually in the liquid, its combustion is slow enough to obtain a
very constant luminous effect.
   After having studied these special properties of induction-currents
by the aid of a magneto-electrical machine having high tension, it
was necessary to ascertain if the same phenomena could be pro
duced by the aid of a source of electricity having smaller electro
motive force.      With this view we used a Nollet's machine with
eight coils, like the preceding, but surrounded by a wire having
but a small resistance.      This machine has an electromotive force
equal to 22 elements of sulphate of copper.
    When the dialyzing voltameter contained acidulated water, the
absorption of one series was also affected.      But we have obtained
effects of quantity far more intense by using as the liquid a solu
tion of bichloride of mercury in salt water. In this case more of
the wire which acquires positive electricity may be immersed in the
liquid; the resistance is thereby diminished.
   At the commencement of the experiment protochloride of mer
cury is formed, which soon after dissolves under the influence of
the liberated chlorine.      From this moment the mercury is seen
to form round about the electrode, and separates when a pretty
large globule is formed, while the current acquires an intensity
the measurement of which will be afterwards given. The liquid
 of the voltameter acquires a higher temperature urder the action
of the currents. If the position of the electrode be not properly
 regulated, a moment is reached at which the two currents retain
 their normal properties, and then the needle of the galvanometer
is no longer deflected; but by suitably arranging the position of
 the electrode in the voltameter, it may easily be retained in a liquid
 medium at a convenient temperature.
   Adopting this method, and causing the system to act upon a
 bath of sulphate of copper, we succeeded in obtaining from 7 to 8
 grammes of electrolytically deposited copper in an hour.

324                     Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   The passage of the currents in a Ruhmkorff's coil deserves
special attention.
   The contact-breaker being suppressed, Nollet's apparatus pro
duces in the induced wire effects of tension which are so weak
that a spark of 3 millimetre in length is with difficulty obtained.
But on introducing into the circuit the dialyzing voltameter, the
aspect of the experiment is changed. A spark, several centimetres
in length, is obtained; the induced current passes in M. E. Bec
querel's tubes, as well as in those of Geissler, so long as one set
of currents retains an action which is independent of the other
series.  The poles in the tubes are well marked. But if the                                                           con

the elementary laws are more simple than those which regulate
the distribution of electricity upon conducting bodies; yet                                      its

this principle has been already demonstrated experimentally

       When both poles are connected to insulated conductors, then
    two or more resistances exist in the circuit; and as in the con

     (i.e. the “magnitude,” “intensity,” or “quantity” of the current)
    is inversely proportional to the sum of all the resistances in the cir

    mulated on any one surface of the resistances will be inversely pro
    portional to            of

resistance of the circuit, then, when the two sets are placed in
circuit, since the resistance of the whole circuit is doubled, the
quantity on each plate would be only 0.5; and if now the re
sistance of one set be increased by doubling the distance between
them, the quantity would be reduced to 0.33.
    By the same means the quantity that would be accumulated
on a series of several pairs of equal plates joined “in cascade”
may be found, and compared with the quantity that would be ac
cumulated on a single pair; and it will be seen that, as the resist
ance of m sets of plates will be m times as great as that of one,
the quantity accumulated on each set of plates will be m times
smaller than that which it would be with one set of plates.    But
as there are m sets of   plates thus  charged,   the total quantity
generated and accumulated is the same as if one set of plates
only were employed.      This agrees with the result of Green’s                                                 in
vestigation of the same problem, and is thus enunciated by
Green –“The total quantity of electricity contained in the                                                      in
terior of any number of equal and similar jars”, when one of
them communicates with the prime conductor, and the others
are charged by cascade, is precisely equal to that which one only
would receive if placed in communication with the same con
ductor,    its
             exterior surface being connected with the common
                        say,  connexion through the surrounding

332          Mr. F. C. Webb   on “Inductive Circuits,” or the
the prime conductor. The reason of this is easily seen when we
consider the problem by means of the theory of inductive circuits.
The resistance of the circuit is now increased by the resistance of
the dielectric separating the rubber from surrounding objects; and
as the rubber has little surface compared to that of the prime
conductor, this resistance is much greater than that existing be
tween the surface of the prime conductor and the surrounding
objects, so that the resistance of the whole circuit is thus               in
creased considerably more than double, the exact amount of
the increase depending, however, on the proportion of the rubber
to the prime conductor and the proximity of surrounding con
ductors to it.
   If  the rubber is connected to surrounding                objects, the only
resistance in the inductive circuit consists             of the dielectric
separating the surface of the prime conductor from the sur
rounding conductors.   The quantity generated is therefore much
greater than when the total resistance included that between
the rubber and surrounding objects.   The total quantity of posi
tive generated is accumulated on the prime  conductor, and the
equal quantity of negative passes to surrounding objects, and
there remains until neutralized by recombination with the posi
tive on the conductor.
   In the same way, if we connect the rubber to the interior of
a Leyden jar, and the prime conductor to the interior of another
jar of equal size, the exterior of both jars being in connexion,
we shall be able to accumulate in each about half the quantity
that would be accumulated in a single jar with the rubber con
nected to the exterior coating.       The resistance between the
prime conductor and surrounding objects and that between the
rubber and surrounding objects form here two branch resistances,
and these, being unequal, cause a slight inequality in the jars;
that jar connected to the prime conductor will therefore contain
a little less than the jar attached to the rubber.
   With a voltaic battery and two or more variable lengths of
submarine cable the laws of inductive circuits are best seen.
Thus,   if a
           battery has one pole insulated and the other pole con
nected to a long length of cable, say a hundred miles, having               its
distant end insulated,        no
                             charge     the cable will take place.

The resistances here consist        of
                                 the envelope           of
                                                 the cable and              of
the resistance separating the insulated terminal from surround
ing objects.     This resistance      practically infinite; and hence
                                     is

                                         is

Q=     #, ; and           when the two lengths are equal, the quantity                         in
each   will be half that which would be accumulated in one, if the
other pole were connected to earth.
   In the charging of a series of Leyden jars arranged in cascade
(fig. 8), with the last jar connected to earth, the reason that the
accumulation in each jar is not quite equal, but is less in each jar
nearest the earth connexion than in the preceding one, is easily
seen by considering the problem as one of branch circuits. The
first jar in a cascade of two jars is a resistance common to both

branches; and the branches consist, first, of the dielectric inter
vening between the outer armature of the first jar and the sur
rounding conductors, and, secondly, of the glass of the second jar.
   The quantity in the first jar must be equal to the quantity on
the outside of the outer coating of the same jar (or what is
sometimes termed the “free electricity”) added to the quantity
in the second jar, just in the same way that the current in any
part of a conductive circuit (containing a branch) must, before
bifurcation, be equal to the sum of the currents in the two
branches after bifurcation.          The quantity in the second jar will
be therefore less than that in the first by exactly this quantity
of “free electricity” on the outside of the first jar. And as this
quantity can be increased by lessening the resistance of this
branch of the circuit,              as,

of a microscopic opening, F.

protect the end of the tube E from dust.
It is separated from E by fragments of
linen.
   The only point requiring particular
attention is the formation of the capil
lary opening F. This opening is best
made by blowing a little bulb at the end
of the tube, bursting a little hole in this
before the blowpipe, and allowing the
 whole to collapse while the air is conti
nually injected.       Several such tubes
 should be prepared.      It is not difficult

of D, to fall in less than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.

    On connecting H and with the poles of a battery, the water
in C is decomposed; the detonating gas can only escape by the
opening F.        The hindrance it meets with on account of the
small size of F causes it to force the mercury up D. The effect
of the rise of the mercury in D is twofold; it forces more gas
through F, at the same time that it lays bare a part of the elec
trodes, leaving the active portions of them further apart. The
quantity of gas produced is accordingly diminished. In other
words, an increase in the strength of the current produces effects
which diminish the strength of the current. The instrument is
a regulator, which may be compared with the governor of a steam
engine.
    It is found that the mercury rises to a certain height in D,
and remains nearly at that height for many hours. Since a cer
tain height of the mercury in D corresponds to a certain pres
sure in the interior, and since the latter corresponds to a certain
rate of delivery through F, it follows that the quantity of elec
tricity passing through the instrument is directly measured by
the height of the mercury. The actual relation between the
height of the mercury and the electricity which passes may, of
course, be measured either by interposing a galvanometer            or
actually measuring the quantity of gas evolved by fitting a gas
delivery tube over F, &c.
    Nevertheless an exceeding gradual depression in D must occur
even with a perfectly constant current, on account of the removal
of a portion of the liquid C by electrolysis.       For many purposes
this is negligible, namely when the instrument is used as a vol
tastat.     It is clear that, as a certain height in D corresponds to
a certain activity, the amount of water lost from C in a given
time is measured by the height in D.          Hence, on knowing the
relative diameters of D and A, and knowing the amount of water
decomposed in a given time, a simple calculation serves to make
the minute correction.

   The idea which immediately suggested itself was to try whether
a formula similar to the one usually employed for the coefficients
of expansion did not satisfy the experiments.       In order to try
the fitness of different curves corresponding to these values, some
of the observations for the sodium-line were taken, from which
four so-called standard values (Normalorte) were chosen.

By the help of these the values of the constants were approxi
mately reckoned.     It seemed possible to assume, without in any
way departing from the truth, that a formula suitable for the
index of refraction for D would be applicable as far as concerned
its form to the other two rays.   For a curve of the form

 a formula which agreed with the observations quite as accurately
 as the preceding one.       An isolated previous observation, how
 ever, made it appear probable that for water below 0° the refrac
 tive index again diminishes.       Bearing this in mind,     I imagined
that the formula had     a symmetrical form, and     I finally  tried
                            p-a-H    bi”--ct},

     This formula agrees so well with the observations and is so
 simple that   I determined to adopt it arbitrarily as the one ex
pressing the alteration in the refractive index, and according to
which the arrangement was to be attempted.
     Since in n-a+bt”--ct" for low temperatures c has only a
trifling influence, the indices for 0° were determined from obser
vations between 0° and 10° according to the formula n=a+bt”.
These values, moreover, are more correct than the other ones,
because, in the first place, the temperature of the liquid is only a
little different from that of the surrounding air, and therefore the
determinations of temperature are more correct, and, secondly,
because, in consequence of this, the refracted images of the lines
are much more sharp and distinct, whereby the error of adjust
ment is less.

molecules   which finally act upon a given aether molecule, a num
ber which must appear in the coefficients of the differential
equations of the motion, must lead to a relation between the
velocity of luminous propagation and the density of bodies.
The fundamental conception is certainly at present wanting con
cerning the method to be adopted.            But not only the possibility,
but also the necessity of a connexion appears from the nature
of the differential equations supported by the views we have
given. . It may be permitted here to return to a point already
touched upon. On page 265 we arrived at the surprising result
that the velocity of propagation of light in liquids and gases                                              in
creases universally with the increase of their temperature, while
with most solid bodies it diminishes. Such an opposite beha
viour may be explained by assuming that there occurs in aether,
on heating          it,   an
                       increase       density of     diminution   or a elasti                  of

explicable.     And although the hypothesis adopted for their ex
planation      is  present only brought forward
                     at                                     explain facts,     to                           it

 require any such definite connexion, must                 rejected       un   be                   as

                                                       most physicists, at

for Deville's experiments on the refractive indices of liquid mix
tures, and obtained perfectly concordant results.    Forthommef
also adopted the refractive power (brechende Kraft) as basis for
similar investigations.    Schrauf S published a very elaborate
criticism against  the constancy  of the quotient between the re
fractive power and density, for which he proposed a new relation,
which he strove to support by numerical values.       He proceeds
from   Cauchy’s  formula of  dispersion, and makes use of the first
approximation,

   Schrauf gives the derivation of another equation in some such
terms as the following||.
   The coefficient of dispersion depends, according to Cauchy,
upon     quadratic ; the dispersion can only be caused by disturb
          a
ances of a higher order; and so, as is shown by comparison of
the differences, we may rightly assume that the alteration in B
is a function both of the density and         alterations, and that    its

    Schrauf calls   M the “specific refractive power”         (speciftsches
Brechungsvermögen),       and he calls N the “specific          dispersive
power” (specifisches Dispersionsvermögen).
    Although Schrauf's views concerning the cause of dispersion
and the effect of the material molecules on light contain much
truth, and the consistent carrying out of his hypothesis must be
called very able, it is impossible to refrain from applying the
term obscure, if not confused, to the commencement of his work,
    In order to establish the constancy of the magnitude M and
N, he takes the experiments of Gladstone and Dale (1858), and
uses also whatever other materials are at his disposal, such as
the observations of Deville, Cahours, Handl and Weiss, De Roux,
 and others.

    It appeared that
                          D    was approximately constant,      but dimi
nished continually as the temperature increased.          The constancy
of B does not appear to me to be even approximately proved by
the numerical data.        Schrauf endeavoured to account for the
diminution of the     magnitude    M by assuming that the angle of
the prism had changed by increase of temperature—a supposi
tion which Gladstone and Dalek have rejected as totally un
founded.
    All the elegant subsequent deductions, founded upon the fun
damental assumption that M and N are independent of the
temperature, fall to the ground as soon as it is shown that these
magnitudes are not constant, but vary considerably with the
temperature.       We cannot, therefore, regard it proved in this
manner that the refractive power is constant, or a multiple of
the simplest factors of the series of natural numbers,

   Also the conclusions drawn in later treatises of Schrauf, “On
the Influence of the Chemical Conditions on the Velocity of
Propagation of Light”*, and also “On the Determination of the
Refractive Equivalents of the Elements”t, are rendered invalid
by the proof that neither M nor N are constants, but that M
only may be considered so in rather rough approximation.     Two
schemes, which are given on pages 357 and 359, give numerical
values for M and N for certain substances. The first of these
is taken, for the most part, out of the second treatise by Glad
stone and Dalef ; the second I have calculated from my own
observations                  for water.
      In        the treatise mentioned,                        Gladstone and Dale suppose there
to be another relation between                                 A    and D, namely     *p        = const.,

 ‘absolute refractive power’ is evidently not a constant,” and
prove their assertion by numbers.       For the calculation of A they
employed their own observations, while for the density they used
the numbers which Kopp gave in his “ Investigations on Specific
Gravity and Expansion by Heat, and on the Boiling-Point of
some Liquids”.S.     The employment for one and the same calcu
lation of constants derived from two different kinds of the same
liquid cannot be considered trustworthy, because the different
degree of chemical purity may give rise to considerable differ
ences.    At                  all
                  events, such great differences       density     are               in            as

  almost chemically pure.                   Moreover Kremers’k and Matthiessent
  have proved that small mixtures of salts do not appreciably alter
  the constants of expansion of water.
  .    In my experiments                I   used distilled water out of Professor
  Kolbe's chemical laboratory, and                       I distilled it frequently myself
  with     every     care.       For    every       separate    determination, moreover,
  the absorbed air was expelled by continual boiling.
       We may here introduce a scheme showing some numerical
  values for the relation given between the velocity of propagation
  of light and the density.

distinctly from the second Table, even if the observations above
60° are not taken into account, since small errors in the index of
refraction exercise a great influence upon the value of B.
   The hitherto advanced empirical relations therefore cannot be
maintained, and the so-called “specific refractive force ’’ (speci
fische brechende Kraft) changes with the temperature,
   I  consider it unnecessary to endeavour to introduce new rela
 tions between the velocity of the propagation of light and the
 density of bodies, since mathematical investigations will certainly
 soon give the desired solution, and then it will merely remain to
 compare the theory with experiment.
    The proof that Schrauf's “specific force” M (specifische Kraft)
 and his “specific dispersion power” N (specifisches Dispersions
 vermögen), which has been given by the adduced numbers, are
 not constants, overthrows             all

   The quantity of the alternating current is determined by A;
and the value of a only affects the epoch of maximum current.
If we make p-0, the effect is that of closing the circuit of a,

This expression shows that the condenser has no effect when the
current is closed.
   If we  make    p-to,   the effect is that of removing the    con
ductor y, and thus breaking the circuit.      In this case

This expression gives a greater value of A than when the circuit
is         provided 2CLn” is greater than unity, which may be
ensured by increasing the capacity of the condenser, the self
induction of the electromagnetic coil, or the velocity of rotation.
   If CLn”=1, the expression is reduced to
                                    Mn

                                    R.
This is the greatest effect which can be produced with a given
velocity, .#   is the same as if the current in the coil had no
“electromagnetic momentum.”
   If the electromagnet   has a secondary coil outside the primary
coil so as to form an ordinary induction-coil, the intensity of the
secondary current will depend essentially on that of the primary
which has just been found. Although the reaction of the se
condary current on the primary coil will introduce a greater
complication in the mathematical expressions, the remarkable
phenomenon described by Mr. Grove does not require us to enter
into this calculation, as the secondary sparks observed by him
are a mere indication of what takes place in the primary coil.

very nearly the same as those which were afterwards obtained
by Leverrier.
   Before the beginning of the present century the effects which
the excentricity of the earth’s orbit may have on climate were
discussed.   But about thirty-five years ago the question as to
how far a change in the amount of excentricity might affect the
climate of our globe was considered by Sir John Herschel; and
his results were published in the Transactions of the Geological
Society of London, vol.                    iii.

that the climate       our globe could not

the glacial epoch, could not, from the nature of things, have

        Date of the Glacial and the Upper Miocene Period.                        367
glacial epoch, a conclusion which we know from geological evi
dence is incorrect.   Influenced by these considerations, I ex
pressed the opinion that it might yet turn out that between
240,000 and 80,000 years ago was the period of the glacial
epoch, and that that epoch of glaciation about 850,000 years
ago might be that of the Upper Miocene period.
   There are physical reasons of great weight against the opinion
that the glacial epoch was so remote as 850,000 years ago. If
 we place the middle of the glacial epoch 850,000 years back, then
we must lengthen out to a corresponding extent the entire geo
logical history of our globe. Sir Charles Lyell considers that
when we go back as far as the Lower Miocene formations, we
arrive at a period when the marine shells differed as a whole
from those now existing.        But only 5 per cent. of the shells ex
isting at the commencement of the glacial epoch have since died
out.     Hence, assuming the rate at which the species change to
be   uniform,  it follows that the Lower Miocene period must be
twenty times as remote as the commencement of the glacial
epoch.     Consequently, if it be 1 million of years since the com
mencement of the glacial epoch, 20 millions of years, Sir Charles
concludes, must have elapsed since the time of the Lower Mio
cene period, and 60 millions of years since the begininng of the
Eocene period, and about 160 millions of years since the Carboni
ferous period, and about 240 millions of years must be the time
which has elapsed since the beginning of the Cambrian period.
But, on the other hand, if we refer the glacial epoch to the later
period of great excentricity, and take 250,000 years ago as the
 beginning of that period, then, according to the same mode of
calculation, we have 15 millions of years since the beginning of
the Eocene period, and 40 millions of years since the Carbonife
rous period, and 60 millions of years in              all
                                                   since the beginning
 of the Cambrian    period.
    A  great many considerations seem        show that 850,000 years
                                                 to
cannot possibly have elapsed since the glacial epoch, and that                    we
must assign that epoch         the period commencing about 240,000
                               to
years ago and extending down            about 80,000 years ago.

                                     Sir Charles  Lyell  concludes,   that
the beginning        the Cambrian period will require

 sical nature which    proves  that    it
                                       isabsolutely  impossible that the
existing order      things,

368          Mr.    J.   Croll on Geological Time, and the probable
must be felt to be conclusive. It would be superfluous to state
them here; I shall, however, for reasons which will presently
appear, refer briefly to one of them, and the one which seems to
be the most conclusive of all, viz. the argument derived from the
limit to the age of the sun's heat.
   It is found that 83°4 foot-pounds of heat per second is inci
dent upon a square foot of the earth's surface exposed to the
perpendicular rays of the sun. The amount radiated from a
square foot of the sun's surface to that incident on a square foot
of the earth’s surface is as the square of the sun's distance to
the square of his radius, or as 46,400 to 1.           Consequently
3,869,000 foot-pounds of heat is radiated off every square foot
of the sun's surface per second—an amount equal to about 7000
horse-power. The total amount radiated from the whole surface
of the sun per annum amounts to 8340 x 10° foot-pounds. To
maintain the present rate of radiation, it would require the com
bustion of about 1500 lbs. of coal per hour on every square foot
of the sun’s surface; and were the sun composed of that mate
rial, it would be       consumed all    less than 5000 years.  inThe
opinion that the sun's heat       maintained     combustion cannot
                                                  is                                  by
 be entertained for    single moment.          pound     coal falling        A                      of
into the sun from                an a
                        infinite distance would produce          con                                         by   its
cussion more than 6000 times the amount           heat that would be                  of
generated          by    its   combustion.
   It   well known that the velocity with which body falling from
        is                                                                                 a

nebulous mass, filling the entire space presently occupied            the                              by

is quite conceivable that this nebulous mass might have been
possessed of an original store of heat previous to condensation.
It is quite possible that the very reason why it existed in such
a rarefied or gaseous condition was     excessive temperature, and        its
that condensation    only began      take place     the mass began  to                         as

particles to each other. There would be the pressure of the whole
mass towards the centre of convergence. In the case of air, and
all perfect gases cooling under pressure, about 234 foot-pounds
of the original heat possessed  by the gas is given out while 95
foot-pounds is generated by condensation.    We have, however,
no reason whatever to believe that in the case of the cooling of
the sun the same proportions would hold true. The propor
tion of original heat possessed by the mass of the sun to that
produced by condensation may have been much greater than
234 to 95, or it may have been much less. In the absence of
 all knowledge on this point, we may in the meantime assume
that to be the proportion. The total quantity of heat given out
 by the sun resulting from the condensation of his mass, on the
 supposition that the density of the sum is uniform throughout,
 we have seen to be equal to 20,237,500 years’ sun-heat.   Then
the quantity of heat given out, which previously existed in the
mass as original temperature, must have been 49,850,000 years'
heat.     In all, 70,087,500 years’ heat as the total amount.
   The above quantity represents, of course, the total amount of
heat given out by the mass since it began to condense.                      But

amount of heat as would thus be generated; and when they
condensed on cooling, they would form one spherical mass
like the sun. It is perfectly true that two such bodies could
never attain the required amount of velocity by their mutual
gravitation towards each other.     But there is no necessity
whatever for supposing that their velocities were derived from
their mutual attraction alone. They might have been approach
ing towards each other with the required velocity wholly inde
pendent of gravitation.
   We know nothing whatever regarding the absolute motion of
bodies in space.   And beyond the limited sphere of our obser
vation, we know nothing regarding even their relative motions.
There may be bodies moving in relation to our system with                                             in
conceivable velocity.  For anything that we know to the con
trary, were one of these bodies to strike our earth, the shock
might be sufficient to generate an amount of heat that would dis
sipate the earth into vapour, though the striking body might not
be heavier than a cannon-ball.     There                      is,

376        Mr.    J.   Croll     on Geological             Time, and the probable
Stratified formations 10,000 feet in thickness, for example,
may, under some conditions, have been formed in as many
years, while under other conditions it may have required as
many centuries.      Nothing whatever can be safely inferred as to
the absolute length of a period from the thickness of the stra
tified formations belonging to that period. Neither will this
method give us a trustworthy estimate of the relative lengths of
geological periods.      Suppose we find the average thickness
of the Cambrian rocks to be 26,000 feet, the Silurian to be
28,000 feet, the Devonian to be 6000 feet, and the Tertiary to
be 10,000 feet, it would not be safe to assume, as is sometimes
done, that the relative duration of those periods must have cor
responded to these numbers.         Were we sure that we had got
the correct average thickness of                         all
                                         the rocks belonging         each                          to

relative lengths      those periods; but we can never

     is far
tance of periods  so remote as those which concern the geologist.
But even   supposing  the palaeontologist had a period of sufficient
length measured off correctly to begin with, his results would
still be unsatisfactory; for it is perfectly obvious, that unless
 the climatic conditions of the globe during the various periods
were nearly the same, the rate at which the species change
 would certainly not be uniform. But we have evidence, geolo
gical as well as cosmical, that the climate of our globe has at
various periods undergone changes of the most excessive cha
 racter.
   The palaeontological method, as we have already seen, will
give 60 millions of years or 240 millions of years as the period
that has elapsed since the commencement of the Cambrian pe
riod, just as we choose to adopt 250,000 years ago or 1,000,000
years ago as the commencement of the glacial epoch.
     It
      is the modern and philosophic doctrine of uniformity that
has chiefly led geologists to overestimate the length of geological
periods. This philosophic school teaches, and that truly, that
the great changes undergone by the earth’s crust must have been
produced not by great convulsions and cataclysms of nature,
but by those ordinary agencies that we see at work every day
around us, such as rain, snow, frost, ice, and chemical action,
&c. It teaches that the valleys were not produced by violent
dislocations, nor the hills by sudden upheavals, but that they
were actually carved out of the solid rock by the silent and
gentle agency of chemical action, frost, rain, ice, and running
water.    It teaches, in short, that the rocky face of our globe
has been carved into hill and dale, and ultimately worn down to
 the sea-level, by means of these apparently trifling agents, not
 only once or twice, but probably dozens of times over during
 past ages.    Now, when we reflect that with such extreme slow
 mess do these agents perform their work, that we might watch
 their operations from year to year, and from century to century,
 if we could, without being able to perceive that they make any
 very sensible advance, we are necessitated to conclude that

378          Mr.   J. Croll    on Geological         Time, and the probable
lions, hundreds of millions, thousands of millions, the mind is
then totally unable to follow, and we can only use these numbers
as representations of quantities that turn up in calculation. We
know, from the way in which they do turn up in our process of
 calculation, whether they are correct representations of things in
 actual nature or not; but we could not, from a mere comparison
 of these quantities with the thing represented by them, say
 whether they were actually too small or too great.      It is here
 that some geologists have erred: they have not made the neces
 sary calculations, and found by the known rules of arithmetic
 that 100,000,000 is too small a number to represent in years
 the probable age of the earth’s crust; but they look first at the
 phenomena and then at the figures; and as the two produce
 totally different impressions, they pronounce the figures to be
 too small to represent the phenomena.
   If  the geologist could find a method of ascertaining the actual
 rate at which these denuding agents do perform their work; if it
 could be ascertained at what rate the face of the country is at
 present being denuded, how much, for example, per annum the
 general level of the country is being lowered and the valleys
 deepened, then we should have a means of ascertaining whether
 or not the agents to which we refer were really capable of pro
 ducing the required amount of change in the earth's surface in
 the allotted time.   But mere conjectures in the absence of some
 positive determinations are worse than useless.
    But happily there is a method of ascertaining, with the most
 perfect accuracy, the rate at which the face of the globe is being
denuded by subaérial agency.        And it is somewhat remarkable
that this method has been so long overlooked by geologists.
                                  I
The method to which allude is that which has already been
incidentally referred to, viz. that of determining the amount of
solid materials which is being carried down annually by our
rivers into the sea. Were it ascertained (and this might be
easily done) how much sediment is being carried down by our
rivers into the sea, then we should be able to determine exactly
the extent to which the area of drainage of those rivers was
being lowered annually by subaerial denudation; for the mate
rial carried down by those rivers must            derived from the all    be
surface     the country drained
             of                        them. When    by   published             I

is quite possible that it may be more than neutralized by up

   The amount of sediment carried down into the Gulf of Mexico
by the Mississippi River has been estimated with the greatest
accuracy by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot.          It is found that
the average amount of sediment held in suspension in the
waters of the Mississippi is about rºro of the weight of the
water, or gro by bulk.       The annual discharge of the river is
19,500,000,000,000 cubic feet of water.          The quantity of
sediment carried down into the Gulf of Mexico amounts to
6,724,000,000 cubic feet. But besides that which is held in
suspension, the river pushes down into the sea about 750,000,000
cubic feet of earthy matter, making in     total    7,474,000,000 all

  There can be no doubt about the rate at which the American

382        Mr.   J.   Croll on Geological Time, and the probable
country since the creation of man, according to Mosaic chrono
logy, is certainly not a very great quantity. No person but one
who had some      preconceived   opinions to maintain would ever
think of concluding that one foot of soil during 6000 years was
an extravagant quantity to be washed off the face of the country
by rain and floods during that long period.       Those who re
side in the country and are eye-witnesses of the actual effects
of heavy rains upon the soil, our soft country roads, ditches,
burns, and rivers, will have considerable difficulty in actually
believing that only one foot has been washed away during the
past 6000 years.
   Some may probably admit that a foot of soil may be washed
off during a period so long as 6000 years, and may tell us that
what they deny is not that a foot of loose and soft soil, but a
foot of solid rock can be washed away during that period.  But
a moment’s reflexion must convince them that, unless the rocks
of the country were disintegrating and decomposing as rapidly
into soil as the rain is carrying the soil away, the surface of the
country would ultimately become bare rock. It is true that the
surface of our country in many places is protected by a thick
covering of boulder-clay; but when this has once been removed,
the rocks will then disintegrate far more rapidly than they are
doing at present.
   But slow as is the rate at which the country is being denuded,
yet when we take into consideration a period so enormous as 6
millions of years, we find that the results of denudation are really
startling.   One thousand feet of solid rock during that period
would be removed from off the face of the country.       But if the
mean level of the  country  would be lowered 1000 feet in 6 mil
lions of years, how much would our valleys and glens be deepened
during that period?     This is a problem well worthy of the con
sideration of those who treat with ridicule the idea that the ge
neral features of our country have been carved out by subaérial
agency.
  In consequence      of the retardation of the earth’s rotation, oc
casioned   by  the friction of the tidal-wave, the sea-level must be
slowly sinking at the equator and rising at the poles.          But it
is probable that the land at the equator is being lowered by
denudation as rapidly as the sea-level is sinking.         Nearly one
mile must have been worn off the equator during the past 12
millions of years, if the rate of denudation       all
                                                   along the equator
be  equal  to that     of

    my communication on the numerical relations of gravity
       magnetism t, after adducing various evidences of a cor
relation that had been long suspected,     endeavoured to obtain      I
approximate valuations for the constant factor K, which was in
troduced in the comparison of the tidal forces with the force of
equilibrium.    These approximations led me to “suggest the pro
priety of considering the element of density (or of   correlative,              its

value, or about stºry of the total force, it is but little greater
than Helmholtz found in the vibration-ratios for the first over
tone of a series of tuning-forks (5.8 to 6-6 times the funda
mental), while it is much less than the daily fluctuation in the
terrestrial magnetic force, which appears to be intimately con
nected with the joint action of atmospheric elasticity and solar
 differential tidal attraction.
     The coefficient of atmospheric specific gravity, 4, suggests the
 ratio of the length of a sonant acrial column to that of an equi
 valent sonorous wave, as well as the time of a complete oscillation
 of each magnetic pulse. During each vibration, from a maximum
 of condensation across the position of equilibrium to minimum,
 or vice versä, the effect produced by any constant force would be
 four times as great as during the half oscillation from either ex
 treme to the point of equilibrium.              The ratios of wave-velocity
 to elasticity and density, and of revolution to distance from the
 centre of motion, point to various experiments upon the relations
 of magnetic capacity to tenacity in iron, and of magnetizing
 power to specific gravity or to specific heat” in coils of different
 metals.      If   such experiments        should show any intimate con
 nexion between        elasticity and   specific  magnetism (a result which
 it does not seem unreasonable to anticipate), some of the mys
 tery in which an interesting physical fact is now shrouded will
 be happily dispelled.

        “On Governors.”        By  J.  Clerk Maxwell, M.A., F.R.S.S.L. & E.
 A  governor is a part of a machine by means of which the velocity of
 the machine is kept nearly uniform, notwithstanding variations in the
 driving-power or the resistance.
    Most governors depend on the centrifugal force of a piece con
 nected with a shaft of the machine.            When the velocity increases,
 this force increases, and either increases the pressure of the piece
 against a surface or moves the piece, and so acts on a break or a
 valve.
    * The specific heats of iron, cobalt, and nickel are nearly the same, being
 each about twenty-seven times that of hydrogen.        Recently discovered cos
 mical affinities of  hydrogen  and  iron, and the ratio between solar and ter
 restrial superficial gravitation, may perhaps sometime lead to the recogni
 tion of a significance in relations which would now be generally regarded
 as fanciful and accidental,

    In one class of regulators of machinery, which we may call modera
tors *, the resistance is increased by a quantity depending on the ve
locity. Thus in some pieces of clockwork the moderator consists of
a conical pendulum revolving within a circular case.                   When the ye
locity increases, the ball of the pendulum presses against the inside
of the case, and the friction checks the increase of velocity.
    In Watt's governor for steam-engines the arms open outwards, -
and so contract the aperture of the steam-valve.

limit of action of the governor. This takes place when the possible
part of one of the impossible roots becomes positive. The mathe
matical investigation of the motion may be rendered practically useful
by pointing out the remedy for these disturbances.
   This has been actually done in the case of a governor constructed
 by Mr. Fleeming Jenkin, with adjustments, by which the regulating
power of the governor could be altered.                By altering these adjust
ments the      regulation     could be made more and more rapid, till at last
a dancing motion of the governor, accompanied with a jerking motion
of the main shaft, showed that an alteration had taken place among
the impossible roots of the equation.
     I  shall consider three kinds of governors, corresponding to the
three kinds of moderators already referred to.
     In the first kind, the centrifugal piece has a constant distance
from the axis of motion, but                pressure       its

 place, the variable friction between the combination of levers and
 the ring on the shaft on which the force is made to act; and, in
 the second place, a centrifugal air-fan through which more or less
 air is allowed to pass, according to the position of the levers.
 Both these causes tend to regulate the velocity according to the
 same law.
    The governors designed by the Astronomer Royal on Mr. Siemens's
principle for the chronograph and equatorial of Greenwich Obser
 vatory depend on nearly similar conditions.              The centrifugal piece
is here a long comical pendulum, not far removed from the vertical,
 and it is prevented from deviating much from a fixed angle by the
driving-force being rendered nearly constant by means of a differential
system. The break of the pendulum consists of a fan which dips
into a liquid more or less, according to the angle of the pendulum
with the vertical. The break of the principal shaft is worked by the
differential apparatus; and the smoothness of motion of the principal
 shaft is ensured by connecting it with a fly-wheel.
    In the third kind of governor a liquid is pumped up and thrown out
over the sides of a revolving cup.           In the governor on this principle,

If the fluid is in open channels, the values of A and C will depend on
the depth to which the channels are filled at each point, and that of

If   M'=0, then the motions in        0 and 4 will be independent                        of each
other.      If M   is also 0, then we have the relation

and   if this

effect on the motion in q. The teeth of the differential system in
gear with the main shaft and the governor respectively will then

body, and this relation will be mutual.
   In such differential systems a constant force, H, sufficient to keep
the governor in a proper state of efficiency, is applied to the axis
m, and the motion of this axis is made to work a valve or a break on
the main shaft of the machine.         E in this case is merely the fric
tion about the axis of £.          If
                                 the moments of inertia of the differ
ent parts of the system are so arranged that M'=0, then the dis
turbance produced by a blow or a jerk on the machine will act in
stantaneously on the valve, but will not communicate any impulse to
                                                                       -

    “On the Structure of the Crag-beds of Norfolk and Suffolk,
 with some observations on their Organic remains.—Part I. Coral
 line Crag.” By Joseph Prestwich, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
    The history of the division of the several crag-deposits into three
 formations—the Mammaliferous, Red, and Coralline Crags—having
 been recounted, the author stated that for the last thirty years the
 evidence of their sequence had remained unaltered, the distinction
 between the Mammaliferous        and Red Crags being still purely
 palaeontological, not a single case of superposition having been dis
 covered.    Mr. Prestwich then proceeded to the special object of
 this paper, which was to describe more fully the physical structure
 of the several crags, and to determine, if possible, the exact relation
 which the Suffolk Crags bear to the Crag of Norfolk.
    Commencing with the Coralline Crag, the author stated that the
well-known outlier at Sutton furnishes a base-line and the best clue
 to  itsstructure and dimensions, showing also the depth       which        to               it
has been denuded and replaced               by
                                        the Red Crag.     The Coralline

 preparing the data necessary for verifying his theory that Father
 Sestini(in 1845)undertook           the Observatory at    the Collegio Romano          of

then reproduce the modified colours, and the effect would be im
perceptible.
    But the result is very different for rays produced by the combus
tion of various substances in a luminous body. A substance capable
of producing, for instance, the ray F, which corresponds to blue and
to a wave-length of 486.39 millionths of a millimetre, would change
its position in the spectrum, owing to the motion of the star; for
while the vibrating molecule which produces it would oscillate in
the length of time which is peculiar to it and invariable, the wave
itself would be lengthened or shortened by the transport of the ra
diant-point, and therefore would change its refrangibility; compa
ring it to the same substance radiating near the observer, a differ
 ence would be found in the place of the ray.               Thus, if the motion
 were such that it ought to increase the wave-length by 40-63 mil
 lionths of a millimetre, the ray F would pass into the place of the
 ray E in the spectrum, and the colour would be green. To produce
 a similar change, the star should have in moving away a velocity of
 31,000 kilometres in a second, and, in approaching, a velocity of
 about 16,000 kilometres.           As the earth only traverses about 30°4
 kilometres in the same time, the star should have in the first of the
 two cases a thousand times that velocity.
     But our present spectroscopic instruments enable us to measure
 much smaller intervals.           Let us suppose that the spectroscope is one
  which    sharply  divides the   ray  D(which is the case with those am now     I
  using), a difference in position equal to the magnitude of this double
  ray would doubtless be measurable. Now the two rays D' and D",
  according to M.Van der Willigen, are at a distance of 4 ten-millionths
  of a millimetre.      A displacement of this amount (taking the velocity
  of light   at 300,000     kilometres in a second) indicates that the star
                                                                           is,
  has a velocity of 304 kilometres in moving away—that                    velocity
                                                                           a
  ten times that of the earth.          Half as much would be sufficient                  if  it
  were approaching.
     These velocities are         by   no
                                        means enormous, but still they are far

it occupies the first place of a dark band after a beautiful band of
bright lines in the greenish blue. The stars hitherto examined be
long to Canis Major, to Orion, to Canis Minor, to Leo, to Triangu-
lum, to the Bear, to Auriga, to Cassiopeia.
   The conclusion at which we have attained, though negative, is of
great importance; for we have ascertained that among the stars ex
amined there is none whose proper motion is five or six times as great
as that of the earth in its orbit.        It is undoubtedly possible that we
may find similar motions for others; but to obtain precision in those
I have examined means are necessary which at present are not at
my disposal.

       To the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
   Perhaps some of your readers may have never noticed the produc
tion of the phenomenon of mirage by a source of heat other than
that of the sun. It was, however, very vividly shown under the fol
lowing circumstances.
  From the deck of a steamer         I   was watching      the rising moon,
when    it happened that the line of vision grazed the  heated funnel.
Instantly the light from the moon appeared reflected from the black
ened surface, in fact it was difficult to conceive that the effect was
not produced by a brilliant mirror.   The moon was distant from the
side of the chimney by an angle of about twenty minutes when thus
seen.   Attention once directed to the matter, the same phenomenon
was easily recognized by viewing other sources of light under the same
circumstances.   Thus were observed a distant lighthouse, the planet
Jupiter, and on a subsequent occasion the rising sun.
   The appearance is explained by the well-known theory of the ordi
nary mirage; the necessity of the heated surface in this case was
easily verified by noticing that the same phenomenon was not           pro
duced by the mast.

ON AN APPARATUS FOR PROVING THAT THE ELECTRIC SPARK
  DOES NOT PASS THROUGH AN ABSOLUTE WACUUM.  BY MM.
  ALVERGNIAT.
   The tubes for this experiment have two platinum wires at a dis
tance of 2 millims.      An almost absolute vacuum is produced in them
by means of the mercury air-pump which we have constructed.        Half
an hour is sufficient for this purpose. The tube is then heated to dull
redness, either by means of charcoal or by means of a furnace for
organic analysis.    The latter means renders it possible to raise the
heat slowly and gradually to redness without incurring the danger
of cracking the tube. When the tube begins to glow we continue
to exhaust, and allow the spark to pass until it ceases to do so. The
connexion of the tube with the lamp is then broken by sealing         it.
  In   a tube  soarranged, notwithstanding the slight distance between
both  platinum   points,  the passage   electricity completely stops.-

    Theory of Heat; a Lecture delivered before the Forty-first

        course to the present general meeting of the Association,
I have felt it incumbent upon me to choose as my theme, not
the result of any special investigation, but some subject of wide
application and general interest.              I
                                        will therefore take the liberty
of giving, as briefly and in as easily intelligible a form as possible,
an account of the theorem known as the Second Fundamental
Theorem of the Mechanical Theory of Heat, which forms one of
the two great principles whereon this whole theory is based.      It
is obvious that it is impossible for me upon the present occasion
to present this theorem in a mathematical form, or to give a
strict proof of    its
                   truth, and     follow out individually

 heat a connexion                       of such a kind that mechanical work can be ob
 tained by the expenditure                        of heat, and, conversely, heat can be
 produced  by the expenditure of work, there being under          cir                                              all

the amount       work. This principle, known

 ofthe rapid development   which the mechanical theory       heat has                                       of

        When work                  is

briefly expressed    saying that heat   by

that the quantities of heat and ergon which are mutually con
vertible, and which can therefore replace each other, are expressed
by the same numbers. Another convenience is that quantities
of heat and ergon can be added together or subtracted from one
another without any previous reduction having to be performed
upon either the one or the other.
   We will consequently in the following discussion always speak
of ergon instead of work, and will accordingly call the first fun
damental theorem the Theorem of the Equivalence of Heat and
Ergon.
   When once this theorem had been propounded and been con
firmed by experiment, it very quickly became generally known ;
and we may often find that people who have only a superficial
acquaintance with the mechanical theory of heat suppose that it
is the sole foundation of this theory. Such a view of it is indi
cated, for example, by the name which the mechanical theory of
heat often goes by in France, namely, la théorie de l'équivalent
mécanique de la chaleur.        There       however,is,   second theorem,

 believe, however, that when once the necessary mode                viewing         of
 the  subject  has become     familiar, the second fundamental theorem
 will appear just      simple and natural
                       as                         the first.   as
 I     will now  try       to

 are here concerned,        suchin  manner that the new kind

 quence, and that thus the second fundamental theorem may                                       be
 clearly seen    to   be

    If we    examine the conditions under which heat can be                               trans

   By help           of
                this conception the effect        heat can      simply ex  of                  be
pressed         by
             saying that heat tends        increase the disgregation

bodies.

                                                                                                                  or of
resistances must                in
two different kinds.                       In
                              the first place,      order partially             in
completely      destroy the connexion between the molecules, the
                      to
forces with which the molecules mutually attract each other must
 be overcome    and   ;  the second place, there are commonly,
                                     in                                                                          in
addition     these internal forces, other external forces which act
                to
upon the body from without. Thus, for example,              order that                         in
  body subject      external pressure may expand, this pressure,
                            an to
a

                                                     overcome.                     be                            Ac

perform internal and external ergon         overcoming the opposing  in
forces.         In
             the performance        this ergon, heat    used up; and
                                                       of                               is
thus the increase               of
                       disgregation involves conversion      heat into                          of
ergon.   Conversely,      order    diminish
                                      in     disgregation,
                                                      to   ergon  (and
in  general both internal and external ergon) must         expended;                           be

since the forces which     the former case were overcome

duced; and we consequently arrive         the result  that, when dis at
gregation    diminished, ergon
                 is               transformed into heat.  is
     For  reason which shall
           a                       discussed further on, we will as
                                                      be
sume   provisionally   that     the changes     all
                                                are considering take          we
place     in
         such    way that the inverse changes can take place under
                       a
exactly the same circumstances.       Such changes       these we will,                   as
for shortness,  call reversible changes.   This limitation being pre

               Theorem   of the Mechanical Theory   of Heat.        409
   supposed, we may say that the quantity of heat converted into
   ergon when disgregation is increased is exactly the same as the
  quantity of ergon converted into heat by the corresponding         di
  minution of disgregation.
     It will be evident, from what has been said, that between alte
  ration of disgregation on the one hand, and conversion of heat
  into ergon, or vice versá, on the other hand, there exists a causal
  connexion, which may be expressed in various ways in the form
  of a definite law. In order to be able to state this law as simply
  as possible, we will introduce one more special form of ex
  pression.
     The process by virtue of which ergon is produced at the ex
  pense of heat, or heat is generated at the expense of ergon, has
  been already spoken of as a transformation, heat being said to be
 transformed into ergon, or ergon into heat.       In like manner we
  may call an alteration of disgregation a transformation, the ori
  ginal arrangement of the smallest particles of the body being
 spoken    of as transformed into another arrangement.
     Each of these two kinds of transformation can take place in
 two opposite ways, which can be distinguished from each other
 by employing the terms positive and negative. We will regard
 an increase of disgregation as a positive, and a diminution of
 disgregation as a negative transformation. And, further, a trans
 formation of ergon into heat shall be reckoned as positive, and
 the transformation of heat into ergon as negative.
     Let us now return to the processes considered above; we
 then see that when the disgregation of a body is increased (a
 change which we have agreed to call a positive transformation),
 a transformation of heat into ergon (which we have agreed to
 call negative) occurs simultaneously; and in like manner a (ne
 gative) diminution of disgregation is accompanied by a (positive)
 transformation of ergon into heat.      Hence we may deduce, as a
 first conclusion, that in both cases a positive and a negative trans
formation take place at the same time.
     But, in considering transformations, it is needful to attend not
 only to their sign but also to their magnitude. The disgrega
 tion of a body may change to a greater or less extent; and in the
 same way a greater or less quantity of heat may be transformed
into ergon, or produced from ergon. Having proper regard to
these differences, we may represent the quantitative value of any
transformation, when the mode of measuring transformations has
been previously determined on, by a definite mathematical magni
tude, which we will call the equivalence-value of the transformation.
    The question now arises, in relation to these equivalence-values,
whether they are capable of being determined in such a manner
that, in the case of every reversible alteration of a body, the

410              Prof. R. Clausius on the Second Fundamental
simultaneously occurring positive and negative transformations
shall have the same absolute values.
   In order that the fulfilment of this condition may be possible,
regard must be had, in determining the equivalence-value         a                                                of
transformation of heat into ergon, or vice versd, to an element                                                           of
which no mention has hitherto been made. This will be most clearly
seen if we take, as an example, a perfect gas as the body through
whose changes the transformation in question is brought about.
   Let there be given a quantity of a perfect gas occupying some
definite volume. If this gas expands to some other volume (say
to twice         its
             original volume),     increase               an

which      completely determined
            is                          the original and final vo

              heat into ergon.                    internal ergon                   no
                     in of

    To get the equivalence-value of a transformation of heat into
 ergon, or vice versá, prefia to the quantity of heat a positive or
negative sign according as it is generated by ergon or is trans
formed into ergon, and divide by the corresponding absolute tem
perature.
      It
      is not needful to consider in detail in this place the way in
which the equivalence-value of a change of disgregation can be
completely determined; it is sufficient in relation to this point
to state a general theorem which contains what is really essential
to this determination, as well as the principal result of the inves
gations, so far as they relate to the question hitherto considered
by us. This theorem, in which, in relation to the equivalence
value of the transformation of heat into work, or vice versä, the
above rule has been taken as the standard, is as follows:—
   The disgregation of every body can be determined in such a man
ner that it is a magnitude depending solely upon the condition of
the body at any moment, and not upon the way by which it came
into this condition, and so as further to fulfil the condition that, for
every reversible alteration of a body, the alteration of disgregation
thereby occasioned and the simultaneous transformation of heat into
ergon, or vice versä, have equal and opposite equivalence-values, so
that their algebraic sum is zero.
   Two simultaneously occurring transformations, however, which
have opposite signs and equal absolute values, so that their alge
braic sum is nothing, may be said to compensate each other; and
consequently the above statement may be more shortly expressed
thus:—The two transformations which accompany any reversible
alteration of a body are mutually compensating.
   Hitherto we have directed our attention to two kinds of trans
formations exclusively; we have still, however, to consider trans
formations of a third kind.
    Let us again suppose the given body, whose condition is
changed, to be any body whatever; but                   nowlet  assumed
                                                                 it       be
that not merely         single alteration

                                                condition occurs, but                        a
 series    of
            alterations which are        arranged that the body finally
                                           so
returns         to   its
                  original   condition,  and thus passes through      cy             a

into ergon,          or
                   ergon into heat.
            us
                                                                                    of of
    Let      suppose that the alterations            in

body which constitute the cyclical process involve changes            vo
lume,      in
            such sort that the    body  expands     one temperature
                                                          at         and

412        Prof. R. Clausius on  the Second Fundamental
is compressed again at another temperature; then, if the expan
sion takes place at a higher temperature than the compression,
the ergon performed during the expansion will exceed the ergon
expended during the compression; and there is thus on the whole
a preponderance of ergon performed, and therefore naturally a
corresponding quantity of heat is expended.           If the cyclical
process is gone through the other way, so that the expan
sion occurs at a lower temperature than the compression, the
ergom expended in the compression exceeds that performed du
ring the expansion; and hence the result is a preponderance of
ergon expended, and consequently a corresponding quantity of
heat must be produced.
   Hence, when a body goes through a cyclical process, there is
a transformation either of heat into ergon, or of ergon into heat,
according to the direction in which the cycle is performed; and
the question now arises whether this transformation exists by
itself, or whether, as in the simpler cases previously considered,
it is accompanied by a further transformation which serves as a
compensation.
   We will take, in the first place, by way of example, the case
in which the expansion occurs at     a higher temperature than the
compression.     In order that the  original temperature of the body
may be kept up during the expansion, some external body or
other, which we may call the body A, must impart to it the heat
required to replace the heat expended in ergon during the ex.
pansion. When, during the further course of the cyclical process,
the temperature is lowered and the body is compressed at this
lower temperature, in order that it may retain the same tem
perature throughout the compression, it must give out, to some
other body (which we may call B) of lower temperature, the
heat produced from ergon during the compression.
   This last quantity of heat, which is produced from ergon du
ring the compression and imparted to the body B, according to
what is said above, is not quite as great as that which is with
drawn from the body A during the expansion and expended in
the performance of ergon.     The excess of the latter quantity of
heat over the former quantity is permanently transformed into
ergon by the cyclical process.      Of the remainder of the heat,
however, which is withdrawn from the body A, that portion
namely which, though at first converted into ergon is afterwards
converted back again from ergon into heat and given up as
such to the body B, we may say that it is transferred from
the body A of high temperature to the body B of lower tem
perature.
   The final result of the cyclical process is thus twofold: a cer
tain quantity of heat is permanently transformed into ergon, and

               Theorem   of the Mechanical Theory of Heat.         413
another quantity of heat is transferred from      a hotter to a colder
body.
      If the cyclical  process had been gone through in the inverse
order,      the final result would have been that ergon would have
been      transformed into heat, and that at the same time an ad
ditional quantity of heat would have been transferred             from
a    colder to a hotter body.
      It will be thus seen that, even in a cyclical process, the trans
 formation of heat into ergon, or of ergon into heat, is not an iso
 lated occurrence, but is connected with another change, namely
 the transference of heat from a hotter to a colder body, or from
  a colder to a hotter body; and hence it is natural to regard this
  transference of heat as a compensation for the transformation
  which it accompanies.
      In order that we may employ a form of expression correspond
  ing to that adopted in considering the previous case, we will speak
  of the passage of heat from a body of one temperature into a
  body of another temperature as being likewise a transformation,
  inasmuch as heat of one temperature is in fact thereby trans
  formed into heat of another temperature; and, further, we will
  call the passage from a higher to a lower temperature a positive
  transformation, and that from a lower to a higher temperature a
  negative    transformation. We may then express the result at
  which we have arrived in reference to the cyclical process as fol
  lows:–In such a process a positive and a negative transformation
  occur simultaneously, namely the negative transformation of
  heat into ergon, and the positive transformation of heat of higher
  into heat of lower temperature, or the positive transformation of
  ergon into heat, and the negative transformation of heat of lower
  into heat of higher temperature.
      Examining the matter more closely, we find that the equiva
  lence-value of the transference of heat can be determined in such
   a way that the two transformations, which occur simultaneously
  in every reversible cyclical process, are not only of opposite signs,
   but are always of equal absolute values, so that in the algebraic
   sum they exactly counterbalance each other.       It is very easy to
   assign the equivalence-value,     determined in accordance with
   these conditions, of the passage of heat from one temperature to
   another; it is in fact the value that would be obtained as the
   resultant value of the double transformation if the heat were to
   be transformed into ergon at the one temperature, and reproduced
   from ergon at the other temperature.
       If we  now consider conjointly the three kinds of transforma
   tion that we have been discussing, namely the alteration of dis
   gregation, the transformation of heat into ergon, or vice versd,
   and, lastly, the transference of heat, we can establish a theorem

414                 Prof. R. Clausius on the Second Fundamental
which is no longer applicable merely to the changes of condition
of a single body, or even to such a series of changes of condition
as constitute a cyclical process, but which holds good also for any
series whatever of changes of condition that occur in a reversible
manner, either of one body or of a number of bodies.        This is
the theorem known as the Second fundamental Theorem of the
Mechanical Theory of Heat, the elucidation of which was the
object of the foregoing considerations.    It runs as follows:—
     In
      any process, how complicated soever it may be, whereby one
or more bodies undergo any reversible alterations whatever, the alge
braic sum of all the transformations which take place must be zero.
   It will be seen at once that a great degree of similarity ob
tains between this theorem and the first fundamental theorem of
 the mechanical theory of heat.           According to the first funda
 mental   theorem,   heat and   ergon  are related to each other in such
 wise that, in order to produce ergon an equal quantity of heat
 must be expended, and in order to produce heat an equal quan
tity of ergon must be expended.            Production and expenditure
can, however, be included under a single conception by count
 ing expenditure as negative production. The foregoing relation
may therefore be thus expressed:—In every process the algebraic
sum of the heat and ergon produced is zero; and, in exact corre
spondence with this, the second fundamental theorem asserts
 that the algebraic sum of the transformations is zero.
    Consequently, if the first theorem is called the Theorem of the
Equivalence of Heat and Ergon, the second may be naturally
called the Theorem of the Equivalence of Transformations.
   This second theorem can be represented mathematically by an
equation of equal simplicity with that which expresses the first
theorem; and these two equations are the two fundamental equa
tions, whence             all
                      further equations which the mechanical theory
of  heat     capable

that is impenetrable by heat; and the extensive remodelling
which the theory of the steam-engine, and the theory of thermo
dynamic machines in general, has undergone, a change wherein
the second fundamental theorem has played at least as important
a part as the first.  In like manner might quote from other      I
departments of physics many additional and not unimportant
results which have been arrived at as consequences of this theo
rem; and without doubt the number of such results will become
continually greater when the theorem has been more extensively
applied. The points of connexion between the two theorems,
in the investigations that have been carried out by help of the
mechanical theory of heat, are so numerous and so intimate that
but few of these investigations are intelligible without a know
ledge of the second theorem.
  It has     been said above that the two fundamental theorems                                                of
the mechanical theory of heat are very similar to each other.                                                  I
must now, however, direct attention to an essential difference,
the existence of which indicates a very remarkable characteristic
of all natural processes.
   In the foregoing considerations from which we deduced the
second fundamental theorem, it was made a condition through
out that     all

                                             to   a       But since increase
of   disgregation and passage              heat from  of   hotter          colder    a             to   a
body are positive transformations,               follows that the  it  negative
transformation           of
                        heat into work        necessarily connected with
                                                              is                                                    a
simultaneous positive transformation.
    On the other hand, the positive transformation                  ergon into                of
heat can quite well take place without any simultaneous mega
tive transformation. When, for example, force                      expended               is                        in

that any negative transformation should take part                      the pro                     in

               Theorem         of the Mechanical Theory of Heat.                                   417
   Consequently the proposition holds good of the second kind
of transformation also, that the negative transformation of heat
into ergon cannot occur without a simultaneous positive trans
formation, but that the positive transformation of ergon into
heat can take place without a simultaneous negative transforma
tion.
   Finally, we have still to consider the third kind of transforma
tion, or the passage of heat from one temperature to another.
     In   order that heat may be transferred from a colder to a hotter
body, it is a necessity that a positive transformation should form
a part of the same process, as indeed we have seen already, in
connexion with cyclical processes, that such a transference of heat
involves the transformation of ergon into heat. The inverse trans
ference of heat from a hotter to a colder body, on the contrary, can
 go on entirely by itself, as it does, for example, when heat passes
 from a hotter to a colder body by radiation or conduction.
    Hence in this case also, just as in the two previous ones, the
 negative transformation cannot occur without a positive trans
 formation; but the positive transformation can occur without a
 negative transformation.
    When two transformations are equal in magnitude but of op
 posite signs, we agreed above to say that they compensate each
  other. Accordingly we may enunciate the following theorem
 in reference to         all
                      the three kinds    transformations:—Negative
                                                          of
 transformations    can take place only when they are compensated,
 but positive transformations can occur even      uncompensated; or, if
  shorter still, Uncompensated transformations can never    anything                    be
 but positive.
      This peculiar relation                every change that occurs
                                               met with        in

it must be observed that we may regard the word “heat" as
also including light; and the conception of “ergon” is very
much more comprehensive still.          Chemical action, the effects of
electrical and magnetic forces, the production and cessation of
motion, whether it be the progressive, rotatory, or vibratory mo
tion of ponderable masses, or whether it be the motion of elec
tricity, may all, so far as they are here considered, be represented
as ergon.     We are consequently dealing with a theorem that
applies to        all
                natural phenomena.

in  the aether and the heat existing in material bodies.           Lastly,

get nearer to a certain condition in which, regard being had to
the existing temperature, the total disgregation is the greatest
possible.

Phº
                                            [With          a Plate.]
                    every chemist and physicist has had occasion to
       feel the want of a thermometer capable of measuring high
temperatures, of portable size, and sufficiently delicate in                                             its   in
dications.        organic chemistry especially, and
                      In                               the course                        in                    of
fractional distillation (an operation    frequent occurrence), this of
want      very generally experienced.
         is                               Up      330°     350° the                to             or
mercurial thermometer answers      every requirement—although                                                   as
these high temperatures are approached           indications require           its
correction         to
               the extent       15°    20°, since the height
                                            of             or       the                                  of
column outside the    distilling apparatus   has then        taken into                  to       be
consideration. But beyond this point we possess nothermometer
capable       of
            similar indications.
   In certain cases only are we able         measure elevated tempe to
ratures with    anything    like  precision.     The air-thermometer,
especially with the latest modifications which M. Regnault and
M.      H.
         Deville have given                        it,
                                    certainly allows

400 cubic centims.                 at
                         least—a circumstance which limits its use

hand, the air-thermometer,              has been hitherto employed,
never directly indicates the true temperature; this            only de                             is

internal pressure  is thus determined    by the recession of the mer
curial column contained in the capillary tube. The number of

passes ought to be nearly equal to that which expresses the tem

   Now this volume represents only the rºw part      the capacity                                      of

times less dense than that in the capillary tube possessing the
temperature of the surrounding space. The weight of the air
contained in the reservoir diminishes, therefore,
   1. By the amount of air contained in the 500 millims. of
capillary tube originally filled with mercury at zero, but now at
500° filled with air; this amount is equal to about the rig
part of that contained in the reservoir at 500°.
   2. By the difference in the quantity of air contained in the
anterior portion of the tube originally at zero, but now at 500°.
The pressure, and consequently the condensation of this air,
being now tripled, and the length of the one portion of the tube
being nearly equal to that of the other (that in which the mer
cury has been replaced by air), it will be seen that the increment
in the amount of air contained in the first portion of the tube is
very nearly equivalent to two-thirds of the quantity replacing the
mercury in the second portion of the same tube.
    The above quantities taken together represent a total diminu
tion of one-sixtieth in the amount of air contained in the reser
voir, resulting from the increased temperature.
    This diminution will evidently vary with the capillarity of the
tube. The foregoing calculations are made for a tube # of a
millim, in internal diameter.         In a tube            millim.      dia

changed into carbonaceous matter.     At this temperature the
greater number of organic compounds, even of the most stable
constitution, commence to decompose.
   The boiling-points of bodies but slightly volatile may be in
this way easily determined.   I have ascertained, for example,
that retene, C*H*, boils at 390°, and that perchlorinated naph
thalene, C* Cl* (prepared by means of antimony chloride), boils
at 403°. I have also found that the boiling-point of sulphur re
mains constant during the entire process of     distillation.              its

         could not rest satisfied until had planned a repetition of
his principal experiments on this point in a new shape. . The
only circumstance in his mode of proceeding about which
could have any doubt was the fall of pressure from the varying
                                                                                                          I
density of the air in the large reservoir to the constant lower
pressure maintained in the calorimetric part of the apparatus; and
I  imagined it might be more satisfactory, at least as a variation of
the experiment, if the heating and cooling worms were traversed
by a current of the compressed air from a mass contained in an
adjoining reservoir, and caused mechanically to circulate through
the apparatus without appreciable change of density or tension.
                               I
     To effect this copied as closely as possible the arrangement of
Regnault's heating and cooling worms (Pl. VI. fig. 2) a, b, and
added the receiver, c, of sheet copper, 7 inches in diameter and
30 inches long, divided into two compartments by the air-tight dia
phragm d. To this diaphragm is fixed the circulating-pump, e—a
brass model of a steam-engine cylinder afºrately finished, with
but slight “lap” and “lead” on the valve, the piston being worked
by a handle on the fly-wheel fixed on the outer end of the crank
shaft, f, which passes through a stuffing-box on the side of the
receiver.      The            air
                             taken into the pump through the pipe

not    lose heat without a corresponding amount         of condensation,
the return into water of a portion of the working steam equiva
lent to the work done seems to be an inevitable conclusion.
Hirn's later experiments on the working of large steam-engines,
described in his “Exposition Analytique,” 1865, seem to prove
this relation; and it is now supposed that the anomalous results
of former experiments are attributable chiefly to the presence of
 water in the steam. This point has been fairly proved by the
 use of superheated steam in Hirn's more recent experiments;
 and a fresh series of experiments which          I  have been recently
 making with a different method, which I believe to be novel,
 lead to the same conclusion in a manner which does not seem
 to admit of further doubt on the subject.          I shall probably ere
 long be requesting of you the favour to allow a brief statement
 of these experiments to appear in the Philosophical Magazine;

 oblige me.

   LII.   On the least Electromotive Force by which a Galvanic       Lu
            minous Arc can be produced.       By E. EDLUND*.
 1.                  the conduction between the       poles  of a powerful
       WHEN    voltaic battery is interrupted, and        a luminous arc
  formed at the    break,  the intensity of the current is known to be
  considerably less than when the conduction is unbroken, and no
  light exists. It has hitherto been assumed that the great dimi
 mution in the intensity which here ensues arises from a great re
  sistance which the luminous arc offers to the transmission of the
  current.    It has been found that this resistance increases with
  the length of the arc.         In a previous investigation     f I have
 proved experimentally that if an ordinary resistance be inter
  posed in the circuit which causes the same diminution as the
  luminous arc alone, this consists of two parts, one of which is
  quite independent of the length of the luminous arc, and is un
  changeable in magnitude so long as the intensity remains the
  same; the other part increases proportionally to the length of
  the luminous arc, provided that, when the length of the arc is
  increased, so much of the interposed resistance is removed that
  the intensity of the current is not thereby diminished. If the

first part of the resistance in question be called a, and the other
part, corresponding to a luminous arc of unit length, is b, the re
 sistance of a luminous arc whose length amounts to n units is
 a+mb. It follows from the experimental part of the research in
 question that a is inversely as the intensity.                It is therefore
 easy to calculate the length of a for a certain intensity, provided
 its value is known for another.           The resistance b also increases
 in magnitude if the intensity decreases, although the law for this
 increase could not be deduced from the experiments, because b
 for the unit of length assumed was so small, in comparison with
 a, that no accurate measurements in this respect could be made.

tually independent of the current, it is impossible to obtain a
luminous arc when the electromotive force (E) of the battery is
so much diminished that E is equal to D; the sum of the elec
tromotive forces of the entire circuit is then zero, and hence the
 current must cease.     But even before E, in being diminished,
 attains these limits, the impossibility of forming a luminous arc
 must occur; for a certain intensity is necessary for       forma                                its

    The experiments were made as follows”:-After the electromo
tive force of the battery and the resistance had been determined
when the poles were screwed against each other, the electromo
tive force D in the luminous arc was measured by the rules given
in my former investigation. For this purpose the points were
fitted in a pole-holder which was placed in a Foucault’s lantern,
and the length of the luminous arc determined by measuring
the image projected on the screen. The pole-holder was then
removed from the lantern and firmly screwed against the table,
upon which the electromotive force of the battery was succes
 sively diminished by the removal of a greater or smaller number
of elements.    At each diminution of the electromotive force, it
was examined whether a luminous arc could be formed or not,
until the limit was reached. The trough which mentioned in                   I
my former paper was used as a rheostat, and was filled with
 sulphate of copper.   In            all

 trying.  The luminous phenomenon was frequently so brilliant
 as to make it appear as if there was an actual luminous arc; but
 when the circuit was opened and the conduction examined in the
 usual manner, it was found to be a mere ignition with contact
 between the poles.
        If D
         were quite constant and independent of the intensity, the
least electromotive force by which a luminous are could have
been produced must have been greater than D, as determined
by the stronger currents. This is obvious; and it follows, more
over, that if with a given value of E a luminous arc can be
produced, this is no longer possible if the resistance is adequately
increased.   Hence a certain intensity is necessary to produce a
luminous arc.    Comparing the values of D as determined by
stronger currents with the limiting values of E by which a lumi
nous arc can just be produced, it is observed that with the hard
carbon-points in Series 1 the electromotive force E of the battery
is greater than D, but in                    all

  The first object sought was                      to
                                 diminish the internal resistance
of the battery; and this was attained    four ways.             in
   (1) The upper face        each zinc plate (to which the pla
                                        of
tinum plate       screwed) was carefully filed off         perfectly

smooth and flat surface, and the screws were tightened        much                    as
                  large contact-surface was thus secured instead
of as
   possible.        A
   the few points     which  at  usually obtained.
                                            it   is   The oxidation
between the two plates was also greatly diminished       this. The              by
contacts       of
             course were  carefully cleaned every  time the battery
was used.
        (2) The thickness         of    the platinum plates was increased,                 as   it
                        *    Communicated             by   the Author.

              Mr. G. W. Wigner   on Grove’s Battery.            449
was found that when of the ordinary thickness they opposed           a
serious resistance to the current.
  (3) The zinc and platinum were brought much nearer together,
thus diminishing the length of liquid through which the cur
rent had to pass in each cell.   In many cases the zinc plates
were put into absolute contact with the porous cell without any
apparent disadvantage.
   (4) A white porous cell of a very close and uniform texture
was at last selected, as embracing both the necessary conditions
of good conducting-power and pores sufficiently small to prevent
the free mixture of the acids.
   The second object sought was to prevent local action; and this
was accomplished by putting a small quantity of mercury at the
bottom of each cell, in contact with the zinc, which was by this
means always thoroughly amalgamated.          Ultimately the zincs
were made in two pieces—one flat piece 4; x3 for one side of the
cell, the other a bent piece to carry the platinum; and the con
mexion between the two pieces was formed by the mercury at the
bottom of the cell. This alteration was found to be a great con
venience, as any zinc could be lifted out without disturbing the
adjoining cells.   It also proved economical, the first cost of each
zinc being less and the durability greater; for the old shape
always broke at the lower bend long before they were worn out.
   Anothe source of loss still remained, in the short circuits
which were formed from one cell to another, and from the ter
minals to the ground, by moisture and condensed acid, and
which, when working with 120 cells, were so strong as to render
it painful to touch the terminal screws of the battery while
standing on a stone floor.
   To obviate this, two glass rods about half an inch in diameter
were fixed lengthwise in the bottom of each tray, and on these rods
the cells stood; thus any moisture which might condense settled
out of contact with the cells.     The trays and small pieces of
wood which were inserted between each cell were of oak, baked
for twelve hours, and varnished with three coats of shell-lac var
nish ; and when in use each tray (of ten cells) was insulated by
another series of glass rods; so that the loss by local circuits was
reduced to a minimum.
   I have also found considerable advantage from working the
batteries in front of a large fire: the fumes of the acid are        all
carried  upthe chimney, and condensation very greatly diminished.
 I   next endeavoured      increase the constancy
                          to                        ofthe battery.
    The first step,of course, was to  increase the dimensions   ofthe
 outer cells, toprevent the sulphuric  acid from becoming  so rapidly
 saturated with zinc.   I   then tried the effect of stronger nitric
 acid, even   ashigh as  1:540 spec. grav., but eventually decided

 in favour of nitrosulphuric acid; and the results I have obtained
 are very satisfactory, amounting in one case to a loss of only 18
 per cent. in the light, ten hours after setting up the batteries,
 more than six hours of which the batteries were in circuit.
 If only  four or five hours’ work is required from the battery, 2
 lbs. nitric acid (1360 spec. grav.) to 5 lbs. sulphuric acid (1845
 spec. grav.) will be a very good proportion; but if more work is
 required, the proportion of nitric acid may be increased to 34 lbs.
 I once worked sixty cells very satisfactorily for four hours with
 only 1      lb.

 evident.

flamed but the taper extinguished, as with a jar of hydrogen the
mouth of which is held downward. With 1% volume of oxygen
it forms an explosive mixture.
    Potassic hydrate and other alkaline hydrates absorb the gas as
completely as carbonic acid, though somewhat more slowly. The
solution is inodorous, but disengages sulphuretted hydrogen and
carbonic acid when treated with acids.     It is probably decom
posed as   follows:—
            C O S + 4.K HO = K? CO3 + K? S + 2 H* 0.
The solution gives with ammoniacal solution of silver a copious
black precipitate, and the filtered solution indicated no trace
either of chlorine or cyanogen.
   Neither chlorine nor fuming nitric acid exert any action on the
gas at ordinary temperatures.     When sodium is heated in the gas
it burns with a dazzling light, forming a black easily fusible mass,
which consists of carbon, sulphide of sodium, and carbonate
of sodium. By heating, the gas is decomposed into sulphur and
carbonic oxide without any change of volume.

coating.     In boiling water it disengages a small amount of hy
drogen. Gently heated in the air it burns, with formation of
brown oxide; but if suddenly heated more strongly, it burns with
explosive violence, and scatters about the most brilliant stars.
In this respect it differs from everything, with the exception of
Ulranlum.
    Bettendorff's has described two allotropic modifications of
arsenic. When pure arsenic was volatilized in a rapid current of
hydrogen, metallic hexagonal arsenic was deposited in the imme
diate neighbourhood of the heated part, and a little further on
there was some black amorphous arsenic, while the whole front
part of the tube was filled with a bright yellow fume, which as
it deposited became darker and finally grey. It was found on
analysis to be pure metallic arsenic; it was quite amorphous,
and was found under the microscope to consist of small globules
arranged together in a chaplet-form.         Its specific gravity was
found to be 471; and when heated from 358° to 360° it changes
into crystallime metallic arsenic of the specific gravity 5'72, with
such disengagement of heat that part of the arsenic volatilizes.
    The black amorphous arsenic with a vitreous lustre is obtained
when arsenic vapour is cooled to from 210° to 220°. It is best pre
pared by bending one end of a combustion-tube in a U-shape,
and immersing this part in an oil-bath heated to 220° while the
arsenic, which is placed near the upper end of the tube, is volati
lized in the current of hydrogen. After the experiment the         in
terior of the U-tube is lined with a splendid mirror, which by
gently tapping is obtained in a number of thin brittle scales. Its
specific gravity is 471; and on heating to 360° it passes into
crystalline arsenic, with considerable development of heat.         It
resists chemical attack much more emergetically than crystallized
al’SenlC.
    Gondolot has described an important modification in Boussin
gault's method of preparing oxygen.         Tubes either of wrought
or cast iron are covered on the inside with a lute of magnesia,
and externally with asbestos, in order to diminish the porosity
and the waste in the fire. These tubes are fastened in a brick
furnace provided with arrangements for regulating the draught
so that the tubes can be heated either to bright or to dull red
ness.     The tubes contain baryta, with which is mixed lime, and
a small quantity of manganate of potash, which prevents fritting.
Air is then passed through the tubes at a low heat, at which the

oxygen is absorbed with formation of binoxide of barium; on
heating this to a higher temperature pure oxygen is given off.

dification of one devised by Tessié du Motay and Maréchal+. It
is based on the following reactions:—Peroxide of manganese

tact with air, is changed into manganate,

M. Haagen on the Refractive Indices of some Haloid Compounds. 457
tween 10° and 70°C.   As iodide of silver melts only at a rather
high temperature (400° C.), the effects could not be attributed
to the irregularities which might be produced in the neighbour
hood of the temperature corresponding to the change in condi
tion of the substance.
   The expansion of iodide of silver should thus be expressed by
a negative coefficient—at any rate, within the above limits.
Moreover, in proportion as the temperature rises, the value of
the coefficient considerably increases, so that the contradiction
becomes more and more marked.
    Haagen has determined the refractive indices and specific gra
vities of some liquid haloid compounds*.           Two of Meyerstein’s
spectrometers were used for ascertaining the refractive indices.
By means of the larger one, which had a vernier reading to ten
seconds, the index could be determined with certainty to the
fourth place of decimals, and with a possible error of four units
in the fifth place.    By the smaller instrument, which was used
for  investigating  fuming   chlorides, the angle could be read                                off
a minute; the indices determined with                              its
                                                   aid were accurate                        to to
the third   place;  the fourth varied        three         by
                                                       four units. The   or
method used was that                as of
                              the least deviation.        Geissler's hy       A

referred.
                                          Harmotome.
  Several years ago the author showed that simple crystals                                     of   Har
motome did not exist, and that those Strontian           of
                                                  Scotland                  in                 (Morve

 462                           Royal Society:—
  mite), considered as such, presented, in fact, a twinning formed by
 the interpenetration of two principal individuals.          The particular
  orientation of the plane of the optic axes in each of the crystals of
 which the least complicated of such groups are composed had led
 him to refer their crystalline form to a right rhombic prism of 124°
 47'; and he had been induced to look on this prism as presenting a
 peculiar sort of hemihedrism, or rather hemimorphism, such that
 only one-half of the fundamental rhombic octahedron existed—that,
 namely, formed of four faces parallel two and two, and lying in the
 same zone.       More recently, in studying the modifications which
 heat induces in the position of the optic axes and of their plane, he
 observed a phenomenon less compatible with the hypothesis of a
 primitive rhombic form; but the slight transparency of the plates on
 which he operated, the wide separation of the optic axes, which ren
 dered the examination of the two systems of rings almost impossible
 in air, and, finally, the almost complete absence of dispersion led him
 to regard the observed result as an apparent anomaly, attributable
 to the highly complex structure of the crystals.
     Desirous of verifying the truth of a suggestion communicated to
 him by M. Gadolin in June 1867, the author had some new plates
 cut normal to the acute positive bisectrix from very transparent
 crystals of the Scotch Morvenite, and he has been able to establish
 the existence of a very decided twisted dispersion.         In consequence
 of the smaller mutual inclination of the      optic  axes in these than in
 the former plates, the author was also able to satisfy himself directly
that the displacement impressed by heat on the plane containing
 these axes is a rotary one, quite analogous to that which he had
 shown to exist in borax and Heulandite.             It is therefore now
beyond doubt that the crystalline type of Harmotome is the oblique
rhombic prism; and the author has corrected the crystallographic
description of the mineral accordingly.
                                  Wöhlerite.
    In his ‘Manual of Mineralogy,’ the author had described the
crystals of Wöhlerite as derivable from a prism of very nearly 90°.
From the point of view from which a consideration of the orientation
of their optic axes had induced him to regard them, they appeared
to offer a certain number of homohedral forms associated with forms
that were hemihedral or hemimorphic, analogous to those that he
had drawn attention to in Harmotome.             Having proved that the
latter mineral   belongs   to the climorhombic  system,  he endeavoured to
ascertain whether this was not also the case with Wöhlerite, all the
forms of which would in that event be homohedral.               But in this
case a   study  of the different varieties of dispersion  is rendered diffi
cult by the yellow colour, and by the imperfect transparency pre
sented by the substance even when in very thin plates.               Besides
this, contrary to what is found in Harmotome, while the dispersion
belonging to the optic axes is very distinct, the horizontal and twisted

dispersions, which should be sought for in plates normal to the two
bisectrices, are, on the contrary, but slightly evident.               However, on
examining in               oil
                      some thin    plates    placed              have the plane

their   optic  axes horizontal and      perpendicular        the plane      polariza to                   of

  The temperature of the liquid                       was taken     by a small thermometer,
having a bulb 60 millims. long and about 2.5 millims. diameter.
Each degree was divided into twenty parts; and by means of a tele
scope gºt of a degree could be read off.
   The authors give experiments which prove that the high specific
heats observed are not due to evaporation caused by the introduc
tion of the heated metals into the calorimeter.
   The second method used was that generally employed.           A certain
weight of the liquid, the specific heat of which is to be estimated, en
closed in a suitable vessel, is heated and then plunged, vessel and
all, into a calorimeter containing a known weight of distilled water.
The temperature of the calorimeter will rise, owing to the introduc
tion of the heated liquid; and the elevations in temperature produced
by different liquids will, in this case, be directly proportional to their
specific heats.
   The following Tables give the means of the various results obtained.
   Four series of experiments were made.           In the first series the
brass weight was employed; it was heated to a temperature of about
98°C. In the second and third series the copper weight was used,
heated to about 98° and 42°C. respectively.         The fourth series was
conducted in the ordinary manner.

 which is a gas easily liquefied, has a far greater cohesion than hy
 drogen : as regards cohesion, hydrochloric acid is between hydrogen
 and chlorine, and thus it is more difficult to liquefy than chlorine.
    (2) When the combination of two gases is accompanied by a con
 densation, the cohesion of the compound depends on the internal
 pressure; and as the volume V+V' is then greater than V", the
 cohesion in the case of this gas is much greater than in the prece
 ding  case.
    In like manner, gaseous combinations formed with condensation
 of the elements are much more easily liquefied than compounds
 formed without condensation.         Thus it is that protoxide of nitrogen,
 in which the condensation is        equal  to a third, could be liquefied;
 while binoxide of   nitrogen,  formed without condensation, has hitherto
 resisted liquefaction.
    (3) When two compounds C and C, corresponding to the same
 volume W are formed of the same elements A and A', and only differ
 by the volumes V and W" of one of the elements A, the volume of
 the second element being supposed invariable, there is a difference
 between the cohesions p and p' of the two compounds represented by
 the relation
                           (0–0)=(R+P*Y.
 In this  case the cohesion increases proportionally to the number of
 volumes of the element A added to the combination, and proportion
 ally to the cohesion of the element A increased by the external
 pressure.
    Thus carbonic acid and carbonic oxide, with the same volume and
 under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the
 same quantity of carbon ; carbonic acid contains more oxygen than
 carbonic oxide. The cohesion of carbonic acid is greater than that
 of carbonic oxide; and carbonic acid is the only one of these two gases
 which has hitherto been liquefied.
    Olefiant gas and marsh-gas present another instance.
    (4) If in a compound C an element A be replaced by another ele
ment A, which corresponds to the same volume as A, without the
volume W of the compound being modified, the element A' being
 further supposed to be unchanged, a new compound C, is obtained
 whose cohesion p, is different from p.
    If R   be the cohesion   of the element  A,   we have from formula (2)
                           p'-p=(R-R)         *
                                              V
Thus the difference in the cohesions of the two compounds, C, and C,
is proportional to the difference of the cohesions in the two elements
A, and A.

iodine for bromine, the compounds obtained by substitution are less

some observations on the nature of the rays absorbed by the atmo

   The intensity was measured either by allowing the rays to fall di
rectly on the thermometer of the actinometer, or by first causing them
to pass through a layer of distilled water of about 5 centims. thick
ness. This water was contained in a brass tube closed by two glass
plates.

  It  follows from these observations that, in the conditions under
which I worked, the atmosphere stops the luminous rays in greater
proportion than the obscure rays which are absorbed by water.
There is an obvious analogy between this result and the well-known
property of the atmosphere, of allowing the red rays to pass more
easily than the more refrangible rays.
   It will be observed that the above experiments were made in cold
and dry weather.     It will be interesting to ascertain whether the
same result holds when the tension of vapour is more considerable.

       ON     THE INTERNAL WORK                 OF GASES.     BY M. A. CAZIN.
  I    havemade observations on the variations of pressure in a
gaseous mass which has suddenly passed from one reservoir into
another, from the moment at which the pressure began to be equal
to the time that the gas had assumed  original temperature.
                                                     its

   The following is the principle of the method of observation. The
gas is at the outset under the same pressure in the two reservoirs,
which are then connected with a sulphuric-acid manometer, and the
level noted. A valve is closed, which cuts off communication between
the reservoirs and the manometer. By means of a pump, part of the
gas is driven from one reservoir into the other.        A large stopcock
between the reservoirs being opened; sudden expansion takes place,
and the motion of the stopcock opens in turn the valve of the mano
meter. The apparatus indicates the time when the expansion com
mences, and at which the valve has been opened; and the level in the
manometer at known intervals is then observed.
   For this purpose a voltaic circuit is used containing an electro
magnet the armature of which is provided with a pencil; against
this pencil a band of paper is uncoiled with known velocity. The
stopcock in turning closes the circuit as soon as the expansion
commences, and then opens it at the same time as the valve;
the circuit, finally, is closed for a moment each time the manometer is
read off.    From the marks left on the paper the necessary times are
easily known.
   Let H be the difference of level observed at different times, H' the
final difference observed when the gas has resumed            original tem                     its
perature;      curve

and for abscissae the times calculated from the moment the expan
sion commenced.
   By gradually increasing the time which elapses between the com
mencement          the expansion and the opening
                   of                                      the valve, leaving      of
other circumstances unaltered,          series     curves
                                                        a               of

curve  of  real pressure which the gas possesses            various intervals.
By this device            we
                       avoid being compelled       attempt the impossibility
                                                                        to
of  having  a  manometer which shall instantaneously indicate the va
rying pressure        the gas.
   This method           is of
                       analogous     that which    toused     1862,     I                in            in   an   in

time less than 0.1 second; the pressure increases then for several
 seconds, at first rather rapidly, but then more slowly, and the more
 so the greater the divergence of the gas from Mariotte's law. The
 pressure attains a maximum, and then very slowly decreases until the
 initial temperature is set up.
    This result is easily explained on thermodynamic principles. The
moment inequality of pressure begins to be set up, part of the gas
 eddies about; there has been a lowering of temperature in the ex
panded part, an increase in the compressed part. The vis viva of
the part in motion is gradually converted into heat, and consequently
the pressure increases.       If the sides were impervious to heat, equi
librium would be established without any external work being brought
into play, or any heat taken from or given to the surrounding bodies.
The temperature would then be lower than the original temperature;
and the difference would be greater the greater the divergence from
Mariotte's law.       But the sides impart heat to the cold part of the
gaseous mass, and take                  it,   on
                                       the contrary, from the heated part,
without there being            an
                             exact compensation between the two effects.
The final result       that the mass receives
                      is                           little heat from without;
