I. Second Memoir on the Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals,
   and the relation of Magnetism and Diamagnetism to Mo
   lecular Arrangement. By JoHN TYNDALL and HERMANN
   KNoBLAUCH*.
IN     the year 1846 our views of magnetic action received,
      through the researches of Faraday, an extraordinary ex
pansion. The experiments of Brugmans, Le Baillif, Seebeck
and Becquerel, had already proved the power to be active
beyond the limits usually assigned to it; but these experi
ments were isolated, and limited in number. Faraday was
the first to establish the broad fact, that there is no known
body indifferent to magnetic influence, when the latter is
strongly developed. The nature of magnetic action was then
found to be twofold, attractive and repulsive; thus dividing
bodies into two great classes, which are respectively denomi
nated magnetic and diamagnetic.
   The representative of the former class is iron, which, being
brought before the single pole of a magnet, is attracted; the
representative of the latter class is bismuth, which, being
brought before the single pole of a magnet, is repelled.
   If a little bar of iron be hung freely between the two poles
of a magnet, it will set its longest dimension in the line joining .
the poles; a little bar of bismuth, on the contrary, will set its
longest dimension at right angles to the line joining the poles.
   The position of the iron is termed by Mr. Faraday the
awial; the position of the bismuth, the equatorial. We shall
have occasion to use these terms.
   These discoveries, opening, as they did, a new field in phy
sical science, invited the labours of scientific men on the con
tinent. Weber, CErsted, Reich and others, have occupied

2         Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
themselves with the subject. But, if we except the illustrious
discoverer himself, there is no investigator in this branch of
science whose labours have been, to all appearance, so richly
rewarded as those of Professor Plücker of Bonn.
   In 1847 M. Plücker had a magnet constructed of the same
size and power as that described by Mr. Faraday”, his object
being to investigate the influence of the fibrous constitution
of plants upon their magnetic deportment. While conducting
these experiments, he was induced to try whether crystalline
structure exercised an influence. “The first experiment,”
says M. Plücker, “gave an immediate and decided reply.”
   Following up his investigations with crystals, he was led to
the affirmation of the following two laws:—
   “When any crystal whatever with one optical aris is brought
between the poles of a magnet, the aris is repelled by each of the
poles; and if the crystal possess two aires, each of these is re
pelled, with the same force, by the two poles.
   “The force which causes this repulsion is independent of the
magnetism or diamagnetism of the mass of the crystal ; it de
creases with the distance more slowly than the magnetic influence
everted by the polesl.”
   It is perhaps worth explaining, that if, on exciting the mag
net, the optical axis take up the avial position, it is said to
be attracted; if the equatorial, it is said to be repelled.
   The first experiment of M. Plücker, which led to the affir
mation of these laws, was made with tourmaline. A plate of
the crystal which had been prepared for the purposes of po
larization, twelve millimetres long, nine wide, and three thick,
was suspended by a strong fibre between the poles of an
electro-magnet. On sending a current round the latter, the
plate, which was magnetic, set itself as an ordinary magnetic
substance would do, with its longest dimension from pole to
pole. The optical axis of the crystal, thus suspended, was
vertical.
   On hanging the crystal, however, with its optical axis hori
zontal; when the magnet was excited, the plate stood no longer
as a magnetic substance, but as a diamagnetic; its longest
dimension being at right angles to the line joining the poles.
The optical axis of the crystal was found to coincide with its
length, and the peculiar deportment was considered as a proof
that the optical axis was repelled.
   This law was further established by experiments with Ice
land spar, quartz, zircon, beryl, &c., and, as above stated,
included crystals of all kinds, both optic positive and negative.

                Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.                   3
It has, however, lately undergone considerable modification
at the hands of M. Plücker himself.            In a letter to Mr. Fa
raday, which appears in page 450, vol. xxxiv. of this Maga
zine, he expresses himself as follows:—
   “The first and general law I deduced from my last expe
riments is the following one:—“There will be either repulsion
or attraction of the optic axes by the poles of a magnet, ac
cording to the crystalline structure of the crystal. If the
crystal is a negative one, there will be repulsion; if it is a po
sitive one, there will be attraction *.’”
   This law applies to crystals possessing two optical axes,
each of the said axes being attracted or repelled according as
the crystal is positive or negative. It will simplify the subject
if we regard the line bisecting the acute angle inclosed by the
two axes as the resultant of attraction or repulsion; for the
sake of convenience, we shall call this the middle line.               In
positive crystals, therefore, the middle line, according to the
above law, must stand arial; in negative crystals, equa
torial. It is also evident, that the plane passing through the
optical axes must, in the one class of crystals, stand from pole
to pole, in the other class at right angles to the line joining
the poles.
   In explaining this new modification of the law, M. Plücker
lays particular emphasis upon the fact, that the attraction or
repulsion is the result of an independent force, connected in
no way with the magnetism or diamagnetism of the mass of
the crystal; and this view is shared by Mr. Faraday, who, in
expressing his concurrence with M. Plücker, denominates the
force in question an “optic axis forcef.”
   The experiments described in our first paper upon this
subjecti, furnish, we conceive, sufficient ground of dissent from
these views. In the case of five crystals of pure carbonate of
lime (Iceland spar), we found the law of Plücker strictly veri
fied, all five crystals being diamagnetic; on replacing, how
ever, a portion of the carbonate of lime by carbonate of iron,
nature herself being the chemist in this case, the crystal was
no longer diamagnetic, but magnetic; in every other respect
it was physically unchanged; its optical properties remained
precisely as before, the crystal of carbonate of lime and the
crystal of carbonate of lime and iron being both negative. In
the one case, however, the optical axis was attracted; in the
other, the said axis was repelled; the attraction being evi
dently caused by the passage of the crystal from the diamag
netic into the magnetic state.

4.          Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
     We have examined other crystals of the same form as Ice
land spar, both magnetic and diamagnetic. In all cases, the
former act in a manner precisely similar to the magnetic cry
stal already described, while the latter behave as the diamag
netic. The following are examples.
     Nitrate of Soda.—This crystal is exactly of the same form
 as carbonate of lime, and, like it, diamagnetic. Its deport
 ment is in every respect the same. A rhombus cloven from
 the crystal and suspended horizontally between the poles, sets
its longer diagonal axial. Suspending the full crystal between
 the poles, with its optical axis horizontal, on exciting the mag
 net this axis sets itself equatorial.
     Breunnerite.—This is a crystal composed principally, of
 carbonate of lime and carbonate of magnesia, but containing
 a sufficient quantity of the carbonate of iron to render it mag
 netic. Suspended in the magnetic field, the optical axis stands
 from pole to pole.
     Dolomite.—In this crystal a portion of the lime is replaced
 by protoxide of iron and protoxide of manganese, which in
 gredients render it magnetic. The optical axis stands from
 pole to pole.
      Carbonate of Iron.—In the cases cited, the substitution of
 iron for calcium was partial; in the case before us it is com
 plete. This crystal differs in nothing, save in the energy of
 its action, from the magnetic crystals already described. If
  a full crystal be hung between the poles, with its optical axis
  horizontal, on closing the circuit and sending a current round
  the magnet, the said axis turns strongly into the axial line,
  vibrates through it quickly for a time, and finally comes to
  rest there. If a thin rhombus be cloven from the crystal and
  suspended from one of its obtuse angles with its parallel faces
  vertical, it will set itself exactly equatorial. In this case it
  is easy to see that the horizontal projection of the optical
  axis, which passes through the obtuse angle of the crystal,
  stands axial. Hung from its acute angle, the rhombus takes
  up an oblique position, making a constant angle with the line
 joining the poles. To this position, if forcibly removed from
  it, it will invariably return. The position may be either right
  or left of the axial line; but the angle of obliquity is always
  the same, being the angle which the optical axis makes with
  the face of the rhombus. Hung from the obtuse angle the
  obliquity is nothing—from the acute angle it is a maximum;
  the rhombus is capable of all degrees of obliquity between
  these extremes, the optical aris in all cases standing exactly
 jrom pole to pole.               -
      Oride of Iron-The above phaenomena are exhibited even

               Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.              5
in a more striking manner by this crystal. So strong is the
directive power, that a rhombus, suspended from one of its
obtuse angles, will set itself strongly equatorial, though its
length may be fifteen or twenty times its breadth.
    What is the conclusion to be drawn from these experi
ments? We have first of all a diamagnetic crystal of pure
carbonate of lime, which sets its optical axis equatorial. On
substituting for a portion of the lime a quantity of protoxide
of iron sufficient to render the crystal weakly magnetic, we
find the position of the axis at once reversed. Replacing a
still further quantity of the diamagnetic lime by a magnetic
constituent, we find the action stronger, the force with which
the optical axis takes up the axial position increasing as the
magnetic constituents increase.       These experiments appear
to be irreconcilable with the statement, that the position of the
optical axis is independent of the magnetism or diamagnetism
of the mass.
    Turning now to crystals possessing two optical axes, we
find the law of Plücker equally untenable; a forcible contra
diction is exhibited in the case of
    Dichroite.—This crystal, as is well known, receives its name
from its ability to transmit light of different colours. The
specimen examined by us is a cube. In the direction of the
crystallographic axis, which coincides with the middle line,
the light transmitted is yellowish; through the other four
sides of the cube it is a deep blue. Suspended with the middle
line horizontal, whatever be the position of that line before
closing the circuit, the instant the magnetic force is developed
it turns with surprising energy into the axial position and
becomes fixed there. According to the law, however, the
middle line should stand equatorial, for the crystal is negative”.
    Sulphate of Barytes (heavy spar).-The form of this crystal
 is a prism whose base is a rhombus, the four sides being per
pendicular to the base. It cleaves parallel to the sides and
base.    Suspended between the poles, with the axis of the
prism vertical, on exciting the magnet, the long diagonal sets
itself axial. The crystal is diamagnetic, and agrees, thus far,
 with the carbonate of lime. Suspended from the acute angle
 formed by two sides of the prism, the axis of the latter being
 horizontal, on closing the circuit the said axis turns into the
 awial position, and remains there as long as the force is pre
 sent. Suspending the crystal from its obtuse angle, the axis
 being still horizontal, on closing the circuit the axis sets itself
 equatorial. A plane perpendicular to the rhombic base, and

6         Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
axes, which are inclined to each other at an angle of 38°.
The middle line bisecting this angle is parallel to the axis of
the prism, and hence stands arial or equatorial, according as
the prism is suspended from its acute or its obtuse angle.
The position of the middle line is therefore a function of the
point of suspension, varying as it varies; at one time support
ing the law of Plücker, and at another time contradicting it.
Heavy spar is positive.
   Sulphate of Strontia (Caelestine).-This is also a positive
crystal, its form being precisely that of heavy spar; the only
difference is, that, in the case before us, the optic axes inclose
an angle of 50° instead of 88°. The corroboration and con
tradiction of heavy spar are exhibited here also.
   Sulphate of Žinc.—Suspend the crystalline prism from its
end, and mark the line which stands equatorial when the mag
net is excited. A plate taken from the crystal parallel to this
line, and to the axis of the prism, on examination with polar
ized light, will display the ring systems surrounding the ends
of the two optic axes. The middle line, therefore, which bi
sects the acute angle inclosed by these, stands axial. It ought,
however, to stand equatorial, for the crystal is negative.
   Sulphate of Magnesia.-Suspending the crystalline prism
from its end, and following the method applied in the case of
sulphate of zinc, we discover the ring systems and the position
of the middle line.    This line stands axial, but the crystal is
negative.
    Topaz.-This being one of the crystals pronounced by M.
Plücker as peculiarly suited to the illustration of his new law,
it is perhaps on that account deserving of more than ordinary
attention. In the letter to Mr. Faraday, before alluded to,
M. Plücker writes:—                                              -
   “The crystals most fitted to give the evidence of this law
are diopside (a positive crystal), cyanite, topaz (both negative),
and others crystallizing in a similar way. In these crystals
the line (A) bisecting the acute angles made by the two
optic axes, is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the axis
(B) of the prism. ... Such a prism, suspended horizontally, will
point neither axially nor equatorially, but will take always a
fixed intermediate direction. . This direction will continually
change if the prism be turned round its own axis (B). It may
be proved by a simple geometrical construction, which shows
that during one revolution of the prism round its axis (B),
this axis, without passing out of two fixed limits C and D,
will go through all intermediate positions. The directions C
and D, where the crystal returns, make, either with the line
joining the two poles, or with the line perpendicular to it, on

               Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.                 7-*
both sides of these lines, angles equal to the angle included by
A and B; the first being the case if the crystal be a positive
one, the last if a negative one.        Thence it follows, that if the
crystal, by any kind of horizontal suspension, should point to
the poles of a magnet, it is a positive one; if it should point
equatorially, it is a negative one”.”
   In experimenting with this crystal, we have found the great
est care to be necessary. Its diamagnetic force is so weak,
that the slightest local impurity, contracted by handling or
otherwise, is sufficient to derange its action. The crystals as
they come from the mineralogist are unfit for exact experi
ment. We have found it necessary to boil those which we
have used in muriatic acid, and to scour them afterwards with
fine white sand, reduced to powder in a mortar.             These pre
cautions taken, we have been unable to obtain the results de
scribed by M. Plücker. We have examined five specimens
of topaz from Saxony, the axial dimension of some of them
exceeding the dimension perpendicular thereto by one-half;
the axis, notwithstanding, stands in all cases from pole to pole.
Two specimens of Brazilian topaz, the one of an amber colour,
the other almost as clear as distilled water, give the same re
sults; the axes of the crystals stand from pole to pole, and
turning round makes no difference. On a first examination,
some of the crystals exhibited an action similar to that de
scribed by M. Plücker; after boiling and scouring, these
irregularities disappeared, and they one and all stood axial.
   One crystal in particular caused us considerable embarrass
ment. Its action was irregular, and the irregularity remained
after the adoption of the methods described to ensure purity.
A splinter from one of its sides was found to be attracted,
a splinter from the side opposite was found to be repelled.
To the naked eye the crystal appeared clean and clear. On
examination, however, under a powerful microscope, the side
of the crystal from which the magnetic splinter was taken was
found dotted with small black particles imbedded in its mass;
the other side of the crystal was perfectly transparent. On
cleaving away the impurities, the irregularity vanished, and
the crystal stood as the others.
   In the letter quoted, diopside is pronounced by M. Plücker
to be a positive crystal. On examination with circular polar
ized light, as recommended by Dovet, we find the crystal to
be negative. The same method pronounces topaz, positive,
instead of negative, as affirmed by M. Plücker. The speci
mens we have examined in this way are from Brazil and
              * Phil. Mag., vol. xxxiv. p. 450.

8         Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
Saxony. Aberdeen topaz we have not examined, but it also
is classed by Brewster among positive crystals. The obli
quity of the middle line of topaz does not exist in the speci
mens which have come under our notice; it is exactly per
pendicular to the principal cleavage, and consequently exactly
parallel to the axis of the prism. This agrees with the results
of Brewster, who found the optical axes to be “equally in
clined to the plane of cleavage".”
   In experimenting with weak diamagnetic crystals, the greater
the number of examples the better; as, if local impurity be
present, it is thus more liable to detection. Our results with
heavy spar have been confirmed by ten different crystals; with
coelestine, by five; and with topaz, as has been stated, by seven.
The suspending fibre, in these and similar instances, was a
foot long and gº of an inch thick, or about one-eighth of the
diameter of a human hair.
   Sugar.—It is well known that this crystal forms a prism
with six sides, two of which are generally very prominent, the
principal cleavage being parallel to these two, and to the
wedge-like edge which runs along the end of the prism. The
plane of the optical axes is perpendicular to the axis of the
prism, and their ends may be found by cutting out a plate
parallel to that axis, and inclined to the principal cleavage at
an angle of about 20°. Such a plate exhibits both ring
systems symmetrically, while a plate parallel to the principal
cleavage exhibits one system only. Suspended between the
excited poles, with the axis of the prism horizontal, and the
principal cleavage vertical, the plane of the optical axis stands
axial; according to the law of M. Plücker, it ought to stand
equatorial, for the crystal is negative.
   Rock-crystal (Quartz).-This crystal has undergone more
than one examination by M. Plücker, its deportment being,
“contrary to all expectation,” very weak—a result, it may be
remarked, difficult of explanation on the hypothesis of an
“optic axis force.” M. Plücker's first experiments with this
crystal were apparently made with great exactitude, the cry
stal being reduced to a spherical shape, and the influence of
mere form thus annulled. These experiments proved the
optical axis to be repelled. Later researches, however, in
duced this philosopher to alter his opinion, and accordingly,
in his last memoirt, we find quartz ranked with those crystals
whose optical axes are attracted, with the remark “weak”
added parenthetically. We have not been able to obtain this
             * Lardner's Encyclopaedia, Optics, p. 204.
              t Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. lxxviii. p. 428.

             Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.              9
deportment. After the washing and scouring process, the
finest and most transparent crystals we could procure con
firmed the first experiments of M. Plücker, and therefore
contradict the new modification of his law.     It is almost in
credible how slight an impurity is sufficient to disturb the
action of this crystal. A specimen with smaller crystals at
tached to it, or growing through it, is suspicious and ought
to be rejected. Clear isolated crystals are alone suitable.
We must remark that a fine cube, with faces half an inch
square, suspended with the optic axis horizontal, showed no
directive action; either one or the other of the diagonals set
itself from pole to pole, though the axis ran parallel to four of
the faces.
   As far as it has been practicable, we have cut and cloven,
and examined the optical properties of the crystals which have
passed through our hands ourselves, testing, in every possible
case, the results of others by actual experiment. Most of the
crystals in Brewster's list have been gone through in this
way. Iceland spar, quartz, mica, arragonite, diopside, lepi
dolite, topaz, saltpetre, sugar, sulphate of zinc, sulphate of
magnesia, and others have been examined and verified. In
two cases, however, our results differed from the list, these
being sulphate of nickel and borax. A prism of sulphate of
nickel was suspended from its end between the poles; on ex
citing the magnet it took up a determinate position. When
it came to rest, a line parallel to the magnetic axis was
marked thereon, and a plate taken from the crystal parallel to
this line and to the axis of the prism. Such a plate, ground
thin, exhibited in the polariscope a pair of very beautiful
ring systems. The ring systems of borax were found in a
similar manner.      The middle line, therefore, in both cases
stood equatorial, and, according to the list, would contradict
the law of M. Plücker, for both are there set down as positive.
 A careful examination with circular polarized light led us to
 the opposite conclusion. We thought it worth while to send
 specimens of each to Berlin, so as to have them examined by
 Professor Dove, the author of the method by which we ex
 amined them. The crystals have been returned to us with
 a note certifying that they are negative, and thus confirm
 ing our observations. . This certificate has reached us in the
 form of a private note, but we believe Professor Dove will
 not charge us with imprudence for thus availing ourselves of
 such a high authority as his opinion confessedly is in optical
 matterS.
    Yellow Ferrocyanide of Potassium.—This crystal does not
 stand in the list of Brewster, and we have sought for it in

 10      Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
 other lists in vain. In one German work on physics we find
Blutlaugensalz set down as a negative crystal with one optical
axis, but whether the red or yellow salt is meant, the author
does not explain. We have examined the crystal ourselves,
and find it positive with two optic axes. The middle line
stands perpendicular to the principal cleavage. Suspended
 with this line horizontal, on closing the circuit it sets itself
equatorial. Another exception to the law under considera
tion is here exhibited.
    M. Plücker recommends the magnet as a practical means
of determining whether a crystal is positive or negative; this
method being attended with the peculiar advantage that it
 can be applied in the case of opake crystals, where all the
 ordinary methods fail.   We find accordingly, in his last me
 moir on this subject, metallic and other opake crystals with
optical properties attributed to them. Antimony is negative
with one optic axis; bismuth and arsenic are positive with
one optic axis.     The foregoing experiments demonstrate the
insecurity of the basis on which this classification rests.
    By looking back upon the results described, it will be seen
that we have drawn from each respective class of crystals one
or more examples which disobey the law of M. Plücker.         Of
positive crystals with one axis, we have quartz; of positive
crystals with two axes, we have heavy spar, coelestine and
ferrocyanide of potassium. Of negative crystals with one
axis, we have carbonate of lime and iron, and several others;
of negative crystals with two axes, we have dichroite, sugar,
sulphate of zinc, and sulphate of magnesia. It is due how
ever to M. Plücker to state, that in a considerable number of
cases we have found the law confirmed. Tourmaline, idocrase,
beryl, Iceland spar, saltpetre, arragonite, and many others all
confirm it. Singularly enough, these are the very crystals
with which M. Plücker has experimented.          It is therefore
not to be wondered at, that he should be led by such a mass
of concurring evidence to pronounce his law general. Had
his experiments embraced a sufficient number of cases, they
would doubtless have led him to the same conclusion to which
ours have conducted.
   Mr. Faraday has devoted considerable time to the investi
gation of this intricate subject. His most notable experi
ments are those with bismuth, antimony, arsenic, sulphate of
iron, and sulphate of nickel, which experiments we have care
fully repeated.
   Bismuth.--Crystals of bismuth we have ourselves prepared,
by melting the metal in a Hessian crucible, placed within a
larger one and surrounded by fine sand. In this state it was

              Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.        .. 11
allowed to cool slowly, until a thin crust gathered on the sur
face. At this point the crust was pierced, and the molten
metal underneath poured out, thus leaving the complete cry
stals clustering round the sides and bottom. Our experi
ments with these crystals corroborate, to the letter, those so
minutely described by Mr. Faraday in the Bakerian Lecture
for 1849, delivered before the Royal Society”.
    Arsenic.—Our arsenic we obtained at the druggists. It is
well known that this metal is usually obtained by the sublima
tion of its ore, the vapour being condensed in suitable re
eeivers, where it is deposited in a crystalline form. There is
a difference of opinion between Mr. Faraday and M. Plücker
as regards this metal; the former holding it for diamagnetic,
the latter for magnetic. Several specimens, obtained from
different druggists, corroborated the view of M. Plücker.
They were all magnetic.
    About half an ounce of the metal was introduced into a
glass tube closed at one end and open at the other. About
five inches of the tube, near the open end, was crammed full
of copper turnings, and the open end introduced through a
 small aperture into the strong draft of a flue from a heated
oven. The portion of the tube containing the copper turn
ings was heated to redness, and by degrees the oxygen within
the tube was absorbed.          The arsenic at the other end was
then heated and sublimed. After some time the vapour was
allowed to condense slowly, and a metallic deposit was the
consequence—the arsenic thus obtained was diamagnetic.
 The deportment of the crystal is described by Mr. Faraday
in the place referred to.
    Antimony.—A difference of opinion exists with regard to
 the action of this crystal also. Referring to the deportment
assigned to it by Mr. Faraday, M. Plücker writes, “to my
 astonishment however antimony behaved in a manner directly
 the reverse.     While on the one side a prism of bismuth,
 whose principal cleavage coincided with the base of the prism,
 set itself arial; and on the other side a plate of arsenic,
 which, on account of its magnetism, ought to stand awial, set
 itself equatorial; a plate of antimony deviated completely from
 this deportment, and although the mass was strongly dia
 magnetic, set itself decidedly airial.”
    M. Plücker's results differ from those of Mr. Faraday in
 two particulars; first, a plate of antimony, similar to that de
 scribed by M. Plücker, is found by Mr. Faraday to stand
equatorial instead of avial; second, the following phaenomena,
 observed by Mr. Faraday, appear not to have exhibited
                 * Philosophical Transactions, 1849, p. 1.

12         Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
themselves in M. Plücker's experiments:—“On the develop
ment of the magnetic force, the crystal went up to its position
slowly, and pointed as with a dead set. Other crystals did
the same imperfectly; and others again made one or perhaps
two vibrations, but all appeared as if they were moving in a
thick fluid, and were, in that respect, utterly unlike bismuth,
in the freedom and mobility with which it vibrated. If the
crystalline mass was revolving when the magnetic force was
excited, it suddenly stopped, and was caught in a position
which might, as was found by experience, be any position.
The arrest was followed by a revulsive action on the discon
tinuance of the electric currentº.”
    In most of the specimens examined by us these phaenomena
were also absent, and the results of M. Plücker presented
themselves. Three specimens however behaved exactly in
the manner described by Mr. Faraday, exhibiting a singular
inertness when the magnetic force was present, and a revul
sion from the poles on breaking the circuit. To ascertain, if
possible, the cause of this difference, we dissolved an example
of each class in muriatic acid, precipitated the antimony with
distilled water, and tested the clear filtrate with ferrocyanide
of potassium. The specimen which agreed with M. Plücker
exhibited a faint bluish tint, characteristic of the presence of
iron; that which corroborated Mr. Faraday showed not the
slightest trace of this metal. The iron, though thus revealing
itself, must have been present in a quantity exceedingly mi
nute, for the antimony was diamagnetic. Whether this has
been the cause of the difference between M. Plücker and Mr.
Faraday we will not undertake to say; irregular crystalline
structure may also have had an influence.
    We have here a crowd of examples of crystalline action
in the magnetic field, but as yet not a word of explanation.
M. Plücker's hypothesis has evidently failed... We now turn
to the observations of Mr. Faraday, and shall endeavour to
exhibit, in the briefest manner possible, the views of this pro
found investigator.
    After a general description of the action of bismuth between
the poles, Mr. Faraday writes:—“The results are, altogether,
very different from those produced by diamagnetic action.
 They are equally distinct from those dependent on ordinary
 magnetic action. They are also distinct from those discovered
 and described by Plücker, in his beautiful researches into the
 relation of the optic axis to magnetic action; for there the
 force is equatorial, whereas here it is axial. So they appear
    * Philosophical Transactions, 1849, p. 14. For an explanation see Phi
 losophical Magazine, vol. xxviii. p. 460.

               Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.                13
to present to us a new force, or a new form of force in the
molecules of matter, which for convenience sake, I will con
ventionally designate by a new word, as the magnecrystallic
force*.”
   “The magnecrystallic force appears to be very clearly
distinguished from either the magnetic or diamagnetic forces,
in that it causes neither approach nor recession; consisting
not in attraction or repulsion, but in its giving a certain de
terminate position to the mass under its influence, so that a
given line in relation to the mass is brought by it into a given
relation with the direction of the external magnetic powert.”
   The line through the crystal which sets itself with greatest
force from pole to pole, is termed by Mr. Faraday the magne
crystallic axis of the crystal. He proves by experiment that
bismuth has exactly the same amount of repulsion whether
this axis be parallel or transverse to the lines of magnetic force
acting on it.
   “In other experiments a vertical axis was constructed of
cocoon silk, and the body to be examined was attached to it
at right angles as radius; a prismatic crystal of sulphate of
iron, for instance, whose length was four times its breadth,
was fixed on the axis with its length as radius and its magne
crystallic axis horizontal, and therefore as tangent; then, when
this crystal was at rest under the torsion force of the silken
axis, an electro-magnetic pole was so placed that the axial
line of magnetic force should be, when exerted, oblique to
both the length and the magnecrystallic axis of the crystal;
and the consequence was, that, when the electric current cir
culated round the magnet, the crystal actually receded from
the magnet under the influence of the force, which tended to
place the magnecrystallic axis and the magnetic axis parallel.
Employing a crystal or plate of bismuth, that body could be
made to approach the magnetic pole under the influence of
the magnecrystallic force; and this force is so strong as to
counteract either the tendency of the magnetic body to ap
proach or of the diamagnetic body to retreat, when it is ex
erted in the contrary direction. Hence Mr. Faraday con
cludes that it is neither attraction nor repulsion which causes
the set or determines the final position of a magnecrystallic
 bodyf.”
   “As made manifest by the phaenomena, the magnecrystallic
force is a force acting at a distance, for the crystal is moved
by the magnet at a distance, and the crystal can also move
the magnet at a distance.” Mr. Faraday obtained the latter
result by converting a steel bodkin into a magnet, and suspend
   • Phil. Trans., 1849, p. 4.             # Phil. Trans., 1849, p. 22.

14       Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
ing it freely in the neighbourhood of the crystal. The ten
dency of the needle was always to place itself parallel to the
magnecrystallic axis.
   Crystals of bismuth lost their power of pointing at the mo
ment the metal began to fuse into drops over a spirit-lamp or
in an oil-bath. “Crystals of antimony lost their magnecry
stallic power below a dull red heat, and just as they were
softening so as to take the impression of the copper loop in
which they were hung.” Iceland spar and tourmaline, on
the contrary, on being raised to the highest temperature which
a spirit-lamp could give, underwent no diminution of force;
they pointed equally well as before.
   Mr. Faraday finally divides the forces belonging to crystals
into two—inherent and induced.      An example of the former
is the force by which a crystal modifies a ray of light which
passes through its mass; the second is developed exclusively
by magnetic power. To this latter, as distinct from the other,
Mr. Faraday has given the name magnetocrystallic. To ac
count for crystalline action in the magnetic field, we have,
therefore, the existence of three new <U+017F>orces assumed :—the
optic aris force, the magnecrystallic force, and the magneto
crystallic force.
   With regard to the experimental portion of Mr. Faraday's
labours on this subject, we have only to express our admira
tion of the perfect exactitude with which the results are given.
It appears to us, however, a matter of exceeding difficulty to
obtain a clear notion of any such force as he has described;
that is to say, a force proceeding from the pole of a magnet,
and capable of producing such motions in the magnetic field,
and yet neither attractive nor repulsive.
   That a crystal of bismuth should approach the magnetic
pole, and that a crystal of sulphate of iron should recede
therefrom, appears, at first sight, anomalous, but certainly
not more so than other phaenomena connected with one of
Mr. Faraday’s most celebrated discoveries, and explained in
a beautiful and satisfactory manner by himself.
   If we hang a penny from its edge in the magnetic field, and
so arrange the suspending thread, that the coin, before the
magnetic power is developed, shall make an angle of 45°, or
thereabouts, with the line joining the poles; then, on closing
the circuit, and sending a current round the magnet, the coin
will suddenly turn, as if it made an effort to set itself from
pole to pole; and if its position beforehand be nearly axial,
this effort will be sufficient to set it exactly so; the penny
thus behaving, to all appearance, as if it were attracted by
the poles.
   The real cause of this however is repulsion.      During the

              Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.              15
development of magnetic power, an electric stream is aroused
in the copper coin, which circulates round the coin in a di
rection opposite to that of the current which passes from the
battery round the coils of the magnet. The effect of this in
duced stream is to create a polar axis in the copper; and
when the direction of the stream is considered, it is easy to
see that the north end of this axis must face the north pole
of the magnet, and will consequently be repelled. On looking
therefore at the penny, apparently attracted as above de
scribed, we must, if we would conceive rightly of the matter,
withdraw our attention from the coin itself, and fix it on a
line passing through its centre, and at right angles to its flat
surface; this is the polar axis of the penny, the repulsion of
which causes the apparent attraction.
    We do not mean to say that any such action as that here
described takes place with a bismuth crystal in the magnetic
field. The case is cited merely to show that the “approach "
of the bismuth crystal, noticed by Mr. Faraday, may, be really
due to repulsion; and the “recession” of the sulphate of iron
really due to attraction.
    Our meaning will perhaps unfold itself more clearly as we
proceed. If we take a slice of apple, about the same size as
the penny, but somewhat thicker, and pierce it through with
short bits of iron wire, in a direction perpendicular to its flat
surface, such a disc, suspended in the magnetic field, will, on
the evolution of the magnetic force, recede from the poles and
set itself strongly equatorial; not by repulsion, but by the
 attraction of the iron wires passing through it. If, instead of
 iron, we use bismuth wire, the disc, on exciting the magnet,
 will turn into the axial position; not by attraction, but by
 the repulsion of the bismuth wires passing through it.
    If we suppose the slice of apple to be replaced by a little
cake made of a mixture of flour and iron filings, the bits of
wire running through this will assert their predominance as
before; for though the whole is strongly magnetic, the supe
 rior energy of action along the wire will determine the position
 of the mass. If the bismuth wire, instead of piercing the
 apple, pierce a little cake made of flour and bismuth filings,
 the cake will stand between the poles as the apple stood; for
though the whole is diamagnetic, the stronger action along
 the wire will be the ruling agency as regards position.
    Is it not possible to conceive an arrangement among the
 particles of a magnetic or diamagnetic body, capable of pro
ducing a visible result similar to that here described? If the
 magnetic and diamagnetic forces be associated with the par
 ticles of matter, is it not a reasonable inference, that the closer

  16      Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
 these particles are aggregated, the less will be the obstruction
 offered to the transmission of the respective forces among
 them? It is this closeness of arrangement in the cases just
 cited, which gives to the iron and bismuth wire their predomi
 nance; for the interposed flour particles obstruct the forces in
 all other directions. If, therefore, in a magnetic or diamagnetic
 mass, two directions exist, in one of which the contact of the
 particles is closer than in the other, may we not fairly con
 clude that the strongest exhibition of force will be in the for
 mer line, which therefore will signalize itself between the
 poles, in a manner similar to the bismuth or iron wire? The
 case seems analogous to that of good and bad conductors in
 electricity. This fluid will not quit the good conductor to go
 to the bad. The powder magazine is safe, because the fluid
 prefers the iron rod to any other path. As regards magnet
 ism, different directions, through the same body, may represent
 these good and bad conductors; the line of preference being
 that of closest contact among the material particles.
    If analogic proof be of any value, we have it here of the very
 strongest description. For example:—bismuth is a brittle
 metal and can readily be reduced to a fine powder in a mor
 tar. Let a teaspoonful of the powdered metal be wetted with
 gum-water, kneaded into a paste, and made into a little roll,
 say an inch long and a quarter of an inch across. Hung be
 tween the excited poles, it will set itself like a little bar of bis
 muth—equatorial. Place the roll, protected by bits of paste
board, within the jaws of a vice, squeeze it flat, and suspend
the plate thus formed between the poles. On exciting the
magnet the plate will turn, with the energy of a magnetic sub
stance, into the axial position, though its length may be ten
times its breadth.
    Pound a piece of carbonate of iron into a fine powder, and
form it into a roll in the manner described. Hung between
the excited poles, it will stand as an ordinary magnetic sub
stance—axial. Squeeze it in the vice and suspend it edge
ways, its position will be immediately reversed. On the de
velopment of the magnetic force, the plate thus formed will
recoil from the poles, as if violently repelled, and take up the
equatorial position.
    We have here “approach” and “recession,” but the cause
is evident. The line of closest contact is perpendicular in each
case to the surface of the plate—a consequence of the pressure
which the particles have undergone in this direction; and
this perpendicular stands axial or equatorial according as the
plate is magnetic or diamagnetic. We have here a “a direc
tive force,” but it is attraction or repulsion modified. May

not that which has been here effected by artificial means occur
naturally P. Must it not actually occur in most instances? for,
where perfect homogeneity of mass does not exist, there will
always be a preference shown by the forces for some particular
direction. This election of a certain line is therefore the rule
and not the exception. It will assist both the reader and us
if we give this line a name; we therefore propose to call it
the line of elective polarity. In magnetic bodies this line will
stand axial, in diamagnetic equatorial.
   “The relation of the magnecrystallic force,” says Mr. Fa
raday, “to the magnetic field is axial and not equatorial.”
This he considers to be proved by the following considera
tions:—suppose a crystal of bismuth so suspended that it sets
with its marimum degree of force, then if the point of suspen
sion be moved 90° in the axial plane, so that the line which in
the last case stood horizontal and axial, may now hang verti
cal, then the action is a minimum : now, contends Mr. Fara
day, if the force were equatorial this change in the axial plane
ought not to have affected it; that is to say, if the force act
at right angles to the axial plane, it is all the same which
point of the plane is chosen as the point of suspension.
   This seems a fair conclusion; but the other is just as fair
—that, if the force be axial, a change of the point of suspen
sion in the equatorial plane cannot disturb it. Mr. Faraday
finds the line of maximum force in sulphate of nickel to be
parallel to the axis of the prism. Whatever, therefore, be
the point of suspension in the plane perpendicular to the axis,
the action ought to be the same. On examining this crystal
it will probably be found that two opposite corners of the
parallelopiped are a little flattened.    Let the prism be hung
 with its axis horizontal and this flattening vertical, and after
the evolution of the magnetic force let the oscillations of the
prism be counted.       Move the point of suspension 90° in the
equatorial plane, so that the flattening shall be horizontal, and
again count the oscillations. The numbers expressing the
oscillations in both cases will be very different. The former
will be a maximum, the latter a minimum.        But if the force
be axial this is impossible, therefore the force is not axial.
   Whatever be the degree of conclusiveness which attaches
itself to the reasoning of Mr. Faraday drawn from bismuth ;
precisely the same degree attaches to the above drawn from
sulphate of nickel. The conclusions are equal and opposite,
 and hence destroy each other. It will probably be found that
the reasoning in both cases is entirely correct; that the force
is neither axial nor equatorial, in the sense in which these
terms are used.
   Phil, Mag. S, 3, Vol. 37, No. 247, July 1850.           C

  18      Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
     A number of thin plates, each about half an inch square,
  were cut from almond kernels, with an ivory blade, parallel to
 the cleft which divides the kernel into two lobes.    These were
  aid one upon the other, with an interval of strong gum be
 tween, until a cube was obtained.      A few minutes in the sun
 shine sufficed to render the cube dry enough for experiment.
 Hung between the poles, with the line perpendicular to the
 layers horizontal, on exciting the magnet this line turned and
 set itself parallel to the magnetic resultant passing through
 the mass. The action here was a maximum. Turning the
 cube round 90° in the axial plane, there was scarcely any di
 rective action. If the word “crystal’ be substituted for “cube’
 in the description of this deportment, every syllable of it is
 applicable to the case of bismuth; and if the deportment of
 the crystal warrant the conclusion that the force is axial, the
 deportment of the cube warrants the same conclusion. Is the
 force axial in the case of the cube? Is the position of the
 line perpendicular to its layers due to the “tendency” of
that line to set itself parallel to the magnetic resultant? The
 kernel is strongly diamagnetic, and the position of the per
 pendicular is evidently a secondary result, brought about by
the repulsion of the layers. Is it not then possible, that the ap
proach of the magnecrystallic aris, in bismuth, to the magnetic
resultant, is really due to the repulsion of the planes of clea
vage 2
    But here the experiment with the silken axis meets us;
which showed that so far from attraction being the cause of
action in a magnetic crystal, there was actual recession; and
so far from repulsion being the cause in a diamagnetic crystal,
there was actual approach. This objection it is our duty to
anSWer.
    A model was constructed of powdered carbonate of iron,
about 0.3 of an inch long and 0 1 in thickness, and, by atten
tion to compression, it was arranged that the line of elective
polarity through the model was perpendicular to its length.
Suspending a thread of cocoon silk with a weight at one end
a vertical axis was obtained ; a bit of card was then slit and
fitted on to the axis, so that when the model was laid on one
side, the card stood like a little horizontal table in the middle
of the magnetic field. The length of the model extended from
the central axis to the edge of the card, so that when the
mass swung round, its line of elective polarity was tangent to
the circle described.
   When the model was made to stand between the flat-faced
poles obliquely, the moment the magnet was excited it moved,
tending to set its length equatorial and its line of elective

                Magneto-optic properties of Crystals.                 19
polarity parallel to the lines of magnetic force. In this ex
periment therefore the model of carbonate of iron, though a
magnetic body and strongly attracted by such a magnet as
that used, actually receded from the magnet.
    If, instead of the model of carbonate of iron, we substitute
a crystal of sulphate of iron, we have Mr. Faraday's experi
ment instituted to prove the absence of attraction or repulsion.
The dimensions are his dimensions, the arrangement is his
arrangement, and the deportment is the exact deportment
which he has observed. We have copied his very words,
these words being perfectly descriptive of the action of the
model. If, then, the experiment be “a striking proof that
the effect is not due to attraction or repulsion” in the one
case, it must also be such in the other case; but the able ori
#.         will, we imagine, hardly push his principles so far.
    e will, we doubt not, be ready to admit, that it is more pro
bable that a line of elective polarity exists in the crystal, than
that a magnecrystallic axis exists in the model”.
     By a similar proceeding, using bismuth powder instead of
 carbonate of iron, the action of Mr. Faraday's plate of bis
 muth may be exactly imitated. The objection to the conclusion,
 that the approach of the magnecrystallic aris, in bismuth, to the
 magnetic resultant, is due to the repulsion of the planes of clea
 vage, is thus, we conceive, fairly met.
     Let us look a little further into the nature of this magne
 crystalllic force, which, as is stated, is neither attraction nor
 repulsion, but gives position only. The magnecrystallic axis,
 says Mr. Faraday, tends to place itself parallel to the magnetic
 resultant passing through the crystal; and in the case of a
 bismuth plate, the recession from the pole and the taking up
 of the equatorial position is not due to repulsion, but to the
 endeavour the bismuth makes to establish the parallelism
 before-mentioned. Leaving attraction and repulsion out of
 the question, we find it extremely difficult to affix a consistent
 meaning to the words ‘tends’ and ‘endeavour.” “The force
 is due,” says Mr. Faraday, “to that power of the particles
 which makes them cohere in regular order, and gives the mass
 its crystalline aggregation, which we call at times the attraction
 of aggregation, and so often speak of as acting at insensible
  distances.” We are not sure that we fully grasp the meaning
  of the philosopher in the present instance; for the difficulty
  of supposing that what is here called the attraction of aggre
 gation, considered apart from magnetic attraction or repulsion,
     * The term magnecrystallic axis may with propriety be retained, even
  should our views prove correct; but then it must be regarded as a subde
  nomination of the line of elective polarity.

20        Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
can possibly cause the rotation of the entire mass round an
axis, and the taking up of a fixed position by the mass, with
regard to surrounding objects, appears to us insurmountable.
We have endeavoured to illustrate the matter, to our own
minds, by the action of a piece of leather brought near a red
hot coal.      The leather will be affected and motion caused,
without the intervention of either attraction or repulsion, in
the present sense of these terms; but this motion exhibits
itself in an alteration of shape, which is not at all the case with
the crystal. Even if the direct attraction or repulsion of the
poles be rejected, we do not see how the expressed relation
between the magnecrystallic axis and the magnetic resultant
is possible, without including the idea of lateral attraction
between these lines, and consequently of the mass associated
with the former. In the case of flat poles, the magnetic re
sultant is a straight line from pole to pole across the magnetic
field. Let us suppose, at any given moment, this line and
the magnecrystallic axis of a properly suspended crystal to
cross each other at an oblique angle; let the crystal be for
gotten for a moment, and the attention fixed on those two
lines. Let us suppose the former line fixed, and the latter
free to rotate, the point of intersection being regarded as a
kind of pivot round which it can turn. On the evolution of
the magnetic force, the magnecrystallic axis will turn and set
itself alongside the magnetic resultant. The matter may be
rendered very clear by taking a pair of scissors, partly open,
in the hand, holding one side fast, and then closing them.
The two lines close in a manner exactly similar; and all that
is required to make the illustration perfect, is to suppose this
power of closing suddenly developed in the scissors themselves.
How should we name a power resident in the scissors and
capable of thus drawing the blades together? It may be
called a “tendency,” or an ‘endeavour, but the word attraction
seems to be as suitable as either.
   The symmetry of crystalline arrangement is annihilated by
reducing the mass to powder. “That force among the par
ticles which makes them cohere in regular order” is here in
effective. The magnecrystallic force, in short, is reduced to
nothing, but we have the same results. If, then, the principle
of elective polarity, the mere modification of magnetism or
diamagnetism by mechanical arrangement, be sufficient to
explain the entire series of crystalline phaenomena in the mag
netic field, why assume the existence of this new force, the
very conception of which is attended with so many difficulties**
   * “Perhaps,” says Mr. Faraday, in a short note referring to ‘the strange
and striking character’ of this force, “these points may find their explica
tion hereafter in the action of contiguous particles.”

              Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.              21
  Application of the principle of Elective Polarity to Crystals.
   We shall now endeavour to apply the general principle of
elective polarity to the case of crystals. This principle may
be briefly enunciated as follows:—
   If the arrangement of the component particles of any body be
such as to present different degrees of prorimity in different
directions, then the line of closest provimity, other circumstances
being equal, will be that chosen by the respective forces for the
exhibition of their greatest energy. If the mass be magnetic,
this line will stand awial ; if diamagnetic, equatorial.
    From this point of view, the deportment of the two classes
of crystals, represented by iceland spar and carbonate of iron,
presents no difficulty. Their crystalline form is the same ;
and as to the arrangement of the particles, what is true of one
will be true of the other. Supposing, then, the line of closest
proximity to coincide with the optic axis; this line, according
to the principle expressed, will stand axial or equatorial, as
the mass is magnetic or diamagnetic, which is precisely what
the experiments with these crystals exhibit.
    Analogy, as we have seen, justifies the assumption here
made. It will, however, be of interest to inquire, whether
any discoverable circumstance connected with crystalline for
mation exists, upon which the difference of proximity de
pends; and, knowing which, we can pronounce with tolerable
certainty, as to the position which the crystal will take up in
the magnetic field.
    The following experiments will perhaps suggest a reply.
    If a prism of sulphate of magnesia be suspended between
the poles with its axis horizontal, on exciting the magnet the
axis will take up the equatorial position. This is not entirely
due to the form of the crystal; for even when its axial dimen
 sion is shortest, the axis will assert the equatorial position ;
thus behaving like a magnetic body, setting its longest dimen
 sion from pole to pole.
    Suspended from its end with its axis vertical, the prism will
take up a determinate oblique position. When the crystal has
 come to rest, let that line through the mass which stands
 exactly equatorial be carefully marked. Lay, a knife-edge
 along this line, and press it in the direction of the axis. The
 crystal will split before the pressure, disclosing a shining sur
 face of cleavage. This is the only cleavage the crystal pos
 sesses, and it stands equatorial.
    Sulphate of zinc is of the same form as sulphate of magnesia,
  ad its cleavage is discoverable by a process exactly similar

22        Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
to that just described. Both crystals set their planes of clea
vage equatorial. Both are diamagnetic.
    Let us now examine a magnetic crystal of similar form.
Sulphate of nickel is, perhaps, as good an example as we can
choose. Suspended in the magnetic field with its axis hori
zontal, on exciting the magnet the axis will set itself from pole
to pole; and this position will be persisted in, even when the
axial dimension is shortest.      Suspended from its end, the cry
stalline prism will take up an oblique position with considerable
energy. When the crystal thus suspended has come to rest,
mark the line along its end which stands arial. Let a knife
edge be laid on this line, and pressed in a direction parallel to
the axis of the prism. The crystal will yield before the edge,
and discover a perfectly clean plane of cleavage.
    These facts are suggestive. The crystals here experimented
 with are of the same outward form; each has but one cleavage;
 and the position of this cleavage, with regard to the form of
 the crystal, is the same in all.    The magnetic force, however,
 at once discovers a difference of action.     The cleavages of the
 diamagnetic specimens stand equatorial ; of the magnetic, arial.
    A cube cut from a prism of scapolite, the axis of the prism
 being perpendicular to two of the parallel faces of the cube,
 suspended in the magnetic field, sets itself with the axis of the
 prism from pole to pole.
     A cube of beryl, of the same dimensions, with the axis of
 the prism from which it was taken also perpendicular to two
 of the faces, suspended as in the former case, sets itself with
 the axis equatorial. Both these crystals are magnetic.
     The former experiments showed a dissimilarity of action
 between magnetic and diamagnetic crystals. In the present
 case both are magnetic, but still there is a difference; the axis
 of the one prism stands axial, the axis of the other equatorial.
  With regard to the explanation of this, the following fact is
  significant. Scapolite cleaves parallel to its axis, while beryl
  cleaves perpendicular to its axis; the cleavages in both cases,
  therefore, stand axial, thus agreeing with sulphate of nickel.
  The cleavages hence appear to take up a determinate position,
  regardless of outward form, and seem to exercise a ruling
  power over the deportment of the crystal.
     A cube of saltpetre, suspended with the crystallographic axis
  horizontal, sets itself between the poles with this axis equa
 torial.
     A cube o <U+017F>topaz, suspended with the crystallographic axis
  horizontal, sets itself with this axis from pole to pole.
     We have here a kind of complementary case to the former.
  Both these crystals are diamagnetic. Saltpetre cleaves parallel

               Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.                     23
to its axis; topaz perpendicular to its axis. The planes of
cleavage, therefore, stand in both cases equatorial, thus agree
ing with sulphate of zinc and sulphate of magnesia”.
    Where do these facts point? A moment’s speculation will
perhaps be allowed us here. May we not suppose these cry
stals to be composed of layers indefinitely thin, laid side by
side, within the range of cohesion, which holds them together,
but yet not in absolute contact? This seems to be no strained
idea; for expansion and contraction by heat and cold compel
us to assume that the particles of matter in general do not
touch each other; that there are unfilled spaces between them.
In such crystals as we have described, these spaces may be
considered as alternating with the plates which compose the
crystal. From this point of view it seems very natural that
the magnetic laminae should set themselves axial, and the dia
magnetic equatorial; for in crossing transverse to the cleavage,
the respective forces would encounter the obstacle presented
by the intervening spaces; while in the direction parallel to
the cleavages no such obstacle exists+.
    We have a very fine description of sand-paper here. The
sand or emery on the surface is magnetic, while the paper
itself is comparatively indifferent. By cutting a number of
stripes of this paper, an inch long and a quarter of an inch
wide, and gumming them together so as to form a parallelo
piped, we have a model of magnetic crystals which cleave
parallel to their axes; the layer of sand representing the mag
netic crystalline plate, and the paper the intermediate space
between two plates. For such a model one position only is
possible between the poles, the axial. If, however, the paral
lelopiped be built up of squares, equal in area to the cross
section of the model just described, by laying square upon
square until the pile reaches the height of an inch, we have a
model of those magnetic crystals which cleave perpendicular
to their axes. Such a model, although its length is four times
its thickness, and the whole strongly magnetic, will, on closing
the circuit, recede from the poles as if repelled, and take up
   * Topaz possesses other cleavages, but for the sake of simplicity we have
not introduced them; more especially as they do not appear to vitiate the
action of the one introduced, which is by far the most complete.
   t In these speculations we have made use of the commonly received
notion of matter. Mr. Faraday, for reasons derived from electric conduc
tibility, and from certain anomalies with regard to the combinations of
  otassium and other bodies, considers this notion erroneous. Nothing,
<U+017F>º could be easier than to translate the above into a language agree
ing with the views of Mr. Faraday. The intervals of space between the
laminae would them become intervals of weaker force, and the result of
our reasoning would be the same as before.

24        Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
the equatorial position with great energy. . The deportment
of the first model is that of scapolite; of the second, that of
beryl. By using a thin layer of bismuth paste instead of the
magnetic sand, the deportment of saltpetre and topaz will be
accurately imitated.
    Our fundamental idea is, that crystals of one cleavage are
made up of plates indefinitely thin, separated by spaces indefi
nitely narrow. If, however, we suppose two cleavages existing
at right angles to each other, then we must relinquish the notion
of plates and substitute that of little parallel bars; for the
plates are divided into such by the second cleavage. If we
 further suppose these bars to be intersected by a cleavage at
right angles to their length, then the component crystals will
be little cubes, as in the case of rocksalt and others.    By thus
increasing the cleavages, the original plates may be subdivided
indefinitely, the shape of the little component crystal bearing
 special relation to the position of the planes”. It is an infer
ence which follows immediately from our way of viewing the
subject, that if the crystal have several planes of cleavage, but
all parallel to the same straight line, this line, in the case of
magnetic crystals, will stand axial; in the case of diamagnetic,
equatorial. It also follows, that in the so-called regular cry
 stals, in rock-salt, for instance, the cleavages annul each other,
and consequently no directive power will be exhibited, which ,
 is actually the case. Everything which tends to destroy the
 cleavages tends also to destroy the directive power; and here
the temperature experiments of Mr. Faraday receive at once
their solution. Crystals of bismuth and antimony lose their
directive power just as they melt, for at this particular instant
the cleavages disappear. Iceland spar and tourmaline, on the
contrary, retain their directive power, for in their case the
cleavages are unaffected. The deportment of rock crystal,
whose weakness of action appears to have taken both Mr.
 Faraday and M. Plücker by surprise—as here the optic axis
force, without assigning any reason, has thought proper to
absent itself almost totally—follows at once from the homo
geneous nature of its mass; it is almost like glass, which pos
sesses no directive power; its cleavages are merely traces of
cleavage. If, instead of possessing planes of cleavage, a cry
stal be composed of a bundle of fibres, the forces may be ex
pected to act with greater energy along the fibre than across
it. Anything, in short, that affects the mechanical arrange
ment of the particles will affect, in a corresponding degree,
the line of elective polarity. There are crystals which are
both fibrous and have planes of cleavage, the latter often per
                * See the last note at bottom of page 23.

               Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.                    25
pendicular to the fibre; in this case two opposing arrange
ments are present, and it is difficult to pronounce beforehand
which would predominate*.
   The same difficulty extends to crystals possessing several
planes of cleavage, oblique to each other, and having no com
mon direction. In many cases, however, the principle may
be successfully applied. We shall content ourself in making
use of it to explain the deportment of that class of crystals, of
which, as to form, Iceland spar is the type.
    For the sake of simplicity, we will commence our demon
stration with an exceedingly thin rhombus cloven from this
crystal. Looking down upon the flat surface of such a rhom
bus, what have we before us? It is cleavable parallel to the
four sides.      Hence our answer must be, “an indefinite num
ber of smaller rhombuses held symmetrically together by the
force of cohesion.”       Let us confine our attention, for a mo
ment, to two rows of these rhombuses; the one ranged along
the greater diagonal, the other along the less. A moment's
consideration will suffice to show, that whatever be the num
ber of small rhombuses supposed to stand upon the long
diagonal, precisely the same number must fit along the short
one; but in the latter case they are closer together. The matter
may be rendered very plain by drawing a lozenge on paper,
with opposite acute angles of 77°, being those of Iceland spar.
Draw two lines, a little apart, parallel to two opposite sides of
the lozenge, and nearly through its centre; and two others,
the same distance apart, parallel to the other two sides of the
figure. The original rhombus is thus divided into four smaller
ones; two of which stand upon the long diagonal, and two
upon the short one, each of the four being separated from
its neighbour by an interval which may be considered to re
present the interval of cleavage in the crystal. The two which
stand upon the long diagonal, L, have their acute angles op
posite; the two which stand upon the short diagonal, S, have
their obtuse angles opposite. The distance between the two
former, across the interval of cleavage, is to the distance be
tween the two latter, as L is to S, or as the cosine of 38° 30'
to its sine, or as 4:3. We may conceive the size of these
rhombuses to decrease till they become molecular; the above
ratio will then appear in the form of a differential quotient,
but its value will be unaltered. Here, then, we have along
the greater diagonal a row of magnetic or diamagnetic mole
cules, or ‘centres of force,” to use a term of Mr. Faraday's,
the distance between each two being represented by the figure
   * It is probable that the primitive plates themselves have different ar
rangements of the molecules along and across them.

 26       Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
 4; and along the short diagonal a row of molecules, the di
 stance between each two being represented by the figure 3.
 In the magnetic field, therefore, the short diagonal will be
 the line of elective polarity; and in magnetic crystals will
 stand axial, in diamagnetic equatorial, which is precisely the
 case exhibited by experiment. Thus the apparent anomaly
 of carbonate of lime setting its long diagonal axial, and car
 bonate of iron its short diagonal axial, seems to be fully ex
 plained; the position of the former line being due, not to any
 endeavour on its part to stand parallel with the magnetic re
 sultant, but being the simple consequence of the repulsion of
 the short diagonal.
    These conclusions are corroborated by experiment. Let a
 rhombus be cut from pasteboard, of the same shape as a
 rhombus of Iceland spar. Along the greater diagonal, fix
 six or eight small magnetic pellets, and along the short
 diagonal the same number. If this rhombus be suspended
 horizontally in the magnetic field, on closing the circuit the
 short diagonal will set itself from pole to pole. If pellets of
 bismuth be used, the same diagonal will stand equatorial.
    There is no difficulty in extending the reasoning used above
to the case of full crystals. If this be done, it will be seen
 that the line of closest proximity coincides with the optic axis,
which axis, in the magnetic field, will signalize itself accord
ingly. A remarkable coincidence exists between this view
and that expressed by Mitscherlich in his beautiful investiga
tions on the expansion of crystals by heat”. “If,” says this
gifted philosopher, “we imagine the repulsive force of the
particles increased by the accession of heat, then we must
conclude that the line of greatest expansion will be that in
which the atoms lie most closely together.” This line of
greatest expansion Mitscherlich found, in the case of Iceland
spar, to coincide with the optic axis. The same conclusion
has thus been arrived at by two modes of reasoning, as differ
ent as can well be conceived.
   If, then, speculation and experiment concur in pronouncing
the line of closest proximity among the particles, to be that in
which the magnetic and diamagnetic forces will exhibit them
selves with peculiar energy, thus determining the position of
the crystalline mass between the poles, we are furnished with
a valuable means of ascertaining the relative values of this
proximity in different directions through the mass. An order
of contact might, perhaps, by this means be established, of
great interest in a mineralogical point of view. In the case of a
right rhombic prism, for example, the long diagonal of the base
            * Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. x, p. 138.

              Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.            27
may denote a line of contact very different from that denoted
by the short one; and the line at right angles to the diagonals,
that is, the axis of the prism, a contact very different from
both. We can compare these lines two at a time. By hang
ing the short diagonal vertical in the magnetic field, its rota
tory power is annulled, and we can compare the long diagonal
and the axis. By hanging the long diagonal vertical, we can
compare the short diagonal and the axis. By hanging the
axis vertical, we can compare the two diagonals. From this
point of view the deportment of heavy spar and coelestine, so
utterly irreconcileable with the assumption of an optic axis
force, presents no difficulty. If we suppose the proximity
along the axis of the prism to be intermediate between the
proximities along the two diagonals, the action of both cry
stals follows as a necessary consequence. Suspended from
one angle, the axis must stand from pole to pole; from the
other angle, it must stand equatorial.

between two bits of glass and pressed to the thickness of a
quarter of an inch. It was then set edgeways between the
plates and pressed again, but not so strongly as in the former
case. A model of heavy spar was cut from the mass, so that
the shorter diagonal of its rhombic base coincided with the
line of greatest compression; the axis of the model with the
direction of less compression, and the longer diagonal of the
base with that direction in which no pressure had been ex
erted. When this model was dried and suspended in the mag
netic field, there was no recognizable difference between its de
portment and that of heavy spar.
    When a crystal cleaves symmetrically in several planes, all
parallel to the same straight line, and, at the same time, in a
direction perpendicular to this line, then the latter cleavage,
 if it be more eminent than the former, may be expected to
 predominate; but when the cleavages are oblique to each other,
 the united action of several minor cleavages may be such as
 to overcome the principal one, or so to modify it that its action
 is not at all the same as that of a cleavage of the same value
 unintersected by others. A complex action among the par
 ticles of the crystal itself may contribute to this result, and
 possibly in some cases modify even the influence of proximity.
 If we hang a magnetic body between the poles, it always shows
 a preference for edges and corners, and will spring to a point
 much more readily than to a surface. Diamagnetic bodies
 will recede from edges and corners. The fluid is, as it were,
 discharged with greater power from a point. A similar action
 among the crystalline particles may possibly bring about the
 modification we have hinted at.

28       Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
   During this investigation a great number of crystals have
passed through our hands, but it is useless to cumber the reader
with a recital of them. The number of natural crystals have
amounted to nearly one hundred; while, through the accus
tomed kindness of Professor Bunsen, the entire collection of
artificial crystals, which his laboratory contains, has been
placed at our disposal”.
   We now pass over to a brief examination of the basis on
which the second law of M. Plücker rests:—the affirmation
that the magnetic attraction decreases in a quicker ratio than
the repulsion of the optic axes. The ingenuity of this hypo
thesis, and its apparent sufficiency to account for the phaeno
mena observed by M. Plücker, are evident. It will be seen,
however, that this repulsion arises from quite another cause—
a source of error which, unfortunately, has run undetected
through the entire series of this philosopher's inquiries.
   The following experiment is a type of those which led M.
Plücker to the above conclusion. A tourmaline crystal 36
millimeters long and 4 millimeters across was brought between
a pair of pointed moveable poles, so that it could barely swing
between them. It set itself avial. On removing the poles to
a distance and again exciting the magnet the crystal stood
equatorial. The same occurred, if the poles were allowed to
remain as in the former case, when the crystal was raised
above them or sunk beneath them. According as the crystal
was withdrawn from the immediate neighbourhood of the poles,
it turned gradually round and finally set itself equatorial+.
    A similar action was observed with staurolite, beryl, ido
crase, smaragd, and other crystals.
    We have repeated these experiments in the manner de
scribed, and obtained the same results. A prism of tourma
line three-quarters of an inch long and a quarter of an inch
across was hung between a pair of poles with conical points,
placed an inch apart. On exciting the magnet the crystal
stood axial. When the poles were withdrawn to a distance
and the force again evolved, the same crystal stood equatorial.
An exceedingly weak current was here used; a single cell of
Bunsen's construction being found more than sufficient to
produce the result.
    According to the theory under consideration, the tourma
line, in the first instance, stood from pole to pole because the
magnetism was strong enough to overcome the repulsion of
the optic axis. This repulsion, decreasing more slowly than
   * We gladly make use of this opportunity to express our obligation to
Dr. Debus, the able assistant in the chemical laboratory.

the magnetic attraction, necessarily triumphed when the poles
were removed to a sufficient distance. The same crystal,
however, between a pair of flat poles, could never take up the
axial position. On bringing the faces within half an inch of
each other, and exciting the magnet by a battery of thirty
two cells, the crystal vibrated between the faces without
touching either. The same occurred when one cell, six cells,
twelve cells, and twenty cells, respectively, were employed. ,
   If the attraction increases, as stated, more quickly than the
hypothetic repulsion, how can the impotence of attraction in
the case before us be accounted for? We have here a power
ful current, and poles only half an inch apart; power and
proximity work together, but their united influence is insuffi
cient to pull the crystal into the axial line. The cause of the
phaenomena must it seems be sought, not in optic repulsion,
but in the manner in which the magnetic force is applied.
The crystal is strongly magnetic, and the pointed poles exer
cise a concentrated local action.        The mass of both ends of
the crystal, when in the neighbourhood of the points, is power
fully attracted, while the action on the central parts, on ac
count of their greater distance, is comparatively weak. Be
tween the flat poles the crystal finds itself, as it were, totally
immersed in the magnetic influence; its entire mass is equally
affected, and the whole of its directive power developed. The
similarity of action between the flat poles and the points, with
drawn to a distance, is evident.        In the latter case, the force,
radiating from the points, has time to diffuse itself, and fastens
almost uniformly upon the entire mass of the crystal, thus
calling forth, as in the former case, its directive energy; and
the equatorial position is the consequence. The disposition
of the lines of force, in the case of points, is readily observed
by means of iron filings strewed on paper and brought over
the poles. When the latter are near each other, on exciting
the magnet the filings are gathered in and stretch in a rigid
line from point to point; according as the poles are with
drawn, the magnetic curves take a wider range, and at length
attain a breadth sufficient to encompass the entire mass of the
crystal *.
   As the local attraction of the mass in the case of magnetic
crystals deranges the directive power and overcomes it, so
will the local repulsion of the mass in diamagnetic crystals.
A prism of heavy spar, whose length was twice its breadth,
hung from its acute angle, stood between the flat poles axial,
between the points equatorial. On making its length and

field of uniform force.”—Phil. Trans., 1849, p. 4.

30        Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the
breadth alike, the axis of the prism stood from pole to pole,
whether the conical points or flat faces were used. Shorten
ing the axial direction a little more, and suspending the cry
stal from its obtuse angle, the axis between the flat poles stood
equatorial, and, consequently, the longest dimension of the
crystal, axial ; between the points, owing to the repulsion of
the extreme ends, the length stood equatorial. Similar ex
periments were made with coelestine and topaz; but all with
the same general result.
    “I had the advantage,” says Mr. Faraday, “ of verifying
Plücker's results under his own personal tuition, in respect of
tourmaline, staurolite, red ferrocyanide of potassium, and
Iceland spar. Since then, and in reference to the present
inquiry, I have carefully examined calcareous spar, as being
that one of the bodies which was at the same time free from
magnetic action, and so simple in its crystalline relations as
to possess but one optic axis.
    “When a small rhomboid about 0.3 of an inch in its
greatest dimension is suspended with its optic axis horizontal
between the pointed poles of the electro-magnet, approximated
as closely as they can be to allow free motion; the rhomboid
sets in the equatorial direction, and the optic axis coincides
with the magnetic axis; but if the poles be separated to the
distance of a half or three-quarters of an inch, the rhomboid
turned through 90° and set with the optic axis in the equato
rial direction, and the greatest length axial. In the first in
stance the diamagnetic force overcame the optic axis force;
in the second the optic axis force was the stronger of the two.”
    The foregoing considerations will, we believe, render it
 very clear that the introduction of this optic axis force is al
together unnecessary; the case being simply one of local re
pulsion. Mr. Faraday himself found that the crystal between
the flat poles could never set its optic axis from pole to pole;
between the points alone was the turning round of the crystal
possible. We have made the experiment. A fine large cry
 stal of Iceland spar, suspended between the near points, set
 its optic axis from point to point; between the distant points
 the axis stood equatorial. The crystal was then removed
 from the magnetic field, placed in an agate mortar and
 pounded to powder. The powder was dissolved in muriatic
acid. From the solution it was precipitated by carbonate of
 ammonia.     The precipitate thus obtained, as is well known,
is exactly, of the same chemical constitution as the crystal.
 This precipitate was mixed with gum water and squeezed in
 one direction. From the mass thus squeezed a model of Ice
land spar was made, the line of greatest compression through

               Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals.            31
 the model coinciding with that which represented the optical
 axis. This model imitated, in every respect, the deportment
 observed by Mr. Faraday. Between the near points the opti
cal axis stood from point to point, between the distant points
 equatorial. It cannot however be imagined that the optic
 axis force survived the pounding, dissolving and precipitating.
 Further, this optic axis force is a sword which cuts two ways;
if it be assumed repulsive, then the deportment of carbonate
of lime and iron is unexplainable; if attractive, it fails in the
case of Iceland spar.
    It is a remarkable fact, that all those crystals which exhibit
this phenomenon of turning round, cleave, either perpendi
cular to their axes, or oblique to them, furnishing a resultant
which acts in the direction of the perpendicular. Beryl is an
example of the former; the crystal just examined, Iceland
spar, is an example of the latter. This is exactly what must
have been expected. In the case of a magnetic crystal, clea
vable parallel to its length alone, there is no reason present
why the axial line should ever be forsaken. But if the clea
vages be transverse, or oblique, so as to furnish a line of elec
tive polarity in the transverse direction, two diverse causes
come into operation. By virtue of its magnetism, the crystal
seeks to set its length axial, as a bit of iron or nickel would
do; but in virtue of its mechanical structure, it seeks to place
a line at right angles to its length axial. For the reasons
before adduced, if the near points be used, the former is tri
umphant; if the points be distant, the latter predominates.
   We noticed in a former paper a description of gutta-percha
of a fibrous texture, which, on being suspended between the
poles, was found to transmit the magnetic force with peculiar
facility along the fibre. A piece was cut from this substance,
exactly the same size as the tourmaline crystal, described at
the commencement of this section.        The fibre was transverse
to the length of the piece. Suspended in the magnetic field,
the gutta-percha exhibited all the phaenomena of the crystal.
   One of the sand-paper models before described is still more
characteristic as regards this turning round on the removal
of the poles to a distance. We allude to that whose magnetic
layers of emery are perpendicular to its length. The deport
ment of this model, if we except its greater energy, is not to
be distinguished from that of a prism of beryl. Between the
near points both model and crystal stand axial, between the
distant points equatorial, and between the flat poles the de
portment, as before described, is exactly the same. The
magnetic laminae of beryl occupy the same position, with re
gard to its axis, as the magnetic laminae of the model, with

regard to its axis. There is no difference in construction,
save in the superior workmanship of nature, and there is no
difference at all as regards deportment. Surely these consi
derations suggest a common origin for the phaenomena exhi
bited by both.
   We have the same action in the case of the compressed
dough, formed from the powdered carbonate of iron and bis
muth.     A plate of the former, three-quarters of an inch
square and one-tenth of an inch in thickness, stands between
the conical poles, brought within an inch of each other, ex
actly axial; between the same poles, two inches apart, it
stands equatorial. A plate of compressed bismuth dough
stands, between the near points, equatorial, between the di
stant points, axial.
   Any hypothesis which solves these experiments must em
brace crystalline action also ; for the results are not to be
distinguished from each other. But in the above cases an
optic action is out of the question. With the similarity of
structure between beryl and the sand-paper model, above
described,—with the complete identity of action which they
exhibit, before us; is it necessary, in explanation of that ac
tion, to assume the existence of a force which, in the case of
the crystal, is all but inconceivable, and in the case of the
model is not to be thought of? In his able strictures on the
theory of M. Becquerelº, M. Plücker himself affirms, that
we have no example of a force which is not associated with
ponderable matter. If this be the case as regards the optic
axis force, if the attraction and repulsion attributed to it be
actually exerted on the mass of the crystal, how is it to be
distinguished from magnetism or diamagnetism 2 The as
sumption of Mr. Faraday appears to be the only refuge here;
the abandonment of attraction and repulsion altogether.
   In the first section of this memoir it has been proved, by
the production of numerous exceptions, that the law of M.
Plücker, as newly revised, is untenable. It has also there
been shown, that the experiments upon which Mr. Faraday
grounds his hypothesis of a purely directive force, are refer
able to quite another cause. In the second section an attempt
has been made to connect this cause with crystalline structure,
and to prove its sufficiency to produce the particular phaeno
mena exhibited by crystals. In the third section we find the
principle entering into the most complicated instances of these
phaenomena, and reducing them to cases of extreme simpli
city. The choice therefore rests between the assumption of
three new forces which seem but lamely to execute their mis

 sion, and that simple modification of existing forces, to which
 we have given the name elective polarity, and which seems
 sufficiently embracing to account for all.
    It appears then to be sufficiently established, that from the
 deportment of crystalline bodies in the magnetic field, no di
 rect connexion between light and magnetism can be inferred.
 A rich possession, as regards physical discovery, seems to be
 thus snatched away from us; but the result will be compen
 satory. That a certain relation exists, with respect to the
path chosen by both forces through transparent bodies, must
be evident to any one who carefully considers the experiments
described in this memoir.          The further examination of this
deeply interesting subject we refer to another occasion.
    Nature acts by general laws, to which the terms great and
small are unknown; and it cannot be doubted that the modi
fications of magnetic force, exhibited by bits of copperas and
sugar in the magnetic field, display themselves on a large
scale in the crust of the earth itself. A lump of stratified grit
exhibits elective polarity. It is magnetic, but will set its
planes of stratification from pole to pole, though it should be
twice as long in the direction at right angles to these planes.
A new element appears thus to enter our speculations as to
the position of the magnetic poles of our planet; the influence
of stratification and plutonic disturbance upon the magnetic
and electric forces.

  II. Notices of a late Visit to the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.
             By JAMES BRyce, Jun., M.A., F.G.S.*
THE        Lochaber glens have been subjected to so keen a
        scrutiny by the advocates for the various theories of the
Parallel Roads, that it cannot be expected there should remain
many facts of importance to be yet ascertained. By this cir
cumstance, however, the obligation upon an observer at once
to make known such facts as may have come under his notice
is rendered more imperative, while the value of new facts is
enhanced.      Observations, which in other circumstances would
be scarcely deemed worthy of record, become of importance
when viewed in connexion with an inquiry such as this, which,
after all the discussion elicited by it, still remains the great
unsolved problem of Scottish geology. In submitting the fol
lowing communication, it is not my purpose to advance a new

34            Mr. J. Bryce's Notices of a late Visit
theory. I have merely in view the much more humble object
of putting on record a few facts, which seem to have escaped
the notice of previous observers; and of offering, in connexion
with these, some remarks on the two theories last proposed.
 I refer to those of Mr. Chambers of Edinburgh, and Mr.
James Thomson of Glasgow, both published early in 1848;
 the latter immediately before my visit, which took place in
July of that year. My examination of the district had thus
additional interest given to it, as the facts were to be viewed
under a somewhat novel aspect, and had not yet been com
mented on by any geologist, with reference to their bearing
upon the two theories in question.
    Mr. Chambers's account of the Parallel Roads, with his
theory of their origin, forms a portion (pp. 95–130) of his
valuable and beautifully illustrated work on Ancient Sea
 Margins. A map of part of Lochaber, showing the shelves
 in the glens, is given at the end. It has been “constructed
by Messrs. W. and A. K. Johnston under the direction of
 Sir George McKenzie, Bart., David Milne, Esq., and Robert
 Chambers, Esq.” The same map accompanies a late paper
on the Parallel Roads, by Sir George McKenzie (Ed. N. Phil.
Journ., vol. xliv.); it is that to which Mr. Milne refers in his
late important paper (Ed. N. Phil. Journ, vol. xliii. p. 839);
and on which the reasonings of Mr. James Thomson are
founded, an enlarged copy of it having been laid before the
 Royal Society of Edinburgh along with his paper.
    Now, this map contains an important topographical error,
calculated to mislead those who may frame theories of the
Roads without having made a personal inspection of the ground.
The error consists in this—that at its junction with Glen
 Fintec, Glen Gluoy is laid down as opening towards Loch
Lochy; whereas, in point of fact, the high ridge descending
from the table-land at the top of Glen Toorat, and shutting
in Glen Gluoy on the west, continues its course southwards
fully a mile below the point where Glen Fintec opens into
Glen Gluoy. Glen Fintec is thus completely cut off from direct
connealion with Loch Lochy, the ridge in question being con
tinuous throughout, and rising to the height of from 1200 to
1800 feet above the sea, or from 300 to 700 feet above the
upper shelf. The rocks of which the ridge consists are chiefly
micaceous slate and quartzite, the strata being nearly on end,
and ranging in the direction of the ridge, or about S.W. I
could detect no traces of scratching or grooving, though the
rocks are laid bare in many places, and strew the surface in
huge flat masses.
   The error now pointed out involves another in the repre

               to the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.              35
sentation of a portion of the upper shelf. The eastern portion
is correctly represented as terminating at the south-west corner
of Glen Fintec ; but on the west side, the shelf, instead of ter
minating as expressed on the map, is continued a considerable
distance southwards of the opening of Glen Fintec, from half
a mile to a mile, or perhaps more; at first less distinct than
usual, then more plainly marked, till coming against a rocky
projecting ledge on the hill side, it fails as usual to impress it,
and is seen no more.
    On referring lately to Sir T. D. Lauder's map accom
panying his paper (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. for 1817), which
I had not looked into before visiting the Parallel Roads, I
found that his representation of this portion of the district is
much more correct. Glen Gluoy is given in its true dimen
sions; and the stream formed by the union of the Gluoy
and Fintec waters is laid down as turning, at a place called
Lowbridge, round the southern termination of the moun
tainous ridge just described, and discharging into Loch Lochy,
nearly opposite to a village named Kyle-Rose in Mr. Cham
bers's map. This representation is very near the truth; but
perhaps too great extension is given to the southern part of
 Loch Lochy.
    One of the principal objections which has been urged against
 Mr. Milne's theory, is the absence from the district of a suffi
cient quantity of detrital matter to account for the barriers at
 the mouths of the glens, required by the theory. The force
 of this objection would be very much diminished, if we could
 receive Mr. Chambers's account of the hill of Oonchan as cor
 rect.   It appears to me, however, that he quite over-estimates
 the amount of detritus in this hill.
    After giving a full and accurate description of the other
 principal detrital accumulations of the district, Mr. Chambers
 thus notices the hill of Oonchan:—“By far the grandest delta
 of the district is that hill which has been referred to under
 the name of Unichan as occupying so much of the lower part
 of Glen Spean. This is a mass of gravel 11 miles long by
 perhaps 2 broad, and reaching an elevation of 612 feet. . I
 observed rock rising through it at one place; but it is mainly,
 as has been said, a hill of gravel.” He considers that “when
 the sea stood somewhat above 622 feet (and there is evidence
 of its having paused long at 628 or 630), the rivers descending
 from the Ben Nevis group of mountains delivered their spoils
 into the estuary filling Glen Spean: on the withdrawal of the
 sea this mass was left.”
    The high ground in question, part only of which is called
  Oonchan, is an undulating ridge parallel to the main chain,
                                 D 2

36                  Mr. J. Bryce's Notices of a late Visit
and stretching from near Fort William to within 1% mile of
the bridge of Roy, a distance of about 12 miles. Such sub
ordinate elevations are seen at the base of almost every high
chain, and mark the axes along which the upheaving forces
acted with decreasing intensity. This ridge is separated from
the main chain by a slightly depressed tract, having a very
smooth outline, into which five glens descending from the Ben
 Nevis group open at right angles, the surface presenting no
marked change of character at the junction. The streams
from these glens, as well as those which drain the tract itself,
being prevented by the high ground in front from following
direct courses to the valley of the Spean, are deflected to the
east and west, parallel to the high ground on either side. The
watershed of the tract being nearer the western than the east
ern end, and the inclination eastwards slight, there is an im
perfect discharge of the waters, and consequently extensive
swamps have been formed, which sometimes become lakes.
The annexed sketch will give an idea of the outline of the
surface.

     On the western part of the ridge the rock is seen in many
places; and about the middle I found it a little lower than
the highest point, c, of the ridge at that part; and I think
there can be little doubt that the thickness of the detrital
covering is in most places inconsiderable. At its eastern ter
mination detritus appears in more imposing quantity. Near
the bridge of Roy the end of the ridge is cut through by
numerous streams, or rather the channels of streams; for
there is often no water, and the detritus stands out in nume
ºus round or elliptic flat-topped mounds with steep sides.

are smaller, and of rounder forms, resembling Danish raths;

while further back the detritus only shows itself in terraces,
formed by the streams cutting into the talus at the base of the
high mountains.          -
   Mr. Chambers regards the question of the origin of the
Parallel Roads as “involved in that of the superficial forma
tions generally, which bear the marks of former levels of the
sea at various intervals up to 1200 feet;” the various mark
ings in the three kingdoms, in France, &c., “all falling into
such conformity as to prove that the shift of level has been
effected from at least that height with perfect equability
throughout.” He considers this widely extended and strongly
marked conformity “as more favourable to the idea of a re
cession of the sea as opposed to that of an elevation of the
land, since it is precisely what would result from the former
operation, while there is an obvious difficulty in supposing”
that so large a portion of the earth's crust could be repeatedly
upheaved, and yet the relative levels so preserved “that be
tween Paris and Inverness not a vertical foot of derangement
could be detected.”
   The explanation of the origin of the Parallel Roads is thus
mixed up with, indeed forms an essential part of his general
theory. And whatever difficulty geologists may feel in giving
their assent to such generalizations as those just quoted, or how
ever unwilling they may be, in the present state of inquiry, to
admit many successive equable sinkings of the waters of the
ocean all over the globe, the same difficulties and hesitation inust
be experienced in receiving Mr. Chambers's explanation as the
true theory of the Parallel Roads. Besides, the speciality of
the phaenomena is by no means accounted for on this hypo
thesis. It appears to me to require a special local cause.
On the hypothesis of the shelves being formed by the sea, it
cannot, I think, be shown why other Highland glens were not
equally impressed; or that any conservative influences have
operated in Lochaber, which were not just as likely to prevail
in other places. This argument cannot be properly estimated
by one who has not seen the shelves in Glen Roy and Glen
Gluoy; from examining sea and lake-terraces, from descrip
tions and drawings, the faintest conceptions only can be formed
of the wonderful reality.     Any one on whose view the scene
which is presented on turning the flank of Bohuntine hill,
bursts for the first time, must look with the deepest astonish
ment at the distinctness, continuity, and extent of the shelves;
he will feel how inadequate were all his conceptions, and
how little the Parallel Roads have in common with any appear
ances which have come under his notice before.          Mr. Cham
bers eloquently describes the first impressions, and acknow

38           Mr. J. Bryce's Notices of a late Visit
ledges the “singular distinctness” of the shelves in this loca
lity; yet his theory affords no explanation of a phaenomenon
so remarkable. But this argument has been so ably handled
by Mr. Milne in his reply to Mr. Darwin (Ed. N. Phil. Journ.,
vol. xliii. p. 487), that it is unnecessary to insist further
upon it.

Spean, which Mr. Chambers lays so much stress upon as sup
porting his view, I did not notice. “The whole,” he says,
“might appear doubtful to many persons; in an unfavourable
light, a hasty observer might pass them by altogether unno
ticed.” These may have been my circumstances, and I do
not therefore question the existence of such markings; but I
cannot regard the conclusion as warranted by the facts—the
existence, namely, “in Glen Spean of a body of water at
levels above the barriers assigned to it by McCulloch, Lauder
and Milne.” Are not these and similar slight and local mark
ings best explained on the received theory,+the action of cur
rents upon the submerged land, or the occasional pauses in
the process of elevation 2
   While thus dissenting from the theoretical conclusions at
which Mr. Chambers has arrived, I cannot forbear to express
my high admiration of his patient and active research,-his
clear, truthful, and eloquent descriptions,—and of the service
he has rendered to geology by his many exact measurements,
and by proposing a theory which will lead to a more careful
study of phaenomena of this class.
   The lake theory has gained immensely of late by the ad
vocacy of Mr. David Milne. His paper, already referred to,
is perhaps the most able which has been written upon the
Parallel Roads. The evidence in support of his own views has
been collected with the greatest sagacity, and the arguments
founded upon it conducted with consummate skill; while he
appears to me to have completely demolished both the theory
of Mr. Darwin, and the glacial theory, in the form proposed
by M. Agassiz. The agency assigned by Agassiz will not
explain all the phaenomena, and is positively inconsistent with
many facts. But it does not hence follow that glacial action
is to be rejected, as explaining the blocking up of the mouths
of the glens,—for it is required for this purpose alone. May
not a form be given to the theory which will adapt it to all
the exigencies of the case, and thus remove from the lake
theory the one great remaining objection—the origin and the
disappearance of the enormous earthy barriers at the mouths
of the glens? Since Agassiz wrote, the question has been
placed on a very different footing. The first glacialist in

               to the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.              39
Europe, Prof. J. D. Forbes, has given it as his decided opinion
that glaciers formerly existed on the Cuchullin hills in Skye
(Ed. N. Phil. Journ, vol. xl. p. 79). Why, then, may not
masses of ice have filled the still higher valleys of the Ben
Nevis group of mountains? Professor Forbes's late discoveries
in Switzerland respecting the viscidity of glacier ice, and the
nature of glacier motion, appear to have suggested to Mr.
James Thomson the highly ingenious modification of the
glacial theory lately proposed by him (Ed. N. Phil. Journ.,
vol. xlv. p. 49). The gist of this theory is contained in the
following passage:—
   “In Switzerland the mean temperature of the compara
tively low and flat land is so much above the freezing-point,
that the ice no sooner descends from the mountains than it
melts away; and it is thus usually prevented from spreading
to any considerable extent over the plains. In the Antarctic
continent, on the contrary, the mean temperature is nowhere
so high as the freezing-point. The ice, therefore, which de
scends from the hills unites itself with that which is deposited
from the atmosphere on the plains; and the whole becomes
consolidated into one continuous mass, of immense depth,
which glides gradually onwards towards the ocean . . . . Now
a climate somewhere intermediate between these extremes
appears to be that which would be requisite to form the shelves
in the glens of Lochaber. The climate of Switzerland would
be too warm to admit of a sufficient horizontal extension of
the glaciers; that of the Antarctic continent too cold to allow
the lakes to remain unfrozen.     If the climate of Scotland were
again to become such that the mean temperature of Glen
Spean would be not much above the freezing-point, there
seems to be every reason to believe that that glen would again
be nearly filled with an enormous mass of ice; while its upper
parts, and also Glen Roy, would be occupied by lakes . . . .”
   The state of things here supposed is extremely critical; not
likely long to maintain itself under the same geographical dis
tribution of the surface as now prevails, and liable to be
changed by many slight causes. If the mean temperature of
Glen Spean was little above freezing, and wide fields of ice
covered its surface, it is not probable that the lakes in the
glens, at considerably higher levels, would long remain unfrozen;
and if the Ben Nevis group of mountains, whose mean height
we may take at somewhat less than 4000 feet, not only nou
rished glaciers in their higher recesses, but were wholly enve
loped in sheets of ice, can we suppose that the mountains sur
rounding Glen Roy and Glen Gluoy, many of which attain
the altitude of from 2000 to 2500 feet, would not likewise give

 40           Mr. J. Bryce's Notices of a late Visit
 origin to masses of ice, descending into the glens, and occu
 pying the very sites of our supposed lakes? On the other
 hand, it may be stated in favour of Mr. Thomson's views, that
 the hypothesis of Glen Spean being “filled with an enormous
 mass of ice’ which would block up Glen Roy, is more con
 sistent with the geography of the district, than the supposition
 that a glacier descended from one of the high valleys of the
 Ben Nevis group, and forced its way into the opening of Glen
 Roy. There is nothing in the nature of the country to deter
 mine a glacier to follow such a course. The form of the sur
 face between the Lochaber glens and the Ben Nevis group is
 such, that if a glacier descended from any one of the five
 great glens, whose directions are inclined to that of Glen Roy
 at an angle of 60 or 70 degrees, and reached the open country
 at the base of the mountains, there would be nothing to deter
 mine its course up Glen Roy, or indeed in any one direction
 more than another, except the slight eastward and northward
 slope already described. Glaciers descending from these
 glens would thus coalesce into one huge sheet, coextensive
 with the valley of the Spean. The hypothesis of sheets of ice
covering the whole surface—“des grandes nappes de glace”—
seems also more consistent with the absence of “perched           -
blocks” and moraines, than the idea of separate glaciers.
These are not seen anywhere over the surface of the open
tract between the mountains and the river; and the peculiar
detrital covering is very like that which would be formed under
such advancing sheets, most of it being stratified sand and
 small gravel, the result of wearing, or decomposition in situ.
    Mr. Thomson's explanation of the phaenomena of Glen
 Gluoy is very ingenious. It will be remembered that these
are peculiar. The shelves do not correspond with those in
the other glens; and while in the latter each successive shelf,
as we descend, extends further down the glens than those that
are higher, in Glen Gluoy the upper shelf extends further
towards the mouth of the glen than the lower; and this lower
shelf, unlike all the others, is not in connexion with any sum
mit level. If the lake theory be true, it will follow from these
facts that the barrier which retained the water at the lower
level was further up the glen than that which retained it at
the higher; and that when the lower shelf was forming, the
overflow must have taken place at the mouth of the glen.
Mr. Thomson supposes “that the glacier which occasioned
the formation of the higher of the Glen Gluoy shelves had at
some former period protruded a terminal moraine as far up
the glen as the termination of the lower shelf; that, on the
final retiring of the glacier, this old moraine served as a bar

               to the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.             41
rier to dam up the water to the level of the lower shelf, and
that it has been subsequently washed away by the river flowing
over it.” He then suggests that the space between the termi
nations of the upper and lower shelves should be examined,
to ascertain if the remains of such a moraine exist.      I made
this examination with considerable care, but could find no
such remnants. There is some detritus in the main glen op
posite the mouth of Glen Fintec; but it has obvious reference
to the present drainage, and is in no way remarkable. The
whole of Glen Gluoy is indeed singularly free from detritus;–
a peculiarity which I consider due to its form. It is narrow,
and the hills rise steep and high from the very margin of
the river, so that there is no space where detritus could rest;
and it is thus swept away as soon as it is brought down. This
circumstance is also favourable to the rapid and complete
removal of such a moraine, or barrier, as Mr. Thomson sup
poses may have once existed. The mouth of the glen is
equally free from detritus, or other indications of the existence
of earthy barriers in a former condition of things.
    “A glacier occupying the present site of Loch Lochy, and
receiving supplies from the neighbouring mountains, would
appear,” Mr. Thomson says, “to afford a sufficient explana
tion of the phaenomena observed in this glen.” This was
probably written under the impression that Glen Fintec com
municated with Loch Lochy, and that the mouth of Glen
 Gluoy was in the way of a glacier advancing from that lake.
 But this is not the case. A glacier having its origin among
 the high mountains to the N.W. of Loch Lochy—the only
hills high enough to produce one—and advancing from Loch
Lochy, must make its way past Maucomer and Brecklech up
 the valley of the Spean, for so only will the levels permit.
 This direction is about perpendicular to that of Glen Gluoy;
and it would be only a lateral branch or arm, parting from
the main body, that could penetrate that glen. The mouth
 of the glen is narrow, and the hill sides rise steep and high;
 a little way up there is a considerable bend before we reach,
 at a mile's distance, the bosom or sinus in the hill side, where
 the moraine is conceived to have existed in connexion with
 the lower shelf. All this shows the improbability of a moraine
 being deposited at this place; and that recourse may as well
 be had to the masses of ice with which Glen Spean has been
 supposed to be filled, from its chief source in the Ben Nevis
 group. But it seems impossible that such masses of ice could
 deposit a moraine in the situation required; and it even ap
 pears doubtful whether sheets of ice would deposit moraines
 at all.

42     Dr. Ballot on the importance of Deviations from the mean
    I do not feel myself competent to express a decided opinion
upon this “vexed question;” but regarding the lake theory
 as the true one, I think it now only remains to be determined
 whether the barriers at the mouths of the glens consisted of
 ice or of earthy materials. Perhaps we know nearly as much
 regarding the latter as we ever can know; but the valley of
the Spean has never been carefully examined, with reference
 to the former passage of glaciers through it, by one fully com
petent to the task. Till this has been done, geologists are
not in a position to decide between the rival theories.
 III. On the great importance of Deviations from the mean
    state of the Atmosphere for the Science of Meteorology. By
    Dr. BUYS BALLOT*.
Tºº             are some points in meteorology which certainly
       are no longer disputed, but which nevertheless are not
always sufficiently present to the minds of meteorologists, nor
so publicly pronounced and admitted as to compel them to
action, and serve as a torch to illumine the path leading to
the penetralia of science. Though these facts may appear
simple, particularly in England, where they have been treated
upon, still even there it cannot be considered superfluous to
view them in another light, and to introduce them in connexion
with a Dutch prize question, which, in my opinion, is the
most important meteorological question that can be brought
forward, and which fully characterizes the new meteorological
period developed by Dove.
   On the other hand, England has such boundless merits as
to meteorological observations, and has such great facilities,
in consequence of her extensive influence and wide-spread
observatories, for the application of those facts in all parts
of the earth, that she has a right to receive information,
through her own periodicals, of what is taking place on the
continent. I therefore decided (on being solicited by the
Society of Physics of Berlin to send in annually a report of,
and opinions on, what might occur in meteorology) to adopt
also for insertion in an English periodical, by modifying some
points of less interest, a paper drawn up for the Journal of
the Society, Die Fortschritte der Physik. The truths to which
I allude were particularly remarked by me in 1846, when I
wrote my work Les Changements Périodiques de Température
dépendants de la nature du Soleil et de la Lune déduits d'ob
servations Neerlandaises de 1729–1846, in which those parti
               * Communicated by the Astronomer Royal.

   state of the Atmosphere for the Science of Meteorology. 43
culars are to be found, chapter vii. p. 104 et seq. But let us
proceed to those propositions.
   I. The average temperature which prevails at any certain
place is not that which is generated there by the action of the
sun, &c., and which would depend simply on the latitude and
the elevation of the ground, but is remarkably changed by the
influences of other regions, particularly by the action of the
winds.
   II. That average temperature, such as it is obtained any
where from observations during a series of years, for the dif
ferent months or days of the year, will by no means always
prevail at those places for the determined month or day of
each single year. On the contrary, observations give gene
rally great variations; and it is precisely the magnitude of
these variations which it is of the utmost importance to learn.
    III. What we asserted regarding the temperature in pro
position II. applies equally to all meteorological indications;
it is of great importance to become acquainted with those va
riations of the barometer, and of the force and direction of
the wind.
    IV. The most efficient means for prognosticating the
weather are, the employment of the electric telegraphs and of
self-registering instruments, because they facilitate and make
possible a tabular union of the variations mentioned in II.
and III.
    In the following remarks these propositions are more fully
developed.
    Art. I. No one can call in question our first proposition,
we shall not therefore demonstrate it; we will only observe,
that it is the winds that modify this temperature; we will en
deavour to ascertain how much is to be ascribed to each wind.
    Let 6) represent for longer, 0 for shorter spaces of time, the
mean theoretical temperature of a place, and let MT and mt
represent the mean temperature deduced from long series of ob
servations, OT and ot the observed mean temperature for that
 longer or shorter space of time at the same place in a given
 year; then we need only annex some distinctive symbols to
 these three signs in order to show of which space of time we
 are speaking. Therefore, when we speak of years or seasons,
 we shall annex the first letters of the words year, y; winter, w;
spring, sp. ; summer, su, ; autumn, a, at the foot of the great
 letters; and when we speak of months, we shall annex the
 first letter of the name of the month after the small letters.
 Thus Oy will signify the mean temperature of the year, $f the
 mean temperature of February, which ought to prevail at a
 certain place, if that place did not receive warmth from and

 44    Dr. Ballot on the importance of Deviations from the mean
impart warmth to the surrounding parts: it will readily be per
 ceived that these values must ever be the same for each place
 situated in the same latitude and elevation above the sea.     On
 what does it depend that MTy and mt<U+017F> are not found alike in
 all the places in the same parallel, but always different in every
different place; lower in this, higher in that, than Qy and
$f? If there was a parallel circle which extended wholly over
a continent, or if we passed regularly over a parallel circle in
a ship, and if we determined the MTy in n different selected
                      XM
places, then would       <U+017F>º    be nearly expressed by Qy; the
value so obtained would, however, be somewhat greater than
Oy, because there is more air drawing towards the north than
towards the south over a whole parallel circle, that southern
air at the same time being warmer; and also because, near
the equator, the latent heat which is employed in the vapori
zing of water is greater than that which is freed by rain; and,
on the contrary, in higher latitudes there is more freed than
expended on the formation of vapour. This is also a cause
why on the land Qy must be something less than at sea. If
we would nicely calculate this influence, we ought equally to
distinguish between rain that is formed in different altitudes.
Properly we ought to infer theoretically Oy, and equally so
ºf, from the warmth which emanates from the sun to us every
day; from the warmth which every day and night issues from
beneath the surface of earth; and from the warmth that is
produced by animals, consumed by plants, lost by radiation,
given by condensation of vapour. The difference between Oy
so obtained, and MTy, (MTy–Oy), at a certain place, is to be
ascribed to the influence of the wind during the year; simi
larly, mtf–ºf is the influence of the wind which prevails in
February at that place. How far we are as yet from such a
determination may be seen, for example, from the meteorology
of the late illustrious Daniell.    But even if it could be ob
tained, it would, however, not be fit for a great space of time;
for certain it is, that the resultant of the winds of a whole year
would not have the same influence on the temperature as the
different components. This will appear more evident to any
one who directs his attention to the differences miy—09,
mtf–ºf, mijl—jl, &c. He would find, not only for every
place, but also for every month of the year, different influences
for the same wind; the same wind producing a different cool
ing or heating power in different seasons, a circumstance of
which account is not taken in computing the resultant.
    Art. II. We will suppose that not only 6) and 0, but also MT
and mt were obtained at a certain place from a long series of

   state of the Atmosphere for the Science of Meteorology.        45
observations, that MT therefore could be considered as the
equilibrial state of temperature at a determined season of the
year at that place; then we should find that the differences
OT-MT, ot–mt are to be ascribed to these circumstances:—
1st, that the winds had not in that space of time the same
direction as usual; and 2nd, that the distribution of tempe
rature at the surrounding places was quite different from the
usual distribution during that space of time, or shortly before.
Thus it is necessary that we know the variations, not only for
the place itself for which we desire to explain the temperature,
but also for the surrounding places, since the variations at the
first place must be explained partly from the variations at the
latter. The most important causes are always to be sought
in the variations (deviations); it is from those that we must
derive the exhibition of the state of temperature, not from the
absolute observed temperature. Even now, when we give
absolute temperatures, we do in fact give deviations; namely,
deviations from the arbitrary zero of temperature. Positive
prognostications will always be given under the form of de
viations, and best by deviations from the mean state of the
atmosphere. Certainly it were to be wished that we better
understood the theoretical temperature (69), which must take
place for certain soils and elevations above the sea, and for
every latitude, in order also to be able to give the deviations
from those theoretical values; but for want of that knowledge
the deviations from the mean value are the main points for con
sideration.
   Art. III. Temperature is that state which most attracts
the attention of the public, in consequence of the immediate
influence it has on the relations of human life; but scientifi
cally, all states are equally important. The pressure of vapour
is perhaps the most uncertain element, and of which we can
give little explanation, from the manner in which it is mea
sured; electricity is not anywhere (with exception of Brussels
and Kew) sufficiently known either as to its origin or as to its
quantity; it is not therefore expected that the deviations of
these elements can be given. It is the winds that bring us the
warm air and cold waves; they must be accurately noted as to
direction and strength, but it will avail little to give their devia
tions from the mean direction; the winds must therefore be
noted with their real directions. On the contrary, as to the
barometer, the deviations again are of the greatest importance,
especially as here the theoretical state is known for every lati
tude. Everywhere, where attention has been paid to the de
viations of the barometer, which at the same time have been
observed at different places or successively at the same place,

46     Dr. Ballot on the importance of Deviations from the mean
it has led, in connexion with the observation of the wind, to
  ractical discoveries.     Who knows not the fruits of the labours
of Redfield, Reid, Piddington, Thom 2 In later times also,
the investigations of Mr. Birt on the atmospheric waves, which
in November pass over England and Europe, are only de
duced from the knowledge of the deviations.
   As we must give so much importance to the deviations of
the barometer and thermometer as to assert that they are ap
plicable in most meteorological investigations; as we further
consider how much trouble it causes for a calculator to sub
tract the value obtained from every observation which he uses
from the mean value at that place for that day, whilst the
observer can so very easily, whilst he is noting his observa
tions, note in a column next to it the difference from the mean,
we dare propose and urgently invite the observer everywhere,
where the mean of each day is sufficiently known, or even
where this is known with some approximation, to take this
little trouble. We should then, after a lapse of five or ten
years, be able to modify the mean of the temperature, and
then to determine it with greater certainty. A book that con
tains such means for every day of the year for many places
would certainly be a most useful book; and if one once pos
sessed that, then it would be sufficient for the observers to
communicate the deviations; from time to time the correc
tions could be published in the form of supplements.
   Art. IV. England has given the example of communicating
the state of the weather” at a certain instant in all parts of the
country, at least to Glasgow, by means of telegraph, as I saw
to my surprise in the Greenock Daily News. My propo
sition made in the Changements de Température was actually
in operation. Later I have also learned that that plan is like
wise proposed to the British Association: thus the communi
cation of the weather becomes more scientific than it hitherto
had been. Telegraphs can, better than self-registering instru
ments, answer the purpose of approaching to a foretelling of
the weather at all places before it exists there; they give us
the opportunity of being informed of the weather before it has
passed from one place to another. We can be on our guard
and arrange our occupations (our observations in the first place)
accordingly; remarkable phaenomena will be noticed by dif
ferent observers in corresponding manners at different places,
and many other advantages will result. It is true, we shall
  * This publication was principally planned and is carried into execution
by the proprietors of the London Daily News. The report of the state of
the weather at 9" in the morning at numerous places is published every
day in that journal.—G. B. AIRY.

  state of the Atmosphere for the Science of Meteorology.     47
be able likewise to see from the graphic self-registering instru
ments the state of the weather at every instant at all places
where they exist (and this is the main point of agreement of
both), but only long after those circumstances are past; from
the telegraphs we are acquainted with it instantaneously. It
will yet be some time, we avow it, before we become sufficiently
acquainted with the laws of the transit of the states of the
weather, to be able to foretell with any certainty even from the
known state of the weather at the neighbouring places (particu
larly, also, because to the class of “surrounding places” belong
the places above us, and the winds and temperature reigning
there); but we shall never arrive at this point except by means
of exhibition of simultaneous observation.     When we draw a
series of theoretical deductions from a given distribution of
meteorological indications (wind, heat, pressure, &c.), and
compare them with the subsequent distribution which is really
found to follow as an effect of the first, we cannot fail to pe
netrate better the origin and influence of the winds, and more
over the variations of temperature produced by them.
   Therefore it will be of importance to improve our graphic
methods of representing simultaneous observations, and either
by that means or by numbers to exhibit those states in a
tabular form. As to the graphic method, it is to be seen in
the articles of Mr. Birt, Report of the Meeting of the British
Association, 1844, 1845, &c., that there is a want of a uniform
method for noting three or more variations at the same time.
A good graphic method would have enabled Mr. Birt to com
municate more in fewer pages, and to put every reader in a
state to try his conclusions and to extend them.
   Martins, in his annotations to the translation of Kämtz, has
endeavoured to exhibit more than three variations at the same
time; but that method, in our opinion, is not very clear.
   Since the investigation of the great November atmospheric
wave is probably to be continued, it is perhaps not inconsistent
to propose another manner of exhibiting it. We can form a
map of all the places where observations are made, and give
to each place a sign, for example (a), (b), &c.; then the posi
tion of those signs in the other part of the drawing must ex
press the height of the barometer at those so indicated places
in the following manner. Let us draw round that map a circle,
which we consider as the section of a vertical cylinder, in the
plane of which those places are situated; let us further sup
pose that at the places (a) (b) the barometers are placed with
the lower surface of the mercury in the same plane of that
circular section; so will the top of the highest standing baro
meter lie in a plane parallel to the first, and give a circular

48    Dr. Ballot on the importance of Deviations from the mean
section of the cylinder; the distance between the two circles
will be proportional to the height of the barometer at that
place. This will be true for all places; and the height of the
letters or signs (a) (b) noted at the respective sections in the
surface of the cylinder would indicate the height of the baro
meter at those places. If we imagine our eye in the axis of
the cylinder, and we project those supposed points (a) (b)
on the horizontal plane, or what is the same thing, if we apply
the method of descriptive geometry to this, the greater or
lower height of the barometers at (a)(b) will be represented by
points, a, 3, in circles concentric with the first, but more or
less removed, whose distance from the first (the difference of
the radius) will be proportional to that height. So the first
circle may represent a very low barometrical height, as 730 mil
limetres, and each millimetre that the barometer in (a) or (b)
is higher may be represented by one or two millimetres’ di
stance of the circle (2) or (3) from the first. But we can go a
step further; we can divide those circles from the common
centre point into a number of sectors, thirty sectors I suppose:
in one sector the letters may signify the height of the baro
meter at the 20th of October, in another at the 21st, and so
on; every sector may be applied to one day. So we shall
have the barometrical range at every one place, and the differ
ent states at the different places simultaneously, equally well
and clearly represented, while the map within the circle indi
cates the distribution with respect to the surface of the earth.
If, by chance, the points (a) in the different sectors lie in a
circle, it indicates that the barometer at a has not varied du
ring the month; if they lie in an ellipse, then there have been
two highest and two lowest states; we see immediately those
heights and the dates. So, as to the simultaneous comparison
of the barometer heights, the eye catches immediately the let
ters that are higher or lower, and we see on the map in the
middle the line of places where the barometer was at the high
est or the lowest. If there actually is a wave, then it is clearly
exhibited thus to the eye; if the eye has difficulty in discern
ing the wave, then probably there is no wave, or perhaps that
wave must have been marked out by the foregoing or following
days.
   It is even possible to go a step further, and, for example,
to represent at the same time the thermometer state by the
distances at which we set the letters (a), (b) (the signs of
the places) from the radii which divide the circle; the more
on the right, for example, the higher the state of the ther
mometer.      It is evident, however, that the more variations
we exhibit, the more is lost in simplicity. We could have

   state of the Atmosphere for the Science of Meteorology.   49
represented also latitude, longitude, time, barometer, ther
mometer. How much soever we improve the graphic repre
sentation, we must however always, where there is not merely
a view required but an accurate calculation, have recourse to
a tabular exhibition. To promote this, the Utrecht Provin
cial Society for Arts and Sciences has issued the following
prize question:—
   Since the usual indications of thermometer, barometer, and
anemometer throughout the year, that is, the periodical func
tions by which those indications are expressed, are now known
for a great number of places, at least with approximation, and
thus a sufficient basis is laid for the investigation of non
periodical changes; the Society wishes—
   After having calculated the mean indications of thermo
meter, barometer and anemometer, over as great a number of
places as possible in Europe and Asiatic Russia for periods of
five days for two successive years,
   1. The deviations of thermometer and barometer from their
above-described usual state in each of those periods, should
be united in tables;
   2. The manner of transit of those deviations in time and
space should be investigated; and
   3. Those deviations should be compared and brought in
connexion with the winds that prevailed during each of the
said periods, and with the deviation from their usual direction
which they exhibited.
   The importance of this prize proposition in connexion with
the various researches which are required for its investigation,
has induced the author of this question to augment the offered
prize with one hundred and fifty guilders. It is wished that
the answer be received before October 1, 1851, by M. C. von

and Sciences.     The name of the author, as usual, in a sepa

 IV. On the Triadic Arrangements of Seven and Fifteen
                 Things. By A. CAYLEY, Esq.”
THERE          is no difficulty in forming with seven letters,
       a, b, c, d, e,f, g, a system of seven triads, containing
every possible duad; or, in other words, such that no two
triads of the system contains the same duad. One such system,
for instance, is
                 abc, ade, afg, bdf; beg, cdg, cef;
and this is obviously one of six different systems obtained by
permuting the letters a, b, c, We have therefore six different
systems containing the triad abe; and there being the same
number of systems containing the triads abd, abe, alf and abg
respectively, there are in all thirty-five different systems, each
of them containing every possible duad. It is deserving of
notice, that it is impossible to arrange the thirty-five triads
formed with the seven letters into five systems, each of them
possessing the property in question. In fact, if this could be
done, the system just given might be taken for one of the
systems of seven triads. With this system we might (of the
systems of seven triads which contain the triad abd) combine
either the system
                 abd, acg, af, bee, b/g, def; deg,
or the system
                 abd, acf. aeg, beg, bef, dce, dfg.
   But any one of the other abd systems would be found to
contain a triad in common with the given abc system, and
therefore cannot be made use of. For instance, the system
abd, acg, aef, bef, beg, dce, d<U+017F>g contains the triad beg in com
mon with the given abc system; and whichever of the two
proper abd systems we select to combine with the given abc
system, it will be found that there is no abe system which does
not contain some triad in common, either with the abc system
or with the abd system.
   The order of the letters in a triad has been thus far dis
regarded. There are some properties which depend upon
considering the triads obtained by cyclical permutations of the
three letters as identical, but distinct from the triads obtained
by a permutation of two letters or inversion. Thus abc, bea,
cab are to be considered as identical inter se, but distinct from
the triads acb, cba, bac, which are also identical inter se.     I
write down the system (equivalent, as far as the mere combi
nation of the letters is concerned, to the system at the com

 derived, it is to be observed, from a pair of triads, ade, afg,
 by a cyclical permutation of the e,f, g, and by successively
changing the a into b and c, the remaining triad of the system
being the letters a, b, c taken in an inverse order. Let it be
 proposed to derive the system in the same manner from any
 other two triads of the system; for instance, from the triads
acb, ade. The process of derivation gives
                  acb, ade, ged, geb, fee, fbd, fga”,
which is, in fact, the original system. But attempt to derive
the system from the two triads elig, efc, the process of deriva
 tion gives
                  ebg, efc, döf, dog, abe, agf, ade,
which is not the original system, inasmuch as the triads dif,
dog, abe, ag fare inversions of the triads baf, cdg, cba, a<U+017F>g of
the original system. The point to be attended to, however,
is, that both triads of the pair dif, dog, or of the pair abc, agf,
are inversions of the triads of the corresponding pair in the
original system; the pair is either reproduced (as the pair efc,
dbf), or there is an inversion of both triads. Where there is
no such inversion of the triads of a pair, the system may be
said to be properly reproduced; and where there is inversion
of the triads of one or more pairs, to be improperly reproduced.
There is no difficulty in seeing that the system is properly
reproduced from a pair of triads containing in common any
one of the letters a, b, c or d, and improperly reproduced from
pairs of triads containing in common any one of the letters d,
e or f. It is owing to the reproduction, proper or improper,
of the system from any pair of duads that it is possible to
form a system of “octaves” analogous to the quaternions of
Sir William Hamilton; the impossibility of a corresponding
system of fifteen imaginary quantities arises from the circum
stance of there being always, in whatever manner the system
of triads is formed, an inversion of a single triad of some one
or more pairs of triads containing a letter in common. When
the system is considered as successively derived from different
pairs, the system is not according to the previous definition
reproduced either properly or improperly. A system of triads
having the necessary properties with respect to the mere com
bination of the letters (viz. that 23) and 28s being any two
triads having a letter in common, there shall be triads such

as {3}, ºys, and M3s, myº) may easily be found; the system to
be presently given of the triads of fifteen things would answer
the purpose.       And so would many other systems.
    Dropping the consideration of the order of the letters which
form a triad, I pass to the case of a system of fifteen letters,
a, b, c, d, e,f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o. It is possible in this
case, not only to form systems of thirty-five triads containing
every possible duad, but this can be done in such manner that
the system of thirty-five triads can be arranged in seven systems
of five triads, each of these systems containing the fifteen let
ters”. My solution is obtained by a process of derivation
from the arrangements ab. cf. dg. eh and ab. cd. ef.gh as
follows; viz. the triads are

and a system formed with i, j, k, l, m, n, o, which are then
arranged—

an arrangement, which, it may be remarked, contains eight
different systems (such as have been considered in the former
part of this paper) of seven letters; viz. of the letters i, j, k,
l, m, n, o, and of seven other sevens, such as i, j, k, a, b, c, f.
The theory of the arrangement seems to be worth further in
vestigation.
    Assuming that the four hundred and fifty-five triads of
fifteen things can be arranged in thirteen systems of thirty-five
triads, each system of thirty-five triads containing every pos
sible duad, it seems natural to inquire whether the thirteen
systems can be obtained from any one of them by cyclical per
mutations of thirteen letters. This is, I think, impossible.
For let the cyclical permutation be of the letters a, b, c, d, e,f,
   * The problem was proposed by Mr. Kirkman, and has, to my knowledge,
excited some attention in the form “To make a school of fifteen young
ladies walk together in threes every day for a week so that each two may
walk together.” It will be seen from the text that I am uncertain as to
the existence of a solution to the further problem suggested by Mr.
Sylvester, “to make the school walk every week in the quarter so that
each three may walk together.”           -

g, h, i, j, k, l, m. Consider separately the triads which contain
the letter n and the letter of neither of these systems of triads
contains the letter, whatever it is, which forms a triad with n
and o. Hence, omitting the letters n, o, we have two different
sets, each of them of six duads, and composed of the same
twelve letters. And each of these systems of duads ought, by
the cyclical permutation in question, to produce the whole
system of the seventy-eight duads of the thirteen letters.

and consequently the duads of each set ought to be situated
one duad in each line. Suppose the sets of duads are com
posed of the letters a, b, c, d, e,f, g, h, i, j, k, l, it does not
appear that there is any set of six duads composed of these
letters, and situated one duad in each line, other than the
single set al, bk, cy, di, eh, fg; and the same being the case
for any twelve letters out of the thirteen, the derivation of the
thirteen systems of thirty-five triads by means of the cyclical
permutations of thirteen letters is impossible. And there does
not seem to be any obvious rule for the derivation of the thir
teen systems from any one of them, or any prima facie reason
for  º:           that the thirteen systems do really exist, it having
been already shown that such systems do not exist in the case
of seven things.

V. On some remarkable effects of Lightning, observed in a
   Farm-house near Moniemail, near Cupar-Fife.               Communi
   cated by WILLIAM THoMson, Esq., M.A., Fellow of St.
   Peter's College, Cambridge, and Professor of Natural Phi
   losophy in the University of Glasgow”.                 -
     HE following is an extract from a letter, addressed last
        autumn to me, by the Rev. Mr. Leitch, minister of
Moniemail parish:-
                                     “Moniemail Manse, Cupar-Fife,
                                            August 26, 1849.

 house in my immediate neighbourhood. I called shortly
 afterwards and brought away the wires and the paper which
 I enclose. * *
    “I have some difficulty in accounting for the appearance of
 the wires. You will observe that they have been partially fused;
 and when I got them first, they adhered closely to one another.
 You will find that the flat sides exactly fit. They were both
 attached to one crank, and ran parallel to one another. The
 question is, how were they attracted so powerfully as to be
 compressed together? # *
    “You will observe that the paper is discoloured. This
 has been done, not by scorching, but by having some sub
 stance deposited on it. There was painted wood also dis
 coloured, on which the stratum was much thicker.       It could
 easily be rubbed off, when you saw the paint quite fresh be
neath. * *
    “The farmer showed me a probang which hung on a
 nail. The handle only was left. The rest, consisting of a
 twisted cane, had entirely disappeared. By minute examina
 tion I found a small fragment which was not burnt but broken
off.”
    [The copper wires, and the stained paper enclosed with
 Mr. Leitch's letter, were laid before the Society.]
    The remarkable effects of lightning described by Mr.
 Leitch, are all extremely interesting. Those with reference
 to the copper wires are quite out of the common class of
electrical phaenomena; nothing of the kind having, so far as
I am aware, been observed previously, either as resulting
from natural discharges, or in experiments on electricity. It
is not improbable that they are due to the electro-magnetic
attraction which must have subsisted between the two wires
during the discharge, it being a well-known fact that adja
cent wires, with currents of electricity in similar directions
along them, attract one another. It may certainly be doubted
whether the inappreciably short time occupied by the elec
trical discharge could have been sufficient to allow the wires,
after having been drawn into contact, to be pressed with
sufficient force to make them adhere together and to produce
the remarkable impressions which they still retain. On the
other hand, the electro-magnetic force must have been very
considerable, since the currents in the wires were strong
enough nearly to melt them; and, since they appear to have
been softened, if not partially fused, the flattening and re
markable impressions might readily have been produced by
even a slight force subsisting after the wires came in contact.

 Prof. Thomson on some remarkable effects of Lightning. 55
   The circumstances with reference to the probang, de
scribed by Mr. Leitch, afford a remarkable illustration of
the well-known fact, that an electrical discharge, when effected
through the substance of a non-conducting (that is to say, a
powerfully resisting) solid, shatters it without producing any
considerable elevation of its temperature, not leaving any
Inarks of coinbustion, if it be of an ordinary combustible ma
terial such as wood.              -
   Dr. Robert Thomson, at my request, kindly undertook to
examine the paper removed from the wall of the farm-house,
and enclosed with his letter to me by Mr. Leitch, so as if
possible, by the application of chemical tests, to discover the
staining substance deposited on its surface. Mr. Leitch, in
his letter, had suggested that it would be worth while to try
whether this case is an example of the deposition of sulphur,
which Fusinieri believed he had discovered in similar circum
stances. Accordingly tests for sulphur were applied, but
with entirely negative results. Stains presenting a similar
appearance had been sometimes observed on paper in the
neighbourhood of copper wires, through which powerful
discharges in experiments with the hydro-electric machine
had been passed; and from this it was suggested that the
staining substance might have come from the bell-wires. Tests
for copper were accordingly applied, and the results were most
satisfactory. The front of the paper was scraped in different
places, so as to remove some of the pigment in powder,
and portions of the powder from the stained and from the not
stained parts were separately examined. The presence of
black oxide of copper in the former was readily made manifest
by the ordinary tests; in the latter no traces of copper could
be discovered. The back of the paper presented a greeh
tint, having been torn from a wall which has probably been
painted with Scheele's green; and matter scraped away from
any part of the back was found to contain copper. Since,
however, the stains in front were manifestly superficial, the
discoloration being entirely removed by scraping, and since
there was no appearance whatever of staining at the back of
the paper, nor of any effect of the electrical discharge, it was
impossible to attribute the stains to copper produced from
the Scheele's green on the wall below the paper. Dr. Thom
son, therefore, considered the most probable explanation to
be, that the stains of black oxide of copper must have come
from the bell-wire. To ascertain how far this explanation
could be supported by the circumstances of the case, I wrote
to Mr. Leitch asking him for further particulars, especially

56 Prof. Thomson on some remarkable effects of Lightning.
with reference to this point, and I received the following
anSWe 1 :--                                     “Moniemail, Cupar-Fife,
                                                   Nov. 30, 1849.
    “* * I received your letter to-day, and immediately called
at Hall-hill, in the parish of Colessie, the farm-house which
had been struck by the lightning. * *
    “I find that Dr. Thomson's suggestion is fully borne out
by the facts. I at first thought that the bell-wire did not
run along the line of discoloration, but I now find that such
was the case.” + +
    [From a drawing and explanation which Mr. Leitch gives,
it appears that the wire runs vertically along a corner of the
room, from the floor, to about a yard from the ceiling, where
it branches into two, connected with two cranks near one
another and close to the ceiling.]
    “The efflorescence [the stains previously adverted to] was
on each side of this perpendicular wire. In some places it
extended more than a foot from the wire.                   The deposit
seemed to vary in thickness according to the surface on which
it was deposited. There was none on the plaster on the roof.
It was thinnest upon the wall-paper, and thickest upon the
wood facing of the door”. This last exhibited various colours.
On the thickest part it appeared quite black; where there
was only a slight film, it was green or yellow. * *
    “I may mention that the thunder-storm was that of the
11th of August last. It passed over most of Scotland, and
has rarely been surpassed for terrific grandeur, -at least
beyond the tropics. It commenced about 9 o'clock P.M.,
and in the course of an hour it seemed to die away alto
gether. The peals became very faint, and the intervals be
tween the flashes and the reports very great, when all at once
a terrific crashing peal was heard which did the damage.
The storm ceased with this peal.
    “The electricity must have been conducted along the lead
on the ridge of the house, and have diverged into three
streams; one down through the roof, and the two others
along the roof to the chimneys. One of these appears to
have struck a large stone out from the chimney, and to have
been conducted down the chimney to the kitchen, where it
left traces upon the floor. It had been washed over before I
saw it, but still the traces were visible on the Arbroath flags.
   * These remarkable facts are probably connected with the conducting
powers of the different surfaces. The plaster on the roof is not so good a
conductor as the wall-paper with its pigments; and the painted wood is
probably a better conductor than either.—W. T.

The stains were of a lighter tint than the stone, and the
general appearance was as if a pail of some light-coloured
fluid had been dashed over the floor, so as to produce various
distinct streams. All along the course of the discharge, and
particularly in the neighbourhood of the bell-wires, there were
small holes in the wall about an inch deep, like the marks
that might be made by a finger in soft plaster.
   “Most of the windows were shattered, and all the frag
ments of glass were on the outside. I suppose this must be
accounted for by the expansion of the air within the house.

the time, was riddled, as if with small shot. The diameter
of the space so riddled was about a foot. On minute exami

 1850.         of the Wart-Hogs (Phacochaerus), with illustrations
of a System of Notation for the Teeth in the Class Mammalia.”
By Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
   The author commences by a brief statement of the facts and con
clusions recorded in a paper by Sir Ev. Home on the dentition of
the Sus AEthiopicus, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1799,
p. 256; and gives the results of an examination of the original
specimens described and figured by Home, and of other specimens
showing earlier stages of dentition, which lead to the following
conclusions as to the number, kinds, and mode of succession of
the teeth in the genus Phacochaerus. The tooth answering to the
first milk-molar and first premolar in the upper jaw, and those
answering to the first and second milk-molars and corresponding
premolars in the lower jaw of the common Hog are not developed.
Eight successive phases of development of the grinding teeth of the
African Wart-hogs are described and expressed by the following
notation :-

    These observations prove that, contrary to the opinion of Home
and Cuvier, the Wart-hogs have deciduous teeth, succeeded verti
cally by premolar teeth; in the Phacochaerus AEliani, at least,
three deciduous teeth are, in some individuals, succeeded by as
many premolar teeth; and, as a general rule, two deciduous teeth
are displaced vertically by two premolars. The first true molar is
remarkable for its unusually early development, which is followed
by an unusually early abrasion and expulsion, when its place is ob
literated by the second true molar being pushed forwards into con
tact with ºil. last premolar. This tooth is as remarkable for its
 longevity, and remains after the wearing away and shedding of the
second true molar, when the last true molar advances into contact
with the last premolar, and the place of both the previously inter
vening true molars is obliterated. This unusual order of shedding
of the molar teeth has given rise to the idea of the last large and
complex true molar of the Phacochaerus being the homologue of
both the last and penultimate grinders of the common Hog, which
the author's observations refute; and he, also, is able to point out,
by re-examination of the original specimen figured by Home in the
Phil. Trans., the source of the erroneous idea that the common Hog
had an additional true molar behind the large one symbolised by
m 3, in the author's system of dental notation.
   The nature and signification of the symbols proposed are ex
plained and illustrated by a series of drawings. One of the fruits

the homologies of individual teeth can be determined: they present

the requisite constancy of character in a large proportion of the
class Mammalia. Certain members of this class, e.g. the order
Bruta and the Cetacea vera, have teeth too numerous and alike in
form and mode of development to admit of being determined indi
vidually from species to species. Such mammalia have but one set
of teeth, and the author proposes to call them “Monophyodonts.’
On the other hand, the orders Marsupialia, Insectivora, Rodentia,
Ruminantia, Pachydermata, Carnivora, Cheiroptera, Quadrumana
and Bimana have two sets of teeth, and might be called collectively,
“Diphyodonts. Of the permanent teeth of this division of mam
malia, some succeed the deciduous teeth vertically, others come into
place behind one another in horizontal succession. The “incisors’
are determined by a character of relative position to the jaws and
to each other: so likewise the ‘canines.’ The remaining teeth are
divided into those which are developed in vertical relation to the
deciduous molars, and push them out, and those that have not such
relation, but follow each other horizontally: the term ‘molar' is re
stricted by the author to these latter teeth, and that of ‘premolar'
to the former ones, which are always anterior to the molars. There
is a remarkable degree of constancy in the number of these different
kinds of teeth; in the placental Diphyodonts, e.g. the “incisors'

the author regards as the typical formula of dentition in the great
proportion of the mammalian class above defined. It was rarely
departed from by the primaeval species that have become extinct,
and is modified chiefly by defect or loss of certain teeth in the ex
isting species. When the grinders are below the typical number,
the missing molars are taken from the back part of their series, and
the premolars from the fore part of theirs: the most constant teeth
being the fourth premolar and first true molar; these are always
determinable, whatever be their form, by the relation to them of the
last tooth of the deciduous series.     Thus determined, the homo
logies of the other grinders are ascertained by counting the molars
from the first backwards, 1, 2, 3 ; and the premolars from the last
forwards, 4, 3, 2, 1. The symbols are made by adding the initial m
to the numbers of the molar teeth, and the initial p to those of the
premolar teeth. The author concludes by pointing out the advan
tages of this system of anatomical notation.
   2. “Description of the Hydrostatic Log.” By the Rev. E. L.
Berthon, M.A. Communicated by Sir Francis Beaufort, F.R.S.
&c., on the part of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
   The object of this invention is to obtain a register of the speed
of ships, by a column of mercury, in such a manner that the height
of the column shall depend upon the velocity alone, and not be
affected by any disturbing causes, such as alteration of draught of
water, pitching and rolling, &c.
   The principle embraces that of Pitót's tube, inasmuch as the

 60                           Royal Society.
 force of the resistance due to the velocity is communicated through
 a small pipe projecting into the water below the bottom of the ship:
 this force, acting upwards, compresses a portion of enclosed air in a
small cylinder, which air communicating by means of a little pipe
with the bulb of a glass tube—bent like a common barometer—
 raises the mercury in the tube, by depressing it in the bulb.
    But as any single column of water and air thus acting upon the
surface of the mercury in the bulb alone must depend not only upon
 the resistance due to the velocity, but also upon the distance of the
cylinder from the water-line, which distance or height varies with
every sea, and alters more permanently as the draught of water
changes, a compensation was necessary; and the inventor has found
one, which he considers perfect for all these variations, by applying
a second column of water and air to press upon the other surface of
the mercury, viz. that in the glass tube. This second column is
precisely like the first as regards the pipe and cylinder, and commu
nicates with the sea by an aperture or apertures, presented in such
a direction that velocity does not produce any increase of pressure.
Thus the mercury in the indicator is placed between Two columns
of water and air, which are always equal to each other in length, and
the mercury rises according to the difference between the pressures
upon its two surfaces, the result of resistance or velocity alone.
   The air-pipes may be conducted in any direction, and the indi
cator, which swings upon gimbals, may be placed in any part of
the ship. The two water-pipes are conducted into one tube in the
bottom of the ship, divided into two separate chambers for the dif
ferent forces.
   In addition to the speed, the true course or leeway of the vessel
is indicated upon a horizontal segment divided into degrees, over
which a needle is moved by a rod connected with the above-men
tioned double tube; and the whole is kept continually in the true
direction of the ship's motion by a float or vane attached to the
lower end of the tube in the water.

Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis.” By Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq.,
LL.D., F.R.S., Vice-President of the Geological Society, &c.
   In this communication the author describes his recent investiga
tions on the structure of the two genera of fossil Cephalopoda, whose
remains occur so abundantly in the Oxford clay of Wiltshire,
namely, the Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis, as supplementary to his
memoir on the same subject, published in the Phil. Trans. 1848. In
that paper evidence was adduced to show the correctness of the
opinion of the late Mr. Channing Pierce as to the generic distinction
of these two extinct forms of Cephalopoda.
   As however several eminent naturalists had expressed doubts as
to some of the opinions advanced by the author in his former memoir,
figures and descriptions are given in the present notice, of beautiful
and instructive specimens lately discovered in Wiltshire, and which
he conceives establish his previous conclusions. Dr. Mantell then
states as the result of his examination of several hundred examples,

                            Royal Society.                            61
that our knowledge of the organization of the animal of the Belem
nite is at present limited to the following parts, viz. –
   1. An external Capsule or periostracum which invested the osse
let or sepiostaire, and extending upwards, constituted the external
sheath of the receptacle.                            -
   2. The Osselet, characterized by its fibrous radiated structure,
terminating distally in a solid rostrum or guard, having an alveolus,
or conical hollow, to receive the apical portion of the chambered
phragmocone; and expanding proximally into a thin cup, which
became confluent with the capsule, and formed the receptacle for
the viscera.
   3. The Phragmocone, or chambered, siphunculated, internal shell;
the apex of which occupied the alveolus of the guard, and the upper
part constituted a capacious chamber, from the basilar margin of
which proceeded two long, flat, testaceous processes.
   These structures comprise all that are at present known of the
animal to which the fossil commonly called “The Belemnite,”
belonged.
   Of the Belemnoteuthis, the fossil cephalopod which Prof. Owen
regards as identical with the Belemnite, many examples of the body
with eight uncinated arms, and a pair of long tentacula, having an
ink-bag and pallial fins, have been discovered. The osselet of this
animal, like that of the Belemnite, has a fibro-radiated structure,
investing a conical chambered shell; but this organ, for reasons
fully detailed in the memoir, the author considers could never have
been contained within the alveolus of a Belemnite; the soft parts
of the animal of the Belemnite are therefore wholly unknown.
   Many beautiful specimens of Belemnites and Belemnoteuthis were
exhibited by Dr. Mantell to the Society, in proof of the statements
contained in the memoir.
   2. “On the PELoRosaurus; an undescribed gigantic terrestrial
reptile, whose remains are associated with those of the Iguanodon
and other Saurians, in the Strata of Tilgate Forest.” By Gideon
Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., Vice-President of the Geo
logical Society, &c.
   The author had for a long while entertained the idea, that among
the remains of colossal reptiles obtained from the Wealden strata,
there were indications of several genera of terrestrial saurians,
besides those established by himself and other geologists. The re
cent discovery of an enormous arm-bone, or humerus, of an unde
scribed reptile of the crocodilian type, in a quarry of Tilgate Forest
in Sussex, where Dr. Mantell had many years since collected nume
rous teeth and bones of the Iguanodon, Hylaeosaurus, &c., and some
remarkable vertebrae not referable to known genera, induced him to
embody in the present communication the facts which his late re
searches have brought to light.
   The humerus above-mentioned was found imbedded in sandstone,
by Mr. Peter Fuller of Lewes, at about 20 feet below the surface;
it presents the usual mineralized condition of the fossil bones from
the arenaceous strata of the Wealden.       It is four and a half feet in

 62                           Royal Society.
 length, and the circumference of its distal extremity is 32 inches I It
 has a medullary cavity 3 inches in diameter, which at once separates it
 from the Cetiosaurus and other supposed marine saurians, while its
 form and proportions distinguish it from the humerus of the Igua
 nodon, Hylaeosaurus, and Megalosaurus. It approaches most nearly
 to the Crocodilians, but possesses characters distinct from any known
 fossil genus. Its size is stupendous, far surpassing that of the cor
 responding bone even of the gigantic Iguanodon; and the name of
 Pelorosaurus (from tréAwp pelor, monster) is therefore proposed
 for the genus, with the specific term Conybeari, in honour of the
 palaeontological labours of the Dean of Llandaff.
    No bones have been found in such contiguity with this humerus,
 as to render it certain that they belonged to the same gigantic rep
tile; but several very large caudal vertebrae of peculiar characters,
 collected from the same quarry, are probably referable to the Pelo
 rosaurus; these, together with some distal caudals which belong to
the same type, are figured and described by the author.
    Certain femora and other bones from the oolite of Oxfordshire,
 in the collection of the Dean of Westminster, at Oxford, are men
tioned as possessing characters more allied to those of the Pelo
rosaurus, or to some unknown terrestrial saurian, than to the Ce
tiosaurus, with which they have been confounded.
    As to the magnitude of the animal to which the humerus belonged,
Dr. Mantell, while disclaiming the idea of arriving at any certain
conclusions from a single bone, states that in a Gavial 18 feet
long, the humerus is 1 foot in length; i.e. one-eighteenth part of
the length of the animal, from the end of the muzzle to the tip of
the tail. According to these admeasurements the Pelorosaurus would
be 81 feet long, and its body 20 feet in circumference. But if we
assume the length and number of the vertebrae as the scale, we
should have a reptile of relatively abbreviated proportions; even in
this case, however, the original creature would far surpass in mag
nitude the most colossal of reptilian forms.
   In conclusion, Dr. Mantell comments on the probable physical
conditions of the countries inhabited by the terrestrial reptiles of the
secondary ages of geology. These highly-organized colossal land
saurians appear to have occupied the same position in those ancient
faunas as the large mammalia in those of modern times. The trees
and plants whose remains are associated with the fossil bones, mani
fest, by their close affinity to living species, that the islands or con
tinents on which they grew possessed as pure an atmosphere, as
high a temperature, and as unclouded skies as those of our tropical
climes. There are therefore no legitimate grounds for the hypo
thesis in which some physiologists have indulged, that during the
“Age of Reptiles" the earth was in the state of a half-finished
planet, and its atmosphere too heavy, from an excess of carbon, for
the respiration of warm-blooded animals. Such an opinion can only
have originated from a partial view of all the phenomena which
these problems embrace, for there is as great a discrepancy between
the existing faunas of different regions, as in the extinct groups of
animals and plants which geological researches have revealed.

    Feb. 21. –“On the Extension of the Principle of Fermat's The
orem of the Polygonal Numbers to the higher orders of series whose
ultimate differences are constant. With a new Theorem proposed,
applicable to all the Orders.” By Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord Chief
Baron, F.R.S.
    The object of this paper professes to be to ascertain whether the
principle of Fermat's theorem of the polygonal numbers may not be
extended to all orders of series whose ultimate differences are con
stant. The polygonal numbers are all of the quadratic form, and
they have (according to Fermat's theorem) this property, that every
number is the sum of not exceeding, 3 terms of the triangular num
bers, 4 of the square numbers, 5 of the pentagonal numbers, &c.
    It is stated in this paper that the series of the odd squares 1,9, 25,
49, &c. has a similar property, and that every number is the sum of
 not exceeding 10 odd squares. It is also stated, that a series con
sisting of the 1st and every succeeding 3rd term of the triangular
series, viz. 1, 10, 28, 35, &c., has a similar property; and that every
 number is the sum of not exceeding 11 terms of this last series, and
 that this may be easily proved [it was proved in a former paper by
 the same author]. The term “Notation-limit” is applied to the num
 ber which denotes the largest number of terms of a series necessary
 to express any number; and the writer states that 5, 7, 9, 13, 21 are
 respectively the notation-limits of the tetrahedral numbers, the octo
 hedral, the cubical, the eicosahedral and the dodecahedral numbers;
 that 19 is the notation-limit of the series of the 4th powers; that
 11 is the notation-limit of the series of the triangular numbers
 squared, viz. 1, 9, 36, 100, &c., and 31 the notation-limit of the series
 1, 28, 153, &c. (the sum of the odd cubes), whose general expression
 is 2m+–m°.
    The paper next contains an extension of the theorem 8n +3=3 odd
 squares, which was proved by Legendre in his Théorie des Nombres;
 every odd square equals 8 times a triangular No. + 1 ; the theorem
 therefore is–8 times any term in the figurate series (1, 2, 3, 4, &c...)
 +3=3 terms of a series consisting of the next series, viz. (1, 3, 6,
 10 ... &c.), multiplied by 8 with 1 prefixed, and also added to each
term. But it is stated that this theorem may be much extended; for
this is not only true of any two consecutive series, but generally if F,
represent any figurate number of the a'" order, and F, any figurate
number of the y” order, whether y be greater or less than ar,
       8F.--8=3, or (3+8), or (3+2.8), or ... (3+n8), &c.,
terms of a series whose general expression is 8F,+1; and still fur
ther (provided p be greater than 2)—
             pF,4-3=3, or (3+p), or (3+2p), or (3+np),
terms of a series whose general expression is pF, +1, and vice versd.
    The author concludes from these considerations, that probably

64                           Royal Society.
there are many theorems which are common to all the orders.        The
following theorem is then proposed as having that character.
   If the terms of a series be                                -
         1, or (1 + n)", (1+n)', (1+n)*... &c. (1 + n)",
                        the 1st (p+1) terms of (1 +n)”
                        the 1st (p+1) terms of (1+n)”
                        the 1st (p+1) terms of (1+n)”
                                +     &c.  &c.
(if p and n be both not less than 1), any number will be the sum of
not exceeding (pn--1) terms of the series; in other words, pn Hl
is the notation-limit of this series.                               -
   It is manifest that this series is of such a form, that by varying
n and p, it is capable of expressing every possible arithmetical series,
also every possible geometrical series (each having 1 for the first
term); it will also express all the intermediate series of the success
ive orders (to an indefinite extent), which exist between and con
nect together by a regular gradation (as is well known) any such
arithmetical series with a geometric series, whose common ratio is
the 2nd term of both series. The theorem may be stated without
the series thus:—
   If any geometric series (having 1 for its first term) and (1+n)
for its common ratio, be stayed at the (p + 1)th term and discon
tinued as a geometric series, but be continued from that term as an
arithmetic series of the pth order, by forming it with the pth differ
ence as the constant difference, and the other differences (which
will be a, aº, a”, &c. . . . . wº). The resulting series will be
the series stated in the theorem above, and any number may be
formed by not exceeding (pn-H 1) terms, that is (pn--1) will be
the notation-limit of the series; if p becomes indefinitely great, the
limit of the series is a geometrical series, and it would become capa
ble of expressing any number according to a system of notation
whose base or local value would be (1 + n).
   The proof of the theorem seems to depend upon this, that the no
tation-limit assigned by the theorem is actually the notation-limit
of all the geometric terms and one more, at least, while the geometric
terms alone fix the law of the series and ascertain its elements (that
is, the first term and the successive differences); and as the com
binations necessary to enable the series to fulfill its law, and carry
on the notation that belongs to it, are regulated by the series next
below it, viz. by the first rank of differences, while the supply of
new combinations (as the series advances and the number of terms
that may be used increases) is indicated by even a higher series than
itself, the new combinations are always greater, and at length inde
finitely greater, than the number required. If therefore within the
range of those terms that ascertain and fix the law of the series the
law of its notation-limit can be obeyed, it must always (a fortiori)
be obeyed as the series proceeds to a greater number of terms and
to a variety of combinations increasing in a higher ratio; and the

                            Royal Society.                      *   65
series will furnish the numbers requisite to carry on the notation by
the new and more numerous combinations which must of necessity
be of the same numerical kind with those which have preceded them.
It is shown at length, that the new combinations, as the series ad
vances, do actually increase in an increasing proportion compared
with the numbers required.
   2. “Experiments on the section of the Glossopharyngeal and
Hypoglossal Nerves of the Frog, and Observations of the altera
tions produced thereby in the Structure of their primitive fibres.”
By Augustus Waller, M.D. Communicated by Professor Owen,
F.R.S. &c.
   After describing the natural structure of the tubular fibres of the
nerves, the author states the results which he observed to follow
the section of the nerves of the frog's tongue. To this organ two
principal pairs of nerves are distributed; one of these, issuing from
the cranium along with the pneumogastric and distributed to the
fungiform papillae, is regarded as the glossopharyngeal; the other,
arising from the anterior part of the spinal cord, and passing through
the first intervertebral foramen, the author (following Burdach)
names the hypoglossal. Section of the glossopharyngeal nerves
does not cause any perceptible loss of motion or of common sensa
tion, and this fact, together with its distribution to the fungiform
papillae, leads the author to consider this nerve as the nerve of
tasting. On the other hand, when the hypoglossal nerves are
divided, the tongue is no longer sensible to mechanical irritation,
and its motions are entirely abolished. Simultaneous division of
the right and left glossopharyngeal nerves is followed by the death
of the animal in a few days, and the same effect ensues after division
of both hypoglossals. This result, which takes place more speedily
in summer than in winter, the author is disposed to ascribe to a
disturbance of the mechanical process of respiration, in which, as is
well known, the muscles of the frog's mouth and tongue take a
large share.
   To ascertain the changes which take place in the nerve-fibres
after division of the trunks to which they belong, the operation was
confined to the nerve of one side only, and the fibres of the unin
jured nerve of the other side served for comparison. These changes
ensue more speedily, and go on more rapidly in summer than in
winter, commencing usually in about five days. The pulp contained
in the tubular nerve-fibres, originally transparent, becomes turbid,
as if it underwent a sort of coagulation, and is soon converted into
very fine granules, partly aggregated into small clumps, and partly
scattered within the tubular membrane. These granules are at first
abundant, and render the nerve-fibre remarkably opaque; but in pro
cess of time they diminish in number, and, together with the inclosing
membrane, at length disappear, so that at last the finest ramifications
of the nerves which go to the papillae, or those going to the muscular
fibres of the tongue (according to the nerve operated on), are
altogether lost to view, in consequence of the destruction and eva

 nescence of their elementary fibres. The disorganization begins at
 the extremities of the fibres, and gradually extends upwards in the
 branches and trunk of the nerve. The other tissues of the tongue
 remain unaltered.    When the cut ends of the nerve are allowed to
 reunite, the process of disorganization is arrested, and the nervous
 fibres are restored to their natural condition.   The author ascribes
 the disorganization and final absorption of the nerve-fibres to an
 arrestment of their nutrition caused by interruption of the nervous
 current, and considers his experiments as affording most unequivocal
evidence of the dependence of the nutrition on the nervous power.
    Feb. 28.—“Sequel to a Paper on the reduction of the Thermo
metrical Observations made at the Apartments of the Royal Society,
with an Appendix." By James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S.-
    The principal object of this paper is the connexion of the results
deduced in a former paper from the observations at the Royal So
 ciety's Apartments, with the observations at the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich, in order to determine mean numerical values, and to
establish the laws of periodic variation from this long series of obser
vations; the two series of observations are here reduced to one and
the same series.
    The observations at the Royal Society having been discontinued
between the years 1781 and 1786, it was necessary to supply this
link in the series, more particularly as these years were distinguished
by very severe weather, and their omission would have a sensible
effect on the results. The deficient observations have been supplied
by a comparison of the observations which were made at Somerset
House, with the observations during the corresponding years made
by Mr. Barker at Lyndon in Rutlandshire, from 1771 to 1799, cor
rections being thus obtained for reducing the Lyndon observations
to those at Somerset House.
    By a comparison of the temperature of the air at Somerset House
and at the Royal Observatory for every month during the years
 1833 to 1843, corrections necessary to be applied for reducing the
mean values at the one place to those at the other, are deduced.
    Thus the results of the observations at Somerset House are re
duced to those at the Royal Observatory, and a table is given showing
the mean temperature at the latter place of each month in every year
from 1771 to 1849 inclusive. By taking the means of the several
columns in this table, the mean temperature of each month is deduced
from all the observations. From these mean monthly temperatures
a table is constructed showing the excess of the mean monthly tem
perature at Greenwich for each year, above the temperature of the
month deduced from all the years.
   Tables are next given showing the mean temperature in quarterly
periods for the year, and for successive groups of years at the Royal
Observatory at Greenwich, from the year 1771 to 1849; and the
excess of the quarterly and yearly mean temperatures in every year,
and for groups of years, above the means from all the years. The
author remarks that the numbers in these tables do not at all confirm
the idea that a hot summer is either preceded or followed by a cold
                                                                        |

 winter, or vice versä; but on the contrary it would appear that any
 hot or cold period has been mostly accompanied by weather of the
 same character, and instances are cited in support of this conclusion.
    Tables are also given, based upon the readings of the self-registering
thermometers, exhibiting the extreme readings at Somerset House
 and at the Royal Observatory.
   Incidentally the author goes into an inquiry respecting the relative
temperature of London and the country in its neighbourhood. From
 the observations made by Mr. Squire at Epping from 1821 to 1848,
and also from those at Lyndon, he concludes that the general fact
 of a higher winter temperature and lower summer temperature at
the Royal Society's Apartments is satisfactorily proved, and that the
same cause has been in operation at both seasons; this cause he
considers to be the vicinity of the river Thames to the place of ob
servation. With the view of showing the extent to which this cause

water of the Thames, and a comparison is made between the results
of observations made on board the ‘Dreadnought’ Hospital Ship, at
the height of 32 feet above the water, with simultaneous observa
tions at the Royal Observatory. From this comparison it is con
cluded, that at all seasons of the year the temperature at the ‘Dread
nought’ is above that at the Observatory during the night hours,
and that it is below during the mid-day hours only ; at times of ex
treme temperature the effects of the water upon the temperature of
the air is very great.

   2. “On the Communications between the Tympanum and Palate
in the Crocodilian Reptiles.” By Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
   After citing the descriptions by Cuvier, Kaup, Bronn, and De
Blainville of the Eustachian tubes and the foramina in the base of
the cranium of the recent and extinct Crocodiles, the author gives an
account of the nerves, arteries, veins and air-tubes that traverse these
different foramina, and thus determines the true position of the ca
rotid foramina and posterior nostrils in the Teleosauri and other
fossil Crocodilia, which had been a matter of controversy amongst
the authors cited.    In the course of these researches the author dis
covered a distinct system of Eustachian canals superadded to the or
dinary lateral Eustachian tubes, which he describes as follows:—
   “From each tympanic cavity two passages are continued down
wards, one expands and unites with its fellow from the opposite side
to form a median canal which passes from the basisphenoid to the
suture between that, and the basioccipital, where it terminates in the
median canal continued to the orifice described by M. De Blainville
as the posterior nostril. The second passage leads from the floor of
the tympanic cavity to a short canal which bends towards its fellow,
expands into a sinus and divides: one branch descends and termi
nates in the small lateral foramen at the lower end of the suture be
tween the basioccipital and the basisphenoid: the other branch
continues the course inwards and downwards until it meets its fellow
at the median line of the basioccipital, and it forms the posterior

primary division of the common median canal: this soon joins the
anterior division, and the common canal terminates at the median
opening below. Membranous tubes are continued from the three
osseous ones, and converge to terminate finally in the single Eusta
chian orifice on the soft palate behind the posterior nostril. The
mucous membrane of the palate lines the various osseous canals
above described, and is continued by them into the lining membrane
of the tympanum.”
   With regard to the homologies of the above described air-passages,
the author states that the lateral canals answer to the simple Eusta
chian tubes of Lizards and Mammals, and that the median canal,
with its dichotomous divisions, is a speciality peculiar to the Croco
dilian reptiles.

Definite Integrals and Infinite Series. By Professor Stokes.
   In a paper “On the Intensity of Light in the neighbourhood of a

and has tabulated it from m=–4 to ma +4 by the method of qua

part of the eighth volume, Mr. Airy has extended the table as far as
m= +5-6, by means of a series proceeding according to ascending
powers of m. This series, though convergent for all values of m,
however great, is extremely inconvenient for numerical calculation
when m is large, and moreover gives no information as to the law of
the progress of the function for large values of m.     The author has
obtained the following expression for the calculation of W for large,

facility when m is at all large. The author has given a table of the

   Jan. 11, 1850.-An account of some Improvements in a Speculum
Grinding and Polishing Machine. By John Hippisley, F.R.A.S.
   “The machine, as far as regards the general action of two excen
tric pins, which transmit motion to the grinding and polishing tools,
is similar in principle to that adopted by Lord Rosse, and other ma
chines previously in use.
   “The improvements consist in the arrangement of the parts so
as to effect cheapness and facility in the construction, with general
convenience in use, and especially in the manner in which the polish
ing tool is connected with the apparatus which gives it motion.
   “This connexion is made by a ball and socket-joint of a novel
construction, which, while it transmits a perfectly equable motion,
without jerks or irregularities, to the polisher, and leaves it free also
to revolve about its own centre, as the friction between it and the spe
culum may direct, facilitates the application of counterpoise weights,
so as to counterbalance in any required degree the weight of the
polisher, especially in the very last period of the polishing.
   “A polisher of considerable lightness has justly been deemed in
dispensable, and for this purpose wood has been used instead of metal
in its construction. This material is, however, obviously liable to
unsymmetrical alteration of figure, from unequal expansion and con
traction by moisture and heat.
   “Nor does it, it is submitted, adequately fulfill the condition re
quired, namely, that of sufficiently removing pressure from the spe
culum. It appears almost demonstrable that the last finishing action
of the polisher will be exerted with most advantage, to the perfection
both of figure and polish, when it moves without any vertical pressure
whatever. Those who are familiar with the adjustment of reflecting
telescopes are aware that the slightest confinement or pressure on
the speculum, when in its place in the telescope, is sufficient to im
pair its power of definition, in other words, to alter temporarily, in

70                    Royal Astronomical Society.
some degree, however small, its figure. A pressure, certainly far
less than that which a wooden polisher will exert, is capable of pro
ducing this injurious effect.
    “It is, then, to be expected, that when a speculum has been re
ceiving its final figure under any pressure, there will be some,
however slight, recession from that figure when the pressure is re
moved; and if so, the remedy obviously is to diminish successively,
by counterpoises, the weight of the polisher as the figure and polish
are advancing, till it ultimately moves, in giving the last finishing
 strokes, without any more pressure than the cohesion between the
polished and sliding surfaces affords. It may also be expected that
 the lustre and perfection of the polish itself will be enhanced, inas
 much as the size of the abraded atoms will then be at their minimum,
 since they diminish in a direct ratio with the diminution of pressure
 by the abrading surface.
    “In the machine to which these observations refer, the pulley
 which drives one excentric rod is made to differ slightly in diameter
 from its fellow, with which it is connected by the endless band,
 which gives motion to the other excentric rod; so that the centre of
 the polisher, by their joint action, is constrained to describe curves,
 varying from nearly a straight line to ellipsoids having a minor axis
 equal to twice the thrust of the shorter excentric ; and the parabolic
 figure is attained by the maintenance of a certain proportion, found
 experimentally, between the throws of these two excentrics. This
 proportion, for a speculum having an aperture of one inch for each
 foot of focal length, and under the action of a polisher of the same
 dimensions as the speculum, is one-third of the diameter of the spe
 culum for the longer, and one-seventh for the shorter thrust; the
 figure of the speculum receding towards a spherical figure if that
 shorter thrust be diminished, or advancing to the hyperbolic curva
 ture if it be increased.
    “The counterpoises, then, it is suggested, should be added suc
 cessively, and at those periods in the action of the machine when it
 may be considered that its tendency to give a parabolic figure is at
 its maximum; that is, when, by the combined action of the excentric
 pins, the centre of the polisher is describing the widest ellipsoids on
 the speculum.     A bent wire is so placed, as an index, on the excen
 tric rod, that its point, traversing a scale fixed in any convenient
 position, shows the exact moment when these widest ellipsoids are
 being described: at those intervals the counterpoise-weights are
 successively added, so that the polisher may be considered to pass
 through complete cycles of its action under each alteration and dimi
 nution of pressure.
    “Attention to these conditions has, in specula finished by the
machine, apparently been entirely successful, both in obtaining an
exceeding fine polish, and a figure which does not sensibly deviate
from the parabolic.
    “A nice attention to the quantity and purity of the water used in
the polishing is also of much importance. A very convenient method,
which, being self-acting, requires no particular care during the pro
cess, is to fix a small vessel on the excentric rod, with a thread de

                    British Meteorological Society.                     71
 pending from it, and so adjusted, that the single drop, which by the
 capillary and syphon action passes from the thread, shall, at the
extreme thrust of the excentric rod, be deposited at the edge of the
 speculum. The quantity may be nicely regulated by the use of a
 smaller or larger thread; and the water is secure from containing
 any gritty particle, being filtered in its passage through the thread.
    “The machine is of an easy and cheap construction, and intended
 to be worked by the foot acting on a treadle, or by any other con
 venient motive power: the same lever apparatus which is used for
 counterpoising the polisher in finishing, being connected by a ver
 tical rigid bar with the ball and socket-joint of the tool, affords means
for adding any required amount of pressure in the rough grinding
process, and thus that tedious part of the operation is considerably
 accelerated. It is also adapted for figuring lenses of large dimen
 sions, to which it would impart, as well as to specula, surfaces ap
proaching nearly to those of parabolic, or other required geometric
 curvatures, and with the addition of another mandril, or more, re
ceiving rapid motion from the periphery of the fly-wheel, it has been
used with great convenience for grinding and polishing lenses of the
smallest dimensions.”
                BRITISH METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY.
    We have to notice the recent formation of a Society for the advance
ment of Meteorological knowledge, “a branch of physical inquiry
which,” as stated in the published Address, “requires the combined
efforts of numerous observers, steadily following a well-concerted
plan, employing the same class of instruments, and reducing their
results in the same form.
    “Amongst the objects of this Society will be the reduction of
observations and combination of results, as far as their funds will
allow ; nevertheless it is to be hoped that the emulation which will
naturally be excited amongst observers to supply observations pro
ducing the best results, will also induce them to reduce their own
observations, as far as they may be able to do so. With the view
of stimulating observers to perform this work, this Society will
publish from time to time useful Tables to facilitate the reduction of
observations.                         -
    “The Council fully trust, that whilst the establishment of the
British Meteorological Society will be the means of diffusing through
out this country a philosophical spirit of inquiry, and of inducing a
more general employment of trustworthy instruments, and the care
fully noting and submitting for comparison the observations thus
made, it will also have a more extended influence. By facilitating
a comparison of the observations of its own members with those
made in other countries, meteorological phaenomena will be better
traced, and thus effects more satisfactorily and surely referred to
their true causes. A remarkable instance of the want of connecting
observations has been so recently rendered obvious, that it may not
be without its use briefly to refer to it here. In the “American
Traveller,’ published at Boston on April 6, 1850, and recently re
ceived in this country, is a paper by W. Cranch Bond, Esq., of Cam

bridge, United States, in which he speaks of the great atmospheric
wave which was passing over England from the 1st to the 18th day
of February 1849, the mean reading of the barometer during this
interval of time being fully half an inch above its average value, and
when the crest of the wave was over Greenwich, the reading of the
barometer at the level of the sea was 30'90 inches.          The base of
the wave at this time seems to have been in extent just equal to the
distance from England to America; for on the same day that it com
pleted its passage at Greenwich, it was first felt at Boston, and it
was seventeen days passing over Boston, as it was with us. Its
motion, therefore, must have been about 170 miles daily. The re
duced readings of the barometer during the time of the passage of
the wave at Boston, and its extreme readings, were identical in value
with those at Greenwich.          At present we cannot follow this very
remarkable heaping up of the air from the want of observations at
different places.
   “Another object of this Society will be to avail itself of every
 opportunity of establishing observatories in those parts of the world
where none are at present in existence.
   “Other beneficial results to be expected from a Society of this
kind are, the diffusion of a spirit of inquiry concerning the use of
instruments, the practice and extension of meteorological researches,
and the encouragement of mutual information among its members.”

           VII. Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                      THE LAGOONS OF TUSCANY.
THE Tuscan Lagoons are, properly speaking, natural depressions
      of the soil ordinarily filled with water from which hot vapours are
ejected. They are situated within a space of ten or twelve miles,
lying between 28° 27' and 28°40' of longitude, and between 43° 10'
and 43° 15' of latitude. The principal lagoons are those of Monte
Cerboli, of Castel Nuovo in the valley of Cecina, those of Sasso, of
Monte Rotondo, of the Lago del Edifizio, of Lustignano and of Ser
razzano in the valley of Cornia. The ancients were acquainted

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               73
with the Tuscan lagoons, and the name of Mount Cerberus accords
well with the poetical and mythological ideas of the early people of
Italy.
    Even as late as the 18th century the lagoons were regarded only
as a supernatural wonder which excited astonishment rather than
courted investigation. Under the Grand Duke Leopold I., the
chemist Hoefer discovered by analysis, that they contained boracic
acid. This discovery, followed by further explorations, has bestowed
upon the lagoons an unrivalled industrial importance, and has brought
into the countries possessing them an activity contrasting strikingly
with the miserable state in which they before languished. It is a
curious fact in their history that before the discovery of this acid,
the foetid odour developed by the sulphuretted hydrogen gas, the
certain death which met the man who fell into the scalding baths,
the disruptions of the ground occasioned by the appearance of new
Soffioni,-and above all the superstitious terror with regard to them,
had made the people consider the lagoons as a scourge from which
they sought deliverance by public prayers; but now, if by any cause
the Fumacchi, the source of common prosperity, should become ex
 tinguished, they would not fail to seek from heaven a restoration of
 this scourge, which in the skilful hands of M. Larderel, has become,
 to quote M. Bowring, a source perhaps of greater riches than the
 mines of Peru or of Mexico, and certainly more reliable. After the
 discovery of Hoefer, Paul Mascagni, a noted chemist, had the first
 idea of procuring from the lagoons boracic acid like that of China,
 and of thus restoring to Europe the tribute that she had paid to
 Asia.    But the attempt was not at first profitable, as the waters con
 tain in solution at the moment of their escape from the earth, only
 an insignificant quantity of boracic acid. Another chemist having
 observed that a part of the acid was thrown beyond the lagoon, by
 the violence of the vapours, and that it was scattered on the mar
 gins of the craters, and moreover being confident that the waters
 were capable of dissolving a greater quantity of acid, endeavoured
 to find means of saturating them by constructing upon the declivi
 ties of the country artificial lakes fed by the streams from the moun
 tain. The vapours which issue from these lakes keep their waters
 constantly at a boiling temperature. After impregnation for twenty
 or thirty hours by the vapours of the highest lake, they draw off the
 waters into the second lake to submit them to a new impregnation.
  From thence they are drawn into a third, and so on till they reach
  the receptacle at the lowest point. In their passage across six or
  eight lakes, they are charged with half per cent. of boracic acid.
  They are then led into the reservoir from which they are conducted
 into lead reservoirs for evaporation, to produce concentration; and
  to hasten that operation, the happy idea was proposed of substi
  tuting for the combustibles sometimes used, and which were enor
  mously expensive, the direct application of the heat of the Soffioni.
  This improvement decided the success of the enterprise. It is sur
  prising that it was introduced at so late a day, since this method
  was not new and had been long practised at the solfatara of Poz
  zuoli in extracting alum from the earth that contains it.        In the
  lagoons, the hot vapours for carrying on the evaporation are taken

74            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
at their origin and carried across by lead pipes or by subterranean
conduits below the boilers. Thus the fabrication is extremely simple,
the locality itself furnishing the means of carrying it on. A single
discharge of the vapours is sufficient to throw into ebullition, almost
immediately, 20 or 30 caldrons of a capacity of 20 barrels, which
may be estimated at 84,000 pounds of liquid impregnated with bo
racic acid. Before allowing the vapours to escape, they direct them
under the ovens in order to free the acid from its hygrometric moist
ure.    Of late the somewhat complex system of boilers and coolers
has been simplified by substituting rectangular tables of lead of 20
or 30 metres, divided at small intervals by transverse parallel divi
sions, but whose height is never raised above that of the edges. These
tables have an inclination of two to three degrees. The water of the
last lagoon is introduced upon the upper side, in small quantities.
The hot vapours for evaporating are conducted in such a manner that
they act upon the lower surface. The liquid after having filled the
first compartment is diffused very gradually into the second, then
into the third, and so successively to the last, where it reaches such
a state of concentration that it deposits the crystallized acid; the
workmen remove it immediately by means of wooden scrapers. This
mode of gradual concentration is very ingenious, and requires so few
hands that it may almost be said that the acid is obtained without
expense. From 1818 to 1845 the quantity of acid manufactured was
33,349,097 Tuscan pounds. From 1839 to 1845 the mean quantity
has been two millions and a half of pounds.
   Thus in estimating the product at 7500 pounds per day, the
quantity of saturated water upon which they operate daily is
1,500,000 lbs. daily, and annually 547,500,000 lbs.
   This labour brings to Tuscany 12 millions of pounds (10 millions
of francs), and it is surprising that it should have remained unpro
ductive during so many ages, and that it should have been reserved
for the skill of M. Larderel, now Count of Monte Cerboli, and before
1818 a simple wandering merchant, entirely unacquainted with scien
tific researches, to discover the fugitive vapours and render them a
source of inexhaustible wealth.
   The violence with which the burning vapours escape gives rise to
muddy explosions, when a lake has been drained by turning its
waters into another lake.      The mud is then thrown out, as solid
matters are ejected from volcanos, and there forms in the bottom of
the lake a crowd of those little cones of eruption whose activity and
play recall exactly under another form the hornitos of Malpays.
Their temperature varies from 120° to 145° centigrade, and the
clouds which they form above the lagoons constitute true natural
barometers, whose greater or less density rarely disappoints the pre
dictions that they announce.
   While in an industrial point of view, the lagoons occupy the first
rank among the natural products of Tuscany, they place new re
sources at the disposition of science, permitting the investigation of
various geological phaenomena, even under the direction of the will
of the experimenter. The metamorphic gypsum which we have seen
produced at Pereta under the influence of sulphuretted hydrogen
vapours, is formed at the lagoons, which, like those of Monte Cerboli

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               T5
and of Castel Nuovo, are made to cross argillaceous limestone beds,
and with such abundance that their formation may be fully tested.
Action also takes place at the same time upon the walls of fractures
and the fissures of the soil which open a passage to the subterranean
vapours. Thence it extends gradually into the interior of the masses,
and it ends by gypsifying whole circles whose radius is generally
that of the lagoons themselves. Pure limestones are converted into
a lamellar sulphate of lime, but of a loose texture and free of cel
lules. This structure is probably due to the expansion they undergo
from the addition of new materials, and perhaps also by the passage
of the gas at the moment of the crystallization of the salt. The cal
careous formations below the argillaceous, preserve after their trans
formation their primitive position, and they present an alternation of
gypseous beds, and of argillaceous beds which the acid has freed
from the soluble bases. When this influence is exerted in the direc
tion of the thickness of the strata, it is very common to see towards
the limits where the metamorphic influence ceases, a mass of rock
strikingly calcareous at one of its extremities, terminating at the
other extremity in a gypsum which the inhabitants use for buildings.
The resemblance to the gypsum beds, occurring in the midst of the
 secondary formations, is exhibited even in the reddish tint with
which oxidation marks the associate clays of the alberèse.        But a
peculiarity which has given me the solution of a problem which had
embarrassed me thus far, deserves mention; for we have reproduced
 here certain phaenomena of which the enormous deposits of the Pro
vençal Alps present many examples.         I had noticed at Roquevaire
 and at Digne, irregular argillaceous incrustations in which are found
 entangled without order, angular fragments of sulphate of lime of
various sizes. In admitting the transformation of the jurassic lime
 stone of these countries posterior to its consolidation under the in
fluence of the acid vapours, it was difficult to explain the mode of
 formation of these breccias and the manner in which these fragments
 were introduced. In all these cases they seemed to indicate an
 overflow of waters, but the theory opposes the intervention of waters
 for the accomplishment of the facts relative to the conversion of the
 limestone, or it leaves in doubt the part which they must have acted.
 But, observe what is apparent at the lagoons of Monte Cerboli and
 of Castel Nuovo. At the same time that the limestone is changed
 into gypsum, by the contact of sulphurous agents, the fragments of
 alberèse which waters had brought down from heights above to the
 midst of the miry and boiling lakes, are thus changed into sulphate
 of lime, and constitute, with the clays in which they sink, brecciated
 argillo-gypseous beds without stratification. That this fact should
 be equally apparent in the ancient beds under analogous circum
 stances, is at least what might be inferred from the examination
 of that which passes in the lagoons. We should also observe
 the analogous positions of the boracite of Luneburg, which is found
 in crystals disseminated in gypsum intercalated in the midst of a
 cretaceous bed, and the boracic acid and borates of the Tuscan
 lagoons.
    These different facts well confirmed, establish in my view an inti

 mate resemblance between the gypsum of the lagoons and the ab
 normal gypsum beds of secondary regions.
    If the silicification of the Macigno which we have noticed in the
 neighbourhood of the solfatara of Pereta should appear an exag
 gerated application of the theory brought forward, the verification
 of it may be traced in the lagoons of Sasso, where the solution of
 the silex of the freestone and its redeposition are manifest in all
 places where circumstances allow of this double transformation. The
 Fumacci of Sasso rise, to the south of the establishments, from be
 neath a vast mantle of fine-grained freestone, over which passes the
 mountain road connecting the valley of the Cornia with the Province
 of Sienna. At intervals the road is interrupted by isolated boiling
pools or shallow cavities, which exert a metamorphic action upon
the region which they traverse. The first evidence of alteration is
apparent in the colour of the rock, which from blackish-gray becomes
white. It is cracked in all directions. The vapours follow quickly
these lines of separation, attack the silica of the macigno, dissolving
it out, and immediately depositing it under a gelatinous form. The
gelatinous mass becomes opake in the air and assumes the resin-like
appearance peculiar to hydrated silica. In connexion with this we
observe imbedded in a siliceous cement, nuclei of a white micaceous
sandstone unaltered at the centre, causing a breccia appearance. This
kind of breccia is finally, by the complete solution of the nuclei,
converted into a grayish rock entirely siliceous, which resounds under
the hammer like clink-stone, and resembles exactly by its aspect and
its roughness of touch, porcelain biscuit,    Sometimes the solution is
more rapid, and then the rock is formed of an agglutination of little
grains analogous to those of an ancient quartz rock and possessing its
tenacity and hardness. Examined with a glass, each grain is composed
of an independent particle or driblet of hydrated silica, and they
seem to have collected as viscous tears, such as would have adhered
together in hardening.       Breislak observed at the solfatara of Poz
zuoli fragments of decomposed lava bound together by a siliceous
substance almost vitreous; but in the lagoon of Sasso the solution
and permanent regeneration of silica, effected at the expense of the
macigno, are carried on upon a vast scale and over a space of great
extent.—Bull. Soc. Géol. de France, Dec., 1848, 147; and Silliman’s

oN THE INTERPRETATION of MARIoTTE's LAw.                    BY LIEUT.
              E. B. HUNT, U.S. CoRPS OF ENGINEERS.
   It is readily demonstrated that in any entirely homogeneous me
dium, the component parts of which act on each other by forces va
rying as any function of the distance, Mariotte's law must prevail.
Both elastic tension and cohesive force will necessarily vary as the
density, in a medium assumed as homogeneous, quite irrespective of
the law of force, the variation being expressed in terms of distance
between the component parts of the medium. Whether the force
be attractive or repulsive, varying inversely with the first or hun
dredth power of the distance, the result is the same; that entire
homogeneousness makes Mariotte's law necessary.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            77
    To prove this: assume a perfectly homogeneous medium whose
parts exert forces varying as any function of the distance. Assume
in this an origin of coordinates, three coordinate axes, X, Y and Z,
and three constant elementary distances, dr, dy, dz. Conceive each
axis graduated by laying off its element successively from the origin
outward. Through each point of graduation on either axis pass a
plane parallel to the other axes: do this for each axis. The space
around the origin is thus divided into elementary parallelopipeds,
each of which contains a like portion of the homogeneous medium.
    The force of elastic tension or of cohesion is measured by the re
sultant action on a unit of surface of the plane X, Y, by all the
forces acting in the positive direction of the axis Z, between the
parts on opposite sides of the plain X, Y. This resultant is balanced
by an equal one acting in the negative direction of the axis Z. To
make up this resultant, a certain number of the elementary portions
of the medium conspire. It may therefore be equated with a series,
each term of which expresses the positive component along the axis
Z, of the force exerted between two elementary portions of the me
dium on opposite sides of the plane X, Y.
    If now the density of the medium be varied, each term of this
series will vary in the same ratio, since the quantity of matter in
each elementary volume varies as the density. The density thus
governs each term of the series, by fixing the quantity of matter in
each elementary volume. If we call the ratio of the varying density
 to a standard density N, each term of the series contains N as a
 simple factor; or the whole series varies as N. Hence the resultant
or entire elastic tension or cohesion varies as N, or as the density.
This result is entirely independent of any particular law of relation
 between the forces and distances; and will always be true so long
 as the elementary volumes can be assumed as homogeneous. As
 da, dy, dz can always be taken indefinitely less than the radius
 of sensible activity of any assumed force, the demonstration can
 only fail by the parts failing to be homogeneous.
     It will be seen by the above, that any inference of the law of re
 pulsive force between ultimate atoms or molecules, cannot be cor
 rectly drawn from Mariotte's law, for this leaves the primary forces
 involved wholly indeterminate. We are by no means authorized to
 conclude, that in elastic fluids, where the pressure varies as the
 density, the molecules repel each other directly as the distance.
     The demonstration now given has a singular bearing on the
 atomic theory of material constitution. We know experimentally
 that Mariotte's law does not prevail uniformly in elastic media, while
  in liquids and solids it has no show of application. Hence we are
 bound to infer non-homogeneousness. Now how can homogeneous
 ness be interrupted, except through something like an atomic con
  stitution of media? A laminated, filamental, or molecular structure
  alone can produce heterogeneousness.       The two first would confer
  special properties in certain directions, which are not found in fact.
  Hence a molecular constitution of matter seems entailed as an in
  ference, from the bare fact that Mariotte's law is not universal.
  According to the view now presented, the elasticity of gases varies
  as the density, because the quantity of matter within the sphere of

78.            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
sensible activity varies in that ratio. As they approach the point of
liquefaction, other considerations derived from the special atomic
constitutions of the media must be introduced.        The entire absence
of a limit to the division of parts would produce that homogeneous
ness from which Mariotte's law becomes an inevitable inference.
Such an inference, as applied to media in general, being contrary to
the fact, a limit to actual division of parts must be admitted. Any
other theory than one of ultimate molecules, separated by spaces, seems
to impose inferences conflicting with facts, throwing us back irresisti
bly into the theory of true molecular structure.—Silliman's American
Journal, May, 1850.

EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY UPON THE WIRES OF
                     THE MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH,
    The Revue Scientifique for December last contains an interesting
article by M. Baumgartner on the subject of the effects of atmo
spheric electricity upon the wires of the magnetic telegraph. The
following are the most interesting of his results:—
    1. The needle rarely coincides with the point which is determined
by its astatic state and the tension of its suspension thread ; almost
always it deviates more or less from this point, which proves that
it is influenced by an electric current.
    2. The variations are of two kinds; there are some which reach
 50°, others extend over #9 or 8'. The first are less frequent; they
 differ so often in direction and intensity that it is impossible to de
duce a law for them. On the contrary, the small deviations appear
connected by a very simple law.
    The observations made at Vienna and at Gratz appear to show
that, during the day, the electric currents move from Vienna and
from Gratz to Semmering, which is more elevated.          This direction
is inverse during the night.     It appears that this change of direction
 takes place after the rising and setting of the sun.
    3. The regular current is less disturbed by the irregular currents
when the air is dry and the sky isserene, than when the weather is rainy.
    4. In general, the current is more intense with short than with
very long conductors; often, even, the current of the longer chain
is opposed to the current of the shorter chain.
    Where there is a difference of intensity, this difference is far
greater than that which could originate from the resistance of the
longer conductor.
    When the sky is cloudy and the weather stormy, there are fre
quently observed in the electric conductor currents which are suffi
ciently intense to affect the telegraphic indicators, which are, how
ever, far from having extreme sensitiveness.
    When they were placing the conducting wires of the Northern
Telegraph line from Vienna, the workmen frequently complained of
a kind of spasms which they felt in handling the wires. These
spasms ceased as soon as they took the precaution not to touch the
wires with naked hands. These spasms were most frequent and in
tense in Styria, the highest region of the line. Thus, near Kranich
feld, a workman received a shock sufficiently violent to overturn him
and paralyse his right arm.                                           - - -

   The action of the atmospheric electricity on the telegraphs is
stronger on the approach of a storm; and not unfrequently the wires
themselves, and the poles which support them, are destroyed by
electric discharges.
    M. Baumgartner cites several examples in support of what has
just been said. On the 17th of August 1849, a storm which had
burst forth at Ollmutz extended to Frielitz, that is to say, to a di
stance of ten miles. A workman employed at this latter station, in
putting up the wires experienced a shock which overturned him,
and he experienced a real burn of the fingers which touched the
wire.     At this time the sky was perfectly serene at Frielitz.—From
the Journal of the Franklin Institute for April 1850.

VIII. On the Aérometric Balance, an instrument for measuring
   the Density of the Air in which it is situated. By Professor
   Potter, A.M., late Fellow of Queen's College, Cambridge*.
THAT the density of the air            is an important element in
      every discussion of atmospheric phaenomena, will at once
be admitted; but it will be often maintained also, that we have
the means of determining it from observations of the wet and
dry bulb thermometers and the barometer. A little reflection
will, however, soon convince us that this is not absolutely true,
since it supposes a regular constitution of the atmosphere for
all localities and all states of the weather, which certainly does
not exist. Thus, in a room where many persons have been
for some time assembled, the carbonic acid gas coming from
their lungs in respiration will increase the density of the air
in the room; but this will not affect the thermometer, or in a
sensible degree the barometer.
   There are many natural localities on the earth where ex
halations affect the density of the air, but of which the pre
sence escapes detection by the before-named instruments; and
at all places we shall find, on consideration, that the density
of the air depends on circumstances not necessarily shown to
exist by them. If, for instance, the barometric pressure and
the temperature were given, we might still have an upper cur
rent of wind which had a particular hygrometric state and a
particular proportion of its constituent gases, whilst the lower
current of wind was of another composition. The varying den
sity of the lower current would clearly not be indicated by
the usual meteorological instruments.
   These cases would be comprehended in the discussion of
the formula p-kp(1 +25°) for the relation of the pressure,

 82        Professor Potter on the Aérometric Balance,
 density, and temperature of a gas, by the consideration that
 when it is applied to a mixture of gases, such as the atmo
 sphere, the value of k is different for every variation in the
 proportions of the elements.
    The method of weighing a known volume of the air, which
 has been admitted into a flask partially exhausted by the air
 pump and then weighed, is one of considerable labour, and
 requiring the greatest degree of care in order to obtain correct
 results. An instrument which would give the actual density
 by a simple reading off is evidently so great a desideratum,
 that the instrument about to be described has probably in
 some shape or other suggested itself to others, though no in
 strument of the kind is used at present amongst the recog
 nized meteorological instruments that I am aware of.
    The new instrument is a modification of an old air-pump
 experiment, which is used to show that the greater buoyancy
 of more bulky over denser bodies of equal weights in the air
 is a considerable and a measurable quantity. A metallic body
 hanging at one end of a balance appears in the air to be
 heavier than a closed hollow globe of glass hanging from the
 other end; but when placed under the receiver of an air
 pump, and the pump is worked, it is soon seen that as the air
 is withdrawn the apparent excess of weight becomes less and
 less, and eventually the hollow globe preponderates. In an
 instrument for determining the variable buoyancy of bodies
 in the lower stratum of the atmosphere, the points to be sought
for in the construction are, a sufficient sensibility and a means
 of determining the results with readiness. A large closed
globe of glass might be weighed at different times in a fine
 chemical balance; but the process would be tedious, and from
perpetual changes in temperature, susceptible of less nicety
 than that of a delicate bent lever balance, such as I have
adopted.
    There arise difficulties in the construction when extreme
 sensibility is desired, which a knowledge of the mechanical
properties of balances, and a confidence in their theory, alone
can be expected to surmount.         For instance, in the trials
 which have been made with the instrument constructed by
Messrs. Watkins and Hill from my drawings, we have found
a position of stable equilibrium and another of unstable equi
librium within an angle of 40 degrees. The theory showing
that no such positions of equilibrium can exist in a perfect
balance, the result indicated that the knife-edges of the balance,
or the agate planes in contact with them, though made with
all the care considered requisite in fine chemical balances,
were yet not sufficiently true for such a degree of sensibility;

     an instrument for measuring the Density of the Air.     83
and that even with a less degree of sensibility it was requisite
to have the knife-edges sharper, straighter, or more nearly
parallel, and the agates more accurately flat;-these points
were accomplished by improved methods of preparing the
parts above named.
   The annexed figure is a side view of the essential parts of
the instrument. A is a hollow globe of glass of about 4%

inches diameter, hermetically sealed, having an eye in the
upper part where the tube from which it was blown has been
sealed: by this eye it is suspended by hooks from a steel stem
fixed to the brass frame B, holding an agate plate.        This
agate plate rests on the knife-edge of the triangular prism of
steel as in the figure. C is another triangular prism of steel
fixed like the former to the brass lever of the balance.    The

84.        Professor Potter on the Aérometric Balance,
knife-edge at C rests on another agate-plate held by the frame
work of the instrument.     The end D of the lever is formed so
as to be graduated as a vernier; and a graduated arc having its
centre at the knife-edge C is fixed firmly in a vertical plane
to the brass framework. The readings of the graduated arc
by means of the vernier give the position of equilibrium of the
lever. At a b is a fine steel screw passing through the arm
 of the lever and carrying a brass head at b; this screw, turned
 by a key, regulates the sensibility of the balance by raising or
 lowering the centre of gravity of the lever. The spirit-levels
 for adjustment to the horizontal position, as well as other de
 tails, are not drawn in the figure.
    The whole balance is fixed firmly in a glass case or
 lanthorn, which also contains its accompanying thermometer.
    The instrument evidently acts by the changing weight of
 the air displaced by the globe with its appendages, and the
 lever. If these volumes were exactly known, and the place
 of the centre of gravity of that displaced by the lever for given
 temperatures, then the density of the air could be calculated
 from the position of equilibrium; but since these cannot be
 easily determined with accuracy, the method of employing the
 instrument must be that of finding the value of its divisions in
 terms of the density of the air, by experimental methods, for
 changes of temperature and pressure; such as by examining
 the instrument under the receiver of an air-pump furnished
 with a barometer gauge, and by noting the effect of change of
 temperature in the lanthorn when the atmospheric pressure is
 stationary.
    In investigating the theoretical sensibility of the bent lever
 balance, I shall first suppose, in the ordinary way, that the
 weights are absolute weights, and afterwards take the modifi
 cation introduced by supposing the balance used, as actually,
 in a medium of varying density.

    The degree of sensibility may be any that is wished, pro
 vided weights are added to, and taken away from the end B,
 which weights might be very conveniently laid upon the plate
 containing the agate plane. In some trials I had the index
 moving through 40° with 4 grain difference in the weight
 hanging from B; and this is equivalent to a change of about
 one inch in the height of the barometer, or between 16° and
  17° of Fahrenheit's thermometer.
    When changes in the density of the air are required to be
 found which are not dependent solely on temperature and
 pressure, but also on occasional admixtures in the air sur
 rounding the balance, we have to compare its indications with
 those of the other named instruments, and it is needless to
 have a greater sensibility than theirs. Now the best baro
 meters read only to one-thousandth of an inch in the height
 of the mercurial column, and the best thermometers can
 seldom be depended upon to one-hundredth of a degree
 Fahrenheit; so that if a grain added at B cause the index
 to move through 10° of arc, and we read the vernier to 4 mi
 nutes, we have an accuracy greater than either of the other
 named instruments, and one which is sufficient for our expe
 riments.      In this case the scale of 60° will suffice for the
 changes which occur in this climate, without need of weights
 in addition.

     an instrument for measuring the Density of the Air.      87
   The following table contains the last series of observations
which I have made previous to the instrument being finished,
with some additions.         The thermometer inclosed in the
lanthorn was a good one, but not the one intended to be used,
which was not ready ; it was read with a reading microscope,
as was also the aérometric balance.       The instrument was
placed in an upper room facing the west, in which no fire was
lighted. The barometer was a good aneroid one, with an
attached thermometer. I have not thought it necessary to
give the readings of these, but only the height of the baro
metric column reduced to a temperature of 32°.
   The column of the densities is calculated from the formula
                             = —”
                           f= KIEa<U+017F>)
with unity as the density for 32° temperature and 30 inches
          -                -         1             -      -
barometric pressure, taking &= 490 for comparison with the
aérometric balance. Although the changes take the same di
rection, that is, greater buoyancy is indicated when there was
greater calculated density, yet the changes are not propor
tional; and on comparing different parts of the series, we see
remarkable differences.      Observations of the wet bulb ther
mometer might have enabled us to explain some of these, by
the hygrometric changes going on; but if any remained, they
would indicate changes in the composition of the air of the
TOOIn,
   When Messrs. Watkins and Hill have got the construction
of the aërometric balance perfected, I should feel great interest
in the results obtained in different parts of the country, but
must leave the observations to others with better opportunities
and more time, and rest satisfied with having completed the
less important task of designing and superintending the con
structions of the means of observation.
   The observations of the table have a point of interest in
having been taken through one period of storm, and another
of dark but high fog.

    § 29. On the polar or other condition of diamagnetic bodies.
  2640.       Foº years ago I suggested that all the phaeno
                     mena presented by diamagnetic bodies, when sub
  jected to the forces in the magnetic field, might be accounted
   for by assuming that they then possessed a polarity the same
   in kind as, but the reverse in direction of, that acquired by
   iron, nickel and ordinary magnetic bodies under the same
   circumstances (2429. 2430.).                      This view was received so
   favourably by Plücker, Reich and others, and above all by
   W. Webert, that I had great hopes it would be confirmed;
   and though certain experiments of my own (2497.) did not
   increase that hope, still my desire and expectation were in
   that direction.
       2641. Whether bismuth, copper, phosphorus, &c., when
      * From the Philosophical Transactions for 1850, part i.; having been
   received by the Royal Society January 1, and read March 7 and 14, 1850.

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies,             89
in the magnetic field, are polar or not, is however an exceed
ingly important question; and very essential and great differ
ences, in the mode of action of these bodies under the one
view or the other, must be conceived to exist. I found that
in every endeavour to proceed by induction of experiment
from that which is known in this department of science to the
unknown, so much uncertainty, hesitation and discomfort
arose from the unsettled state of my mind on this point, that
I determined, if possible, to arrive at some experimental proof
either one way or the other. This was the more needful,
because of the conclusion in the affirmative to which Weber
had come in his very philosophical paper; and so important
do I think it for the progress of science, that, in those imper
fectly developed regions of knowledge, which form its boun
daries, our conclusions and deductions should not go far be
yond, or at all events not aside from the results of experiment
(except as suppositions), that I do not hesitate to lay my pre
sent labours, though they arrive at a negative result, before
the Royal Society.
    2642. It appeared to me that many of the results which
had been supposed to indicate a polar condition, were only
 consequences of the law that diamagnetic bodies tend to go
from stronger to weaker places of action (2418.); others again
appeared to have their origin in induced currents (26. 2338.);
and further consideration seemed to indicate that the differ
ences between these modes of action and that of a real pola
 rity, whether magnetic or diamagnetic, might serve as a foun
 dation on which to base a mode of investigation, and also to
 construct an apparatus that might give useful conclusions and
 results in respect of this inquiry. For, if the polarity exists it
 must be in the particles and for the time permanent, and
 therefore distinguishable from the momentary polarity of the
 mass due to induced temporary currents; and it must also
 be distinguishable from ordinary magnetic polarity by its
 contrary direction.
    2643. A straight wooden lever, 2 feet in length, was fixed
 by an axis at one end, and by means of a crank and wheel
 made to vibrate in a horizontal plane, so that its free extre
 mity passed to and fro through about two inches. Cylinders
 or cores of metal or other substances, 5}, inches long and
 three-quarters of an inch diameter, were fixed in succession
 to the end of a brass rod 2 feet long, which itself was attached
 at the other end to the moving extremity of the lever, so that
 the cylinders could be moved to and fro in the direction of
 their length through the space of 2 inches. A large cylinder
 electro-magnet was also prepared (2191.), the iron core of

 90    Dr. Faraday's Experimental Researches in Electricity:
 which was 21 inches long and 17 inch in diameter; but one
 end of this core was made smaller for the length of 1 inch,
 being in that part only 1 inch in diameter.
    2644. On to this reduced part was fixed a hollow helix
 consisting of 516 feet of fine covered copper wire: it was
 3 inches long, 2 inches external diameter, and 1 inch internal
diameter: when in its place, 1 inch of the central space was
occupied by the reduced end of the electro-magnet core
which carried it; and the magnet and helix were both placed
 concentric with the metal cylinder above-mentioned, and at
such a distance that the latter, in its motion, would move
within the helix in the direction of its axis, approaching to
and receding from the electro-magnet in rapid or slow suc
 cession. The least and greatest distances of the moving cy
 linder from the magnet during the journey were one-eighth of
 an inch and 2:2 inches. The object of course was to observe
any influence upon the experimental helix of fine wire which
 the metal cylinders might exert, either whilst moving to or
 from the magnet, or at different distances from it”.
    2645. The extremities of the experimental helix wire were
 connected with a very delicate galvanometer, placed 18 or 20
 feet from the machine, so as to be unaffected directly by the
 electro-magnet; but a commutator was interposed between
 them. This commutator was moved by the wooden lever
 (2643.), and as the electric currents which would arrive at it
 from the experimental helix, in a complete cycle of motion or
 to and fro action of the metal cylinder (2643.), would consist
of two contrary portions, so the office of this commutator was,
sometimes to take up these portions in succession and send
them on in one consistent current to the galvanometer, and at
other times to oppose them and to neutralize their result; and
therefore it was made adjustible, so as to change at any period
of the time or part of the motion.
    2646. With such an arrangement as this, it is known that,
however powerful the magnet, and however delicate the other
parts of the apparatus, no effect will be produced at the gal
vanometer as long as the magnet does not change in force, or
in its action upon neighbouring bodies, or in its distance from,
or relation to, the experimental helix; but the introduction
of a piece of iron into the helix, or anything else that can in
fluence or be influenced by the magnet, can, or ought to, show
a corresponding influence upon the helix and galvanometer.
   * It is very probable that if the metals were made into cylinders shorter,
but of larger diameter than those described above, and used with a corre
sponding wider helix, better results than those I have obtained would be
acquired.

            supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.           91
My apparatus I should imagine, indeed, to be almost the same
in principle and practice as that of M. Weber (2640.), except
that it gives me contrary results.
   2647. But to obtain correct conclusions, it is most essen
tial that extreme precaution should be taken in relation
to many points which at first may seem unimportant. All
parts of the apparatus should have perfect steadiness, and be
fixed almost with the care due to an astronomical instrument;
for any motion of any portion of it is, from the construction,
sure to synchronize with the motion of the commutator; and
portions of effect, inconceivably small, are then gathered up
and made manifest as a whole at the galvanometer; and thus,
without care, errors might be taken for real and correct re
sults. Therefore, in my arrangements, the machine (2643,
&c.), the magnet and helix, and the galvanometer stood upon
separate tables, and these again upon a stone floor laid upon
the earth ; and the table carrying the machine was carefully
strutted to neighbouring stone-work.
   2648. Again, the apparatus should itself be perfectly firm
and without shake in its motion, and yet easy and free. No
iron should be employed in any of the moving parts. I have
springs to receive and convert a portion of the momentum of
the whole at the end of the to and fro journey; but it is essen
tial that these should be of hammered brass or copper.
   2649. It is absolutely necessary that the cylinder or core
in its motion should not in the least degree disturb or shake
the experimental helix and the magnet. Such a shake may
easily take place and yet (without much experience) not be
perceived. It is important to have the cores of such bodies
as bismuth, phosphorus, copper, &c., as large as may be, but
I have not found it safe to have less than one-eighth of an
inch of space between them and the interior of the experi
mental helix.     In order to float, as it were, the core in the
air, it is convenient to suspend it in the bight or turn of a fine
copper wire passing once round it, the ends of which rise up,
and are made fast to two fixed points at equal heights but
wide apart, so that the wire has a V form. This suspension
keeps the core parallel to itself in every part of its motion.
   2650. The magnet, when excited, is urged by an electric
current from five pairs of Grove's plates, and is then very
powerful. When the battery is not connected with it, it still
remains a magnet of feeble power, and when thus employed
may be referred to as in the residual state. If employed in
the residual state, its power may for the time be considered
constant, and the experimental helix may at any moment be
connected with the galvanometer without any current appear

92 Dr. Faraday's Eaperimental Researches in Electricity:
ing there. But if the magnet be employed in the excited
state, certain important precautions are necessary; for upon
connecting the magnet with the battery and then connecting
the experimental helix with the galvanometer, a current will
appear at the latter, which will, in certain cases, continue for
a minute or more, and which has the appearance of being de
rived at once from that of the battery. It is not so produced,
however, but is due to the time occupied by the iron core in
attaining its maximum magnetic condition (2170. 2332.),
during the whole of which it continues to act upon the expe
rimental helix, producing a current in it. This time varies
with several circumstances, and in the same electro-magnet
varies especially with the period during which the nuagnet has
been out of use. When first employed, after two or three
days’ rest, it will amount to eighty or ninety seconds, or more.
On breaking battery contact and immediately renewing it, the
effect will be repeated, but occupy only twenty or thirty
seconds.    On a third intermission and renewal of the current,
it will appear for a still shorter period; and when the magnet
has been used at short intervals for some time, it seems ca
pable of receiving its maximum power almost at once. In
every experiment it is necessary to wait until the effect is shown
by the galvanometer to be over; otherwise the last remains
of such an effect might be mistaken for a result of polarity, or
some peculiar action of the bismuth or other body under in
vestigation.
   2651. The galvanometer employed was made by Ruhm
korff and was very sensible. The needles were strengthened
in their action and rendered so nearly equal, that a single vi
bration to the right or to the left occupied from sixteen to
twenty seconds. When experimenting with such bodies as
bismuth or phosphorus, the place of the needle was observed
through a lens. The perfect communication in all parts of
the circuit was continually ascertained by a feeble thermo
electric pair, warmed by the fingers. This was done also for
every position of the commutator, where the film of oxide
formed on any part by two or three days’ rest was quitesuffi
cient to intercept a feeble current.
   2652. In order to bring the phaenomena afforded by mag
netic and diamagnetic bodies into direct relation, I have not
so much noted the currents produced in the experimental
helix, as the effects obtained at the galvanometer. It is to be
understood, that the standard of deviation, as to direction, has
always been that produced by an iron wire moving in the
same direction at the experimental helix, and with the same
condition of the commutator and connecting wires, as the

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.           93
piece of bismuth or other body whose effects were to be ob
served and compared.
   2653. A thin glass tube, of the given size (2643.), 5} by }
inches, was filled with a saturated solution of protosulphate of
iron, and employed as the experimental core: the velocity
given to the machine at this and all average times of experi
ment was such as to cause five or six approaches and with
drawals of the core in one second; yet the solution produced
no sensible indication at the galvanometer. A piece of mag
netic glass tube (2854.), and a core of foolscap paper, magnetic
between the poles of the electro-magnet, were equally ineffi
cient. A tube filled with small crystals of protosulphate of
iron caused the needle to move about 2°, and cores formed
out of single large crystals, or symmetric groups of crystals of
sulphate of iron, produced the same effect. Red oxide of
iron (colcothar) produced the least possible effect. Iron
scales and metallic iron (the latter as a thin wire) produced
large effects.
   2654. Whenever the needle moved, it was consistent in its
direction with the effect of a magnetic body; but in many
cases, with known magnetic bodies, the motion was little or
none. This proves that such an arrangement is by no means
so good a test of magnetic polarity as the use of a simple or
an astatic needle. This deficiency of power in that respect
does not interfere with its ability to search into the nature of
the phaenomena that appear in the experiments of Weber,
Reich and others.
   2655. Other metals than iron were now employed and with
perfect success. If they were magnetic, as nickel and cobalt,
the deflection was in the same direction as for iron.     When
the metals were diamagnetic, the deflection was in the con
trary direction; and for some of the metals, as copper, silver
and gold, it amounted to 60° or 70°, which was permanently
sustained as long as the machine continued to work. But the
deflection was not the greatest for the most diamagnetic sub
stances, as bismuth or antimony, or phosphorus; on the con
trary, I have not been able to assure myself, up to this time,
that these three bodies can produce any effect. Thus far the
effect has been proportionate to the conducting power of the
substance for electricity. Gold, silver and copper have pro
duced large deflections, lead and tin less. Platina very little.
Bismuth and antimony none.
   2656. Hence there was every reason to believe that the
effects were produced by the currents induced in the mass of

94    Dr. Faraday's Experimental Researches in Electricity:
the moving metals, and not by any polarity of their particles.
I proceeded therefore to test this idea by different conditions
of the cores and the apparatus.
   2657. In the first place, if produced by induced currents,
the great proportion of these would exist in the part of the
core near to the dominant magnet, and but little in the more
distant parts; whereas in a substance like iron, the polarity
which the whole assumes makes length a more important ele
ment. I therefore shortened the core of copper from 5% inches
(2643.) to 2 inches, and found the effect not sensibly dimi
nished; even when I inch long it was little less than before.
On the contrary, when a fine iron wire, 54 inches in length,
was used as core, its effects were strong; when the length was
reduced to 2 inches, they were greatly diminished; and again,
with a length of 1 inch, still further greatly reduced. It is
not difficult to construct a core of copper, with a fine iron wire
in its axis, so that when above a certain length it should pro
duce the effects of iron, and beneath that length the effects of
copper.
   2658. In the next place, if the effect were produced by in
duced currents in the mass (2642.), division of the mass would
stop these currents and so alter the effect; whereas if pro
duced by a true diamagnetic polarity, division of the mass
would not affect the polarity seriously, or in its essential na
ture (2430.). Some copper filings were therefore digested
for a few days in dilute sulphuric acid to remove any adhering
iron, then well-washed and dried, and afterwards warmed and
stirred in the air, until it was seen by the orange colour that
a very thin film of oxide had formed upon them : they were
finally introduced into a glass tube (2653.) and employed as
a core. It produced no effect whatever, but was now as in
active as bismuth.
   2659. The copper may however be divided so as either to
interfere with the assumed currents or not, at pleasure. Fine
copper wire was cut up into lengths of 5% inches, and as many
of these associated together as would form a compact cylinder
three-quarters of an inch in diameter (2643); it produced no
effect at the galvanometer. Another copper core was pre
pared by associating together many discs of thin copper plate,
three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and this affected the
galvanometer, holding its needle 25° or 30° from zero.
   2660. I made a solid helix cylinder, three-quarters of an
inch in diameter and 2 inches long, of covered copper wire,
one-sixteenth of an inch thick, and employed this as the ex
perimental core.     When the two ends of its wire were uncon
nected, there was no effect upon the experimental helix, and

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.                      95
consequently none at the galvanometer; but when the ends
 were soldered together, the needle was well affected. In the
first condition, the currents, which tended to be formed in the
mass of moving metal, could not exist because the metal cir
cuit was interrupted; in the second they could, because the
 circuit was not interrupted; and such division as remained
 did not interfere to prevent the currents.
    2661. The same results were obtained with other metals.
 A core cylinder of gold, made of half-sovereigns, was very
powerful in its effect on the galvanometer. A cylinder of
silver, made of sixpenny pieces, was very effectual ; but a
cylinder made of precipitated silver, pressed into a glass tube
as closely as possible, gave no indications of action whatever.
 The same results were obtained with disc cylinders of tin and
lead, the effects being proportionate to the condition of tin
and lead as bad conductors (2655.).
    2662. When iron was divided, the effects were exactly the
reverse in kind. It was necessary to use a much coarser gal
vanometer and apparatus for the purpose; but that being done,
the employment of a solid iron core, and of another of the
same size or weight formed of lengths of fine iron wire (2659),
 showed that the division had occasioned no inferiority in the
latter. The excellent experimental researches of Dove” on the
electricity of induction, will show that this ought to be the case.
    2668. Hence the result of division in the diamagnetic metals
is altogether of a nature to confirm the conclusion, that the
effects produced by them are due to induced currents moving
through their masses, and not to any polarity correspondent
in its general nature (though opposed in its direction) to that
of iron.
    2664. In the third place (2656.), another and very im
portant distinction in the actions of a diamagnetic metal may
be experimentally established according as they may be due
either to a true polarity, or merely to the presence of tempo
rary induced currents; and as for the consideration of this
point diamagnetic and magnetic polarity are the same, the
point may best be considered, at present, in relation to iron.
    2665. If a core of any kind be advanced towards the domi
nant magnet and withdrawn from it by a motion of uniform
velocity, then a complete journey or to and from action might
be divided into four parts; the to, the stop after it; the from,
and the stop succeeding that. If a core of iron make this
journey, its end towards the dominant magnet becomes a pole,
rising in force until at the nearest distance, and falling in force
   * Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, vol. v. p. 129. I do not see a date to the
paper.

96 Dr. Faraday's Experimental Researches in Electricity:
until at the greatest distance. Both this effect, and its pro
gression inwards and outwards, cause currents to be induced
in the surrounding helix, and these currents are in one direc
tion as the core advances, and in the contrary direction as it
recedes. In reality, however, the iron does not travel with a
constant velocity; for, because of the communication of motion
from a revolving crank at the machine (2643.), it, in the to
part of the journey, gradually rises from a state of rest to a
maximum velocity, which is half-way, and then as gradually
sinks to rest again near the magnet:-and the from part of
the journey undergoes the same variations. Now as the
maximum effect upon the surrounding experimental helix
depends upon the velocity conjointly with the intensity of the
magnetic force in the end of the core, it is evident that it will
not occur with the maximum velocity, which is in the middle
of the to or from motion; nor at the stop nearest to the domi
nant magnet, where the core end has greatest magnetic force,
but somewhere between the two. Nevertheless, during the
whole of the advance, the core will cause a current in the ex
perimental helix in one direction, and during the whole of the
recession it will cause a current in the other direction.
   2666. If diamagnetic bodies, under the influence of the
dominant magnet, assume also a polar state, the difference
between them and iron being only that the poles of like names
or forces are changed in place (2429. 2430.), then the same
kind of action as that described for iron would occur with
them; the only difference being, that the two currents pro
duced would be in the reverse direction to those produced by
IrOn.
   2667. If a commutator, therefore, were to be arranged to
gather up these currents, either in the one case or the other,
and send them on to the galvanometer in one consistent cur
rent, it should change at the moments of the two stops (2665.),
and then would perform such duty perfectly. If, on the other
hand, the commutator should change at the times of maximum
velocity or maximum intensity, or at two other times equi
distant either from the one stop or from the other, then the
parts of the opposite currents intercepted between the changes
would exactly neutralize each other, and no final current
would be sent on to the galvanometer.
   2668. Now the action of the iron is, by experiment, of this
nature. If an iron wire be simply introduced or taken out of
the experimental helix with different conditions of the com
mutator, the results are exactly those which have been stated.
If the machine be worked with an iron wire core, the commu
tator changing at the stops (2665.), then the current gathered

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.           97
up and sent on to the galvanometer is a maximum; if the
commutator change at the moments of maximum velocity, or
at any other pair of moments equidistant from the one stop or
the other, then the current at the commutator is a minimum,
Or ().
   2669. There are two or three precautions which are neces
sary to the production of a pure result of this kind. In the
first place, the iron ought to be soft and not previously in a
magnetic state. In the next, an effect of the following kind
has to be guarded against. If the iron core be away from the
dominant magnet at the beginning of an experiment, then, on
working the machine, the galvanometer will be seen to move
in one direction for a few moments, and afterwards, notwith
standing the continued action of the machine, will return and
gradually take up its place at 0°. If the iron core be at its
shortest distance from the dominant magnet at the beginning
of the experiment, then the galvanometer needle will move in
the contrary direction to that which it took before, but will
again settle at 0°. These effects are due to the circumstance,
that, when the iron is away from the dominant magnet, it is
not in so strong a magnetic state, and when at the nearest to
it is in a stronger state, than the mean or average state, which
it acquires during the continuance of an experiment; and that
in rising or falling to this average state, it produces two cur
rents in contrary directions, which are made manifest in the
experiments described. These existing only for the first
moments, do, in their effects at the galvanometer, then appear,
producing a vibration which gradually passes away.
    2670. One other precaution I ought to specify. Unless
the commutator changes accurately at the given points of the
journey, a little effect is gathered up at each change, and may
give a permanent deflection of the needle in one direction or
the other. The tongues of my commutator, being at right
angles to the direction of motion and somewhat flexible,
dragged a little in the to and from parts of the journey: in
doing this they approximated, though only in a small degree,
to that which is the best condition of the commutator for
gathering up (and not opposing) the currents; and a deflec
tion to the right or left appeared (2677.). Upon discovering
the cause and stiffening the tongues so as to prevent their
flexure, the effect disappeared, and the iron was perfectly
inactive.
    2671. Such therefore are the results with an iron core,
 and such would be the effects with a copper or bismuth core
 if they acted by a diamagnetic polarity. Let us now con
sider what the consequences would be if a copper or bismuth

98    Dr. Faraday's Experimental Researches in Electricity:
 core were to act by currents, induced for the time, in its
 moving mass, and of the nature of those suspected (2642.).
 If the copper cylinder moved with uniform velocity (2665.),
 then currents would exist in it, parallel to its circumference,
during the whole time of its motion; and these would be at
 their maximum force just before and just after the to or inner
 stop, for then the copper would be in the most intense parts
 of the magnetic field. The rising current of the copper core
for the in portion of the journey would produce a current in
one direction in the experimental helix, the stopping of the
 copper and consequent falling of its current would produce
 in the experimental helix a current contrary to the former;
the first instant of motion outwards in the core would produce
a maximum current in it contrary to its former current, and
producing in the experimental helix its inductive result, being
a current the same as the last there produced; and then, as
the core retreated, its current would fall, and in so doing and
by its final stop, would produce a fourth current in the expe
rimental helix, in the same direction as the first.
    2672. The four currents produced in the experimental
helix alternate by twos, i. e. those produced by the falling of
the first current in the core and the rising of the second and
contrary current, are in one direction. They occur at the
instant before and after the stop at the magnet, i. e. from the
moment of maximum current (in the core) before, to the
moment of maximum current after, the stop; and if that stop
is momentary, they exist only for that moment, and should
during that brief time be gathered up by the commutator.
Those produced in the experimental helix during the falling
of the second current in the core and the rising of a third
current (identical with the first) in the return of the core to
the magnet, are also the same in direction, and continue from
the beginning of the retreat to the end of the advance (or from
maximum to maximum) of the core currents, i. e. for almost
the whole of the core journey; and these, by its change at
the maximum moments, the commutator should take up and
send on to the galvanometer.
   2673. The motion however of the core is not uniform in
velocity, and so sudden in its change of direction, but, as
before said (2665.), is at a maximum as respects velocity in
the middle of its approach to and retreat from the dominant
magnet; and hence a very important advantage. For its stop
may be said to commence immediately after the occurrence of
the maximum velocity; and if the lines of magnetic force were
equal in position and power there to what they are nearer to
the magnet, the contrary currents in the experimental helix

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.             99
would commence at those points of the journey; but, as the
core is entering into a more intense part of the field, the cur
rent in it still rises though the velocity diminishes, and the
consequence is, that the maximum current in it neither occurs
at the place of greatest velocity, nor of greatest force, but at
a point between the two. This is true both as regards the
approach and the recession of the core, the two maxima of
the currents occurring at points equidistant from the place of
rest near the dominant magnet.
   2674. It is therefore at these two points that the commu
tator should change, if adjusted to produce the greatest effect
at the galvanometer by the currents excited in the experi
mental helix, through the influence of, or in connexion with,
currents of induction produced in the core; and experiment
fully justifies this conclusion. If the length of the journey
from the stop out to the stop in, which is 2 inches (2643.
2644.), be divided into 100 parts, and the dominant magnet
be supposed to be on the right-hand, then such an expression
as the following, 50|50, may represent the place where the
commutator changes, which in this illustration would be mid
way in the to and from motion, or at the places of greatest
velocity.
   2675. Upon trial of various adjustments of the commutator,
I have found that from 7723 to 88|12, gave the best result
with a copper core. On the whole, and after many experi
ments, I conclude that with the given strength of electro
magnet, distance of the experimental core when at the nearest
from the magnet, length of the whole journey, and average
velocity of the machine, 86|14 may represent the points where
the induced currents in the core are at a maximum and where
the commutator ought to change.
   2676. From what has been said before (2667.), it will be
seen that both in theory and experiment these are the points
in which the effect of any polarity, magnetic or diamagnetic,
would be absolutely nothing. Hence the power of submitting
by this machine metals and other bodies to experiment, and
of eliminating the effects of magnetic polarity, of diamagnetic
polarity, and of inductive action, the one from the others: for
either by the commutator or by the direction of the polarity,
they can be separated; and further, they can also be com
bined in various ways for the purpose of elucidating their
joint and separate action.
   2677. For let the arrows in the diagram represent the to and
from journey, and the intersections of the lines a, b or c, d, &c.
the periods in the journey when the commutator changes (in
which case c, d will correspond to 50|50, and e,f to 86|14),
then a, b will represent the condition

But the line a, b indicates those points for the commutator
with which no effect will be produced on the galvanometer
by the induction of currents in the mass of the core. If the
line be inclined in one direction, as i, k, then these currents
will produce a deflection at the galvanometer on one side; if it
be inclined in the other direction, as l, m, then the deflection
will be on the other side.     Therefore the effects of these in
duced currents may be either combined with, or opposed to,
the effects of a polarity, whether it be magnetic or diamagnetic.
   2678. All the metals before mentioned (2655.), namely,
gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, platina, antimony and bismuth,
were submitted to the power of the electro-magnet under the
best adjustment (2675.) of the commutator. The effects were
stronger than before, being now at a maximum, but in the
same order; as regarded antimony and bismuth, they were
very small, amounting to not more than half a degree, and
may very probably have been due to a remainder of irregular
action in some part of the apparatus. All the experiments
with the divided cores (2658, &c.) were repeated with the
same results as before. Phosphorus, sulphur and gutta percha
did not, either in this or in the former state of the commutator,
give any indication of effect at the galvanometer.
   2679. As an illustration of the manner in which this posi
tion of the commutator caused a separation of the effects of
copper and iron, I had prepared a copper cylinder core 2
inches in length having an iron wire in its axis, and this being
employed in the apparatus gave the pure effect of the copper
with its induced currents.         Yet this core, as a whole, was
highly magnetic to an ordinary test-needle; and when the
two changes of the commutator were not equidistant from the
one stop or the other (2670. 2677.), the iron effect came out
powerfully, overruling the former and producing very strong
contrary deflections at the needle. The platinum core which
I have used is an imperfect cylinder, 2 inches long and 0.62
of an inch thick: it points magnetically between the poles of
                               º      -

            supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.          101
a horseshoe electro-magnet (2381.), making a vibration in less
than a second, but with the above condition of the commutator
(2675.) gives 4° of deflection due to the induced currents, the
magnetic effect being annulled or thrown out.
   2680. Some of the combined effects produced by oblique
position of the commutator points were worked out in confir
mation of the former conclusions (2677.). When the commu
tator was so adjusted as to combine any polar power which
the bismuth, as a diamagnetic body, might possess, with any
conducting power which would permit the formation of cur
rents by induction in its mass (2676.), still the effects were so
minute and uncertain as to oblige me to say that, experimen
tally, it is without either polar or inductive action.
    2681. There is another distinction which may usefully be
established between the effects of a true sustainable polarity,
either magnetic or diamagnetic, and those of the transient
induced currents dependent upon time. If we consider the
resistance in the circuit, which includes the experimental helix
and the galvanometer coil, as nothing, then a magnetic pole
of constant strength passed a certain distance into the helix,
would produce the same amount of current electricity in it,
whether the pole were moved into its place by a quick or a
slow motion. Or if the iron core be used (2668.) the same
result is produced, provided, in any alternating action, the
core is left long enough at the extremities of its journey to
acquire, either in its quick or slow alternation, the same state.
This I found to be the fact when no commutator nor domi
nant magnet was used; a single insertion of a weak magnetic
pole gave the same deflection, whether introduced quickly or
slowly; and when the residual dominant magnet, an iron wire
core, and the commutator in its position a, b (2677.) were
used, four journeys to and from produced the same effect at
the galvanometer when the velocities were as 1 : 5 or even
as 1 : 10.
    2682. When a copper, silver, or gold core is employed in
place of the iron, the effect is very different. There is no
 reason to doubt that, as regards the core itself, the same
 amount of electricity is thrown into the form of induced cir
 culating currents within it, by a journey to or from, whether
 that journey is performed quickly or slowly: the above expe
 riment (2681.) in fact confirms such a conclusion. But the
 effect which is produced upon the experimental helix is not
 proportionate to the whole amount of these currents, but to
 the maximum intensities to which they rise. When the core
 moves slowly, this intensity is small; when it moves rapidly,
 it is great, and necessarily so, for the same current of elec

 102 Dr. Faraday's Eaperimental Researches in Electricity:
 tricity has to travel in the two differing periods of time occu
 pied by the journeys. Hence the quickly moving core should
 produce a far higher effect on the experimental helix than the
 slowly moving core; and this also I found to be the fact.
    2683. The short copper core was adjusted to the apparatus,
 and the machine worked with its average velocity until forty
journeys to and from had been completed; the galvanometer
needle passed 39° west. Then the machine was worked with
a greater rapidity, also for forty journeys, and the needle
passed through 80° or more west; finally, being worked at a
slow rate for the same number of journeys, the needle went
through only 21° west. The extreme velocities in this expe
riment were probably as 1:6; the time in the longest case
was considerably less than that of one vibration of the needle
 (2651.), so that I believe all the force in the slowest case was
collected. The needle is very little influenced by the swing
 or momentum of its parts, because of the deadening effect of
 the copper plate beneath it, and, except to return to zero,
 moves very little after the motion of the apparatus ceases. A
silver core produced the same results.
    2684. These effects of induced currents have a relation to
the phaenomena of revulsion which I formerly described
 (2310. 2315. 2838.), being the same in their exciting cause
and principles of action, and so the two sets of phaenomena
confirm and illustrate each other. That the revulsive phae
nomena are produced by induced currents, has been shown
before (2327. 2329. 2336. 2339.); the only difference is, that
with them the induced currents were produced by exalting
the force of a magnet placed at a fixed distance from the
affected metal; whilst in the present phaenomena, the force of
the magnet does not change, but its distance from the piece
of metal does.
    2685. So also the same circumstances which affect the
phaenomena here affect the revulsive phaenomena.        A plate of
metal will, as a whole, be well-revulsed; but if it be divided
across the course of the induced currents it is not then affected
(2529.). A ring helix of copper wire, if the extremities be
unconnected, will not exhibit the phaenomena, but if they be
connected then it presents them (2660.).
   2686. On the whole, the revulsive phaenomena are a far
better test and indication of these currents than the present
effects; especially if advantage be taken of the division of the
mass into plates, so as to be analogous, or rather superior, in
their action to the disc cylinder cores (2659. 266.1.). Plati
num, palladium and lead in leaf or foil, if cut or folded into
squares half an inch in the side, and then packed regularly

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.           103
 together, will show the phaenomena of revulsion very well;
and that according to the direction of the leaves, and not of
the external form. Gold, silver, tin and copper have the re
 vulsive effects thus greatly exalted. Antimony, as I have
 already shown, exhibits the effect well (2514. 2519.). Both
it and bismuth can be made to give evidence of the induced
currents produced in them when they are used in thin plates,
either single or associated, although, to avoid the influence of
the diamagnetic force, a little attention is required to the
moments of making and breaking contact between the voltaic
battery and the electro-magnet.
   2687. Copper, when thus divided into plates, had its revul
sive phaenomena raised to a degree that I had not before ob
served. A piece of copper foil was annealed and tarnished
by heat, and then folded up into a small square block, half an
inch in the side and a quarter of an inch thick, containing
seventy-two folds of the metal. This block was suspended by
a silk film as before (2248.), and whilst at an angle of 30° or
thereabouts with the equatorial line (2252), the electro-magnet
was excited; it immediately advanced or turned until the
angle was about 45° or 50°, and then stood still. Upon the
interruption of the electric current at the magnet the revulsion
came on very strongly, and the block turned back again,
passed the equatorial line, and proceeded on until it formed
an angle of 50° or 60° on the other side; but instead of con
tinuing to revolve in that direction as before (2315.), it then
returned on its course, again passed the equatorial line, and
almost reached the axial position before it stood still. In fact,
as a mass, it vibrated to and fro about the equatorial line.
   2688. This however is a simple result of the principles of
action formerly developed (2329. 2336.). The revulsion is
due to the production of induced currents in the suspended
mass during the falling of the magnetism of the electro
magnet; and the effect of the action is to bring the axis of
these induced currents parallel to the axis of force in the mag
netic field. Consequently, if the time of the fall of magnetic
force, and therefore of the currents dependent thereon, be
greater than the time occupied by the revulsion of the copper
block as far as the equatorial line, any further motion of it
by momentum will be counteracted by a contrary force; and
if this force be strong enough the block will return. The
conducting power of the copper and its division into laminae,
tend to set up these currents very readily and with extra
power; and the very power which they possess tends to make
the time of a vibration so short, that two or even three vibra
tions can occur before the force of the electro-magnet has

104 Dr. Faraday's Eaperimental Researches in Llectricity:
ceased to fall any further. The effect of time, both in the
rising and falling of power, has been referred to on many
former occasions (2170. 2650.), and is very beautifully seen
here.
   2689. Returning to the subject of the assumed polarity of
bismuth, I may and ought to refer to an experiment made by
Reich, and described by Weberº, which, if I understand the
instruction aright, is as follows: a strong horseshoe magnet
is laid upon a table in such a position that the line joining its
two poles is perpendicular to the magnetic meridian and to
be considered as prolonged on one side; in that line, and
near the magnet, is to be placed a small powerful magnetic
needle, suspended by cocoon silk, and on the other side of it,
the pole of a bar magnet, in such a position and so near, as
exactly to counteract the effect of the horseshoe magnet, and
leave the needle to point exactly as if both magnets were
away. Then a mass of bismuth being placed between the
poles of the horseshoe magnet is said to react upon the small
magnet needle, causing its deflection in a particular direction,
and this is supposed to indicate the polarity of the bismuth
under the circumstances, as it has no such action when the
magnets are away. A piece of iron in place of the bismuth
produces the contrary deflection of the needle.              -
   2690. I have repeated this experiment most anxiously and
carefully, but have never obtained the slightest trace of action
with the bismuth.     I have obtained action with the iron; but
in those cases the action was far less than if the iron were
applied outside between the horseshoe magnet and the needle,
or to the needle alone, the magnets being entirely away. On
using a garnet, or a weak magnetic substance of any kind, I
cannot find that the arrangement is at all comparable for rea
diness of indication or delicacy, with the use of a common or
an astatic needle, and therefore I do not understand how it
could become a test of the polarity of bismuth when these fail
to show it.   Still I may have made some mistake; but neither
by close reference to the description, nor to the principles of
polar action, can I discover where.
   2691. There is an experiment which Plücker described to
me, and which at first seems to indicate strongly the polarity
of bismuth. If a bar of bismuth (or phosphorus) be suspended
horizontally between the poles of the electro-magnet, it will
go to the equatorial position with a certain force, passing, as I
 have said, from stronger to weaker places of action (2267.).

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.          105
If a bar of iron of the same size be fixed in the equatorial
position a little below the plane in which the diamagnetic bar
is moving, the latter will proceed to the equatorial position
with much greater force than before, and this is considered
as due to the circumstance, that, on the side where the iron
has N polarity, the diamagnetic body has S polarity, and that
on the other side the S polarity of the iron and the N polarity
of the bismuth also coincide.
    2692. It is however very evident that the lines of magnetic
force have been altered sufficiently in their intensity of direc
tion, by the presence of the iron, to account fully for the in
creased effect. For, consider the bar as just leaving the axial
position and going to the equatorial position; at the moment
of starting its extremities are in places of stronger magnetic
force than before, for it cannot be doubted for a moment that
the iron bar determines more force from pole to pole of the
electro-magnet than if it were away. On the other hand,
when it has attained the equatorial position, the extremities
are under a much weaker magnetic force than they were sub
ject to in the same places before; for the iron bar determines
downwards upon itself much of that force, which, when it is
not there, exists in the plane occupied by the bismuth. Hence,
 in passing through 90°, the diamagnetic is urged by a much
greater difference of intensity of force when the iron is present
 than when it is away; and hence, probably, the whole addi
 tional result. The effect is like many others which I have
 referred to in magnecrystallic action (2487-2497.), and does
 not, I think, add anything to the experimental proof of dia
 magnetic polarity.
     2693. Finally, I am obliged to say that I can find no ex
 perimental evidence to support the hypothetical view of dia
 magnetic polarity (2640.), either in my own experiments, or
 in the repetition of those of Weber, Reich, or others. I do
 not say that such a polarity does not exist; and I should think
 it possible that Weber, by far more delicate apparatus than
 mine, had obtained a trace of it, were it not that then also he
 would have certainly met with the far more powerful effects
 produced by copper, gold, silver, and the better conducting
 diamagnetics. If bismuth should be found to give any effect,
 it must be checked and distinguished by reference to the posi
 tion of the commutator, division of the mass by pulverization,
 influence of time, &c. It appears to me also, that, as the
 magnetic polarity conferred by iron or nickel in very small
 quantity, and in unfavourable states, is far more readily indi
 cated by its effect on an astatic needle, or by pointing between
  the poles of a strong horseshoe magnet, than by any such

 106                y Experimental
        Dr. Faraday's     p            Researches in Electricity:
                                                               3/
 arrangement as mine or Weber's or Reich's, so diamagnetic
 polarity would be much more easily distinguished in the same
 way, and that no indication of that polarity has as yet reached
 to the force and value of those already given by Brugmann
 and myself.
    2694. So, at present, the actions represented or typified by
 iron, by copper and by bismuth, remain distinct; and their
 relations are only in part made known to us. It cannot be
 doubted that a larger and simpler law of action than any we
 are yet acquainted with, will hereafter be discovered, which
 shall include all these actions at once; and the beauty of
 Weber's suggestion in this respect was the chief inducement
 to me to endeavour to establish it.
    2695. Though from the considerations above expressed
 (2693.) I had little hopes of any useful results, yet I thought
 it right to submit certain magnecrystallic cores to the action
 of the apparatus. One core was a large group of symmetri
 cally disposed crystals of bismuth (2457.); another a very
 large crystal of red ferroprussiate of potassa; a third a cry
 stal of calcareous spar; and a fourth and fifth large crystals
 of protosulphate of iron. These were formed into cylinders,
 of which the first and fourth had the magnecrystallic axes
 (2479.) parallel to the axis of the cylinder, and the second,
 third and fifth, had the equatorial direction of force (2594.
 2595. 2546.) parallel to the axis of the cylinder. None of
 them gave any effect at the galvanometer, except the fourth
 and fifth, and these were alike in their results, and were de
 pendent for them on their ordinary magnetic property.
    2696. Some of the expressions I have used may seem to
 imply, that, when employing the copper and other cores, I
imagine that currents are first induced in them by the domi
nant magnet, and that these induce the currents which are
observed in the experimental helix. Whether the cores act
directly on the experimental helix or indirectly through their
influence on the dominant magnet, is a very interesting ques
tion, and I have found it difficult to select expressions, though
I wished to do so, which should not in some degree prejudge
that question. It seems to me probable, that the cores act
indirectly on the helix, and that their immediate action is
altogether directed towards the dominant magnet, which,
whether they consist of magnetic or diamagnetic metals, raises
them into power either permanently or transiently, and has
their power for that time directed towards it. Before the
core moves to approach the magnet, the magnet and experi
mental helix are in close relation; and the latter is situated
in the intense field of magnetic force which belongs to the

           supposed Polarity of Diamagnetic Bodies.          107
 ole of the former. If the core be iron, as it approaches the
magnet it causes a strong convergence and concentration of
the lines of magnetic force upon itself; and these, as they so
converge, passing through the helix and across its convolu
tions, are competent to produce the currents in it which are
obtained (2653. 2668.). As the iron retreats these lines of
force diverge, and again crossing the line of the wire in the
helix in a contrary direction to their former course, produce a
contrary current. It does not seem necessary, in viewing the
action of the iron core, to suppose any direct action of it on
the helix, or any other action than this which it exerts upon
the lines of force of the magnet. In such a case its action
upon the helix would be indirect.
   2697. Then, by all parity of reasoning, when a copper core
enters the helix its action upon it should be indirect also. For
the currents which are produced in it are caused by the direct
influence of the magnet, and must react equivalently upon it.
This they do, and because of their direction and known action,
they will cause the lines of force of the magnet to diverge. As
the core diminishes in its velocity of motion, or comes to rest,
the currents in it will cease, and then the lines of force will
converge; and this divergence and convergence, or passage in
two directions across the wire of the experimental helix, is
sufficient to produce the two currents which are obtained in
the advance of the core towards the dominant magnet (2671.
2673.). A corresponding effect in the contrary direction is
produced by the retreat of the core.
   2698. On the idea that the actions of the core were not of
this kind, but more directly upon the helix, I interposed sub
stances between the core and the helix during the times of the
experiment. A thick copper cylinder 2:2 inches long, 07 of
an inch external diameter, and 0°1 of an inch internal dia
meter, and consequently 0.3 of an inch thick in the sides, was
placed in the experimental helix, and an iron wire core (2668.)
used in the apparatus. Still, whatever the form of the expe
riment, the kind and amount of effect produced was the same
as if the copper were away, and either glass or air in its place.
When the dominant magnet was removed and the wire core
made a magnet, the same results were produced.
   2699. Another copper lining, being a cylinder 2:5 inches
long, l inch in external diameter, and one-eighth of an inch
in thickness, was placed in the experimental helix, and cores
of silver and copper five-eighths of an inch in thickness, em
ployed as before, with the best condition of the commutator
(2675.): the effects, with and without the copper, or with and
without the glass, were absolutely the same (2698.).

108         Mr. W. Spottiswoode on the Geometrical
   2700. There can be no doubt that the copper linings, when
in place, were full of currents at the time of action, and that
when away no such currents would exist in the air or glass
replacing them. There is also full reason to admit, that the
divergence and convergence of the magnetic lines of force
supposed above (2697.) would satisfactorily account for such
currents in them, supposing the indirect action of the cores
were assumed. If that supposition be rejected, then it seems
to me that the whole of the bodies present, the magnet, the
helix, the core, the copper lining, or the air or glass which
replaces it, must all be in a state of tension, each part acting
on every other part, being in what I have occasionally else
where imagined as the electro-tonic state (1729.).
    2701. The advance of the copper makes the lines of mag
netic force diverge, or, so to say, drives them before it (2697.).
No doubt there is reaction upon the advancing copper, and
the production of currents in it in such a direction as makes
them competent, if continued, to continue the divergence. But
it does not seem logical to say, that the currents which the
lines of force cause in the copper, are the cause of the diver
gence of the lines of force. It seems to me, rather, that the
lines of force are, so to say, diverged, or bent outward by the
advancing copper (or by a connected wire moving across lines
of force in any other form of the experiments), and that the
reaction of the lines of force upon the forces in the particles
of the copper causes them to be resolved into a current, by
which the resistance is discharged and removed, and the line
of force returns to its place. I attach no other meaning to
the words line of force than that I have given on a former
occasion (2149.).

     X. On the Geometrical Interpretation of Quaternions.
ByWILLIAM Spottiswoode, M.A., of BalliolCollege,Oxford+.
                       § 1. Fundamental Laws.
TH; following investigations           refer to the same subject as
        that treated by Professor Donkin in vol. xxxvi. of this
Journal; and are offered, not as at all preferable to his, but
simply as indicating another mode in which the question may be
viewed; it being desirable to exhibit a subject, which is some
what new, in more than one way, in order that as much light
as possible may be thrown upon it. The present paper will be
interesting (if it is so at all) principally because its results are
substantially the same as those of the paper just referred to,
                      * Communicated by the Author.

                  Interpretation of Quaternions.               109
 although obtained by an entirely independent process. I have
 stated my views as briefly as possible, because Prof. Donkin's
paper renders any more lengthened discussion superfluous;
and if any expressions occur which appear to indicate a view
of algebraic symbols, &c. different from his, they have been
 used merely because they are the ordinary terms; and I should
wish them to be understood as far as possible in his way, if
for no better reason, at least in order that the two methods
may be compared.
    The calculus of quaternions is a generalization of algebra,
in which sets of four ordinary algebraical quantities are used
instead of single quantities. Each such set of four quantities
is called a quaternion; the nature and laws of combination of
which are the object of the present investigations. The cor
 responding laws in ordinary algebra will be assumed as known.
    Let a quaternion be defined to be a set of four algebraic
quantities considered with reference to their order of position,
and let it be expressed by the following equation,
                           Q=(w, r, y, z), . . . . . (1)
in which Q, or its equivalent, is called the quaternion, and
w, w, y, z its constituents. As this definition involves no law
of connexion between the constituents, it is clear that the equi
valence of any number of quaternions must involve the equi
valence of their several constituents; so that the equations
                        Q=Q1=Q3-...           . . . . . (2.)
involve the following,
                        w=w=iss=... )
                        4 = @1 =4'2 = . . .
                        3/=3/1 =3/2 = . . .
                          = z = 22   =.j
and conversely (3.) will involve (2.). The same principle
gives rise to the following law for the addition and subtraction
of quaternions:
                 XQ = (Xu, Xa, Xy, Xz,);            . . . (4.)
particular cases of which are
                     nG)=(nw, na, ny, m2) . . . . . (5.)
                     Q—Q=0= (0, 0, 0, 0). . . . . (6.)
   The following consideration will assist further investigations.
The quaternion
                            (w, 0, 0, 0) . . . . . . . (7.)
is a system consisting of the quantity w, followed by no other

1 10        Mr. W. Spottiswoode on the Geometrical
quantities, i. e. associated with nothing but itself; in other
words, it is simply equivalent to the ordinary algebraic quan
tity w; so that by means of the law of addition of quaternions,
it will be allowable to write,
(w, w, y, z)=(w,0,0,0)-- (0, a,0,0)--(0,0, y, 0)+(0,0,0,  *}'s )
            =w-- (0, w, 0, 0) + (0, 0, y, 0)+(0, 0, 0, 2)
With respect to the last three terms of this expression, it will
be necessary to introduce some new symbols. Thus, for in
stance, if T, T, T" indicate the operations of transposition
defined by the following equations,
                   T (r, 0, 0, 0)=(0, r, 0, 0)
                   T'(y, 0, 0, 0)=(0, 0, y, 0) >, . . . (9.)
                  T" (2, 0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0, z)
the equation (8.) might be written
                    Q=w--Tw-HT'y--T"z. . . . . (10.)
And, if the laws of the combination of the symbols T, T, T"
were known, the general laws of the combination of quater
nions would be at once deducible.
   It will however be more advantageous to use some symbols
of transposition rather different from those above noticed; let
then
                      i Q=(—a, w, -2, y)
                     jQ=(-y, 8, w,-4) >; . . . . (11.)
                      kQ=(-2, -y, a, w)
from these definitions of the symbols of transposition, i, j, k,
it is easy to deduce the following relations:
i. iQ=j.jQ= k.k0= i.f.kQ= (–w, -a, -y, -2)=-Q]
       j.kQ= —k.jQ= iQ                                       | (12.)
        K. iQ= — i.kQ=jQ                                     } (12.
        i.jQ= —j. iQ= kG)                                   |
in which the expression for – Q may be deduced from (5.) by
writing – 1 for n. These relations may be symbolically
written, as follows:
                     i°=j*=k*=ijk = –1
                     jk = –1j= i
                     Ki = —ik=j                 , . . .   .    (13.)

the operations of transposition and change of sign being in
dependent of the subject of operation.
    As it will assist the geometrical interpretation of the ope
rations i, j, k hereafter, to separate each of them into two di
 stinct operations, the formulae to which such separation gives
rise may be properly noticed          here. Let then
         i'Q=(—a, w, y, z)             i"Q=(w, a , –2, y)

 where P represents the symbolical product without reference
 to order. By means of the above properties of i, j, k, it will
 be possible to transform the expression of a quaternion (1.)
 into another of the same form as (10.); for
                  (0, ar, 0, 0) = i (a’, 0, 0, 0) = ir
                  (0, 0, y, 0) =j (y, 0, 0, 0)=jy X; .           .  (17.)
                   (0, 0, 0, 8) = k(x, 0, 0, 0) = kx
 so that (8.) may be written thus,

 in which i, j, k may be combined according to the laws de
 fined by (13.). It may be observed, that, since by means of
 the condition (4.) the addition of quaternions is reduced to the
 addition of ordinary algebraical quantities, the order and clus
 tering of the terms in (18.) is indifferent, so that the associa
 tive principle of addition among those terms is completely
 established; the same is obviously the case with respect to
the addition of quaternions in general. It may be further
 remarked, that, since by means of (4.),
iXQ, XiQ, j>Q, = XjQ,

with other like formulae, the distributive character of the sym
bols i, j, k is also established.
    The following verifications, although not essential to the
theory, are perhaps worth noticing. If we had taken (18.) as
the definition of a quaternion with (13.) as the definitions of
i, j, k, we should have found
                       iQ=iw—w-H ky—jz

so that the equations
                         Q = Q = Q, =      •**3
which obviously involve also
                       iQ= iQ = iQ2- ..."
                      jQ=jQ1=jQ2- ... }, . . . . (21.)
                      kQ=kGM = kG),= ...
give rise to the equations (3.); for i, j, k being symbolical ex
pressions for (—)", render all real terms, to which they are
prefixed, imaginary in the ordinary sense of that word. The          <U+017F>º
same definition of a quaternion gives
                 XQ, = 2w,+ i>a, +jXy,+ k>z, . . . (22.)
which is in fact identical with (4.).
    But the principal advantage of the linear form of the ex

cation and division. In the form (1.) it does not seem possible
to obtain a complete solution of the problem of multiplication;

 114       Mr. W. Spottiswoode on the Geometrical
In accordance with the fundamental idea of a quaternion, the
position of the line represented by any constituent will be sup
posed to depend upon the position which that constituent
holds in the first expression for Q; so that the directions of
the four lines being once chosen, the first, second, third, and
fourth constituents will always represent lines drawn in the
four directions respectively, whatever changes may have taken
place in the order of the constituents as originally given. Now,
returning to the equations (13.) and (14.) of the former sec
tion, it appears that i!" indicates a change by which the nega
tive axis of z is brought into the old position of the axes of y;
and the axis of y into the old position of the axis of z; the
positions of w and a remaining unchanged; or i" may be con
sidered as indicating a change by which w and a are brought
into positions such, that they are situated, with respect tot he
negative axis of 2 and the positive axis of y, in the same man
ner as they were at first with respect to the axes of y and 2.
respectively. When the axes are rectangular, as at present,
this change may be represented, either by supposing the plane
of y2 to revolve in its own plane through half a right angle in
the direction from y to x, or by supposing the three axes to
remain fixed, and the radius vector w to revolve on the surface
of a right cone with a circular base, whose axis is that of a
and vertex the origin, through one quarter of a revolution;
the direction of rotation being from the axis of z towards that
of y. It is easily seen that j" and k" may be represented by
similar revolutions about the axes of y and 2 respectively.
   Again, i' indicates a change by which the negative axis of
w is brought into the old position of w, and w into the old
position of the positive axis of a, the positions of y and 2 re
maining unchanged; and if x be the angle between the axis
of w and the line w (the vertical angle of the first cone), this
change may be represented by bringing the negative axis of
the cone into the old position of w, and then opening the ver
tical angle of the cone through an angle = T-22.              The
changes.j' and k' may similarly be represented by supposing
the negative axes of the other two cones respectively to take
the position of w, and the vertical angle of the cones to be
opened through angles = ºr—23 and r–2) respectively. The
above theory becomes much simpler when the position of w is
not absolutely determined, but merely restricted to a given
plane; in this case its position may be supposed to coincide
with the intersection of that plane with one of the coordinate
planes; e. g. in the case of i, with the intersection with the
plane of y2; in that of j, with that of zw; and in that of k, with
that of ay; the three cones then become simply the three co

 line of intersection through angles = a in the planes of y2, za,
ay respectively; and i', j', k' similar rotations in the planes of
wa, wy, wº. In each case the origin of the rotations is deter
 In 111ate.
     If the position of w be entirely arbitrary, the positions of
the intersections of the planes of war, wy, we with those of y2,
zr, wy, will be so also; and the only difference arising in the
significations of i', j, k, i', j", k", will be that the origin of
rotation is restricted only to the three coordinate planes suc
cessively, the position in those planes being arbitrary. These
considerations will enable us to interpret É. various terms in
the linear expression for Q; for
                    iw-f(x, 0, 0, 0) = (0, 1, 0, 0) . . . . (2.)
                    jy=f(y, 0, 0, 0)=(0, 0, y, 0) . . . . (3)
                    Az=k(z, 0, 0, 0)=(0, 0, 0, 2) . . . . (4.)
     Now the first constituent of the quaternions on the right
hand side of the above expression will, according to the prin
ciples of interpretation above given, be considered as repre
senting a line coinciding with the intersection of a plane pass
ing through the axis of
                  ac, with the plane of y2, in (2.);

and consequently ir, <U+017F>y, kz will represent that the lines whose
lengths are represented by ar, y, x have revolved through
angles each = # in planes perpendicular to their original di
rections.
    Adopting the above interpretation of the various terms in
the expression for a quaternion, the question next arises, in
what sense are the lines represented by these terms, and by
quaternions generally, said to be added? Now the funda
mental formula for the addition of quaternions shows that in
whatever way the line Q is formed from the quantities w,a, y, z
(with similar expressions for any other quaternions Qi, Q, ...),
then the sum XQ, is a new quaternion line formed in the same
manner from the quantities Xr, Xa, Xy, X2, ; and writing
                       XQ,-Q=(W, X, Y, Z),
it appears that W will be the algebraical sum of the lines
w, w, ..., supposed, for convenience, to be similarly directed,

diagonal of the parallelopiped formed on the sums of the com

pears that straight lines lying in the same straight line are to
be added as in ordinary algebraical geometry, while the sum
of any other set of straight lines inclined to one another at any
angles is the closing side of the polygon formed by placing
the beginning of each line at the termination of its prede

in statics. In accordance with this principle, the sum

   The following cases will exemplify the above interpretation
of quaternions.
   If ABC be a spherical triangle, the radius being equal to
unity, and if Q, Q, Q" indicate the rotations of the radius
vector from B to C, from C to A, from A to B respectively,
it is clear that we must always have
                 Q"Q'Q= QQ'Q' = Q'QQ"= 1.
   In order to find the quaternion which will represent the ro
tation from the line (l, m, n) to the line (l', m', n'), we may con
struct a quadrantal triangle such that (l, m, n), (l', m', n') pass
through the angles opposite to the quadrantal sides; and if Q
be the required quaternion,
               (li--mj+nk)(!'i +m}+n'k)0= –1 ;
but since
              (li-H my--nk)*=(l'i +m}+n'})*= –1,
              (l'i-H m; +n'k)Q=(li-H my--nk)

   = -(ll'+mm'+nn') + i(mn'—m'n)+j(n!—n'l) +k(lm'—l'm).
   To find the quaternions which will represent the rotations
from the three coordinate axes to the line (l, m, n), we need
only put in the above equation,

 XI. On the Structure and Arrangement of the Tesserae in a
     Roman pavement discovered at Cirencester in August 1849. By
     JAMEs BuckMAN, F.L.S., F.G.S.*
 THE       object of this paper is to point out the nature of the
         materials of which the party-coloured floors so beautifully
 wrought in ancient Roman dwellings are composed, as also to
 offer some remarks upon their principles of arrangement.
     The tesserae of Roman pavements may be said to be formed
 out of two classes of materials, the first of which, consisting of
portions of various coloured rocks, may be termed natural; the
 ºcial.
          of stained or coloured terra cottas and glass, being arti
    The natural tesserae furnish but few colours, and those of a
sober cast, hence these will be found forming shadings to figures
entering largely into the composition of borders, or filling up the
groundworks of the designs. They consist of portions of natural
rocks from various localities, those belonging to the district where
the pavement is found, as far as I have observed, always contri
buting their share.
   The Cirencester pavement presented the following:—
             Colours.                          Rocks.
    1. White, composed of ...... Hard fine-grained Oolite.
   2. Light yellow ............... Pebbles of the Wiltshire Drift, and Oolite.
   3. Gray ........................ The same as No. 1, altered by heat.
   4. Slate colour or black     ... Limestone bands of the Lower Lias.
    No. 1 occurs as a bed of compact fine-grained stone of about
2 feet thick in nearly all the freestone quarries of this district,
where it is distinguished under the name of the Limestone bed;
its geological position is about the middle of the freestone rocks
of the Great Oolite; it is well exposed at Trewsbury quarry, at
the Acman Street Station, and at the smaller Sapperton tunnel,
and was no doubt obtained by the Romans from the quarries
once worked by them in the vicinity of the Querns.
    2. The tesserae, of a yellowish or mankeen hue, appear to
have been made of portions of the pebble-drift with which parts
of the neighbourhood of Cirencester is so thickly strewn. Stray
pebbles of this may be found in almost every field to the south
of the town, whilst at Somerford Kaynes, and other places, it en
ters largely into the composition of the gravel beds which are
there worked. It is probable that this drift is the debris of that
tertiary rock known in Wiltshire as Sarsen stone, of which the
huge stones of Abury Camp constitute the more enduring mo
nument.
   3. This, though differing so much in colour from No. 1, yet
               * Read to the Cotswold Club, Jan. 22, 1850.

120       Mr. J. Buckman on the Structure and Arrangement
seemed so identical in lithological structure as to induce me to
try to ascertain from experiment whether or not they were the
same, when, on roasting a portion of the rock No. 1 in the fire
for a few minutes, it gradually assumed the colour of the gray
tesserae, the change no doubt being due to some alteration in the
chemical conditions of the iron with which the stone is slightly
charged.
   4. The dark colour of the lias entered largely into the compo
sition of these pavements, as much of the outline of the design
and the darker bands of the border ornaments are composed of
this stone, which, judging from an Ammonite found in one of the
tesserae, was obtained from some one of the thin layers of argil
laceous limestone with which the clay-beds of the third division
of the lower lias in the vale of Gloucester are separated, and no
doubt the stone in question was brought from that locality.
   The artificial tesserae found at Cirencester entered for the most
part into the construction of the finer and more important parts
of the details of the figures and designs; they consist of
                 Colour.                              Substance.
            1. Black
            2. Light  º
            3. Dark red
                            - - - - - - - - - Terra cotta or baked clay.
            4. Brilliant ruby-red ... Glass.
   1. This is a much darker shade than that of the lias, and was
consequently used in those portions of figures where bold relief
was required; it seems to be composed of a dark-coloured clay,
only slightly, if at all burnt; as the tesserae are very fragile, this
would almost lead to the conclusion that these were not arti
ficially coloured but made of a clay containing a large quantity of
protoxide of iron, which is black, and they were consequently
burnt in smother kilns, or the black would change to red by the
protoxide becoming peroxidized. The identity of constitution of
these tesserae with black pottery is very apparent.
   2 and 3. The two reds are made from clays containing more
or less of iron, and perhaps this substance may have been added
in these and in the instance above noticed, where it was desirable
to deepen the tint; of course the red is due to the peroxidation of
the iron salts.
   4. In only one medallion of the Cirencester pavements has
glass been made to play a part, and that is just when the trans
parency and brilliancy of colour of this substance were of the
utmost importance to the composition.
   An examination of the pavement itself will show that the me
dallion which symbolized Spring, represents a fine female head
crowned by what appears a chaplet of olive-green and verdigris
coloured leaves. Now on studying this head attentively, I was

              of the Tesserae in a Roman Pavement.               121
surprised at seeing these two colours intermixed apparently in a
most inharmonious manner; and as the verdigris-green was so
different from any other colour I had met with, it suddenly
struck me that it was a mere coating to the tesserae, resulting
perhaps from chemical decomposition, and on scraping the sur
face with a knife I was gratified to find that the verdigris only
covered up a glass of an exceedingly rich ruby tint. I then ob
tained a small portion for a chemical analysis, which was kindly
undertaken for me by Dr. Voelcker, the College Professor of
Chemistry, the results of which are so interesting that I must
beg to lay it before the Club in his own words.
       Eacamination of red-coloured Roman glass (Cirencester).
    “The red glass which had undergone a partial decomposition
was coated with a white crust, which itself was covered with a
 green substance. The latter on examination proved to be car
 bonate of copper; the white crust dissolved with effervescence
 in nitric acid, leaving gelatinous silicic acid behind, and was
 found to consist principally of carbonate of lead and silica. The
 glass, after having been treated with nitric acid and thus been
 deprived of the white and green coatings, exhibited a bright red
 colour; it was now transparent, not very hard, and easily flexible
 when exposed to a moderate heat. On analysis the following
 substances were detected, as–
     Oxide of lead.                     Oxide of iron.
     Protoxide of copper.               Lime.
     Alumina.                           Silica.
     “The red colour of the glass undoubtedly is due to protoxide
 of copper, which was present probably in combination with alu
  mina in considerable quantities. It is well known that the an
  cients were acquainted with the art of colouring glass red by
  means of copper, for Cooper informs us (Annales de Chimie,
  série 1. tom. lxxiii. p. 20) that he detected in an antique red
  glass protoxide of copper, and Klaproth likewise ascribes the red
  colour of an antique glass to the presence of copper, which he con
  siders to be contained in the glass in the state of protoxide. This
  gentleman found exactly the same constituent parts as those
  found by me in the Cirencester glass; it has further been ascer
  tained that all the red glass in antique mosaic church windows is
  coloured red by copper.      Gold, which likewise imparts a beau
  tiful red colour to glass, is never met with in Roman glass, and
  it appears that the property of gold and its combinations was
  unknown to the Romans, for we do not find any traces with the
  ancients which could justify the supposition of their being ac
  quainted with the art of making the purple and rose-coloured or

 122 On the Arrangement of the Tesserae in a Roman Pavement.
 ruby-glass which at present is manufactured in great perfection
 in Bohemia, where a preparation of gold, generally chloride of
 gold, is used for that purpose by the glass manufacturer. The
 application of gold preparations in the preparation of red glass,
 comparatively speaking, is of recent origin, for it appears that
 before the 17th century the use of gold preparation for this par
 ticular purpose was unknown. In the 17th century we find
 the first reference made to the use of gold for colouring glass
 red by Cassius, who discovered and recommended a new com
 bination of gold, which, to the present day, is known under the
 name of Cassius gold purple.
    “Copper thus appears to have been the material with which
 the ancients were in the habit of colouring glass red. Various
methods of applying copper were in use, and though metallic
 copper is capable of imbuing glass with a red colour, no doubt
on account of the protoxide of copper which is found in almost
every sample of copper, in most cases it was first subjected to
operations which tended to generate protoxide of copper. Fre
quently also peroxide of copper (black oxide) was used for the
same purpose, but in this case the glass mass received an addi
tion of substances, as tartar, charcoal, soot, iron, protoxide of
iron, which substances at a red heat combine with part of the
oxygen of the black oxide, and thus become the means of redu
cing the latter to red oxide of copper.
    “This important action of iron seems to have been known to the
ancients, for both Cooper's and Klaproth’s analyses of antique red
glass referred to above, as well as my own of the Roman glass
found in Cirencester, exhibits, besides oxide of copper, oxide of
iron. Later the art of colouring glass red by means of copper
was lost entirely, and many persons of our days even denied
altogether the possibility of producing a red glass with copper.
Very generally all red glass was supposed to contain gold.
   “The importance of the subject induced the Society of Arts
of Berlin to offer a prize for a method of manufacturing red glass
by means of copper. The prize was gained by D. Engelhardt of

glass, and who succeeded in making a beautiful red glass with

   From this analysis it will be seen that the liomans imparted
this red tint to glass by a very ingenious method, and it was the
substance used for this purpose, namely copper, which covered
over the tesserae as the surface of the glass had become decom
posed in the form of a carbonate of that metal.

figures that it may almost be taken for granted that, as in this
instance, when there is an exception in this particular, it is due
to some subsequent change having taken place in one or other
of the colours. In the case before us our first tracing was co
loured with the verdigris-green : it was unsatisfactory; but on
making a new tracing and colouring it according to our amended
observations, it at once became harmonious in colour, and as

enable us to convey the idea of ruby-gemmed flowers like the

the general effect.
XII. The Effect of Pressure in Lowering the Freezing-Point
   of Water experimentally demonstrated. By Professor W.
   THOMson, Glasgowº.
ON the 2nd of January 1849, a communication entitled
        “Theoretical Considerations on the Effect of Pressure
in Lowering the Freezing-Point of Water, by James Thomson,
Esq., of Glasgow,” was laid before the Royal Society, and it
has since been published in the Transactions, vol. xvi. part 5+.
In that paper it was demonstrated that, if the fundamental
axiom of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat be
admitted, it follows, as a rigorous consequence, that the tem
perature at which ice melts will be lowered by the application
of pressure ; and the extent of this effect due to a given amount
of pressure was deduced by a reasoning analogous to that of
 Carnot from Regnault's experimental determination of the
latent heat, and the pressure of saturated aqueous vapour at
various temperatures differing very little from the ordinary
freezing-point of water. Reducing to Fahrenheit's scale the
final result of the paper, we find
                             t= n x O'O135;
where t denotes the depression in the temperature of melting
ice produced by the addition of n “atmospheres” (or n times
the pressure due to 29.922 inches of mercury), to the ordinary
pressure experienced from the atmosphere.
    In this very remarkable speculation, an entirely novel phy
sical phaenomenon was predicted in anticipation of any direct
experiments on the subject; and the actual observation of the
phaenomenon was pointed out as a highly interesting object
for experimental research.
   * From the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, February
   t it will appear also, with some slight alterations made by the author,
in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, Nov. 1850.-W. T.

124        Prof. Thomson on the Effect of Pressure in
   To test the phaenomenon by experiment without applying
excessively great pressure, a very sensitive thermometer would
be required, since for ten atmospheres the effect expected is
little more than the tenth part of a Fahrenheit degree; and
the thermometer employed, if founded on the expansion of a
liquid in a glass bulb and tube, must be protected from the
pressure of the liquid, which, if acting on it, would produce a
deformation, or a least a compression of the glass that would
materially affect the indications. For a thermometer of ex
treme sensibility, mercury does not appear to be a convenient
liquid; since, if a very fine tube be employed, there is some
uncertainty in the indications on account of the irregularity
of capillary action, due probably to superficial impurities, and
observable even when the best mercury that can be prepared
is made use of; and again, if a very large bulb be employed,
the weight of the mercury causes a deformation which will
produce a very marked difference in the position of the head
of the column in the tube according to the manner in which
the glass is supported, and may therefore affect with uncer
tainty the indications of the instrument. The former objec
tion does not apply to the use of any fluid which perfectly
wets the glass; and the last-mentioned source of uncertainty
will be much less for any lighter liquid than mercury, of equal
or greater expansibility by heat. Now the coefficient of ex
pansion of sulphuric aether at 0°C. being, according to M. I.
Pierre”, “00151, is eight or nine times that of mercury (which
is 000179, according to Regnault), and its density is about
the twentieth part of the density of mercury. Hence a ther
mometer of much higher sensibility may be constructed with
aether than with mercury, without experiencing inconvenience
from the circumstances which have been alluded to.                      An
aether thermometer was accordingly constructed by Mr.
Robert Mansell of Glasgow, for the experiment which I pro
posed to make. The bulb of this instrument is nearly cylin
drical, and is about 3% inches long and ºths of an inch in
diameter. The tube has a cylindrical bore about 6% inches
long: about 5% inches of the tube are divided into 220 equal
parts. The thermometer is entirely inclosed, and hermeti
cally sealed in a glass tube, which is just large enough to
admit it freely t. On comparing the indications of this instru
   * See Dixon on Heat, p. 72.
   + Following a suggestion made to me by Professor Forbes of Edinburgh,
I have in subsequent experiments with this thermometer, used it with
enough of mercury introduced into the tube in which it is hermetically
sealed to entirely cover its bulb; as I found that, without this, if the ex
periment was conducted in a warm room, the indications of the thermo
meter were frequently deranged by the portion of the water which was left
free from ice becoming slightly elevated in temperature.

             Lowering the Freezing-Point of Water.            125
ment with those of a thermometer of Crichton's with an ivory
scale, which has divisions corresponding to degrees Fahren
heit of about gºth of an inch each, I found that the range of
the aether thermometer is about 3°Fahrenheit; and that there
are about 212 divisions on the tube corresponding to the in
terval of pressure from 31° to 34°, as nearly as I could discover
from such an unsatisfactory standard of reference. This gives
ºr of a degree for the mean value of a division. From a
rough calibration of the tube which was made, I am convinced
that the values of the divisions at no part of the tube differ by
more than ºth of this amount from the true mean value ;
and, taking into account all the sources of uncertainty, I think
it probable that each of the divisions on the tube of the aether
thermometer corresponds to something between tº and ºr of
 a degree Fahrenheit.
    With this thermometer in its glass envelope, and with a
strong glass cylinder (OErsted's apparatus for the compression
of water), an experiment was made in the following manner:—
    The compression vessel was partly filled with pieces of clean
ice and water: a glass tube about a foot long and Poth of an
 inch internal diameter, closed at one end, was inserted with
 its open end downwards, to indicate the fluid pressure by the
 compression of the air which it contained; and the aether
 thermometer was let down and allowed to rest with the lower
 end of its glass envelope pressing on the bottom of the vessel.
 A lead ring was let down so as to keep free from ice the water
 in the compression cylinder round that part of the thermo
 meter tube where readings were expected. More ice was
 added above; so that both above and below the clear space,
 which was only about two inches deep, the compression cy
 linder was full of pieces of ice. Water was then poured in
 by a tube with a stopcock fitted in the neck of the vessel, till
 the vessel was full up to the piston, after which the stopcock
 was shut.
     After it was observed that the column of aether in the ther
  mometer stood at about 67°, with reference to the divisions on
  the tube, a pressure of from 12 to 15 atmospheres was applied,
  by forcing the piston down with the screw. Immediately the
  column of aether descended very rapidly, and in a very few
  minutes it was below 61°. The pressure was then suddenly
  removed, and immediately the column in the thermometer
  began to rise rapidly. Several times pressure was again sud
  denly applied, and again suddenly removed, and the effects
  upon the thermometer were most marked.                       º
     The fact that the freezing-point of water is sensibly lowered
  by a few atmospheres of pressure was thus established beyond

 all doubt. After that I attempted, in a more deliberate ex
 periment, to determine as accurately as my means of observa
 tion allowed me to do, the actual extent to which the tempe
 rature of freezing is affected by determinate applications of
 pressure.
    In the present communication I shall merely mention the
 results obtained, without entering at all upon the details of
 the experiment.
    I found that a pressure of, as nearly as I have been able to
 estimate it, 8-1 atmospheres produced a depression measured
 by 74 divisions of the tube on the column of aether in the
 thermometer; and again, a pressure of 16-8 atmospheres pro
 duced a thermometric depression of 16} divisions. Hence          1
 the observed lowering of temperature was                      #,     or “106°F. in
 the former case, and          #,    or “232°F. in the latter.
    Let us compare these results with theory.                        According to
the conclusions arrived at by my brother in the paper referred
to above, the lowering of the freezing-point of water by 81
atmospheres of pressure would be 8.1 x 0.135, or “109°F.;
and the lowering of the freezing-point by 16-8 atmospheres
would be 16-8 x 0.135, or 227°F.                      Hence we have the fol
lowing highly satisfactory comparison, for the two cases, be
tween the experiment and theory: —

   It was, I confess, with some surprise, that, after having com
pleted the observations under an impression that they pre
sented great discrepancies from the theoretical expectations,
I found the numbers I had noted down indicated in reality an
agreement so remarkably close, that I could not but attribute
it in some degree to chance, when I reflected on the very rude
manner in which the quantitative parts of the experiment
(especially the measurement of the pressure, and the evalua
tion of the division of the aether thermometer) had been con
ducted.
   I hope before long to have a thermometer constructed,
which shall be at least three times as sensitive as the aether
thermometer I have used hitherto; and I expect with it to be

pressure by less than an atmosphere, in lowering or elevating
the freezing-point of water.
   If a convenient minimum thermometer could be constructed,
the effects of very great pressures might easily be tested by
hermetically sealing the thermometer in a strong glass, or in
a metal tube, and putting it into a mixture of ice and water,
in a strong metal vessel, in which an enormous pressure might
be produced by the forcing-pump of a Bramah's press.

which pointed out the remarkable effect of pressure on the
freezing-point of water, now established by experiment, indi
cates that a corresponding effect may be expected for all
liquids which expand in freezing; that a reverse effect, or an
elevation of the freezing-point by an increase of pressure, may
be expected for all liquids which contract in freezing; and
that the extent of the effect to be expected may in every case
be deduced from Regnault's observations on vapour (pro
vided that the freezing-point is within the temperature-limits
of his observations), if the latent heat of a cubic foot of the
liquid, and the alteration of its volume in freezing be known.

                    By J. P. Joule, F.R.S.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
     N the 16th inst., after a very sultry morning, this town
       was, in common with a large tract of country, visited at
4 o'clock by a thunder-storm accompanied with heavy rain.
In the evening of the same day, about 9 o'clock, we had an op
portunity of witnessing a most magnificent display of electrical
discharges, which continued almost uninterruptedly for the
space of one hour, accompanied, however, by only a few drops
of rain. I had never before seen lightning of such an extra
ordinary character. Each discharge appeared to emanate
from a mass of clouds in the south-west, and travelled six or
ten miles in the direction of the spectator, dividing into half a
dozen or more sparks, or zigzag streams of light, in some in
stances the termination of each of these sparks being, as re
presented in the adjoining sketch, again subdivided into a
number of smaller sparks. I did not observe any of the dis
charges to strike the ground; and from the interval of time
between the appearance of those which crossed the zenith and

128 Mr. J. P. Joule on a remarkable appearance of Lightning.
the thunder, I consider that their general elevation from the
surface of the earth must have been at least 3% miles.
    The diverging form arose no doubt from the extensive ne
gative surfacepresented by the clouds,
and may be imitated on a small scale \
by filling a glass jar with water and
using it as a Leyden phial. If such
a jar be discharged by bringing one
ball of the discharging rod towards
the exterior glass surface, the other
ball being in connexion with the
water, the spark will, in restoring the
electrical equilibrium, diverge over
the whole glass surface.
  . Another remarkable feature in the
lightning was the sensible time of
its travelling towards the spectator. The main streams of
light were always formed before the diverging sparks; and
when formed, remained steady for an appreciable time, until
the whole disappeared together. My brothers, Messrs. Ben
jamin and John Joule, who observed the lightning two miles
westward of my station, formed exactly the same impression
of its character; and in addition, the latter and several other
parties were witnesses of a phaenomenon, which, if owing to
the electrical state of the atmosphere, was, I believe, without
a recorded precedent.
    At half-past 8 o'clock a bright red light appeared among
the clouds, bearing nearly due south, and having an elevation
of about 30° above the horizon. It appeared as if the sun
 were behind a cloud illuminating its edges strongly, and
 throwing a brilliant light upon the neighbouring clouds. . It
lasted about five minutes with perfect steadiness, and then
gradually disappeared.
     I ought to mention, that, during the above-described phae
 nomena, violent thunder-storms were taking place in different
 parts of this county and in Cheshire, but without any apparent
connexion with them.
          I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen,
                                   Yours very respectfully,

XIV. Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
   June 30, 1850. By JAMES GLAISHER, Esq., F.R.S., Hon.
   Sec. of the British Meteorological Society, &c.*
TH E weather during the past quarter has been variable,
        and at times very unusual. The temperature of the
air till April 21 was 4°3 above the average, and this period
was free from frosts. From April 22 to May 16, there was
an average deficiency of 5°of daily temperature; from May 17
to June 9, the temperature was about its average value; it was
8° in excess on June 11, and 13° in defect on the 15th; and
during the following night the temperature of the air in many
places was below 32°, a very unusual circumstance for the
season. From June 18 to the 26th, the period was warm; the
mean excess of temperature was 6°. Snow has fallen on
several days during the past quarter.
    The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich for the three
months ending May, constituting the three spring months, was
46°-6, being of almost the same value as that of the average
from the seventy-nine preceding springs.
   For the month of April was 48°5, exceeding that of the ave
rage of the preceding seventy-nine years by 2°8, and exceeding
that of the preceding nine years by 1°0.
    For the month of May was 51°3, being 1°3 less than the
average of the preceding seventy-nine years, and 3°l less than
that of the preceding nine years.
   For the month of June was 60°8, exceeding that of the
average of the preceding seventy-nine years by 2°8, and ea
ceeding that of the preceding nine years by 1%-2.
   The mean for the quarter was 53°4, exceeding that of the
average of seventy-nine years by 1°4, and being less than that
of the preceding nine years by 0°3.
    The mean temperature of evaporation at Greenwich—
   For the month of April was 45°4; for May was 47°5;
and for June was 54°8. These values are 1*7 greater, 3°0
less, and 0° 1 greater than those of the averages of the same
months in the preceding nine years.
    The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich—
   For the months of April, May and June, were 41°7, 43°4,
and 50°1 respectively. These values are 1°0 greater, 4°0
less, and 19.8 less respectively than the averages of the same
months in the preceding nine years.
    The mean elastic force of vapour at Greenwich for the quarter
was 0.318 inch, being less than the average from the preceding
nine years by 0.031 inch.

130       Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
   The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the
quarter was 3:6 grains. The average from the preceding
nine years was 3.8 grains.
   The mean degree of humidity in April was 0.795, in May
was 0.765, and in June was 0.702. The averages from the
nine preceding years were 0.808, 0-788 and 0.702 respectively.
   The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich in April
was 29'594 inches, in May was 29:714, and in June was 29-886.
These readings are 0 1 14 less, 0:07.1 less, and 0.089 greater
respectively than the averages of the same months in the pre
ceding nine years.
   The average weight of a cubic foot of air for the quarter,
under the average temperature, humidity and pressure, was
532 grains; being of the same value as that of the average of
the preceding nine years.
   The rain fallen at Greenwich in April was 2.4 inches, in
May was 2.3, and in June was 1-0. The falls for these three
months on an average of thirty-four years, are 17, 2-0 and 1.7
inches respectively.
   The average daily ranges of the readings of the thermometer
in air at the height of four feet above the soil, in April was
16°0, in May was 18°-9, and in June was 26°0. The ave
rages for these three months from the preceding nine years
were 17°4, 18°9 and 19°4 respectively.
   The minimum readings of the thermometer on grass in April
was at or below 32° on twelve nights; the lowest was 23°;
was between 32° and 40° on fourteen nights, and exceeded
40° on four nights; the highest reading was 44°. In May
the readings were at and below 32° on thirteen nights; the
lowest was 15°; they were between 32° and 40° on eleven
nights; and on seven nights the readings exceeded 40°. In
June the readings were at or below 32° on two nights; the
lowest was 29°; they were between 32° and 40° on six nights,
and they exceeded 40° on twenty-two nights. At Cardington,
as observed by S. C. Whitbread, Esq., the reading of the
thermometer on grass in April was twelve nights, in May
was twelve nights, and in June was three nights below 32°.
   The temperature of the water of the Thames, from the ob
servations of Lieut. Sanders, R.N., Superintendent of the
Dreadnought Hospital Ship, was 48°4 in April, 54°3 in May,
and 63°7 in June.
   Fog was prevalent on April 6 at Dundee and Whitby ; on
the 12th at Rugby and Whitby ; on the 13th at Folkestone
and Whitby ; on the 16th at Whitby and Dundee; and on
the 20th at Edinburgh, Berwick and Whitby. On May 8 at

   Of these storms that of the 26th of June was the worst.  It
was described by J. Johnson, Esq., of Oxford Observatory, as
the most violent storm of thunder and lightning ever remem
bered there. It began about 2h 30m P.M., and lasted till about
4' 30" P.M. Two college towers were struck by lightning.
No life was lost; but he had heard of five persons (three
children) who were thrown down by the violence of the light
ning. There appears to have been two storms, one succeed
ing the other after an interval of about thirty minutes. I
was not here myself, but the storm has been described to me
by two trustworthy persons as terrific. As far as I can make
out, the storm passed over the town in a N.N.E. direction.
   At Hartwell Rectory, the Rev. C. Lowndes states, “that on

134        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
the 26th thunder was heard at 1" 30m P.M., and at 3 P.M.
there was a heavy storm with thunder and lightning: it con
tinued stormy during the evening and night.”
    At Hartwell House, Mr. Horton says, “that on June 26 a
mansion near Thame, called Thame House, about ten miles
from here, was set on fire by the lightning.”
    At Truro, Dr. C. Barham says, “the thunder-storm on
June 26 was rather severe, but more so a few miles to the
northward. Eleven sheep were killed by the lightning in one
field, and four in a neighbouring one about ten miles to the
north-east. The rain was not very heavy, and there was no
hail: there was a fall of 16° of temperature between 1" and 5*
P.M., and the weather has continued unsettled with showers
and squally from that time to the present, July 3.”
    At Exeter, Dr. Shapter remarks, “that for three days pre
viously to June 26 the atmosphere had gradually become hot
and sultry, and at 4 P.M. on this day it became extremely op
pressive. Distant thunder was then heard, and heavy rain
clouds came up with a light wind from the south. At 6 P.M.
 the storm reached Exeter; the lightning was constant and
 vivid, and heavy rain fell for two hours, when the storm mo
 derated and passed on, and the wind shifted rather suddenly
till 6 P.M. It reached Bridgewater at about 9 P.M. The elec
tric telegraph on the South Devon Railway was rendered
useless for several hours; the trains were consequently de
layed, and considerable inconvenience was occasioned. The
general character of the other parts of the month was fine and
warm. Rain to the depth of 1:21 inch fell during the storm.”
    At Uckfield, C. L. Prince, Esq. says, “that on the 26th, at
might, the electric fluid struck a house in this place and shat
tered a portion of the roof, burnt some clothes, &c., and in
jured no one, although there were thirty persons under the
roof at the time.”
   At Southampton rain to the depth of 1.96 inch fell during
the passage of the storm.

          Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather.          139
   The mean monthly values of the several subjects of investi
gation during the past quarter are published in the Quarterly
Report of the Registrar-General. Their quarterly values are
shown in the following table:—
   The mean of the numbers in the first column is 29.561
inches, and it represents that portion of the reading of the
barometer due to the pressure of air; the remaining portion,
or that due to the pressure of water, is 0.322 inch; the sum
of those two numbers is 29.883 inches, and it represents the
mean reading of the barometer for the quarter ending June 30,
1850.
   The mean of the numbers in the second column for Guern
sey, and those places situated in the counties of Cornwall and
Devonshire, is 53°5; at Liverpool and Whitehaven is 51°6;
for those places situated south of latitude of 52° is 53°; for
those places situated between the latitudes of 52° and 53° is
52°; between latitudes 53° and 54° is 51°-0; and for Durham,
North Shields and Newcastle is 49°-3.       The fall of rain was
greatest in Cornwall and Devonshire, averaging 8-3 inches;
and it was the least between the latitudes of 52° and 53°, ave
raging 4°8 inches.
   The highest reading of the thermometer in air was 87° at
Uckfield and Nottingham; and the lowest readings were 25°
at Uckfield and 26° at Wakefield. The extreme range of
temperature during the quarter in England was therefore
about 60°.
   The least daily ranges of temperature took place at Guernsey,
Liverpool and North Shields; their mean value was 10°4:
and the greatest occurred at Uckfield, Aylesbury and Hart
well; their mean value was 21°3.
   The least monthly ranges of temperature occurred at Guern
sey, Torquay and Liverpool; their mean value was 25°1.
The greatest took place at Uckfield, Aylesbury and Notting
ham, and their mean value was 45°8.
   Rain fell on the least number of days at Helston, Holkham,
Norwich and Newcastle; the average number at these places
was 33. It fell on the greatest number of days at North
Shields, Wakefield and Derby. The average number at these
places was 56. The places at which the largest falls took place
were Southampton, Stonyhurst and Exeter ; and the average
amount at these places was 9°5 inches. The smallest falls
occurred at Hartwell, Holkham and Liverpool; and their
average was 4 inches.                        -

   General remarks and agricultural reports.-At Exeter April
was an unusually wet month, the amount of rain being more
than double the average for April here. The mean tempera
ture however was about 3° above the average.
   The general character of May, as compared with those of
former years, was rather cold and wet. The amount of rain
was about ; an inch above, and the temperature was about 2°
below the average.
   The mean temperature and the total amount of rain during
June corresponded very nearly with the average of the pre
ceding twenty years.

 142        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks   on the Weather
     Aylesbury. J. Dell, Esq., F.R.A.S.
     From the small quantity of rain that has fallen during the
 last six months, much inconvenience is beginning to be felt
 from the short supply of water. The large reservoir, which
 usually contains a sufficient quantity of water to supply the
 county jail during the summer months, has now only 5 feet
 in depth, although the usual allowance has been considerably
 reduced.
    Agricultural report for the quarter ending June 30, 1850:--
     Uckfield. From C. L. Prince, Esq.
    During the first three weeks the weather was for the most
 part stormy, with a considerable fall of rain; but the tempe
 rature was more equable than is usual at this season of the
year, there being a total absence of frost during this period.
 March having been unusually dry and favourable for agri
 cultural labour, the heavy rains of April have been very
 beneficial to the grain crops. There were slight frosts on
several mornings during the last week, but not severe enough
 materially to injure the progress of vegetation. After the
 first week in May the weather was seasonable; the warm
growing showers which fell at intervals hastened vegetation
considerably, and proved very beneficial to all the crops
situated on the dry soils in this neighbourhood. A severe
frost occurred on the 3rd of May, which in many situations
almost entirely destroyed the forward blossom of the cherry,
pear, plum, gooseberry, &c. Ice was observed an eighth of
an inch in thickness, and the reading of a self-registering
thermometer placed on grass was 2.1°. The temperature
during the first three weeks of June was very variable, and
the thermometer in the shade ranged from 32° to 84°; the
extreme range of the month however was 70°, viz. 30° in the
morning of the 16th, and 100° in the sun on the 26th. The
low temperature just noticed is very unusual for the season;
and had not the fruit been protected by the foliage, it must
have been very much injured. Ice was observed early in the
morning, and there was a hoar-frost on good radiating sur
faces.
    Stone. The Rev. J. B. Reade, F.R.S., says, “The effect
of the frost on June 16 on the clay land in the Vale of Ayles
bury was severely felt. The potatoes were greatly injured,
and in some places the kidney beans were completely de
stroyed.”
    Hartwell House. Dr. Lee says, “that on June 16 the po
tatoe tops were much frozen.”
    Hartwell Rectory. The Rev. C. Lowndes, F.R.A.S.
    On the night of June 15 the frost was so severe as to damage
the potatoe crops very severely on the low grounds.

          during the Quarter ending June 30, 1850.           143
   Nottingham. E. G. Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S.
   The following are the present appearances of the crops in
this neighbourhood:—Wheat fully an average, and looks very
promising.
   Oats and barley will be a poor crop on hot sandy land, and
very short in the straw. On cold clay lands it is likely to
be good. On the whole they will be both below an average,
as the dry hot weather in June, which was very favourable to
wheat, was quite the reverse to oats and barley.
   The hay crop will be much below an average. Much has
been cut, but the recent rain has prevented half of this from
being as yet housed.
   Beans and peas are but little grown about here; but where
they can grow, they are spoken favourably of
   Turnips and mangelwurzel are good in some localities and
bad in others.
    Clover has not been an average.
   Amongst fruit, currants and gooseberries are exceedingly
 abundant, especially the latter; and there are plenty of straw
berries. Apples, pears and plums will be very deficient,
although in some places the latter are abundant. Apricots,
 peaches and nectarines are very deficient, though the former
 has turned out the best crop of the three.
    Hawarden near Chester.      From Dr. Moffatt.
    From early in March to the beginning of June, oats, barley,
 potatoes, turnips, &c. were put into the ground in their season;
 the seed time was a very favourable one, and the land was in
 good condition for its cultivation. From the extreme cold
 which prevailed at the end of March and beginning of April,
 and the want of rain from the middle of April to the second
 week in May, grass was scanty, and cattle were not turned
 out so early as usual; but the rains of the end of May and
 beginning of June were just in time to retrieve the coming
 crop from its wavering condition.
    Potatoes have been planted to a greater extent in this than
 in former years; and if we may judge of their condition from
 the appearance of the stalk, &c., they are healthy. There
 are rumours however of “the disease.” I find that everybody
 has heard of a reappearance of the disease, but it has not been
 seen by any one in this immediate locality.
    Turnips look well, and I have not heard of the usual com
 plaints of “fly” and “worin.” Disease has been very com
 mon among cattle since the end of last March, and many
 farmers have had serious losses; indeed, one informed me,
 the other day, that since the 16th of that month he had lost
 ten cows from disease of the lungs.

   144,      Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather.
      From the first week in May to the second week in June an
  epidemic affection of the throat prevailed among horses. It
  consisted chiefly of swelling of the throat, with slight fever,
  which continued for a few days, and terminated with profuse
  discharge of thick mucus through the nose. I am not aware
  of its having been fatal in any case. I may surn up and con
  clude by saying, that we have had a very favourable “seed
  time,” that the land generally speaking has been well pre
  pared, and the weather favourable for cultivation; that the
  crops look healthy, and that there is every prospect of an
  early and an abundant harvest.                     -

     The cold east winds in April kept the grass back to such
  a degree, and caused so great a deficiency in the pastures, as
  to give but a very poor prospect of a good hay harvest, and
  induced many farmers to sow a greater amount of grain crops
  than usual. Last year's hay is not to be had in the country.
  The wet weather which prevailed during the early part of
  April caused a great delay in the planting of grain crops.
  Oats were first seen about April 10; clover about April 23,
 but was not all sown till May 1.        Potatoes were not got in
 till May 2.    All these different crops are now looking ex
 ceedingly well. The crop of beans has been unusually good
 all over the country. Turnips have been a good deal in
 fected with the fly; so much, so that some farmers had to sow
 a second time. Sheep were washed about May 31, shorn on
 June 10. The late rains have brought forward the grass
crops with extraordinary rapidity; they are now heavy, and
farmers are waiting only for fine weather to mow. Clover
has been housed, but was light. With this exception, a little
rye-grass, nothing has yet been cut.

    The quarter now passed has been generally very cold and
dry, and dry soils show in many places a want of rain; pas
tures are bare, and meadows are generally light. The season
is late, both wheat and barley shooting about ten days later
than in an average season.
    Potatoes are planted very largely, full one-third more than
usual.    I have seen a few instances of the disease, but it is
very rare; this however is rather early to pronounce the
danger passed for the season. Of turnips a small breadth
only has been sown this year, partly from the great breadth
of potatoes, and partly from many farmers finding their sheep
stock at the present prices (4d. per lb.) are unprofitable. Bar

  ley is very much varied; on good land in good cultivation the
  crop is good, but on dry soils it is light and thin.           A very
  small breadth of barley is sown this season.           Wheat is very
  varied, the crop being from very bad to good according to the
  soils and management, the dry season having seriously affected
  the dry soils.
     An unusually great breadth of spring wheat has been sown,
  displacing, as above stated, a portion of the barley crop.
     Stock has generally done well where healthy, but Pneu

 generally among Irish cattle. Potatoes, from the dry cold
  weather, are later than usual.

          The Course of Creation.   By JoHN ANDERson, D.D.
                      London : Longman and Co.
  WE       have been much gratified by the perusal of this work, not
          because at the present day physical science, and more espe
 cially the most poetical of all the branches of it, Geology, requires
 any defence from the reproach of being hostile to religion, but
 because the plain and simple yet forcible and eloquent manner in
 which the records graven upon the stone book of nature are set forth,
 have invested this production with unusual interest; and the more
 so, as emanating from the pen of a divine fully imbued with the im
 portant bearings which exist between natural science and revealed
 truth. “The Course of Creation” is no philosophic theory—involves
 no metaphysical inquiry into the origin of things—nor affords any
 new facts connected with the science itself; but is simply intended
 to express the feelings engendered in the mind of the author by geo
 logical pursuits; and thus it aims to impress others with a desire to
 become acquainted with the works of the Creator and the records of
 His will.
    The subject-matter of the volume consists of the various geological
 phaenomena to be met with in the line of country occurring between
 the Grampians and the Alps; and the relations of the several geolo
 gical formations to each other are treated of in geographical sequence.
    Thus we have the general structure of Scotland first mentioned,
 with its series of crystalline, trap and palaeozoic rocks, including
 descriptions of the more important animal and vegetable remains
 found in the latter; to this succeeds the geological structure of
 England with its peculiar and interesting features, from the Silurian
 to the close of the tertiary period; the concluding geological portion
 is devoted to France and Switzerland, in which we find a concise
 account of the tertiary basin of Paris and the Loire, the volcanic
 district of Auvergne, and the structure of the Alps, &c.
    The descriptions are embodied not only from personal observation,
 but enriched by an extensive acquaintance with, and careful exami
 nation of, the most recent geological works.          -
    We only notice one misstatement of any importance which appears

 to have escaped the author's attention: in speaking of the Swiss
 Alps, at p. 295 it is stated, that “the Oxfordian group are repre
 sented by the ‘Neocomian limestones, a series of strata abounding
 in fossils of the gault and upper greensand.” According to Sir R.
 Murchison, Von Buch, and other geologists, the occurrence of the
 Oxfordian group with its characteristic shells is distinctly traced in
 the French and Swiss Alps, and forms the base of all the outer edges
 of the Savoy Alps, overlaid by the Neocomian limestones, which are
 again surmounted in the Savoy Alps by a dark-coloured limestone,
 which, from its contained fossils, fairly represents the gault and
 upper greensand.
    The concluding part of the work is devoted to general principles,
 in which we find the theories of organic life discussed, especially as
 bearing on the development hypothesis,—the causes of extinction
 of the various forms of animated life which have successively tenanted
 our globe, the analogical order of moral and physical progression,
 —as well as a chapter on the Mosaic account of creation as recon
 cilable with geological discoveries; want of space prevents us from
 extracting the many valuable and eloquent passages contained in
 this portion, involving points of the highest interest.
    To those who have not hitherto investigated the varied and mul
 tiform changes, both organic and inorganic, to which the superficial
 crust of our globe has been subjected, or have regarded geology as
 an unprofitable and uninviting study, and to the geologist himself
 occupied merely with the laborious task of collecting the dry statical
 details connected with his science, we cordially recommend the per
 usal of this volume, as unfolding in the plainest manner the beauty,
harmony and beneficence of Creative power that has reigned through
 out all past time, and by which the present surface of our earth has
 been elaborated, modified, and adapted to the wants of an intellectual
 and moral being, pointing out to us at the same time, that as an
 inquiry “into the records of Creation, geology has disclosed views,
 and elicited discoveries, of the works of the Divine Architect of the
 world which the religious inquirer will as cordially embrace, as ig
 norance can overlook or misapprehend.”

  1850.          and in particular of the Copula, and the application
of the Theory of Probabilities to some questions of evidence.       By
Professor De Morgan.                                         -
   This paper, which is in continuation of the one published in
vol. viii. part 3 (read Nov. 9, 1846), and of subsequent additions
contained in the author's work on Formal Logic, is divided into six
sections.
   Section I. On the approa'imation of logical and algebraical modes
of thought.—The subjects of this section are, 1st, some development
of the idea that the oppositions of logic have affinities which may

one day lead to a connected theory, making use of a common instru
ment, just as the oppositions of quantity which are considered in
algebra are connected by the general theory of the signs + and —;
and 2nd, some remarks on the resemblance of the instrumental part
of inference to algebraic elimination.
   Ten such instances as affirmative and negative, conclusive and
inconclusive, &c., are compared with the logical distinction of uni
versal and particular; and it is pointed out, in all the cases in which
it is not already acknowledged, that it would be possible to use any
one of the ten in place of the last.
   Section II. On the formation of symbolic notation for propositions
and syllogisms.-Exclusive of remarks on the Aristotelian notation
and on notation in general, and a statement for comparison of Sir
William Hamilton's notation, this section contains the following
matters.
   1. A pictorial or diagrammatic representation of syllogistic infer
ences, being after the method pursued by Lambert, with such addi
tions as will enable the system to represent all the cases in which
contraries are used.
   2. An abbreviated and arbitrary method of representing proposi
tions and syllogisms.
   Following Sir William Hamilton in making the quantity of both
subject and predicate matter of symbolic expression, Mr. De Morgan
gives his system of notation two new features. First, he dispenses
with the representatives of the terms (except when it may be con
venient to introduce them for the time), and represents the proposi
tion by the symbols of quantity only, and the presence or absence of
a sign of negation. Secondly, instead of making the symbols of uni
versal and particular absolute, he gives one symbol, ), to a universal
subject and a particular predicate, and another, (, to a particular
subject and a universal predicate : a dot [...] signifying negation.
Thus X):(Y, or simply ) (, represents “No X is Y’: X("(Y, or (-(,
represents “Some Xs are not any Ys : X()Y represents “Some Xs
are Ys.”    Of the second circumstance above mentioned, Mr. De
 Morgan believes that it makes the rules easier, and knows that it
 makes the notation more suggestive.
    Retaining in mind the order XY, YZ, XZ, which is the only figure
used in the classification (being the first with inverted order of pre
 mises), the syllogism is to be denoted by the junction of the propo
 sitional symbols. Thus ))))=)) denotes ‘Every X is Y, every Y is
 Z, therefore every X is Z.’   When this is to be read in any figure,
 the subject-quantities are to have their symbols thickened, the second
 premise being read first: thus in the four figures, in order, will be
 seen such symbols as ||, || ||, ||.
    Section III. On the symbolic forms of the extension of the Aristo
 telian system in which contraries are introduced.—This system is the
 one which was completed and published to the Society before any
 correspondence with Sir William Hamilton. Mr. De Morgan re
 marks that it contains (incidentally, not designedly) every distribu
 tion of quantifications; and gives his reasons for not dwelling on this
 fact while the controversy was unfinished, with his statement that it
 had not struck him when the controversy began. Mr. De Morgan

148                 Cambridge Philosophical Society.
frequently distinguishes this system from Sir W. Hamilton's by calling
the former that of introduction of contraries, the latter that of inven
tion of predicates. For distinctness, it may be stated that Mr. De
Morgan's other, or numerically definite system (the one concerned in
the discussion), does not appear in the present paper, except as matter
of allusion.
    The forms of predication in this system are as follows, with refer
ence to the order XY, a and y being not X and not Y.
                                Universals.

    Negative     O X()y or X( (Y Some Xs are not Ys

    Various rules of connexion are given, being all translations of
 those in the work on Formal Logic, except a classification of the par
 ticulars by probability, answering to that of universals. Thus of
 X))Y and X()Y, each makes the other impossible: of their con
 traries X(-(Y and X)(Y, each, so far as it affects the other, reduces
 its probability.
     It appears that a quantified term has a quantified contrary: that
 of ‘Every X’ is ‘some as,’ &c.
    The symbolic canon of validity is:—if both middle parentheses
turn the same way, there need be one universal proposition; if dif
 ferent ways, two. Thus ))) ( and (.)) (both have inferences; and
 so has )-()); but ) ()( has none. The symbolic canon of inference
 is;--erase all signs of the middle term, and what is left (two nega
 tions, if there, counting as an affirmation) shows the inference. Thus
 from X()Y)-(Z we infer X(“(Z or X((Z: more simply, from ()) (
 we infer ((.
     Section IV. On the symbolic forms of the system in which all the
 combinations of quantity are introduced by arbitrary invention of forms
 of predication (Sir W. Hamilton's).
    The modes of predication peculiar to this system have the same
  symbols, )(and ('), as the peculiar propositions of the system of
  contraries; but with very different significations, as follows:—
              Contraries.                     Invention of predicates.

    All things are either Xs or Ys.        Some Xs are not some Ys.
     )( Particular affirmative with        )( Universal affirmative with
  universal terms, and negative form    universal terms, being declaration
  in common language.                   of identity in common language.
    Some thingsareneither Xsnor Ys.        All Xs are all Ys.

                     Cambridge Philosophical Society.                      149
     Mr. De Morgan argues that Sir William Hamilton's system cannot
 be called an extension of that of Aristotle, in the sense in which that
 word is used.
     The forms of predication are as follows:–
     A1+A)( All Xs are all Ys                E, ) (No Xs are Ys
     I,       () Some Xsare some Ys          — (*) Some Xsare not some Ys
     Al      )) All Xs are some Ys           O ).) No Xs are some Ys
    Al       (( Some Xs are all Ys           O ( (Some Xs are no Ys.
     Previously to entering upon the forms of syllogism, Mr. De Morgan
 repeats and reinforces the objections brought forward in his Formal
 Logic; namely, that )( is a compound of )) and ((, and has no sim
 ple contradiction in the system; and that (...) not only has no simple
 contradiction, but cannot be contradicted except when the terms are
 singular and identical. He then proceeds to propose one mode of
 remedying these defects. Calling the ordinary proposition cumular,
 he proposes to make it eremplar, as asserting or denying of one in
 stance only. In the universal proposition, the example is wholly in
 definite, any one; in the particular proposition it is not wholly indefinite,
 some one. The defects of contradiction are thus entirely removed, as
 in the following list, in which each universal proposition is followed
 by its contradiction.
 )( Any one X is any” one Y              (( Some one X is any one Y
 (*) Some one X is not some one Y ).) Any one X is not some one Y
 )) Any one X is some one Y              ). (Any one X is not any one Y
 (‘(Some one X is not any one Y () Some one X is some one Y
    In both systems there are thirty-six valid syllogisms, and in both
 the canon of validity is, one universal (or wholly indefinite) middle
 term, and one affirmative proposition. But the symbolic canons of
inference differ as follows (with reference to the order XY, YZ, XZ).

the erased parentheses turn the same way, turn any universal paren
thesis which turns the other way, unless it be protected by a mark
of negation. Thus )-(() gives).), ())(gives (), and ()) ( gives ( (.
    Section V. On the theory of the copula, and its connea-ion with
the doctrine of figure.—In his work on Formal Logic, Mr. De Morgan
had analysed the copula, and abstracted what he calls the copular
conditions of the relation connecting subject and predicate. These
are, transitiveness, seen in such copulae as support, govern, is greater
than, &c., ev. gr. if A govern B, and B govern C, A governs C: and
convertibility, seen in such copulae as is acquainted with, agrees with, &c.;
ear. gr. if A agree with B, B agrees with A. Mr. De Morgan's position
is, that any mode of relation which satisfies both these conditions has
as much claim to be the copula as the usual one, is, which derives its
fitness entirely from satisfying the above conditions. So far the
work cited. In the present paper the correlative copula is introduced,
as is supported in opposition to supports, &c., and every system of
syllogism is thus extended. If a copula be taken which is only trans
       * So that there can be but one X and one Y, and that X is Y.

150                Cambridge Philosophical Society.
itive, but not convertible, every syllogism remains valid, provided
that the correlative of that copula be used instead of it, when needful.
And in this consists, according to Mr. De Morgan, the root of the
doctrine of figure. If + represent affirmative, and — negative, the
four figures are connected with + +, + —, - +, and — — (in the
 system of contraries, where negative premises may have a valid con
clusion, the fourth figure has equal claims with the rest, though the
conditions of all the figures are singularly altered). These forms
 do not require the correlative copula: thus + — in the second figure
 (as Camestres and Baroko among the Aristotelian forms) are as valid
when the copula is ‘supports’ or ‘is greater than,' as when ‘is’ is
 employed. But in every other case the rule for the proper intro
 duction of the correlative copula is as follows:—The preceding being
called the primitive forms of the four figures, when one premise of a
primitive form is altered, the necessity of a correlative copula is
thrown upon the other; when both, upon the conclusion. Thus, the
primitive form of the second figure being + —, and Cesare showing
 — +, it is only valid with the copula ‘governs,’ by making “is not
governed by the copula of the conclusion, as follows:–
        º              No Z governs any Y
                       Every X governs a Y
                       Therefore no X is governed by any Z.
    By an additional letter (g) introduced into the usual words of
syllogism, the places of the correlative copula may be remembered,
as in Barbara, Celagrent, &c. : a g being made to accompany any
 member of the syllogism in which the correlative copula must be
 employed.                         -
    This theory is applied equally to the Aristotelian system, to Sir
William Hamilton's (though not of universal application in the cu
mular form), and to Mr. De Morgan's system of contraries. The
 extensions required by the use of a merely transitive copula, in the
last-mentioned system, are discussed; and mention is made of the
 tricopular system, in which the leading copula and its correlative
 have an intermediate or middle relation, equally connected with
 both ; as in > = and < of the mathematicians.
    The next step is the assertion that it is not necessary that any
 two of the three copulae of a syllogism should be the same ; all that
 is requisite is that, in affirmative syllogisms, the copular relation in
 the conclusion should be compounded of those in the premises. The
 instrumental part of inference is described by Mr. De Morgan as the
 elimination of a term by composition (including resolution) of relations,
 which leads to the conclusion that whenever a negative premise occurs,
 there is a resolution of a compound relation. This resolution is shown
 in a case (among others) of the ordinary copula, in which, however,
 it would hardly strike the mind more forcibly than would the pro
 perties of powers in algebra if every letter represented unity. Mr.
 De Morgan shows (in an addition) that in some isolated cases of in
 ference which are not reducible to ordinary syllogism, logicians have
 had recourse to what amounts to composition of relations.
    Mr. De Morgan next points out that the copular relation, in
 affirmative propositions, need not be restricted as applying to one

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                     151
instance only of the predicate; and shows that the removal of this
usual restriction entirely removes all his objections to Sir William
Hamilton's form of his own system.
    Section VI. On the application of the theory of probabilities to some
questions of evidence.—This inquiry was suggested by the apparent
(but only apparent) error of the logicians, who seem to lean towards
the maxim that, when the subject and predicate are unknown, the
universal and particular propositions ‘Every X is Y,’ “Some Xs are
not Ys,’ are a priori of equal probability. The difficulty is one which
occurs in the following case:—If a good witness, drawing a card
from a pack, were to announce the seven of spades, his credit would
not be lowered, though he would have asserted an event against which
it was 51 to 1 a priori. A common person gives the true answer,
 ‘Why not the seven of spades as well as any other ?’ Many readers
 of works on probability would be inclined to say ‘That is not the
 question; why the seven of spades rather than some one or another
 of the fifty-one others ?’  The retort is fallacious: it rubs out the
 distinctive marks from the other fifty-one cards, and writes on each
 of them ‘not the seven of spades” as its only exponent.            Laplace
has chosen two problems, in one of which the distinctive marks
 exist, and not in the other; and, neglecting the consideration of the
first one, has founded his remarks upon the deterioration of evidence
by the assertion of an improbable event, entirely upon the second.
The object of this section is, by a closer examination of the mathe
matical problem of evidence, to ascertain the accordance or non
accordance of the results of usual data with usual notions.            The
 result of the examination is, that common notions, as in other cases,
 are found closely accordant with theory. For instance, if there be
 n possible things which can happen, so that the mean probability of
           .. 1      -                                  -      -
an event is +,70
                 a witness of whom we know no particular bias towards
one mode of error rather than another, asserting an event of which
the a priori probability is a, has his previous credit raised, unaltered,
                     -           1 .      - - -      -            •
or lowered, according as a- +   70
                                   is positive, nothing, or negative. So
that though the a priori probabilities were distributed among a mil
lion of possible and distinguishable cases, yet a witness asserting one
of them against which it is only 999,999 to 1, would have as good
a right to be believed as though there had been but two equally pro
bable cases, of which he had asserted one.
   March 11.-Curvature of Imperfectly Elastic Beams.              By Ho
mersham Cox, B.A. Jesus College.
   The equation to the curve of an elastic deflected beam is usually
deduced from the assumption,-1, that the longitudinal compression
or extension of an elastic filament is proportional to the compressing
or extending force; 2, that for equal extension and compression the
compressing and extending forces are equal to each other.
   These hypotheses are not quite correct in practice. All substances
appear to be subject to a defect of elasticity, i. e. their elastic forces
of restitution increase in a somewhat less degree than in proportion
to the extension or compression.       If the forces be taken as functions

152                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.
of the latter quantities expressed by a converging series of their
ascending integral powers, the terms after the third may in general be
neglected as of inconsiderable magnitude. If then e be the exten
sion of a uniform rod of a unit of length and a unit of sectional area,
the longitudinal force producing that extension is
                              ae+ 3e3+6'e?,
where cº, 3, 3' are empirical constants.
   Similarly, if c be the compression of a similar rod, the force pro
ducing that compression is
                 -             'yc+3c2+3'cº,
where y, 3, 3’ are three other empirical constants.
   These formulae are to be applied to a uniform beam of rectangular
section, resting on horizontal supports and slightly deflected at its
centre. For this purpose, the compression and extension of every
filament of the beam are expressed in terms of the radius of curva
ture and the distance from the neutral axis. Analytical expressions
are thus obtained for the elastic forces developed in any transverse
section of the beam; and the position of the neutral axis is obtained
from the integrals of these expressions by the principle, that the sum
of all the horizontal forces above is equal to the sum of all the hori
zontal forces below the neutral axis.
   Next, the sums of the moments of the elastic forces about the neu
tral axis are obtained; and the sums are equated to the moment
about that axis of the pressure (P) of the fulcrum, the latter moment
being the product of half the deflecting weight by the distances (a)
of the fulcrum from the point of the neutral axis here considered.
This equation involves the radius of curvature, and is solved with
respect to the reciprocal of that quantity. It is to be observed, that
this equation, and also the preceding one determining the neutral
axis, are not of such a form as to admit of direct solution, and are
therefore solved by an ordinary method of approximation.
   The reciprocal of the radius of curvature of a point (w, y) of a
curve is equal to (the second differential of y with respect to a Y--
(a quantity which becomes equal to unity when, as here, the incli
nation to the axis of a of the tangent at any point of the curve is
comparatively very small).
   Making the substitution indicated, and integrating twice the equa
tion last obtained, we obtained finally for the equation to the neutral
line of a rectangular beam of vertical depth d, and horizontal breadth

CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF A MINERAL CONTAINING OXIDE
    OF URANIUM, FROM THE NORTH SHORE OF LAKE SUPERIOR.
    BY J. D. WHITNEY.
      HE specimen of which the analysis follows, was given me by
       J.W. Foster, Esq., and is the same mineral which has been named
Coracite by Mr. J. L. Le Conte, and partially described by him in
the American Journal of Science (New Series, vol. iii. p. 174). As
it is evident that the conclusions drawn by Mr. Le Conte from his
qualitative examination were quite incorrect, and as the mineral
differs considerably, in its reaction with acids, from pitchblende,
with which it has the greatest analogy, and which at first sight it
would seem to be, I have carefully examined it, with the following
results:—
    Substance amorphous; fracture uneven ; without traces of clea
vage; hardness 3; spec. grav. —; colour pitch-black; powder
 gray; lustre resinous.
    Before the blowpipe it does not change its appearance, or fuse, or
 colour the flame. It gives with the fluxes the characteristic reac
tions of uranium.
    It dissolves readily without the application of heat in dilute hydro
 chloric acid, effervescing strongly; in which respect it differs en
tirely from pitchblende, which is insoluble, except in nitric acid or
in aqua regia. It gives a beautiful green solution, a small quantity
 of flocky silica separating.
    The analysis was conducted as follows:—
    A portion of the mineral, carefully selected and freed from foreign
 matters, was pulverized and dried at 100°C. It was then dissolved
 by hydrochloric acid in a suitable apparatus, the loss of weight being .
 considered as carbonic acid. The silica separated by filtration was
 found to be pure when tested by the blowpipe, and was entirely
 soluble in carbonate of soda. In the solution filtered from the silica,
 sulphuretted hydrogen threw down a precipitate, at first dark brown
 and afterwards black, of sulphuret of lead, which was estimated as
 sulphate of lead by oxidizing with nitric acid. The filtered solution
 was then digested till it no longer smelt of sulphuretted hydrogen,
 and oxides of uranium and iron and alumina precipitated by caustic
 ammonia. The precipitate was washed with water to which chlo
 ride of ammonium had been added, and then taken moist from the

154             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
filter and redissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this solution oxide of
iron and alumina were precipitated by carbonate of ammonia, the
oxide of uranium remaining in solution, and care being taken that
the solution should be quite dilute, in order that the iron might be
entirely precipitated. The oxides of iron and alumina were sepa
rated by caustic potash. In the solution filtered from these sub
stances, the uranium was precipitated by adding hydrochloric acid
to supersaturation, boiling to expel all the carbonic acid, and then
adding ammonia.
   In the solution from which the precipitate by ammonia of uranium,
iron and alumina had been separated, the lime was thrown down by
ammonia and oxalic acid. The filtered solution was evaporated to
dryness, and the ammoniacal salts driven off by ignition, when there
remained traces of magnesia and manganese.
   The water was estimated by ignition in a bulb-tube, and collecting
the water driven off in a weighed chloride of calcium tube. The
mineral does not however part with any of its carbonic acid at a
temperature below that required to drive off all the water, nor is it
rendered less soluble by exposure to the strongest heat of a Berzelius
lamp.
   No traces of sulphur could be found by boiling the mineral with
fuming nitric acid, and testing with chloride of barium. The lead
has therefore been calculated as oxide, and not as a sulphuret.
   The per-centage results of two analyses are as follows: —
                                                                    I.    II.

   That the uranium exists in the mineral as U2 O3, and not as
UO U2 O3, as in the common pitchblende, is evident from its ready
solubility in acids; and that the oxide of uranium, or uranic acid as
it might with equal propriety be called, is in chemical combination
in the mineral is equally evident, from the fact that its solubility is
not diminished by ignition. That the silica is also chemically com
bined is shown by the fact that it is separated in a state in which it
is soluble in carbonate of soda. It is difficult to see in exactly what
manner these elements are combined with regard to each other,
though it is probable that the oxide of uranium plays the part of an
acid toward a portion of the lime (the remaining portion being in
combination with the carbonic acid) and the lead. The frequent
occurrence of a small quantity of oxide of lead with the ores of
uranium is an interesting fact, on which future investigations may
perhaps throw some light-Boston Journal of Natural History,

   ON THE DUST-STORMS OF INDIA.             BY P. BADDELEY, Esq.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                                  Lahore, April 18, 1850.
   I have only an hour or two to spare before the Indian mail leaves
this, to give you a few notes regarding dust-storms, which are
very prevalent in this part of India during the dry months of April,
May and June, that is, before the setting in of the rainy season.
   My observations on this subject have extended as far back as the
hot weather of 1847, when I first came to Lahore, and the result is
as follows:–Dust-storms are caused by spiral columns of the electric
fluid passing from the atmosphere to the earth; they have an onward
motion—a revolving motion, like revolving storms at sea—and a
peculiar spiral motion from above downwards, like a corkscrew. It
seems probable that in an extensive dust-storm there are many of
these columns moving on together in the same direction; and during
the continuance of the storm, many sudden gusts take place at in
tervals, during which time the electric tension is at its maximum.
These storms hereabouts mostly commence from the north-west or
west, and in the course of an hour, more or less, they have nearly
completed the circle, and have passed onwards.
    Precisely the same phaenomena, in kind, are observable in all cases
of dust-storms: from the one of a few inches in diameter to those
that extend for fifty miles and upwards, the phaenomena are identical.
    It is a curious fact, that some of the smaller dust-storms occasion
ally seen in extensive and arid plains, both in the country and in
Affghanistan above the Bolon Pass, called in familiar language
 “Devils,” are either stationary for a long time, that is, upwards of
 an hour, or nearly so; and during the whole of this time the dust
 and minute bodies on the ground are kept whirling about into the
air.    In other cases these small dust-storms are seen slowly advan
 cing, and when numerous, usually proceed in the same direction.
Birds, kites and vultures, are often seen soaring high up just above
 these spots, apparently following the direction of the column, as if
 enjoying it. My idea is, that the phaenomena connected with dust
 storms are identical with those present in waterspouts and white
 squalls at sea, and revolving storms and tornadoes of all kinds; and
 that they originate from the same cause, viz. moving columns of
 electricity.
    In 1847, at Lahore, being desirous of ascertaining the nature
 of dust-storms, I projected into the air an insulated copper wire
 on a bamboo on the top of my house, and brought the wire into
 my room, and connected it with a gold-leaf electrometer and a
 detached wire communicating with the earth. A day or two after,
 during the passage of a small dust-storm, I had the pleasure of ob
 serving the electric fluid passing in vivid sparks from one wire to
 another, and of course strongly affecting the electrometer. The
 thing was now explained; and since then I have by the same means
 observed at least sixty dust-storms of various sizes, all presenting
 the same phaenomena in kind,
    I have commonly observed that, towards the close of a storm of
 this kind, a fall of rain suddenly takes place, and instantly the stream

156            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
of electricity ceases, or is much diminished; and when it continues,
it seems only on occasions, when the storm is severe and continues
for some time after. The barometer steadily rises throughout. In
this part of the world, the fluctuation of the barometric column
is very slight, seldom more than two or three-tenths of an inch at
a time.
   The average height at Lahore is 1: 180, corrected for temperature,
indicating, I suppose, above 1150 feet above the level of the sea,
taking 30 inches as the standard.
   A large dust-storm is usually preceded by certain peculiarities in
the dew-point, and the manner in which the particles of dew are de
posited on the bulb of a thermometer.      My mode of taking the dew
point is, to plunge a common thermometer in a little ice, let it run
down 20° or 30°, take it out, wipe it dry, hold it up to the light, and
observe the bright spot, and continue to wipe off the dew so long as
it is deposited and dulls the bulb : at the instant it clears off mark
the temperature. This I have compared frequently with Daniell's
hygrometer, cooled by means of chloroform, and find them both
correspond with the greatest accuracy.
   This is a digression; but I have no time to arrange, and must
therefore put down my remarks as they occur to me.
   The dew-point varies very much, but is usually many degrees below
the temperature of air, 20° to 50° or more.
   It also varies according to the time of year. During November
last the mean temperature of dew-point was about 47°, that of the
air about 71°.
   In January 1850, dew-point 43°; in the air, 61°; and the mean
temperature of self-registering thermometer 45°4.
   In February 1850, mean of dew-point 48°, and air 64°5.
   April 1850, mean temperature of dew-point so far is about 60°,
and the air 84°.
   The sparks or the stream of electricity, as it is seen passing from
one wire to the other, is in some cases, and during high tension,
doubled or trebled; and is never straight, but invariably more or
less crooked.
   Various kinds of sparks are seen at times; one end of the wire
has a star; and from the wire, when held just beyond striking di
stance, a brush is seen curved, which, when viewed through a lens,
seems composed of a stream or curved brush of bright globules, like
a shower of mercury.
   The manner in which the electricity acts upon the dust and light
bodies it meets with in its passage, is simple enough. I suppose the
particles similarly electrified and mutually repulsive, and then,
together with the whirling motion communicated to them, are
whisked into the air. The same takes place when the electricity
moves over water.     The surface of the water becomes exposed to
the electric agency; and its particles, rendered mutually repulsive,
are in the same way whirled into the air.
   At sea the waterspout is thus formed. First of all is seen the
cloud descending, and beneath may be observed the water in a cone,
misty and agitated; soon the cloud is seen to approach and join the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              157
latter, involving both extremities in one column, having a spiral
motion, and on it moves or continues stationary.           The power of
electricity in raising bodies, when combined with this peculiar whirl
ing motion, will account for fish, &c. being carried up in its vortex
and afterwards discharged to a distance on the earth. The motion
of the dust-storm may be described by spinning a tee-totum on a
drop of ink; and the way in which bodies are projected may be in
like manner described, by letting fall a drop of ink on the centre
of a tee-totum while spinning. In this case the particles of ink are
thrown off at tangents ever varying, as the centre moves; and per
haps it will be found, that when these kind of storms pass through
forests, trees uprooted are distributed something in this manner.
   The violent dust-storms are by some supposed to commence at the
foot of the hills.   I cannot tell if this be the case or not, but should
think that they do not necessarily do so, as many often originate in
extensive arid plains; and the rarefaction of air, from great and long
continued heat, may be in some way connected with the exciting
cause.
   Some of them come on with great rapidity, as if at the rate of
from 40 to 80 miles an hour. They occur at all hours, oftentimes
Inear SunSet.
   The sky is clear, and not a breath moving; presently a low bank
of clouds is seen in the horizon, which you are surprised you did
not observe before; a few seconds have passed, and the cloud has
half filled the hemisphere: and now there is no time to lose—it is a
dust-storm, and helter-skelter everyone rushes to get into the house
in order to escape being caught in it.
   The electric fluid continues to stream down the conducting wire
unremittingly during the continuance of the storm, the sparks often
times upwards of an inch in length, and emitting a crackling sound;
its intensity varying upon the force of the storm, and, as before
said, more intense during the gusts.
   Many dust-storms occur at Lahore and in the Punjaub, generally
during the hot and dry months, as many as seven and nine in one
month.
   One that occurred last year in the month of August seemed to
have come from the direction of Lica, on the Indus, to the west and
by south of Lahore, and to have a north-easterly direction. An
officer travelling, and at the distance of twenty miles or so from
Lica, was suddenly caught in it; his tent was blown away, and he
himself knocked down and nearly suffocated by the sand. He stated
to me that he was informed by one resident at Lica, that so great
was its force at the latter place, as to crack the walls of a substantial
brick dwelling in which the above officer had lately resided, and to
uproot some trees about.
   The instant the insulated wire is involved in the electric current
marked by the column of dust, down streams the electricity.
   I have sometimes attempted to test the kind of electricity, and
find that it is not invariably in the same state; sometimes appearing
+, at other times —, and changing during the storm.
   One day I caused the current to pass through a solution of cya.

In this case the cyanide of silver was pure, without any salt; but
in subsequent attempts to silver a wire in this way, I have not suc
ceeded, only a very slight deposit taking place, which was not in
creased by long exposure to the influence.
   But in all the cases I tried subsequent to the one first alluded to,

      ON CERTAIN PHAENOMENA OF FORCED DILATATION OF
            LIQUIDs.     BY M. MARCELLIN BERTHELOT.
   If a somewhat strong capillary tube, closed at one end and drawn
out at the other to a slender point, is filled with water at the tem
perature of 28° or 30° Cent. ; if this tube is cooled down to 18°, so
as to cause a certain quantity of air to enter it at the open point, and
it is then closed, and again heated to 28° and gradually higher, after
a certain time the air is completely dissolved.      If cooled to 18°, the
original temperature at which the tube contained at the same time
gas and liquid, it is seen that the water continues to occupy the
whole of the internal capacity, and maintains thus an invariable
density between 28° to 18°. Its temperature may even be lowered
still more. At this moment the least shock or collision, the least va
riation causes the instant reappearance, with a sort of ebullition,
 a slight noise, and a shock more or less perceptible, of the gas dis
 solved in the water. It dilates rapidly, and in less than a second
has resumed its primitive volume at 18°. I have made the same
observations with the following liquids, selected from all classes:—
water, solutions of various salts and gases, solution of soda, various
acids, alcohol, aether, acetone, Dutch liquid, essence of turpentine,
oil of olives, creosote, sulphuret of carbon, chlorides of metalloids
and metals, bromine. Mercury is the only liquid with which I have
not succeeded, either in the presence of the air or in vacuo. A
bubble of air remained several days in presence of the mercury with
out dissolving, at least completely, and that under pressures of 200
to 300 atmospheres, produced by preventing, for that length of time,
 the dilatation of the mercury due otherwise to an increased tempe
 rature of 8° or 10°.
   In these phaenomena there are two things very distinct. 1. An
unstable supersaturation of the liquid by the gas, produced under the
influence of the pressure. There are numerous examples of this
order of facts. 2. A state of forced dilatation of the liquid: the latter,
in fact, an instant before the vibration, fills the volume which the gas
occupies an instant after conjointly with it, and this volume is the
same which the dilated liquid filled on an elevation of temperature
of 8 to 10 degrees and more. The variation of density thus produced
is enormous ; for water it is equal to rºw of its volume at 18°; for
alcohol to ºr, for aether to ºn. Such an effect would be produced
in an opposite direction only by a pressure of 50 atmospheres for

                        Meteorological Observations.                                                           1.59
water, of 150 for aether. This phaenomenon is very general, as is
proved by the variety of the liquids on which I have operated. It
probably accompanies all supersaturations, but at variable degrees
and in various directions, without being capable of being proved.
    Following the advice of M. Regnault, I endeavoured to separate
the two facts, and to produce the dilatation of the liquids in vacuo. A
peculiar apparatus enabled me to fill the tubes with liquids absolutely
freed from air, and to close them without letting any gas enter.
Under these new conditions, I reproduced the phaenomenon of forced
dilatation with water and aether, and have thus seen that it is inde
pendent of supersaturation. This permanence of the density of the
liquids in an interval of temperature more or less considerable, ap
pears to me attributable to the adhesion of the glass and the liquid :
it is a force which is opposed to the division of this latter, and which
can only be destroyed by an increase of the molecular attraction of
the liquid for itself, an increase produced under the influence of cool
ing.—Comptes Rendus, June 24, 1850.

            XVIII. On the Composition of Beudantite.
                By John PERcy, M.D., F.R.S.*
      EVY first described this mineral, and from his own ex
        amination of its physical characters, and Wollaston's
 determination of its composition, pronounced it to be a distinct
 species.
    The following is Levy's description, the measurement of the
 crystals being omitted.
    “This substance occurs in small crystals closely aggregated,
 of which the form is a slightly obtuse rhombohedron, with the
 summits truncated.     Their colour is black at the surface, and
 their lustre somewhat resinous; but their fragments are trans
 lucent, and of a deep brown colour. The hardness is sensibly
greater than that of fluate of lime. When pounded, the
colour is of a greenish-gray. The matrix seems to be the
same substance in an amorphous state with veins of fibrous
haematite; it comes from Hornhausen on the Rhine.           I am
indebted to Dr. Wollaston for the chemical examination of
this mineral, the result of which is very interesting; the only
substances he has been able to detect in it being oxide of lead
and oxide of iron.”—Annals of Philos. N. S. vol. xi. p. 195.
    Recently, Descloizeaux has examined the crystallographic,
and Damour the chemical properties of Beudantite (Ann. de
Ch. et de Phys. t. x. p. 73, 3* S.). The crystals upon
which they operated were taken from a specimen in the col
lection of the Ecole des Mines at Paris, and were of two
kinds, green semi-transparent cubes, and bright black cubes,
as seen by reflected light. Damour asserts that the former
were composed of arsenic acid, oxide of iron and water, and
                   * Communicated by the Author.

were identical both in physical and chemical properties with
cube-ore; and that the latter were principally composed of
hydrated arseniate of sesquioxide of iron containing in acci
dental mixture oxide or sulphuret of lead.
   Mr. Brooke having supplied me with some of Levy's
original specimen of Beudantite, from which the portion ex
amined by Wollaston was taken, I am now able to present
quantitative analyses of this mineral. As, however, the quan
tity placed at my disposal was comparatively small, and as
Wollaston mentioned only the presence of oxide of iron and
lead, I shall consider it necessary to state somewhat minutely
the results of my examination. It will be seen, by referring
to Levy's description previously inserted, that only the black
crystals of Descloizeaux agree with that description.
                      Qualitative Analysis.
   1. Heated in the closed tube, colourless liquid was given
off, which reddened litmus-paper, and produced a white pre
cipitate in a solution of chloride of barium.
   2. A yellow-brown bead was obtained by heating with
borax in the outer flame of the blowpipe.
   3. By heating on charcoal in the inner flame with carbonate
of soda and a little borax, a dark-coloured bead was produced,
from which, by trituration and laevigation, numerous brittle
metallic particles and a disc of soft metal like lead were ob
tained.
   4. By roasting the metallic particles (3.) in an inclined open
tube, the characteristic odour of arsenic was instantly per
ceived, and a very sensible quantity of white crystalline sub
limate was formed.                                               -
   5. The disc of soft metal (3.) dissolved without residue in
dilute nitric acid. The solution, evaporated to dryness, gave
a white crystalline residue, in the aqueous solution of which
iodide of potassium produced a voluminous deep yellow pre
cipitate.
   6. The mineral completely dissolved in hydrochloric acid
by the aid of heat, forming a brown solution like that of ses
quichloride of iron.
   7. Solution (6.) was not rendered turbid by dilution with
Water.
   8. Solution (6.) gave a red-brown precipitate with ammonia,
like sesquioxide of iron.
   9. Solution (6.) gave a black precipitate with sulphuretted
hydrogen in excess.                           -                  .
    10. Solution (6.) gave a very sensible white precipitate with
chloride of barium, not redissolved by dilution with water.

         Dr. Percy on the Composition of Beudantite.           163
   11. By Reinsch's test (electrotype copper being used), so
lution (6.) gave ample evidence of the presence of arsenic.
   12. The mineral was fused with a mixture of carbonate of
potash and soda.      The product was washed with boiling
water, when a clear colourless solution and a brown residue
were obtained.
   13. Reinsch's test applied to solution (12.) detected arsenic;
by heat in an inclined open tube, the gray coating was re
moved, and a white, sparkling, crystalline sublimate obtained.
   14. Marsh's test applied to solution (12.) also gave unequi
vocal evidence of the presence of arsenic in considerable
quantity.
   15. Solution (12.) was rendered acid by hydrochloric acid,
and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen. The precipitate was
digested with the strongest nitric acid; the solution was filtered,
reduced by evaporation, and treated in Marsh's apparatus, as
modified by the Prussian government (Chem. Gaz. vol. iii.
p. 46), when an abundant deposit of metallic arsenic was ob
tained.   This was converted into white sublimate, which was
rendered yellow by sulphuretted hydrogen.
   16. To the solution (15.) left, after separation of sulphuret
and free sulphur, and reduced by evaporation, hydrochlorate
of ammonia, and sulphate of magnesia were added. After some
time numerous crystalline particles appeared on the surface
of the liquid, and on the sides and bottom of the glass vessel.
This crystalline precipitate, tested with molybdate of ammonia
(Svanberg's process), gave a yellow precipitate.
   17. The solution of the mineral in hydrochloric acid was
treated with excess of ammonia and then digested with hydro
sulphate of ammonia. The precipitate was treated with strong
nitric acid. Sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through the
diluted acid solution, which was afterwards filtered and boiled
with nitric acid. Excess of ammonia was added. The pre
cipitate was heated with carbonate of soda and nitrate of
potass on platinum before the blowpipe, but no green colo
ration was produced.
   18. The precipitate by ammonia (17.) was boiled with
potash. The potash solution was rendered acid by hydro
chloric acid, and afterwards alkaline by ammonia, but no
sensible precipitate followed.
   19. The brown residue (12.) was dissolved in hydrochloric
acid. Sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through the solu
tion, which was a<U+017F>terwards filtered and boiled with chlorate
of potash. Ammonia was added. The filtrate was tested with
oxalate of ammonia, but no turbidity followed,                   -
   20. The filtrate (19.) was tested with phosphate of soda,

but, after long standing, no trace of crystalline precipitate
appeared.
                                First Analysis.
   In this analysis the crystals employed were not selected
under a lens, and were mixed with some amorphous brown
matrix.
    Weight of mineral after drying at 130°C., 6.17 grains.
The colour of the powder was light brown.
    It was fused with more than 20 grains of a mixture of car
bonate of potash and soda.                The product was thoroughly
washed with hot water and the solution filtered.
                       Solution (a) and Residue (b)
   Solution (a). Colourless. Excess of hydrochloric acid was
added. It was then boiled with a little sulphite of potash,
after which sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through it. A
reddish-brown precipitate was produced, which after standing
all night in a warm place, was covered with a fine yellow pre
cipitate. Some lead had evidently been dissolved by the ex
cess of alkaline carbonate *. The precipitate was washed with
water and afterwards digested with hydrosulphate of ammonia.
    A minute quantity of black matter remained undissolved
upon the filter, upon which the sulphuret of lead subsequently
separated from the insoluble residue (b) was collected.
   The filtrate was treated with excess of hydrochloric acid, and
left in a warm place more than twenty-four hours. The pre
cipitate, which evidently consisted chiefly of free sulphur, was
analysed in the usual way for arsenic. Weight of precipitate
after drying until it ceased to lose weight, 2.08 grains. It
was boiled with the strongest nitric acid. Globule of free
sulphur, washed and dried, weighed 0-65. To the acid so
lution excess of chloride of barium was added. The sulphate
of baryta obtained, washed, dried and ignited, weighed 7:55.
    The solution, from which the arsenic had been precipitated
as sulphuret, was reduced to a small volume by evaporation.
Sulphate of magnesia, hydrochlorate of ammonia, and am
monia were then added. The crystalline precipitate was
washed on the following morning with cold ammonia-water.
Dried and ignited it weighed 0-14 gr.
   Residue (b). It was dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Sul
phuretted hydrogen was passed through the solution. The
precipitate was collected on the filter before-mentioned. It was
digested with the strongest nitric acid, a little sulphuric acid
   * I have found that when a solution of carbonate of potash is long kept
in a flint-glass bottle, it dissolves a very sensible amount of lead.

was added, and the whole evaporated to dryness and ignited.
The product weighed 2:05 grs.
   The solution from which the lead had been separated was
boiled with chlorate of potash. Ammonia in excess was
added. The precipitate, washed, dried and ignited, weighed
2-62 grs.
                         Second Analysis.
   The particles of crystals were carefully selected under a lens.
   Weight 6-64 grains. .                                 -
   The mineral was digested in hot hydrochloric acid. Excess
of ammonia was added to the solution, and afterwards excess
of hydrosulphate of ammonia, when the whole was exposed to
agentle heat during many hours. The precipitate was washed
on a filter with water containing a little hydrosulphate of am
monia, and afterwards treated with hot hydrochloric acid.
Decomposition was complete. Through the solution, after
filtration, sulphuretted hydrogen was passed for a considerable
time. The precipitate was digested with the strongest nitric
acid, and after the addition of a few drops of sulphuric acid,
evaporated to dryness and ignited. The product weighed
2.66 grains.
   The solution from which the lead had been separated by
sulphuretted hydrogen was left in a warm place until the
odour of that gas ceased to be detected. It was filtered,
boiled with nitric acid, and treated with excess of ammonia.
The precipitate, washed, dried and ignited, weighed 250 grs.
   The hydrosulphate of ammonia solution was digested with
excess of hydrochloric acid in a warm place for more than
twenty-four hours. The precipitate, washed and dried at 100°
C., until it ceased to lose weight, weighed 372 grs. The
arsenic was determined indirectly in the usual way. The
analytical data obtained are as follow:—
   Sulphur and sulphuret analysed, weighed . . . 3 #1

   The solution from which the arsenic had been separated as
sulphuret by hydrochloric acid, was reduced by evaporation,
and treated with excess of chloride of barium. The preci
pitate, washed, dried and ignited, weighed 2:40 grs.
   Of another portion of crystalline fragments selected under
a lens, 5.34 grains were weighed.
   The mineral was digested in hot hydrochloric acid. The
solution was poured into a hot solution of chloride of ba

   Loss by calcination, determination of arsenic.—3'54 grs. of
the mineral reduced to powder were heated in a small closed
tube of Bohemian glass for a considerable time; first over the
spirit-lamp, and afterwards at a bright red heat before the
blowpipe. The loss in calcination was 0:40, the calcined
mineral weighing 3-14 grs. This residue was red-brown, like
sesquioxide of iron. It was dissolved in hot hydrochloric acid,
and chloride of barium was added to the solution. The pre
cipitate, washed, dried and ignited, weighed 0.90 gr.
    The solution was freed from baryta by sulphuric acid: ex
cess of ammonia was added, and afterwards hydrosulphate of
ammonia.       The determination of the arsenic was made as
previously described. The analytical data are as follow —

   * On the Separation of Sulphuric Acid from Suphate of Lead by Chloride
of Barium.—As the mineral under examination contained sulphuric acid and
oxide of lead, the correctness of the preceding determination of sulphuric
acid was tested by the following experiment. Of sulphate of lead, which
had been prepared some years previously, and of the absolute purity of
which I was not certain, 23.92 grains were weighed after heating, and dis
solved in hot hydrochloric acid. The acid solution was poured into a hot
solution containing more than 20 grains of chloride of barium. The sul
phate of baryta, washed, dried and ignited, weighed 1804. Now 23.92 of
sulphate of lead contain of sulphuric acid 6:20, and 18:04 of sulphate of
baryta contain of sulphuric acid 6-32. These results are sufficiently sa
tisfactory.

   The preceding results prove that Beudantite is chiefly com
posed of sesquioxide of iron and oxide of lead, and so far con
firm the accuracy of Wollaston's examination of it. They
also confirm Damour's statement of the presence of arsenic
and sulphur, and further demonstrate the presence of phos
phoric acid. But the sulphur cannot, as Damour supposes,
exist even in part as sulphuret, because the mineral dissolves
without residue in hydrochloric acid; whereas if a sulphuret
were present, there would be a residue of free sulphur, the
result of the action of the sulphuretted hydrogen evolved by
the decomposition of the sulphuret upon the sesquichloride
of iron formed at the same time.
   * Mean of three determinations.
   t I think it probable that this determination of arsenic is very sensibly
excessive. I have not given the mean of the several determinations, be
cause I wished to put together the results obtained in the analysis of one
portion of the mineral.

168       Dr. Percy on the Composition of Beudantite.
   The quantitative results are less satisfactory than the qua
litative. The difference between the proportions of oxide of
iron and oxide of lead in the two analyses is considerable;        º
but the following facts may serve in part to explain this dis
crepancy.
   In the first analysis, the crystalline fragments were not
selected under a lens, and were mixed with some of the amor
phous brown matrix; while in the second, the pure crystal
line fragments were alone selected under a lens as carefully
as possible. Besides, the portions of mineral used in the two
analyses were taken from different parts of Mr. Brooke's
specimen, and were received by me at different times.
   The differences also between the several determinations of
arsenic are considerable; but, irrespective of the probable
variation in composition of the several portions of mineral
submitted to analysis, it is not to be expected that in analyses
of such small quantities of matter as three or six grains,
arsenic should be determined with precision. And the same
may be said of the determinations of phosphoric acid. It is
inferred that the arsenic exists as arsenic acid.
   I wish it to be particularly understood, that I do not pre
tend to present these analytical results as more than approxi
mate; for although I observed every precaution in the investi
gation, yet in the analyses of such a complex mineral as Reu
dantite, precision is not to be expected unless a larger quantity
is operated on than I had at my disposal.
   The oxide of lead appears to exist in combination with sul
phuric acid, because in the mineral which has been strongly
heated, sufficient sulphuric acid remains to saturate the oxide
of lead. Thus 8.76 per cent. of sulphuric acid was found in the
mineral after having been strongly heated, while before it con
tained 11.67 per cent. Now 876 of sulphuric acid contain
5.24 oxygen. The oxygen of the oxide of lead in the first
analysis is 1.75, or precisely one-third of that of the acid; that
is, in the ratio which exists between the oxygen of the base
and that of the acid in neutral sulphate of lead. In the second
analysis it is less than one-third; still the difference is within
the limit which, in the present case, may fairly be assigned to
error of analysis.
   Again, the sulphuric acid could only be combined in small
proportion with oxide of iron; for otherwise a much larger
quantity of acid must have been evolved at the high tempera
ture to which the mineral was subjected in the experiment to
determine the loss by calcination previously recorded.
   It may therefore be inferred, that the oxide of lead in Beu
dantite is combined with sulphuric acid.

                                                                   =
              On the Triads made with Fifteen Things.         169
    If this inference be admitted, it follows that the excess of
sulphuric acid beyond that required to saturate the oxide of
lead, is, together with the arsenic and phosphoric acids, com
bined with sesquioxide of iron, of which there is much more
than sufficient to neutralize those acids. The mineral may
therefore be considered as a mixture of sulphate of lead, and of
arseniate and sulphate of sesquioxide of iron with excess of base.
    The sulphate of lead cannot be regarded as in combination
with the salts of iron, because no analogous combination is
known. Nor is it more probable that arseniate and sulphate
of sesquioxide of iron should exist in combination with each
other. Hence the mineral would appear to be a simple mix
ture of three distinct salts. But it is crystallized; and the
crystalline form certainly is very similar to, if not identical
with, that of cube-ore. Levy maintained that it was an ob
tuse rhombohedron with the vertical angle truncated. Descloi
zeaux, on the other hand, asserts that the crystals are cubes
similar in all respects to those of cube-ore from Cornwall.
(Ann. de Chim. et de Phys., vol. x, p. 77.)
    Professor Miller, however, has not been able to obtain sa
tisfactory measurements of the crystals. Now, as Beudantite
contains in very sensible proportion the elements of cube-ore,
as the form of the crystals, to say the least, very nearly re
sembles that of cube-ore, and as neither sulphate of lead nor
sulphate of sesquioxide of iron forms crystals at all similar to
those of cube-ore, the most probable conclusion seems to be
that of Damour, namely, that Beudantite is nothing more than
cube-ore containing an accidental mixture of much foreign matter.
Such mixtures, as Damour observes, are frequently met with
in the mineral kingdom, and present a very interesting subject
of inquiry. An extended investigation to determine the
amount of foreign matter which may enter into the composi
tion of crystals, and its power of distorting or modifying the
crystalline form, would certainly yield many valuable results.

 170         On the Triads made with Fifteen Things.
   The last three pairs of columns exhibit three systems of
subindices, which systems may be cyclically permuted, the
letters remaining undisturbed: this gives us two sets more
each of six final columns, making three sets of six columns,
any set of which being added to the primary column will solve
the problem. If we now permute the letters abcde cyclically
in these 6 x 3 columns, we shall obtain four times 6 x 3 co
lumns more, making 6 x 14 columns in all, additional to the
system of seven above written; so that we can complete the
primary column into a solution in fifteen ways, and this with
out repeating any triad: by this process we shall exhaust the
455 triads that are possible with fifteen things. All this I
have long known; but it never occurred to me to observe that
the additional 6 x 14 were exactly 12 x 7, and thus to make
the pleasing variation, by which Mr. Sylvester has extended the
puzzle over the remaining twelve weeks of the quarter. We
see that this is, as Mr. Cayley expected, a matter of cyclical
permutation ; not of thirteen (a negative which he has proved),
but of five letters.
   I obtained this property of the triads made with fifteen
things four years ago, by observing that, if you substitute in
Qia, at page 195 of the second volume, N. S. of the Cambridge
and Dublin Mathematical Journal, in the place of the small
letters, the second instead of the first arrangement of Ds given
on the preceding page, Qis can be broken up into seven co
lumns of five triads each, so as to solve this problem of the
fifteen young ladies; but Qis, as it stands at page 195, cannot
be so broken up. The solution of Mr. Cayley at page 52
above is obtained by a like tentative process; and, in fact,
all the solutions are of the same form, and can be made
identical with the one above written, by disturbing the alpha
betical order, or that of the subindices in certain triads, or
both, in the first column. The question has yet to be mathe
matically treated: I do not feel satisfied with knowing how
to form thirty-five triads, which are found on trial, but not
certainly proved before trial, to be capable of the required
arrangement. We want to know, before trial, why a school
of fifteen can thus be marched out till every pair have walked
together, and why a school of twenty-one can also, or cannot.
I have a strong opinion, but will not undertake to prove the
negative, that twenty-one cannot be thus arranged.
   Permit me, in conclusion, to enunciate the following pro
positions:–
   Theor. I. 5 x 3” symbols can be arranged in }(5'3” – 1)
columns of triads, each column containing all the symbols,
and so that every duad shall be once, and once only, employed.

XX. On the Action of the Soap-Test upon Water containing
   a Salt of Magnesia only, and likewise upon Water containing
   a Salt of Magnesia and a Salt of Lime. By Dugald
   CAMPBELL, F.C.S. London *.
     OR some time back I have been engaged in analysing
       specimens of water—determining by actual experiment,
besides the salts of the alkalies which they contain, the amount
of phosphate of iron and salts of lime and magnesia in a gal
lon, testing them at the same time with reference to their de
grees of hardness, according to the plan adopted by Prof.
 Clark in the specification of a patent printed in the Reper
tory of Patent Inventions for 1841.
       hen the quantities of phosphate of iron and salts of lime
and magnesia found in a gallon of water were calculated each
into its equivalent of chalk and added together, I had antici
pated that their amount would correspond, or nearly so, with
  * Communicated by the Author, having been read before the British
Association, August 1850.

 172     Mr. D. Campbell on the Action of the Soap-Test
 the degrees of hardness of the water as ascertained by the soap
 test, this being the rule given by Professor Clark in a private
 circular to his chemical friends to “infer the degrees of hard
 mess from an ordinary analysis.” But in this I was mistaken.
 I therefore thought it advisable to make some experiments
 with the soap-test upon water of which I knew the actual
 composition.
    The soap-test I employed in the following experiments was
 prepared with the utmost care, the alcohol having always been
 digested with carbonate of potash for many hours before being
 reduced to proof-spirit. The soap corresponded with what
 Prof. Clark advises, nearly 1 oz. in a gallon of proof-spirit,
giving a soap-test, thirty-two test measures of which formed a
perfect lather with 100 like measures of a standard solution
of 16° hardness of lime, which remained all over the water for
five minutes when first placed after shaking, and which could
be renewed at any time by again agitating it. The soap-test
was likewise proved by standard solutions of lime of 12°, 8°,
6°, 4°, 2° hardness.
   The distilled water employed in making standard solutions
was selected with much care, and tested in various ways to be
sure of its purity.
   The first experiments which I made were upon water con
taining a salt of magnesia in different proportions.
   To prepare such solutions, 19.2 grains perfectly pure and
dry sulphate of magnesia (MgO, SOs), which is the equiva
lent quantity of that salt to 16 grains carbonate of lime, were
dissolved in a gallon of distilled water. This was considered
as a standard of magnesia equal to 16° hardness of lime, or a
standard of magnesia equal to 16°. Fifteen other standard
solutions were prepared from this, as follows: by taking one
measure of the 16° standard, and adding fifteen like measures
of distilled water to it, we have a standard of 1° magnesia;
with two measures of original standard and fourteen like mea
sures of distilled water added to it, we have a standard of 2°
magnesia; and so on up to 15°.
   The results which I obtained (see Table No. 1, p. 173)
when treating these solutions with soap-test, were such as to
induce me to proceed with experiments upon mixed standard
solutions of magnesia and lime. These I prepared as follows:—
Magnesia standards ranging from one to sixteen were made
each to contain double the amount of the magnesian salt that
the previous standards contained. Lime standards were then
made of 32°, 24°, 16°, 12°, 8°, 4° hardness in a gallon. When
fifty measures of these lime standards were mixed with fifty
like measures of the last magnesian standards, I then consi

               upon Water containing a Salt of Magnesia.                           173
dered that I had standard solutions of 16°, 12°, 8°, 6°, 4°,
2° hardness of lime, plus 1°, 2°, 3° magnesia, and so on up
to 16°.
   The Tables Nos. 2 to 7 give the number of soap-test mea
sures which I have found requisite to produce a perfect and
renewable lather, when shaken with one hundred test mea
sures of these solutions in a phial capable of containing about
five fluid ounces.

                             Remarks upon the Tables.
   Table No. 1. Magnesia Standards.-On comparing the
number of soap-test ineasures which I have found requisite
to produce a perfect lather with the magnesia standards, with
the number of soap-test measures which will cause a similar
effect with the corresponding standards of lime”, it will be
   * These are the same which are given by Professor Clark in a private
circular to his chemical friends, and which I have introduced into Table
No. 1, to serve for comparison with the results I hav e obtained,:and which
are detailed in that and the other tables.

           upon Water containing a Salt of Magnesia.           175
seen that only as far as the 6th degree do the magnesia cor
respond, or nearly so, with the lime standards.       And as the
strength of the solutions increase, so much more do the dif
ferences increase, until a standard of 16’ magnesia, and a
standard of 9’ lime, require nearly the same number of soap
test measures to produce a proper lather in each.
   Some experience is requisite in making experiments upon
water containing magnesian salts alone, and likewise upon
magnesian water mixed with lime salts. Magnesian salts in
water more or less produce a curd with soap which interferes
in some measure with the lather. They likewise do not act
so readily upon soap as the salts of lime do; so that in making
an experiment, a good deal more agitation is required to pro
duce a lather. I have found it best to add the soap-test little
by little with agitation; in fact, all solutions should be treated
in the same manner as when a water of unknown hardness
has to be tested. If the requisite quantity of soap-test be
added at once to a standard, a good deal of shaking is required
to produce even a curd : this is more the case as the quantity
of magnesia increases, but by additional shaking the lather
appears. A proper lather once having been obtained, it
can with very moderate shaking be restored again, not only
for hours but for days afterwards, and improved as to sta
bility. The addition however of a little more soap-test with
gentle agitation, instead of at once improving the lather, has
the contrary effect, and a curd appears instead of the lather,
or apparently the water is rendered hard, and it is only by
very considerable agitation that the lather can be restored;
when restored, it is a better lather than before the addition of
the last portion of soap-test: this operation may be repeated
upon the same solution several times and with similar re
sults, by proceeding as above described, until a considerable
amount of soap-test measures have been added above the
quantity requisite to produce a proper lather. This is more
particularly the case in the higher degrees.
   Table No. 2, 16° Lime plus Magnesia degrees.—On re
ferring to this table, it will be seen that the solution of 16°
lime plus 1° magnesia, actually does not require so much
soap-test to form a perfect lather as does the solution of 16°
of lime alone, and as the magnesia increases in the solutions,
the soap-test measures requisite to produce a lather diminish,
until the solution of 16° lime plus 16° magnesia gives a lather
with 27.9 measures, i.e. 4:1 soap-test measures less than is re
quired by the standard of lime of 16° hardness. The action
of a few more soap-test measures, when added to solutions in
which a perfect lather had once been established, of appa

   176    Mr. D. Campbell on the Action of the Soap-Test
  rently rendering them hard, was noticed in these as in the
  former solutions.
     Table No. 3. 12° Lime plus Magnesia degrees.—It will be
  observed in this table that the magnesia acts similarly, although
  scarcely so powerful as in the last experiments; but on the
  whole, the action of magnesia thoughout this series of expe
  riments very much accords with its action in the former.
     Table No. 4. 8° Lime plus Magnesia degrees.—On referring
  to this table, it will be seen that the magnesia acts upon the
  lime standard much as in the last experiments.
     Table No. 5. 6° Lime plus Magnesia degrees.—On ex
  amining this table, we find now that the magnesia begins to
  act differently towards the lime than it has hitherto done;
 the 6° lime plus 1° magnesia is now equal in soap-test mea
 sures to 6° lime, at least the difference (0-2) may be considered
 within the limits of error of experiment; from 2° mag. up to
 6° there is a gradual rise, but at 7° it begins to fall, and con
 tinues to do so throughout the remaining solutions. I may
 remark that the lathers from 7° to 16° are not produced with
 the soap-test given in table, except with considerable agitation,
 and although thin, are perfectly free from curd and are re
 producible at any future time by agitation. When a perfect
 lather has been produced by the minimum quantity of soap
 test, the addition of a small quantity more will reduce the
 lather to a curd; great agitation may produce the lather
 again, and stronger than it was before the last addition of
 soap-test: if beyond a certain amount of soap-test has been
 added, a new action shows itself, which I have failed to notice
 in any of the previous solutions, which is, that shaking cannot
 restore the lather properly again until a certain amount of
 soap-test has been added; the additional quantities of soap
 test I have had to add are in the table, and opposite the so
 lutions in which I noticed this peculiarity; how to account
for it I know not, and have not as yet had time to investigate
into it.    I am unable to account for the wide difference in the
amount of additional soap-tests between the numbers 7° and 8°;
as the other numbers seem to follow regularly, it may be owing
to another point in some of these solutions at which much
agitation and less soap-test would produce a lather, but which,
although I have made many experiments, I have not succeeded
in hitting upon. When to the lather established after the
additional soap-tests a small quantity of soap-test is added,
it renders it curdy, but shaking will re-establish the lather
again.
    Table No. 6. 4° Lime with Magnesia degrees.—On looking
over this table, it will be noticed that the magnesia comes into

          upon Water containing a Salt of Magnesia.         177
action more fully, and for the first time the standard of lime
with 1° magnesia requires more soap-test to form a lather
than does the standard of lime alone; still it does not amount
to what would be necessary for 5° lime. The soap-test mea
sures required to produce perfect lathers with 4°, 5°, 6° and
7°, are greater than was required in the last series of expe
riments upon these numbers with the 6° standard of lime.
The same peculiarities of the soap-test upon some of these so
lutions were observed in this set of experiments as in the last.
   Table No. 7. 2° Lime with Magnesia degrees.—On ex
amining this table, it will be seen that the solutions of this
standard of lime with the first four magnesia degrees appear to
require nearly as many soap-test measures as if they were en
tirely lime standards. It will likewise be observed, on com
paring Table 4 with this table, that 7°, 8°, 9° magnesia with 8°
lime, do not take each so many soap-test measures as 7°, 8°, 9°
magnesia with 2°lime, to form proper lathers. Again, in Table
No. 5, it will be seen that each of the magnesia degrees from 6°
to 16°, with the standard of lime which is 6°, do not take so
many soap-test measures to form proper lathers, as do these
magnesian solutions with 2° hardness of lime. On referring
to Table 6, the same remark applies to these solutions as to
the last, that is, that 2° lime with each of the standards of
magnesia from 6° to 16° require more soap-test to produce
proper lathers than solutions of 4° lime with each of these
magnesian standards require. I would call attention again
to Table 7, to notice a rapid descent in soap-test mea
sures between 10° and 11° magnesia; I have made many ex
periments if possible to explain this, but without success. . I
can only observe, that in certain stages of a series of expe
riments of a standard of lime with magnesia, it requires much
care, attention and observation, to mark when the lather pre
vails over the curd, and to obtain at this particular stage uni
form lathers, more especially when the soap inclines to form
a curd in a solution, together with a lather, at the same time.
If these points are not attended to, and no perseverance em
ployed in agitating the solutions, uniform results cannot be
expected. The other observations I have made on the pre
ceding series of waters are applicable to these. The inferences
which I draw from the foregoing experiments are as follows:–
   1st. That water containing sulphate of magnesia alone acts
towards the soap-test in producing with it a perfect lather,
similarly or nearly so, as does water containing a lime salt
alone, but only when the equivalent of magnesia salt does not
exceed 6 grs. of carbonate of lime in a gallon of water.
   2nd. That the degrees of hardness of an ordinary water

  178       On a new Accelerating Process in Photography.
  cannot be inferred by the rule —Compute the grains of lime,
  magnesia, oxides of iron, alumina, in a gallon of water, each
  into its equivalent of chalk: the sum of these equivalents will
  be the hardness of the water.
     3rd, That the degrees of hardness of a water containing
  magnesia and lime salts, as shown by the soap-test as it is now
  applied, cannot in almost every case be taken as representing
  the amount of these salts in the water; nor in nearly every
  instance can it be considered as giving the amount of lime in
  a water when magnesia is present.
     4th. That water might show by the soap-test a small de
  gree of hardness in comparison to the considerable quantities
 of salts of magnesia and of lime it might contain, and trusting
  to this method of analysis alone when selecting water for
 ordinary use and for steam purposes, might lead to a water
 being selected which might not be conducive to the general
 health, and which would leave considerable deposit in vessels
 in which it was boiled,—a great deterioration to its use in
 steam generating.
        XXI. On an Accelerating Process in Photography.
                   By J. MIDDLEToN, F.G.S.*
 THE following method of preparing sensitive paper, may,
       perhaps, be welcome to photographers on account of the
 great sensibility which it confers; it has the additional recom
mendation, moreover, of being very simple and constant in its
results.
    I beat up albumen of the egg of the duck till it becomes
liquid, and then mix it with water in the proportion of eighty
grains of the former to an ounce of the latter. I add to this
solution iodide of potassium in the proportion of twenty-five
grains to the ounce. Prior to the application of this solution
I wash the size from the side to be rendered sensitive, by
means of a camel-hair brush, and when dry I float the paper
on the solution, for from three to four minutes, and when
drained and dried I lay it aside for use.                  -
    When about to be used for taking a picture, the paper,
prepared as above directed, is to be washed with aceto-nitrate
of silver, in the proportion of sixty grains of nitrate and
eighty grains of acetic acid to an ounce of water (Talbot's
strength). I apply the solution with a glass rod, in the
manner recommended some time since by a writer in the
Philosophical Magazine, using about forty grains of it to a
                   * Communicated by the Author.

    Mr. R. Crossley on Algerite, a new Mineral Species.       179
 quarto page, and allow the paper to dry in the dark; it is now
 ready for the camera. While applying the sensitive coat, as
 also while bringing out the picture, I take the precaution to
 use a yellow light. I find that from ten to fifteen seconds is,
 with ordinary sun-light, sufficient exposure, the latter being
 generally too great.
    When the picture has been taken no trace of it appears on
 the paper, but it comes speedily out on the application of a
 saturated solution of gallic acid. I turn up the edges of
 my paper and pour the solution on till the paper is entirely
 covered, and keep it so till the picture has come sufficiently
 out, when I fix it in the usual way.
    I find that if bromide of potassium be substituted for iodide
 of potassium, in the first process, a picture is obtained; but
 the time of exposure required is then about a minute. Again,
 bromide or chloride of potassium does not serve to accelerate,
 as in the ordinary processes, but the contrary; gallic acid too,
 added to the aceto-nitrate, destroys sensitiveness. I find also,
 that if the albumen be dried, and afterwards dissolved up
 and used as above described, it has lost its photographic
 value; a circumstance, which would seem to indicate that
 photographic properties are connected with or dependent
 upon molecular arrangement.
    The employment of albumen in photography is not, I be
 lieve, new : it has not, however, so far as I am aware, been
 used in the way or with the effect stated above,

                   By RicharD CRossLEY, Esq.”
A DETAILED               description of this mineral by Mr. F.
        Alger, accompanied with an analysis by Mr. T. S. Hunt,
was published in the American Journal of Science for July
1849, vol. viii. I have since, at the request of Mr. Alger,
made a re-examination. The results obtained vary but little
from those of Mr. Hunt, though this variation is essential to
the formula. Algerite, named by Mr. Hunt in honour of its
discoverer, Mr. Alger, is found in the town of Franklin,
Sussex County, New Jersey. It is sparingly disseminated in
prismatic crystals through a bed of pure crystalline limestone.
The crystals when undecomposed are of a honey-yellow colour,
and more or less penetrated by the matrix: some are conta
minated by graphite, and others are encrusted with idocrase,

Brittle, subtranslucent. Before the blowpipe alone it fuses
readily to a white blebby glass. With soda it fuses to a dirty
white slag. With borax and phosphorus salt it gives a bead,
faintly tinged by iron, enclosing a siliceous skeleton. Heated
in a closed tube it gives off water which reacts feebly alkaline,
and the powder changes in colour from light buff to light
brown. It is perfectly attackable by a mixture of sulphuric
and hydrochloric acids.

               XXIII. On the Diffusion of Liquids.
             By THoMAs GRAHAM, F.R.S., F.C.S.*
      NY saline or other soluble substance, once liquefied and
        in a state of solution, is evidently spread or diffused
 uniformly through the mass of the solvent by a spontaneous
 process.
    It has often been asked whether this process is of the nature
of the diffusion of gases, but no satisfactory answer to the
 question appears to be obtained, owing, I believe, to the sub
ject having been studied chiefly in the operations of endos
mose, where the action of diffusion is complicated and obscured
by the imbibing power of the membrane, which is peculiar
for each soluble substance, but no way connected with the
diffusibility of the substance in water. Hence also it was not
the diffusion of the salt, but rather the diffusion of the solution,
which was generally regarded. A diffusibility like that of
gases, if it exists in liquids, should afford means for the sepa
ration and decomposition even of unequally diffusible sub
stances, and being of a purely physical character, the neces
sary consequence and index of density, should present a scale
of densities for substances in the state of solution, analogous
 to vapour densities, which would be new to molecular theory.
    M. Gay-Lussac proceeds upon the assumed analogy of
liquid to gaseous diffusion in the remarkable explanation
which he suggests of the cold produced on diluting certain
saline solutions, namely, that the molecules of the salt expand
into the water like a compressed gas admitted into additional
 space.
    The phaenomena of solubility are at the same time con
sidered by that acute philosopher as radically different from
those of chemical affinity, and as the result of an attraction
which is of a physical or mechanical kind. The characters
indeed of these two attractions are strongly contrasted. Che
mical combination is uniformly attended with the evolution of
heat, while solution is marked with equal constancy by the
production of cold. The substances which combine chemically
are the dissimilar, while the soluble substance and its solvent
are the like or analogous in composition and properties.
    In the consideration of solubility, attention is generally en
grossed entirely by the quantity of salt dissolved. . But it is
necessary to apprehend clearly another character of solution,
namely, the degree of force with which the salt is held in so
lution, or the intensity of the solvent attraction, quite irre
   * From the Philosophical Transactions for 1850, part i.; having been
received by the Royal Society November 16, and read December 20, 1849.

spective of quantity dissolved. In the two solid crystalline
hydrates, pyrophosphate of soda and sulphate of soda, we see
the same ten equivalents of water associated with both salts,
but obviously united with unequal degrees of force, the one
hydrate being persistent in dry air and the other highly efflo
rescent. So also in the solutions of two salts which are equally
soluble in point of quantity, the intensity of the attraction
between the salt and the water may be very different, as ex
emplified in the large but feeble solubility in water of such
bodies as the iodide of starch or the sulphindylate of potash,
compared with the solubility of hydrochloric acid or of the
acetate of potash, which last two substances are capable of
precipitating the two former, by displacing them in solution.
Witness also the unequal action of animal charcoal in with
drawing different salts from solution, although the salts are
equally soluble; and the unequal effect upon the boiling-po, t
of water produced by dissolving in it the same weight of x -
rious salts. Besides being said to be small or great, the sº u
bility of a substance has also therefore to be described as weak
or strong.
    The gradations of intensity observed in the solvent force
are particularly referred to, because the inquiry may arise
how far these gradations are dependent upon unequal diffusi
bility; whether indeed rapidity of diffusion is not a measure
of the force in question.
    I have only further to premise, that two views may be taken
of the physical agency by which gaseous diffusion itself is
effected, which are equally tenable, being both entirely suffi
cient to explain the phaenomena.
    On one theory, that of Dr. Dalton, the diffusibility of a gas
is referred immediately to its elasticity. The same spring or
self-repulsion of its particles which sends a gas into a vacuum,
is supposed to propel it through and among the particles of
a different gas.                                                             -
    The existence of an attraction of the particles of one gas
for the particles of all other gases is assumed in the other
theory. This attraction does not occasion any diminution of
volume of gases on mixing, because it is an attraction residing
on the surfaces of the gaseous molecules. It is of the same
intensity for all gases, hence its effect in bringing about inter
mixture is dependent upon the weight of the molecules of the
gases to be moved by it; and the velocity of diffusion of a gas
comes to have the same relation to its density on this hypo
 thesis as upon the other *.
   * Both of the molecular theories of the diffusion of gases were first pub
licly explained, and at the same time ably discussed, with the reference to

            Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.                   183
   The surface attraction of molecules assumed will recall the
surface attraction of liquids, which is found necessary to ac
count for the elevation of liquids in tubes and other phaeno
mena of capillary attraction.
   (1.) An early preliminary experiment was made upon the
liquid diffusion of a body, with whose diffusion as a gas we
are already well acquainted, namely, carbonic acid dissolved
in water.
   Two half-pound stoppered glass bottles were selected, of
which the mouths were 1-2 inch in diameter, and the lips were
ground flat so as to close tight when applied together (fig. 1).
One of them, placed firmly in an                         Fig. 1.
upright position, was filled to the
base of the neck with carbonic acid
water. Over this distilled water
was poured, care being taken to
disturb the liquid below as little as
possible, in filling up the neck. The
second bottle, filled with distilled
water and inverted upon a glass
plate, was slipped over the first at
the water-trough. The solution of
carbonic acid in the lower bottle
was thus placed in free communica
tion by an aperture of 1:2 inch, with
an equal volume of pure water in the
upper bottle. It was expected that the carbonic acid would
be <U+017F>ound, in time, equally diffused through both bottles,
   After forty-eight hours, the upper inverted bottle was again
slipped off from the lower one, upon a glass plate, and the
ratio of the gas found in the upper to that in the lower bottle
determined by the weight of carbonate of baryta which the
liquids of the two bottles afforded respectively. It was as
1-18 to 12-80 (about 1 to 11), instead of the ratio of equality,
which would undoubtedly be the ultimate result of diffusion,
were sufficient time allowed.
   After five days, in a second experiment with a weaker solu
tion of carbonic acid, the gas was found to be distributed—
                   In upper bottle . . . 1:63

friend Mr. T. S. Thomson of Clitheroe. A decided preference was given
by Mr. Thomson, and also by the late Mr. Ivory, to the last, or the attrac
tion theory of diffusion, over that of gases being vacua to each other. See
Phil. Mag., 3rd series, vol. xxv, pp. 51,282.

184        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
    In other experiments where the liquid in the upper bottle
was a solution in water of nitrous oxide gas, instead of pure
water, the carbonic acid of the lower bottle was also observed
 to diffuse into the liquid above it, as freely as it did into pure
 water in a comparative experiment; the ultimate ratios being
 1 to 0-12 in the nitrous oxide liquid, and 1 to 0-10 in the water
 experiment.
    With the necks of the pair of bottles occupied by sponge
 charged with distilled water, the diffusion of the carbonic acid
 of the lower bottle proceeded with little change in its rapidity,
 or in the result when nitrous oxide was placed above it. The
 carbonic acid found in the upper bottle, and which had dif
 fused into it from the lower, was 0.231 when the upper bottle
 contained water alone, and 0.229 when it was water charged
 with three-fourths of its volume of nitrous oxide gas, to 1
 carbonic acid remaining undiffused in the lower bottle in both
 CaSeS.
    It appeared, then, that the liquid diffusion of carbonic acid
 was a slow process compared with its gaseous diffusion, quite
 as much as days are to minutes.
    That this diffusion of the liquid carbonic acid takes place
 with undiminished vigour into water already saturated with
 nitrous oxide, the substance of all others most resembling
 carbonic acid in solubility and the whole range of its physical
 qualities. The diffusion of the liquid carbonic acid appears
 no more repressed by the liquid nitrous oxide, than the diffu
 sion of gaseous carbonic acid is by gaseous nitrous oxide.
    But the chief interest of these observations was the practical
 solution which they give to the question, whether, in conduct
ing experiments on liquid diffusion, accidental causes of dis
turbance and intermixture of two liquids, communicating
freely with each other, can be avoided. It was made evident
that little is to be feared from accidental dispersion when or
dinary precautions are taken.
   An excess of density in the lower liquid of not more than
Tºonth part is found adequate to prevent any considerable
change of place of the latter, from expansion by heat, acci
dental tremors and such disturbing causes, which must exist,
—for days together.
   (2.) Another early inquiry was, how far is the diffusion of
various salts governed or modified by the density of their so
lutions.
   Solutions of eight hydrated acids and salts were prepared,
having the common density of 1:200, and were set to diffuse
into water in the following manner:—
   Eighteen or twenty six-ounce phials were made use of to

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.          185
contain the solutions, and to form what I shall call the Solu
tion phials or cells. They were of the same make and selected
from a large stock, of the common aperture of l’ 175 inch.
Both the mouths and bottoms of these phials were ground
flat. The mode of making an experiment was first to fill the
phial to the base of the neck, or rather to a constant distance
of 0-6 inch below the ground surface of the lip. A little disc
of cork, provided with a slight upright peg of wood, was then
floated upon the solution in the neck, after having been first
dipt in water. The neck itself was now filled up with pure
water by means of a pointed sponge, the drop suspended from
the sponge being made to touch the peg of the float, and water
caused to flow in the gentlest manner, by slightly pressing the
sponge. The only other part of the apparatus, the water-jar,
was a plain cylindrical glass jar, of which the inner surface of
the bottom was flat or slightly concave, to give a firm support
to the phial. The phial, with its solution only, was first
placed in this jar partly filled with distilled water, and the
neck of the former was then filled up with distilled water in
this position, as before described, to avoid any subsequent
movement. The phial was ultimately entirely covered to the
depth of an inch with water, which required about 30 ounces
of the latter, fig. 2. The saline solution in         Fig. 2.
the diffusion cell or phial thus communicated
freely with about five times its volume of pure
water, the liquid atmosphere which invites
diffusion. Another modification of this pro
cedure was the substitution of phials cast in
a mould, of the capacity of 4 ounces, or more
nearly 2080 grs., which were ground down
to a uniform height of 3-8 inches. The neck
was 1:25 inch in diameter and 0.5 inch in
 depth; and the phial was filled up with the
 solution to be diffused to that point. The solution cell or
phial and the water-jar form together a diffusion cell.
    The diffusion was stopt, after twenty-seven days in the pre
 sent experiments, by closing the mouth of the phial with a
 plate of glass, and then raising it out of the water-jar. The
 quantity of salt or of acid which had found its way into the
 water-jar, the diffusion product as it may be called,—was then
 determined by evaporating to dryness for the salts, and by
 neutralizing the same liquid with a normal alkaline solution
 for the acids. The quantities of the acids diffused are esti
 mated at present as protohydrates for the sake of comparison
 with the salts.

   It appears that the diffusion from solutions of the same den
sity is not equal but highly variable, ranging from 1 to 0-1333.
     The results also favour the existence of a relation between
large or rapid diffusibility and a high boiling-point. The latter
property may be taken to indicate of itself a high degree of
attraction between the salt and water.
               I. CHARACTERs of Liquid DIFFUsion.
                   1. Diffusion of Chloride of Sodium.
 . The characters of liquid diffusion were first examined in
detail in the case of this salt.                                                -
   (1.) Do different proportions of chloride of sodium in solu
tion give corresponding amounts of diffusion ?
   Solutions were prepared of chloride of sodium in the pro
portion of 100 water with 1, 2, 3 and 4 parts of the salt.
   The diffusion of all the solutions was continued for the same
time, eight days, at the mean temperature of 52°5 Fahr.

    The quantities diffused appear therefore to be closely in
proportion (for this salt) to the quantity of salt in the diffusing
solution. The density of the solutions containing 1, 2, 3 and
4 parts of chloride of sodium, was at 60°, 1:0067, 1:01:42,

            Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.                      187
1.0218, 1:0285. The increase of density corresponds very
nearly with the proportion of chloride of sodium in solution.
A close approach to this direct relation is indeed observable
in most salts, when dissolved in proportions not exceeding 4
or 5 per cent.
   The relation which appears in these results is also favour
able to the accuracy of the method of experimenting pursued.
The variation from the speculative result does not in any ob
servation exceed 1 per cent.
    2.) Is the quantity of salt diffused affected by temperature?
     he diffusion of similar solutions of chloride of sodium was
repeated at two new temperatures, 39°6 and 67°, the one
being above and the other below the preceding temperature.
It was necessary to use artificial means to obtain the low tem
perature owing to the period of the season. A close box of
double walls, namely the ice-safe of the Wenham Ice Com
pany, was employed, masses of ice being laid on the floor of
the box, and the water-jars supported on a shelf above. The
water and solution were first cooled separately for twenty
four hours in the ice-box, before the diffusion was commenced.
It was found that the temperature could be maintained within
a range of 2° or 3° for eight days. It was doubtful however
whether the temperature was constantly the same to a degree
or two in all the jars; and the results obtained at an j
temperature were always less concordant and sensibly inferior
in precision to observations made at the atmospheric tempe
rature.

   The proportionality in the diffusion is still well-preserved
at the different temperatures. The deviations are indeed little,
if at all, greater than might be occasioned by errors of obser
vation.    The ratio of diffusion, for instance, from the solutions
containing 4 parts of salt, is 3.80 and 3.89 for the two tem
peratures, which numbers fall little short of 4.
   The diffusion manifestly increases with the temperature,

‘188         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
and as far as can be determined by three observations, in
direct proportion to the temperature. The diffusion-product
from the 4 per cent. solution increases from 10 grs. to 18-60,
with a rise of temperature of 27°4, or rather more than one
third. Supposing the same progression continued, the diffu
sibility of chloride of sodium would be doubled by a rise of
84 or 85 degrees.
   (3.) The progress of the diffusion of chloride of sodium in
such experiments as have been narrated, was further studied
 by intercepting the operation after it had proceeded for dif
ferent periods of 2, 4, 6 and 8 days. The solution employed
 was that containing 4 parts of salt to 100 water. Two of the
 six-ounce phials were diffused at the same time for each
period. The temperature given is the mean of the tempera
tures of a water-jar observed each day of the period. The
 daily fluctuation was not more than two or three-tenths of a
degree Fahr.
   In 2 days, temperature 63°7; the salt diffused was 4.04
and 3-86 grs. ; mean 3.95 grs.
    In 4 days, temperature 63°7; the salt diffused was 6-78
and 7-12 grs. ; mean 6'95 grs.
   In 6 days, temperature 63°8; the salt diffused was 10:02
and 9.70 grs. ; mean 9'86 grs.
   In 8 days, temperature 64°; the salt diffused was 13:00 and
 13:25 grs. ; mean 13 12 grs.
    The proportion diffused in the first period of two days is
given directly in the first experiments. The proper diffusion
for each of the three latter periods of two days is obtained by
deducting from the result of each period the result of the
period which precedes it:--
             Diffused in 1st two days . . 3'95 grs.
            Diffused in 2nd two days . . 3:00 grs.
            Diffused in 3rd two days . . 2.91 grs.
            Diffused in 4th two days . . 3.26 grs.
   The diffusion appears to proceed pretty uniformly, if the
amount diffused in the first period of two days be excepted.
Each of the phials contained at first about 108 grs. of salt, of
which the maximum quantity diffused is 13-12 grs. in eight
           l
days, or # of the whole salt. Still the diffusion must neces
sarily follow a diminishing progression, which would be
brought out by continuing the process for longer time, and
appear at the earliest period in the salt of most rapid diffusion.
   All the experiments which follow being made like the pre
ceding on comparatively large volumes of solution in the phial,
and for equally short periods of seven or eight days, may be
looked upon as exhibiting pretty accurately the initial diffusion

            Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.                    189
of such solutions, the influence of the diminishing progression
being still small. The volume of water in the water-iar is
also relatively so large, that the experiment approaches to the
condition of diffusion into an Unlimited Atmosphere.
        2. Diffusion of various Salts and other Substances.
    With these notions regarding the influence of temperature
and proportion of salt on the amount of diffusion, an exami
nation was next undertaken of the relative diffusibility of a
variety of salts and other substances. The results of this first
survey I shall state as shortly as possible, as I consider these,
 as well as the experiments which preceded, as of a preliminary
 character. The experiments were all made by means of the
 diffusion phials already described, namely, the six-ounce
 phials, and with similar manipulations.
     In the following experiments, the diffusion took place at a
 temperature ranging from 62° to 59°, mean 60°-5, and was
 continued for a period of eight days; the proportion of salt in
 solution to be diffused being always 20 salt to 100 water, or
 1 to 5. I add as usual the density of the solutions.

      The following additional ratios of diffusion were obtained
  from similar solutions at a somewhat lower temperature,
  namely 48°;—chloride of sodium 100, hydrate of potash
   151.93, ammonia (from a 10 per cent. solution, saturated with
   chloride of sodium to increase its density) 70, alcohol (satu
   rated with chloride of sodium) 75-74, chloride of calcium
   71°23, acetate of lead 45-46.

 190        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids,
    Where two experiments upon the same salt are recorded
 in the table they are seen to correspond to within l part in
 40, which may be considered as the limit of error in the pre
 sent observations.     It will be remarked that the diffusion of
 cane- and starch-sugar is sensibly equal, and double that of
 gum-arabic. On the other hand, the sugars have less than
 half the diffusibility of chloride of sodium. It is remarkable
 that the specifically lightest and densest solutions, those of the
 sugars and of sulphate of magnesia, approach each other
 closely in diffusibility. On comparing together, however, two
 substances of similar constitution, such as the two salts, chlo
 ride of sodium and sulphate of magnesia, that salt appears to
 be least diffusive of which the solution is densest.
    But the most remarkable result is the diffusion of albumen,
 which is low out of all proportion when compared with Saliné
 bodies. The solution employed was the albumen of the egg,
 without dilution, but strained through calico and deprived of
 all vesicular matter. As this liquid, with a density of 1.041,
 contained only 14.69 parts of dry matter to 100 of water, the
 proportion diffused is increased in the table to that for 2
  arts, to correspond with the other substances.     In its natural
 alkaline state the albumen is least diffusive; but when neutral
 ized by acetic acid, a slight precipitation takes place and the
 liquid filters more easily. The albumen is now sensibly more
 diffusive than before. Chloride of sodium appears 20 times
 more diffusible than albumen in the table, but the disparity is
 really greater; for nearly one-half of the matter which diffused
consisted of inorganic salts. Indeed the experiment appears to
promise a delicate method of proximate analysis peculiarly
adapted for animal fluids. The value of this low diffusibility
in retaining the serous or albuminous fluids within the blood
vessels at once suggests itself.
    Similar results were obtained with egg albumen diluted and
well-beaten with 1 and 2 volumes of water.          The solution
diluted with an equal bulk of water, and made slightly acid
with acetic acid, contained 7% dry matter to 100 water. Dif
fused from two four-ounce bottles of 1:25 inch aperture, for
seven days, at a mean temperature of 43°5 F., it gave pro
ducts of 1.73 and 1:48 gr., from the evaporation of two water
jars, in which cubic crystals of common salt were abundant.
The whole matter thus diffused in two cells was found to con
sist of

   The diffusion product of the same solution of albumen left
alkaline, or without the addition of acetic acid, in the same

                                                   261 grs.
   The diffusion product of a solution of 74 parts of chloride
of sodium to 100 water, from similar cells and for the same
time and temperature, would amount to about 30 grs. of salt.
It is to be remarked also that 5:53 grs. of the ignited salt dif
fused from albumen contained 1:32 gr. of potash or 23.9 per
cent, which is a high proportion, and indicates that salts of
potash diffuse out more freely from albumen than salts of soda.
   Nor does albumen impair the diffusion of salts dissolved
together with it in the same solution, although the liquid re
tains its viscosity. Three other substances, added separately
in the proportion 5 parts to 100 of the undiluted solution of
egg albumen, were found to diffuse out quite as freely from
that liquid as they did from an equal volume of pure water:
these were chloride of sodium, urea and sugar. Urea proved
to be a highly diffusible substance. It nearly coincided in
rate with chloride of sodium.
   A second series of salts were diffused containing 1 part of
salt to 10 of water; a smaller proportion of salt which admits
of the comparison of a greater variety of salts. The tempe
rature during the period of eight days was remarkably uni
form, 60°–59°.

    The near equality of the quantities diffused of certain iso
morphous salts is striking at both temperatures. Chloride of
potassium and chloride of ammonium give 40° 15 and 40°:20
grs. respectively in the first table. Nitrate of potash and ni
trate of ammonia 35-55 (mean) and 35°.3 grs. respectively in
the first table, and 28.70 and 29' 19 grs. in the second table.
Sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of zinc 15:45 and 15.8 grs.
(means) in the first table, with 13:07 and 1260 grs. in the
second.    The relation observed is the more remarkable, that it
is that of equal weights of the salts diffused, and not of atomi
cally equivalent weights. In the salts of ammonia and potash,
this equality of diffusion is exhibited also, notwithstanding con
siderable differences in density between their solutions; the
density of the solution of chloride of ammonium, for instance,
being 1:0280 and that of chloride of potassium 1:0596. It
may have some relation however, but not a simple one, to the
density of the solutions; sulphate of magnesia, of which the
solution is most dense, being most slowly diffusive; and salts
of soda being slower, as they are generally denser in solution,
than the corresponding salts of potash. Nor does it depend

    A comparison was now made of the diffusibility of several
acids. They were diffused from the same six-ounce phials,
and for eight days. Solutions were prepared in the proportion
of 4 parts of the anhydrous acid to 100 parts of water. The
quantity of acid which diffused into the water-jar was estimated
by the proportion of carbonate of soda which it neutralized.

    Considerable latitude thus appears to exist in the diffusibi
lity of the different acids. To make the result for nitric acid
fairly comparable with that for hydrochloric acid, the former
should be increased in the proportion of 54 to 63, that is esti
mated as nitrate of water. This calculation gives 33.5 grs.
of nitrate of water diffused, which approaches closely to 34.1
grs., the quantity for chloride of hydrogen or hydrochloric
acid. The quantity of soda neutralized by the sulphuric and
hydrochloric acids diffused was as 14:32 to 28'97, or nearly
as 1 to 2. Sulphuric and acetic acids, on the other hand,
appear to be equally diffusible. Phosphoric acid is the least
diffusible acid in the series, presenting only about half the
diffusion product of the two last-mentioned acids. The solu
tion of phosphoric acid had been boiled for half an hour be
fore diffusion, and was therefore in the tribasic state.                                         The
same precaution was not thought of for arsenic acid, although
it is possibly required by this acid also. These two acids do
not exhibit the equality of diffusion anticipated from their
recognized isomorphism, but it is to be stated that the acidi

metrical method of analysis followed is not so properly appli
cable to these two acids as it is to all the others.
           3. Diffusion of Ammoniated Salts of Copper.
   It was interesting to compare together such related salts as
sulphate of copper, the ammoniated sulphate of copper or
soluble compound of sulphate of copper with 2 equivs. of am
monia and the sulphate of ammonia. It is well known that
metallic oxides, or subsalts of metallic oxides, when dissolved
in ammonia or the fixed alkalies, are easily taken down by
animal charcoal. This does not happen with the ordinary
neutral salts of the same acids, which are held in solution by
a strong attraction. Supposing the existence of a scale of the
solvent attraction of water, the preponderance of the charcoal
attraction will mark a term in that scale.                     And if the solvent
force is nothing more than the diffusive tendency, it will follow
that salts which can be taken down by charcoal must be less
diffusible than those which cannot.
   Of sulphate of ammonia and sulphate of copper, solutions
were prepared, consisting of 4 anhydrous salt to 100 water,
the sulphate of ammonia being of course taken as NH4O, SO”.
The solution of the copper salt was divided into two portions,
one of which had caustic ammonia added to it in slight excess,
so as to produce the azure blue solution of ammonio-sulphate
of copper.
  The solutions were diffused for eight days, at a mean tem
perature of 64°-9 for the sulphates and nitrates, and 67°7 for
the chlorides.

    It is to be observed, that in preparing the ammoniated salts,
the solutions of the neutral salts of copper were slightly diluted
by the water of the solution of ammonia added to them, so
that the proportion of salt of copper which they possessed was
sensibly reduced below 4 per cent. On the other hand, the
copper salt which diffused out is estimated, not as ammoni
ated, but as neutral salt. It will be observed that the quantity
of sulphate of copper diffused out in the experiments falls from
6:35 in the neutral salt to 1.44 gr. in the ammoniated salt;
of nitrate of copper from 9:77 to 1:56, and of chloride of cop
per from 10:65 to 4'24. These numbers are to be taken only
as approximations; they are sufficient however to prove a
much reduced diffusibility in the ammoniated salts of copper.
    It will be remarked that the nitrate of ammonia and chlo
ride of ammonium approximate, 15-80 and 16:59 grs.; as do
also the nitrate and chloride of copper, 9.77 and 10.65 grs. ;
the chlorides, which were diffused at the higher temperature
by 2°8, exceeding the nitrates in both cases.
                     4. Diffusion of Miwed Salts.
    When two salts can be mixed without combining, it is to
be expected that they will diffuse separately and independently
of each other, each salt following its special rate of diffusion.
    (1.) Anhydrous sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of water
(oil of vitriol), one part of each, were dissolved together in 10
parts of water, and the solution allowed to diffuse for four
days at 61°5.
    The water-jar was found to have acquired—
              Sulphate of magnesia . . .       5-60 grs.
             Sulphate of water . . . . 21.92 grs.
                                              27.52 grs.
    The experiment with the same diffusion cell and liquid
being continued for a second period, this time of eight days,
 there was found to be simultaneously diffused, of
              Sulphate of magnesia . . . 9°46 grs.
              Sulphate of water . . . . 29-32 grs.
                                              38°78 grs.
     It is obvious that the inequality should be greatest in the
 first period of diffusion, or with the initial diffusion, as it ac
 tually appears above, and become less and less sensible as the
proportion of the low diffusive salt comes to be increased in
 the solution phial.
     In former experiments upon the solution of sulphate of
                                 O 2

196        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
magnesia alone in water, as 1 salt to 10 water, compared with
sulphate of water, also as 1 to 10, the disparity in the diffusion
of these two salts was less considerable, being only as 1 to
2-385, instead of 1 to 3 or 4.
   (2.) A solution was also diffused of 1 part of anhydrous
sulphate of soda and 1 part of chloride of sodium in 10 parts
of water, for four days at 61°5. The salt which diffused out
in that time consisted of—
           Sulphate of soda . . . .           9'48 grs.
           Chloride of sodium      . . .     17-80 grs.
                                             27-28 grs.
   The sulphate of soda in the last experiment had begun to
crystallize in the solution phial, from a slight fall of tempera
ture, before the diffusion was interrupted, a circumstance
which may have contributed to increase the inequality of the
proportions diffused of these two salts.
   (3.) A solution of equal weights of anhydrous carbonate of
soda and chloride of sodium, namely, of 4 parts of the one
salt and 4 parts of the other, to 100 water, was diffused from
3 four-ounce phials of 1:25 inch aperture, at a mean tempe
rature of 57°-9 and for seven days. The diffusion product
amounted to 17:10, 17°58 and 18°13 grs. of mixed salt in the
three experiments. The analysis of the last product of 18:13
grs. gave—
        Carbonate of soda .      .  .   5.68         31°33
        Chloride of sodium       .  .  12:45         68-67
                                       18-13       100'00
   Here the carbonate of soda presents a diffusion less than
one-half of that of chloride of sodium. The difference is again
greater than the peculiar diffusibilities of the same salts as
they appear when the salts are separately diffused. For in
experiments made in the same phials with solutions of 4 parts
of each salt singly to 100 water, but with a lower temperature
by 3°6, namely, at 54°3, the diffusion product of the carbo
nate of soda was 7-17 and 7:34 grs. in two experiments, of
which the mean is 7.25 grs. ; while the diffusion product of
the chloride of sodium was 11:18 and 10.73 grs. in two expe
riments, of which the mean is 10.95 grs. The quantity of
chloride of sodium diffused being taken at 100 in both sets of
experiments, we have diffused—
   Of carbonate of soda 66:18, when diffused singly.
   Of carbonate of soda 45-64, when diffused with chloride of
sodium.

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.          197
   The least soluble of the two salts appears in all cases to
have its diffusibility lessened in the mixed state. The ten
dency to crystallization of the least soluble salt must evidently
be increased by the admixture. Now it is this tendency, or
perhaps more generally the increased attraction of the particles
of a salt for each other, when approximated by concentration,
which most resists the diffusion of a salt, and appears to
weaken the diffusive force in mixtures, as it is also found to
do so in a strong solution of a single salt.
   (4.) Equal weights of nitrates of potash and ammonia dis
solved, as in certain preceding experiments, in five times the
weight of the mixed salts of water, and diffused for eight days,
gave in two experiments—
                                       At 59°4.    At 52° 6.
        Nitrate of potash    .   . . 28.39          25'88
        Nitrate of ammonia       .  .   36-16       30°36
                                        64°55       56'24.
   The inequality in the diffusion of these two nitrates is sin
gular, considering that in solutions of 1 salt to 10 water, they
appeared before to be equally diffusive. But on now com
paring the diffusion of solutions of 1 salt to 5 water, at 52°6,
the salts no longer diffused in equal proportions:—
              Nitrate of potash gave . 57-93 grs.
              Nitrate of ammonia gave 82.08 grs.
   The solution of nitrate of potash last diffused was nearly a
saturated one, while that of nitrate of ammonia is far from
being so. The first has its diffusibility, in consequence, im
paired, and falls considerably below the second.
   The relatively diminished diffusibility of sulphate of mag
nesia, when associated with sulphate of water, is probably
connected with a similar circumstance; sulphate of magnesia
being less soluble in dilute sulphuric acid than in pure water.
   (5.) The salt which diffused from a strong solution of sul
phates of zinc and magnesia, consisting of I part of each of
these salts in the anhydrous state and 6 parts of water, did
not consist of the two salts in exactly equal proportions. The
mixture of salts, diffused for eight days, as in the late experi
ments, gave the following results:—
                -              Exp. I.        II.        III.
      Sulphate of zinc . . 8-12              7-49       8-12
      Sulphate of magnesia 8.68              8°60       8.75
                               16-80        16'09      16'87
   There is therefore always a slight but decided preponde
rance of sulphate of magnesia, the more soluble salt, in the

diffusion product. These last experiments were made at an
early period with another object in view, namely, to ascertain
whether in closely related salts, such as the present sulphates
of magnesia and zinc, the two salts might be elastic to each
other, like the particles of one and the same salt, so that one
salt might possibly suppress the diffusion of the other, and
diffuse alone for both. The experiments lend no support to
such an idea.
   It appears from all the preceding experiments, that the in
equality of diffusion which existed, is not diminished but ex
aggerated in mixtures, a curious circumstance, which has also
been observed of mixed gases.

AS      I have had frequent occasion to speak of Dr. Matthew
        Stewart in the earlier portion of these papers, it will be
proper here to make one statement more.
   From the character of his General Theorems, I have long
entertained the opinion that Dr. Stewart had discovered a
considerable number of Porisms besides those printed in his
book, and the two he gave to Dr. Simson. The description
of his MSS. given by Playfair, in his memoir of that illus
trious geometer, led me to believe that it would be possible
to make out not only the propositions but likewise their de
monstrations, somewhat in the manner that I did with the
 Porismatic part of his General Theorems in the Edinburgh
Transactions a few years ago. I consequently applied to
an eminent mathematical archaeologist to obtain for me infor
mation as to what had become of those papers, and whether they
 were accessible for such a purpose. In a short time he sent me
 the copy of a letter from the proper custodian of the papers,
 decisive on this head. They are all destroyed—deliberately
 burnt; and not only his, but likewise all the MSS. of his son
 Dugald Stewart. Into the motives for this act, which its perpe
 trator offers, I will not enter; and shall only state that he was a
 descendant of those two men whose writings he has thus irre
 trievably destroyed. I have thought it desirable to put upon
 record this fact: for though public indignation will not restore
 the lost treasures, it may prevent others from imitating the
 incendiary.
    A great portion of the correspondence with Nourse and
                      * Communicated by the Author.

        Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.                199
his successor Wingrave is of the most ordinary business cha
racter. ... This might be expected. A few passages even in the
dreary list of £ s. d. are not without interest.
    For instance, the price of authorship:—Mr. John Landen
thus writes (Aug. 28, 1758) to Nourse, after describing his
“Residual Analysis:”—
   “I would have it very elegantly printed in quarto, (with Wood or
Tin Cuts) upon such paper and with such letter as my Lucubrations.
If you chuse to purchase the copy you shall have it for less than I
would take of any other person.
   “The subject is very interesting, and I p ... ne [illegible—pre
sume?] a considerable number will be speedily sold; therefore ex
pect you will not give me less than two Guineas per sheet. How
ever I shall leave it to you to pay me according as it shall sell.”
   It proved here, as it often does, that an author is himself
the very worst judge of what will “sell.” Nobody but system
atic collectors of classes of books, knows anything of Lan
den's Discourse on the Residual Analysis, except accidentally
by mere name. The philosophy of Landen “never took;”
and the truths delivered, or professedly deduced by means of
it, were neither new nor in any way remarkable. Still the
book was not without merit; nor the author destitute of very
high mathematical powers. He was not, however, deficient
in the amour propre; but, on the contrary, was remarkable
for carrying out the principle to an extreme degree.
    Dr. Gregory (who from being “bred and born" in the
neighbourhood of Peterborough was likely to be well ac
quainted with the gossip of the place) has informed me that
 Landen was a man of “imposing presence and imperious man
 ners.” He was steward to Earl Fitzwilliam, for that nobleman’s
 Northamptonshire estates. The then countess, who appears
 to have much disliked the bearing of the steward, described
 an interview between him and her liege lord, as that “between
 Lord Landen and his steward Mr. Fitzwilliam.”
    Landen was perhaps the only non-academic mathematician
 F.R.S., who did not join with Horsley, Hutton, and the other
 seceders from the Royal Society on the accession of Sir
 Joseph Banks to the chair.         Philosophy in the Society had
 then degenerated into Faction: a sort of scientific imitation
 of Whig-and-Toryism. The contest was one of partisanship,
 and it was conducted in the true spirit of political party.
 The naturalists have censured the mathematicians, and the
 mathematicians the naturalists, for their conduct in that dis
  creditable dispute. The question has descended even to our

 200      Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
 own day; and it has very recently been mooted in the Philo
  sophical Magazine. It was a scene which showed undeniably
  the decadence of the philosophic spirit in the Society, rather
  than the overriding of one branch of science by another;
 although it has been almost uniformly represented that the
  “mathematical sciences were ousted from the Society by the
 overwhelming influence of the naturalists.” The terms them
 selves were mere symbols of party: but we are not to assume
 that mathematical science was excluded from the Society be
 cause Dr. Horsley was foiled in his aspirations for the Chair,
 and Dr. Hutton divested of the Foreign Secretaryship. The
  “little band ” overrated their influence in the Society; and
 the time is come when some definite idea of their mathematical
 powers and pretensions can be formed, quite independently
 of factious prejudices. It would be well, therefore, to judge
 the question apart from all party considerations.
     That Horsley had as good a claim to the Chair as Banks,
 there is no doubt: but he attempted to carry his purpose on
 fictitious grounds—as the representative of the mathematical
 section of the Society. That his claims, however, were not
 overwhelming, but only comparative with those of his compe
 titor, no mathematician will now venture to assert. Every
 work he published is “ completely shelved,” and no one, I
 believe, reached a second edition. His name indeed is only
 remembered in scientific circles by his connexion with these
 unhappy disputes. That his supporters and fellow-sece
 ders were so many Newtons and Halleys, who will assert,
 even though the names of Maskelyne, Maseres and Hutton
were on that list? Waring, Milner, Landen and others, kept
aloof from all share in such a partisan-system of enforcing the
superiority of the mathematical sciences over those of obser
Vation.
    So much has been said on the other side that it does not
become me to speak upon it. I am no judge of the scientific
merits of the actors in it. Of the long period of “misrule”
which followed, I have only to say that something of the kind
might have been expected: the reign of “naturalism” was the
reign of actual conquest—the conquest of a faction bearing
one symbol over another faction bearing another symbol.
Perhaps the political condition of Ireland at this moment is
only the same history on a larger scale.
    I have been tempted into this long digression, from the
consideration that it is high time that disputes of so long
standing should be looked at apart from the symbols of the
respective parties—symbols to which the actors on either side
had little claim. It is certainly absurd enough that because

         Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.               201
two sets of aspiring parties quarreled “over a bone” some
eighty years ago, that men who cultivate two very difficult
and ever-expanding sciences, should now look upon each other
 with jealousy, because those two factions assumed the names
of these two sciences as the symbols of their factions. Even
as regards the suppression or publication of papers in the
 Philosophical Transactions, it will be more frequently found
that any impropriety has arisen from the influence of persons
pursuing the same science than the opposite one—at any rate
 the alleged impropriety.
    Another writer proposes to Nourse to take a work on his
 own hands, under the title of Syntagma Analyseos: or a New
Introduction to the Mathematics. After a laudatory account
 of himself, he gives the contents, and concludes with the fol
lowing:—
   “As I often write to the Diaries, Magazines &c. under various
fictitious appellations, I may thereby forward its sale by recommend
ing or quoting it.”
   The method of indirect puffing was not unknown even
then | Till I met with this letter, however, I had taken the
name of the writer (Malachy Hitchins, Exeter College, Ox
ford) to be itself fictitious. His contributions (at least under
his own name) are respectable for the time, though none of
them bespeak powers far above mediocrity. I do not think
that Nourse was taken with the bait of his “recommending”
his own book; and indeed I have no knowledge of its having
been published at all.
   The following passage is only curious as showing a mathe
matician's notions of amusement. It is from a printed pro
posal to publish by subscription a “Complete Course of Ma
thematics” in 96 sixpenny numbers; the scheme of which
was abandoned, and the MS. offered to Nourse, who also ap
pears to have declined it.
   “Even to those who peruse books for amusement, the author
ventures to recommend this work, presuming that more real enter
tainment, much more genuine satisfaction must flow from it, than
can arise from an insignificant romance or fictitious tale, which serve
chiefly to vitiate the taste and corrupt the morals.”
   This is dated Newcastle 1770, and the author is John Da
vidson—a mathematician of great local note, and of some ge
neral reputation in those days.

 202       Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
    A letter from Mr. Andrew Marshall, dated Dover, Oct. 9,
 1773, contains a proposal to Nourse to take a translation of
 the first three books of Simsoni Sect. Con., or a complete
 translation of the whole work, if Nourse should prefer it. The
 letter is valuable in one respect, as giving a reason for this
 proposal.
    “It was at the request of Dr. Matthew Stewart and Dr. William
 son professor of Mathematics in the University of Glasgow, that I
 undertook that translation: and the reason why they interested
 themselves in it was, that they thought their colleges were not so
 well attended, while the students were obliged to read a latin book
 on so abstruse a subject, as they would be, was the text book in
 English and at a lower price.”
    The translation—at least so I judge, but at any rate a trans
 lation—was published in Edinburgh by Charles Elliott, in
 1775. Nourse's name does not appear among the London
 publishers on the title-page. It had been well for English
 science if all the books that Simson and Stewart ever wrote
 had been printed in our own language.
   Trinity College, Dublin, has been, perhaps, the most tena
 cious adherent to the use of Latin in its lectures, exercises and
responsions. Amongst the works published for the use of that
college was Dr. Hugh Hamilton’s Sectiones Conica, 4to, 1758,
in Latin. This work, however, though compulsorily read in
college, was otherwise slow in its sale—much slower indeed
than its great merit would have led us to expect. In a letter
to Nourse in 1768, he says, “there were 600 copies printed,
and about 100 of them remained ’’ then in Dublin; whilst he
speaks of 230 copies in the hands of Johnston, the London
publisher. These last, with the copper-plates and copyright,
he offers to Nourse, and ultimately appears to have sold them
to him, with all else relating to the work, for two shillings
per volume, though he says the print alone cost him more
than three shillings per copy. He adds:—
   “You were certainly right in supposing that the treatise would
have sold much better had it been written in English, for Johnston
told me two years after it was published that he was sure he might
in that time have sold almost the whole impression had it not been
in latin. This makes me imagine that when you get the Property
of Work (and the copperplates which cost me 204.) it may be worth
your while to publish a Translation sometime hence, a Person of
tolerable skill would translate such a Book as easily as he could
transcribe it.”
   He then goes on to mention the additions he would make

         Mr. T, S, Davies on Geometry and Geometers.                203
to it, in the form of an appendix, when translated. This, how
ever, in a subsequent letter he proposes to replace by a few
occasional scholia. Nourse appears to have sent him the
translation in MS.; which, though so easy to make, he con
sidered to be very faulty, and an amended translation in its
turn was only somewhat less faulty. It ended in two Trinity
men, who were reading for fellowships, recommended by
Dr. Hamilton, being employed. Their remuneration was ten
guineas |
   The following is one of the most singular facts, perhaps, in
Irish Church history:—
   “Let him [his friend Matthew Raper] know I would write to him
had I any thing worth communicating, further than one thing (which
I know his friendship to me will make him pleased with) that I have
very fortunately and without any solicitation of mine got the Deanery
of Armagh, the best preferment in our Church under a Bishoprick and
equal in value to some of them.” (Letter, Ap. 30, 1768.)
   The worthy Dean views his good fortune under a sufficiently
worldly aspect: and a fair share of worldly tact is shown in
the following extract from another of his letters (Nov. 23,
1772):—
   “It is proper to observe to you that the Euclid to which my cita
tions refer is Whiston's latin edition of Tacquet's Euclid. And I think
it will be proper to apprize the reader of this at the end of the Trans
lator's Preface, for I am of your opinion that such a preface will be
absolutely necessary, since you cannot avoid saying in the Titlepage,
Translated from the Latin. I think you or any one that is acquainted
with the work might very easily write such a preface; as nothing
more would be necessary than to say that the following Treatise
written in Latin was published at such a time and has since been
so well received by the learned that the Professors in the several uni
versities in England and Ireland have used and recommended it in
preference to all others on the same Subject, and therefore the
Translator thought that an English Edition would be an acceptable
Present to the Public in a Country where so many had distinguished
themselves by their great proficiency in mathematical studies tho
they had not much cultivated the learned languages. He might
then (to show he had read other works of this kind) mention some of
the Particulars in which he thought this work had the advantage of
others. He might say some thing in general of the Method or plan
upon which the Author proceeds, and his manner of executing it,
and then for a further account of the method refer the Reader to the
Author's Preface which follows.
   “I have only mentioned these hints to show what a Preface of
this sort usually contains and that there can be no great difficulty in
 drawing it up.    And I dare say if you were to write to Mr. Wil
liamson or any other Teacher who has read the Book and communi

204       Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
 cate these hints as your own thoughts, and request his assistance he
 would very soon draw up a Preface to your purpose, and you might
 have it in your power to oblige him again.”
    “Secrets in all trades but mine !” The learned author and
 the liberal bookseller combine to represent a mere speculation
 of their own as the act and judgement of the “translator,”—
that invisible, if not imaginary, personage of all ages as well
aS Our OWn.
    It does not appear who did draw up the “translator's pre
face:” but it is executed pretty closely in accordance with the
above prescription; and some changes are introduced into the
text as suggested by Dr. Hamilton, which form real improve
 ments upon an already valuable treatise.
    It seems somewhat strange that Dr. Abram Robertson
should print a ponderous 4to in seven books, only a few years
after (1792), also in Latin, and very much on the same plan
as those of Simson and Hamilton, though more closely imita
ting the latter. The necessity that was felt, even by authors
and publishers, for putting the scientific works they issued in
a language which could be read by all, had produced no in
fluence at Oxford; but even there it was ultimately felt to be
absolutely necessary to give an English edition of at least a
part of the work, which was accordingly done in 8vo a few
years afterwards.
    Even Euclid was recently read in Latin in the Dublin Col
lege; but as it has since been translated, I presume it is
now * read there in English. Dr. Elrington's edition, which is
there used, differs a good deal from Simson's, but most of all
in the treatment of proportion: but I only refer to it here as
another instance of the paramount necessity for writing all
books on science in our vernacular tongue.
    By some letters from the Rev. Francis Holliday, Rector of
West Marsham, Notts, it appears that the price paid for the
copyright of that gentleman's Fluxions was twenty-three
guineas; that is, one guinea per sheet. (Letter to Nourse, con
   * Since this was written, a Dublin friend whom I had asked about the
motive for the retention of Latin as the medium of so much of the Trinity
College exercises, “wonders where I could have met with so antiquated a
thing as a Latin Euclid used in the College.” My own copy is marked
“ editio quarta, 1813.” The Latin appears to be still the medium of ex
amination for the junior fellowships; though (judging from the Dublin
University Calendar) dispensed with in the degree examinations. This
traditionary practice is hence gradually “wearing out " even in its last
stronghold; and certainly in the case of fellowship examinations, less ex
ception can be taken to the practice, than in the case of degrees, whether in
honours or not.

taining a statement of accounts, Nov. 22, 1777.) He asked
thirty guineas, and estimated it at seventeen or eighteen sheets;
see letter, Sept. 26, 1776. Fluxions were cheap then, but
they command no price at all now.
    It may be worth noticing, that Dealtry’s is the last book
published with the name and notation of Fluxions in this
country; but Jephson's the last with the name only, having
the notation of Leibnitz instead of Newton's; the former in
two successive editions, and the latter in two volumes issued
at different times.       The eleventh edition of Hutton's Course
is, however, the last English book in which either the
name or notation appeared (1835, 1837); and though I
strongly urged upon Dr. Gregory, who acted as principal
editor of that edition, the necessity for a change, I failed to
convince him. This was the more inexplicable to me, as he
had for many years admitted the language and notation of the
Differential Calculus (though, perhaps, not its metaphysics)
into the Ladies’ Diary, of which he was the editor. It first
appears in 1824 in the Diary”. His argument for retaining
it in Hutton’s Course was, that Dr. Hutton himself would
have insisted on its retention; and he felt himself bound in
honour to make no further changes in that work than the
author himself would have made under the same circum
stances, and with a full knowledge of the state of mathematical
science in 1836. As I am personally interested in this ques
tion, I may be allowed to state that I consider that view to
have been a mistaken one; and that a resolute adherence to
what it was supposed Dr. Hutton would have done, has driven
the work “out of the market.” The ultimate changes made
in it came too late; and yet no man was more eminently qua
lified to make them than Dr. Gregory.
    It appears from letters written in 1811 to Wingrave (suc
cessor to Nourse) by Miss Maskelyne, that the Greenwich ob
servations were the private property of Dr. Maskelyne. They
are claimed as such; and Sir Joseph Banks's authority is
quoted in support of it. Yet the Board of Admiralty paid

 Differential Calculus into this Country by an eminent anonymé, and by Mr.
Wilkinson, in the Mechanics’ Magazine for 1849. It may, however, be
remarked, that Dr. Gregory introduced the differential notation into his
Trigonometry (using the 8 instead of the d) as far back as 1816; and that
to the edition of Hutton's Course of (vol. ii.) 1837, he gave a translation,
literally, of a portion of Lubbe's treatise. I am not able at this moment to
give the dates of either Dealtry’s or Jephson’s works; but the former
ranged somewhere from 1812 to 1814, and the latter a little before and
 after 1820,

for paper, print, instruments, and a salary for making those
observations ! Many strange affairs, however, have occurred
with respect to books printed by the Admiralty; to some of
which I may hereafter direct more particular attention—rela
ting, of course, to “by-gone days.”
    It seems that even 80 or 100 years ago the booksellers pub
lished a good deal “on commission ” for the authors: but
they do not seem to have carried this kind of business to the
extent that we see it in our day, nor to have charged quite so
heavily for their services as we now find to be the case. Nor
do they appear to have been so eager for that kind of business
as their successors have become.
    A Mr. John Wright of Edinburgh, a friend of Marshall's,
sent 100 copies of a work on Trigonometry (intended as a
supplement to Simson's Euclid) to Nourse in 1772 for sale,
In 1783 it appears that copies to the amount of six guineas
had been sold; and that the “charges” against this were
three pounds seventeen shillings |
    Many large works that have appeared were first published
by public subscription. Usher's Astronomy, Vince's Astro
nomy, Horsley's Newton *, Taylor's Tables, and some others,
are matters relative to which there is more or less correspond
ence in this mass of papers. A memorandum by Wingrave
respecting one work, the name of which I cannot decipher, is
“not enough sold to pay the advertisements.”
    Several papers of Emerson’s occur amongst Mr. Maynard's
collection, but none of them of much scientific importance;
and, indeed, all that is of any value was subsequently incor
porated with his published works. His books are even now
ubiquitous, and his name is familiar to every tongue; and
hence quotation would be idly superfluous. In fact, but for
the purpose of correcting a very general popular error with
respect to him, his name might have been altogether omitted
from these papers.
    Emerson wrote nearly twenty works in all, and upon all
subjects, into the service of which such mathematics as he
possessed could by any contrivance be pressed—from arith
metic to increments, fluxions, mechanics, architecture, music
   * It appears from a printed list that Horsley had obtained 369 subscri
bers : crowned heads, nobility, personages in high civil and diplomatic
offices, university and college libraries—in short, the élite of Europe. A
less pompous and less pretending editor (though as competent to the un
dertaking, as Horsley was confessedly incompetent) must have sought his
patrons elsewhere, and have been satisfied with a smaller number of them.

and chronology. A few of his works (and few only) display
a certain amount of rough invention: but he was singularly
confused in his development of a process, and one of the most
uncouth of all the mathematical writers of this country. It is
very probable that, abating the Method of Increments (which
owed its value to its being then the only one in our language,
Dr. Brook Taylor's being in Latin and untranslated), his
most useful works have been the Elements of Geometry and
the Conic Sections.           The former contains a few theorems
which are, as far as I know, original *; and the latter is va
   * It is often extremely difficult to decide respecting originality in ele
mentary investigations; for no one can undertake to look carefully through
every elementary book that has been published, to ascertain whether some
K.           and simple proposition might not possibly be contained in it.
  evertheless some general criteria might be laid down, which would contri
bute towards probability on one side or another in most cases; and this
presumed probability would often limit the trouble of the search to very
marrow bounds. Almost every proposition naturally refers itself to a class;
and if once observed, others of that class must soon follow. If, then, upon
our observing such a proposition we find it isolated, it is highly probable
that it originated with the author who there gave it, or at least not long
before. In the few cases which I have had occasion to examine minutely
and carefully, I have rarely found this rule to fail—indeed, in no one to
signally fail. This, too, is precisely the same in respect to analytical de
vices—and not widely different is the testimony of the history of experi
mental science.
   This remark is made in consequence of a property of the triangle, now
universally known, which appears to have been first given in an elementary
treatise by Emerson (Geom., b. ii. pr. 32, 1763). “The perpendiculars
from the angular points of a triangle to the opposite sides, pass through
the same point.” The property was, however, enunciated by Mr. Thomas
Moss, an exciseman and able geometer, in 1751; and two neat demonstra
tions given to it shortly after by a writer who signs SOBOX (probably
Simpson), and by Edward Rollinson, in Turner’s Mathematical Exercises.
A property still more general had been given four or five years previously
in the Mathematician, edited by Rollinson. The less general property
was not, however, perceived to be deducible from the more general one,
and both passed without further remark than the mere solutions till atten
tion was called to the system of connected inquiries in the Mathematical
Repository (vol. vi.), under one aspect; and under another in the Phil.
Mag., vol. ii. p. 26, 2nd Ser., and the appendix to the Ladies’ Diary, 1835.
   It may seem strange that so simple a property, and so many others similar
or related to it, should have been unobserved by the antients, and by their
earlier followers after the revival of letters.  It must be recollected, how
ever, that the Greek geometers only valued a theorem (or even a Porism)
except so far as it contributed to the solution of a problem. There are
no traces, nor even intimations, of their having regularly attempted to form
classed collections of theorems, or to arrange systematically the many
beautiful series of properties of figures that could not fail to have presented
themselves during the solution of problems. Such properties were only
selected as would be actually required in demonstrating the constructions
of the cases of a problem. Of these the seventh book of Pappus is a col
lection of instances. The properties of the épôm\ov given by him, form

luable for the great number of properties which the author
 has brought together, of which a fair portion were original.
 As geometry, however, both works are extremely impure, every
 geometrical difficulty being unceremoniously got over by an
 algebraical equation—a practice only too common amongst
 the so-called geometrical writers of our own time. This,
 however, is not the geometry bequeathed us by the Greeks,
and exemplified by the Andersons, the Gregories, the Halleys,
the Simsons, and the Stewarts of these isles.
    The popular error to which I referred is, that Emerson
was the Coryphaeus of the non-academic class of geometers.
He has never been recognized by themselves as the head, the
founder, or the leader of their class; but I suppose the fre
quency of his books on the stalls has led men little acquainted
with the history of English geometry to infer that they either
are, or have been, in great demand, and consulted as oracles.
This never-ending reappearance is more due to the almost
indestructible paper on which they were printed, and the firm
bindings in which they were issued, than to any other cause;
as very few of them ever reached a second edition, and a
great number lay on the bookseller's hands at the time of
Emerson's death. They were pushed into notice by the per
almost the only marked exception—or perhaps also Euclid's Porisms. We
find at all events, extremely little (if anything, properly speaking) concern
ing lines meeting in a point, or points ranging in a straight line. The
modern French geometers were the first to enter upon this class of re
searches with any degree of system; and the results have justified their
expectations, however sanguine. We need not then, after all, feel much
surprise at finding the proposition in question claiming so recent a place in
fºy and the same may be said of a great number of now-familiar
truths.
   Postscript, August 24–Whilst reading the proof sheets, the Mechanics’
Magazine of this date reached me, containing one of Mr. Wilkinson’s able
and elaborate analyses of our English mathematical periodicals, viz. of the
Miscellanea Curiosa Mathematica, 1745–53, edited by Holliday, whose
name has been already mentioned. As there is one passage which renders
a slight modification of the preceding paragraph necessary, I quote it as it
stands—from its offering less trouble, both to myself and the printer at the
last moment, than recomposition and resetting would do.
   Speaking of art. xxxix., “A new Proposition in Geometry demonstrated,
by Mr. William Chapple,” he says:–
   “This proposition is the now well-known property, that ‘the three per
pendiculars of any triangle intersect in the same point,’ and although taken
for granted in the solutions of Quest. 45 Gentleman's Diary for 1743–44;
Quest. 260 Ladies' Diary, 1745–46, the honour of a formal enunciation
and demonstration appears to be due to Mr. Chapple. The property is
stated both for the acute and obtuse-angled triangle, “the same demonstra
tion serving for both, which however is not conducted in so purely geo
metrical a manner as one could wish.’”        He then mentions some more re
cent researches, which, however, need not be introduced here.

        Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.             209
 tinacity of Nourse (who formed a higher opinion of him than
 was at alljust), rather than by any intrinsic merits of their own.
    Of Emerson's personal character this is not the place to say
 much; and indeed it would be unnecessary to do more than
 refer to Hutton's Dictionary (in loco) for a description of his
 eccentricities, were it not for a non-sequitur that has been
 drawn from his and some similar cases. It surely does
not follow that because Emerson and some others habitually
indulged in a rough discourtesy of bearing towards others,
that it arose from the nature of their studies, or inevitably
followed from the tone of feeling generated by mathematics.
Why not, then, charge medical studies with the same tendency
on the ground of an Abernethy, or the legal on the ground of
a Thurlow, belonging to those professions? The inference
is indeed absurd enough; but many a time in my life have
I heard it made.
    However, I have to beg, once for all, that if the non-aca
demic body of mathematicians are decreed to have a head of
their school, they may at least be allowed their own choice.
That election would fall, without a dissentient voice, on
Thomas Simpson. Amongst themselves, he, and not Emerson,
virtually fills the post; and they cannot but feel aggrieved by
hearing a man whose character they do not respect and whose
works they seldom open, thus held up as the prototype of
themselves.
   This series of notices of the Nourse papers must necessarily
be incomplete without some account of the man who was the
real focus of the mathematical literature of his time—now
verging upon a century ago. I regret that few materials of a
positive kind have fallen in my way from which I can satisfy
so reasonable a desire on the part of my readers. . Most of
the letters are written in more or less of that dry, business
style, that only brings in an interesting incident now and then,
and always casually. One series of letters, however, of a more
familiar and intimate character, from John Robertson of
Portsmouth (author of the Treatise on Navigation, and other
works, and subsequently “Clerk’’ of the Royal Society),
throw some light on Nourse's personal character. A few
scraps, too, of Nourse's own geometrical speculations betoken
a mind of no ordinary powers, and a taste in science such as
even few professional mathematicians have evinced.
   From the frequent jocular allusions of Robertson, it would
appear that Nourse was a grave self-possessed person, who
nevertheless enjoyed a pun or a good joke as well as his friend
did. A quiet pipe with its adjuncts in the shop-parlour seems
to have been his sum total of indulgence. He rarely quitted his
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 37. No. 249. Sept. 1850.           P

business; and when he did, it was only to go to Oxford where
he had relatives—a brother, Sir    C. Nourse, and a sister,
the wife of Dr. Hornsby, the Radcliffe astronomer. One of
the letters seems to imply that he was a short and somewhat
corpulent man, who always fancied himself to be “wasting
away.” He was always alive to his business, and the number
of works of which he was the publisher was unprecedented in
his day; his undertakings appear to have been generally
successful, and his dealings scrupulously honourable. He
does not appear from any allusions in these letters to have
been married: and he amassed considerable property, which
was bequeathed to his brother and sister.
   The mathematical character of Nourse is best shown by a
specimen of his geometry. I therefore annex two: one a de
monstration of the converse of Euc. v. 25, which he required
as lemma for some emendations of a proposition on the conic
sections in the works of Mylne and Simson; and the other a
remarkably simple and elegant problem in Angelis de inf. Pa
rebolis. These are given precisely as I find them in the MS.,
taking in the textual corrections made by himself.

 XXV. An Instantaneous Demonstration of Pascal's Theo
    rem by the method of Indeterminate Coordinates.         By J. J.
     SylvestER, M.A., F.R.S.*
THE new analytical             geometry consists essentially of two
       parts—the one determinate, the other indeterminate.
    The determinate analysis comprehends that class of ques
tions in which it is necessary to assume independent linear
coordinates, or else to take cognizance of the equations by
which they are connected if they are not independent. The
indeterminate analysis assumes at will any number of coordi
nates, and leaves the relations which connect them more or
less indefinite, and reasons chiefly through the medium of the
general properties of algebraic forms, and their correspond
encies with the objects of geometrical speculation. Pascal's
theorem of the mystic hexagon, and the annexed demon
stration of its fundamental property, belong to this branch of
the subject, and afford an instructive and striking example of
the application of the pure method of indeterminate coor
dinates.
    Let a, y, z, t, u, v be the sides of a hexagon inscribed in the
conic U. Let the hexagon be divided by a new line p in any
manner into two quadrilaterals, say ayzp, tuvp.
    Then               ay?--baz=U=&up +6lv;
                       ... (ay—au)?=3tv–baz;
... ay–au and p are the diagonals of the quadrilateral troz.
    By construction, p is the diagonal joining w, v (i. e. the in
tersection of w and v) with 2, t: and thus we see that ay–au
is the line joining t, a with v, z; but this line passes through
y, u. Therefore w, t ; y, u; z, v lie in one and the same right
line. Q. E. D.

 XXVI. On a new Class of Theorems in elimination between
    Quadratic Functions. By J. J. SYLVESTER, M.A., F.R.S.*
 IN a      forthcoming memoir on determinants and quadratic
       functions, I have demonstrated the following remarkable
theorem as a particular case of one much more general, also
there given and demonstrated.
    Let U, and V be respectively quadratic functions of the
same 2n letters, and let it be supposed possible to institute n
such linear equations between these letters as shall make U
and V both simultaneously become identically zerot. Then
the determinant of AU--p.V, which is of course a function of
A and P. of the 2nth degree, will become the square of a func
tion of A and u of the nth degree; and conversely, if this de
terminant be a perfect square, U and V may be made to va
nish simultaneously by the institution of n linear equations
between the 2n letterst.
    Let now P and Q be respectively quadratic functions of
three letters only, say a, y, z; and let
                       U= P+ (la + my + m2)t
                       V=Q+ K(la + my--nz)t.
    The determinant of AU-1-p V in respect to w, y, z, t is easily
seen to be (A+kp.)*x the determinant of
                      AP+ p.Gl-F (la + my--nz)t
in respect to a, y, z, t. Hence if we call
                   AP+P.Q.--(la + my--nz)t=W,
and make [T].W a squared function of x, p. or which is the
              ayzt
same thing, if
                       [T]. [T]{W}=0,
                        \pi     ayzt
U and V will vanish simultaneously when two linear relations
are instituted between the quantities (all or some of them)
a', y, z, t.           -                        - -  -
    In order that this may be the case, it will be seen to be
sufficient that

is any number m, the number of linear equations being any number not
exceeding   º

214      Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems
shall coexist; for then two equations between ar, y, z, of which
la + my--nz=0 will be one, will suffice to make U and V each
identically zero. Hence we have the following theorem:
             |T|T| {AU+P.V--(1,4-my--nº)t
              Ap,     ayzt                       -
is a factor of the resultant of
                  P=0 Q=0 la + my--nz=0.
   A comparison of the orders of the resultant and the deter
minant shows that they must be identical, d-ci-près, of a nu
merical factor, which, if the resultant be taken in its general
lowest terms, may no doubt be easily shown to be unity.
   As an illustration of our theorem, let
                          P=ay--yz+za.
                          Q=cay + ayz+bza'.

the four linear functions obtained by substituting these values
 of a, y, z in the fourth : the product will contain the resultant

agreeing with the result obtained by my theorem,--a special
numerical factor 4, arising from the peculiar form of the equa
tions, having disappeared from the resultant.
    A geometrical demonstration may be given of the theorem
which is instructive in itself, and will suggest a remarkable
extension of it to functions containing more than three letters,
              |T| {AU+P.V+(lw-my-nº)t}=0,
               ayzt
which is a quadratic equation in A : º, may easily be shown to
imply that the conic AU+wV is touched by the straight line
                          lar +m2 + m2 = 0.
    And we thus see that in general two conics,
                             AU + p.W =0,
passing through the intersections of two given conics,
                             U=0      V = 0,
may be drawn to meet a given line. If, however, the given
line passes through any of the four points of intersection, in
such case only one conic can be drawn to touch it; accordingly
              |T| |T| {AU+p.V+(Iz--my--nz)t}
must be zero when l, m, n are so taken as to satisfy this con
dition, i. e. if

                        la + my--nz-Hpt=0;
and |T| =0 being a cubic equation, in general three such
conoids can be drawn.
    Considerations of analogy make it obvious to the intuition,
that in the particular case of two of these becoming coinci
dent, the given plane la + my--nz +pt must be a tangent plane
to those two coincident conoids at one of the points where it
meets the intersections of U–0 V = 0; i. e.
                        la:--my--nx +pt=0
will pass through a tangent line to, or in other words, may be
termed a tangent plane to the intersections. Hence the fol
lowing analytical theorem, derived from supposing q, r, s, t
to be proportional to the areas of the triangular faces of the
pyramid cut out of space by the four coordinate planes to
which w, y, z, t refer. As these planes are left indefinite,
q, r, s, t are perfectly arbitrary.

order in respect of q, r, s, t,
    The resultant which contains it is of the (4+4+2.4)th,
i.e. 16th order in respect to the coefficients in U and V; of
the (4+8)th, i. e. the 12th, in respect of l, m, n, p ; and of the
4th in respect of q, r, s, t. Hence the special (and, as far as
the geometry of the question is concerned, the unnecessary, I
may not say extraneous or irrelevant) factor which enters into
the resultant is of the 4th order in respect to the combined
coefficients of U and V* ; and of the same order in respect to
l, m, n, p, and in respect to q, r, s, t.
    I have not yet succeeded in divining its general value.

    I believe that the theorem which I have here given for de
termining the condition that la +my--nz +pt shall be a tan
gent plane to the intersection of two conoids U and V, viz.
that the determinant of
                    AU+V+ (lar-i-my--nz+pt)u
shall have two equal roots, is altogether novel.
   * And consequently of the second in respect to the separate coefficients
of each.

 218       Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.
     What is the meaning of all three roots of this determinant
 becoming equal, i.e. of only one conoid being capable of being
 drawn through the intersection of U and V to touch the plane
                            la + my--nz+pt?
 Evidently (ew vi analogiae) that this plane shall pass through
 three consecutive points of the curve of intersection, i. e. that
 it shall be the osculating plane to the curve.
    If we return to the intersection of two co-planar conics, and
 if we suppose a line to be drawn through two of the points of
 intersection, the conics capable of being drawn through the
 four points of intersection to touch the line, besides becoming
 coincident, evidently degenerate each into a pair of right lines.
 It would seem, therefore, by analogy, that if a plane be drawn
 including any two tangent lines to the curve of intersection of
two surfaces of the second degree, this should be touched by two
 coincident cones drawn through the curve of intersection, and
 consequently every such double tangent plane to the intersec
tion of two conoids (and it is evident that one or more of these
can be taken at every point of the curve) must pass through
one of the vertices of the four cones in which the intersection
may always be considered to lie; and it would appear from
this, that in general four double tangent planes admit of being
drawn to the curve, which is the intersection of two conoids,
 at each point thereof. At particular points a tangent plane
 may be drawn passing through more than one of the vertices,
 and then of course the number of double tangent planes that
 can be drawn will be lessened. These results, indicated by
analogy, become immediately apparent on considering the
 curve in question as traced upon any one of the four containing
 cones. For the plane drawn through a tangent at any point,
and the vertex of the cone being a tangent plane to the cone,
 must evidently touch the curve again where it meets it. We
 thus have an additional confirmation of the analogy between
a point of intersection of two curves and the tangent at any
point of the intersection of two surfaces.
    I might extend the analytical theorems which have been esta
blished for functions of three and four to functions of a greater
number of variables; but enough has been done to point out
the path to a new and interesting class of theorems at once in
elimination and in geometry, which is all that I have at present
leisure or the disposition to undertake.                       -

Voltaic Battery.” By Christopher Leefe Dresser, Esq. Commu
nicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S. &c.
   In the retorts used for the destructive distillation of coal to obtain
the carburetted hydrogen gas for the purposes of illumination, after
a certain time a deposition of carbonaceous matter takes place, and
which at length accumulates to such an extent as to fill up a portion
of the retort with solid substance, and to line the whole with a
coating varying from the thickness of paper to several inches.
   After describing several forms in which this substance occurs,
and which vary considerably both in density and hardness, the au
thor states that he found one of great hardness, very little, if at all,
porous, and of a stony fracture, to be best adapted for the negative
conductor of his nitric acid battery. The most convenient form for
the negative conductor is the prismatic, 1} inch square on the side
and about 7 inches long, which is immersed 4 inches in the acid,
and used with round porous cells, the zinc cylinder being 3 inches
in diameter and 4% inches high.
   The carbon is cut into thin plates or prisms by the machine of
the marble cutter, at a cost of about 134, each. The prisms may

   The only precautions necessary in using this form of carbon, are,
after using the plates to immerse them for a few moments in boiling
water, to take off the adhering acid, and then to dry them before a
fire or in a stove.
   Having used the same plates and prisms for months, the author
detected no deterioration of their conducting power, nor any de
composition or alteration. The connexion was made by soldering
a strip of sheet copper to the zinc, and pressing this strongly against
the carbon with a clamp.
   Comparing these plates with plates of platinum, the author could
detect little difference in action, but the carbon appeared rather
superior. He states that his battery of 100 plates cost under £4,
whilst one of platinum of equal power would have cost £60 or £70.
From the cheapness and durability of this substance, he considers
that it will make a valuable addition to our voltaic apparatus.

    SIR,--I am directed by Wiscount Palmerston to send to you, for
 the information of the President and Council of the Royal Society,
 an extract of a letter which his Lordship has received from Mr. James
 Richardson, stating that in the month of November last, a fall of
 aérolites had taken place on the coast of Barbary attended with a
 brilliant stream of light, which extended from Tunis to Tripoli, some
 of the stones falling in the latter city.

    “I will trouble your Lordship by the mention of the astronomic
phenomenon which terrified or arrested the attention of the inhabit
ants of the whole of this coast some two months ago. This was
the fall of a shower of acrolites, with a brilliant stream of light
accompanying them, and which extended from Tunis to Tripoli,
some of the stones falling in the latter city.
    “The alarm was very great in Tunis, and several Jews and Moors
instinctively fled to the British Consulate, as the common refuge
from every kind of evil and danger.

winter which the inhabitants of Tunis and Tripoli have experienced
for many years.”
   The reading of a paper, entitled “Discussion of Meteorological
Observations taken in India at various heights.” By Lieut.-Colonel
Sykes, F.R.S. &c., was commenced, but was not concluded.
   April 11.—Lieut.-Colonel Sykes's paper, entitled “Discussion of
Meteorological Observations in India,” was resumed and concluded.
   The author adverts to a former paper “On the Meteorology of
the Deccan,” published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1835,
and after referring to the conclusions at which he arrived in that
communication, states that, in the discussion of the meteorological
observations which form the subject of the present paper, and which
were made over a very extended area, at different heights, some
being hourly and running through several years at the same station,
it is very satisfactory to find that they fully establish the accuracy
of the former deductions.      He remarks that, as some of the obser
vations now discussed were hourly records continued through con
siderable periods of time, an opportunity has been afforded of in
vestigating abnormal conditions, which the former limited number
of diurnal observations did not permit; and gives the following
review of what appears to be normal and abnormal conditions.
   The annual and daily range of the barometer diminishes from the
sea-level up to the greatest height observed, 8640 feet at Dodabetta,

                             Royal Society.                        221
from a mean annual and mean daily range at Madras of 0.735 and
0.122 respectively to 0.410 and 0.060 at Dodabetta;-the annual
range would appear to increase, about and beyond the northern
tropic, as the annual range at Calcutta (not by hourly observations)
is 0.911; but the diurnal range is somewhat less (0:115) than at
Madras. At no one of the places of observation, even taking the
maximum pressure of one year with the minimum pressure of another
year, does there appear to have been a range of pressure equivalent
to an inch of mercury; nevertheless in the Cyclones, or rotatory
storms, there occurs at times a range of pressure of nearly two inches
of mercury within forty-eight hours; but it is shown from a compa
rison of the simultaneous records on board ship, where these great
depressions were noted, with the records at the observatories on shore,
that the great depressions occurred within very limited areas.
   The author had formerly shown that the times or turning-points
of ebb and flow (if the term be permitted) of the aërial ocean,
were occasionally retarded or accelerated, although the means fixed
the turning-points within certain limit hours; but he was not then
aware that in the ebb or flow of the four daily tides, they ever
retrograded or halted in their onward or retiring course. The hourly
observations now show that abnormal conditions are of no infre
quent occurrence,—that the tides at times flow or ebb for four,
five, six or even seven and eight hours (one instance at Aden of
nine hours),--that frequent instances occur of retrograde move
ments for short periods of time, as if the tide had met with a check
and been turned back; and at the turning-points there are numerous
instances of the atmosphere being stationary for a couple of hours.
   The maximum pressure of the atmosphere is in the coldest months,
December or January, but the minimum pressure is not in the
hottest months, but in June or July. The barometric readings,
when protracted, show"a gradual curve from December or January
descending to June or July, and then ascending again to December
or January, there being an occasional interruption in October or
November. As the curves at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta,
correspond, and as Madras has no south-west monsoon, while
Bombay has a south-west monsoon, and is destitute of the north-east
monsoon of Madras, it would appear that the general movements of
the atmosphere are little influenced by any conditions of its lower
strata; but the curve of pressure would seem to have some relation
to the sun's place in the ecliptic,
   The normal conditions of daily temperature are, that it is coldest
in India at sunrise, and hottest between the hours of 1 and 8 P.M.;
but the tables show many aberrations from this rule. The re
gular increment or decrement of mean monthly heat from the maxi
mum or minimum period is somewhat remarkable, as the curve is
independent of the south-west monsoon at Bombay and the north
east monsoon at Madras; and the passage of the sun twice over
both places does not derange the curve. The anomalies of the
annual mean temperature of Madras, Bombay, Calcutta and Aden,
not diminishing with the increase in the latitude of the respective

 places, are pointed out, and numerous instances are given of the
 very great power of the slanting rays of the sun beyond the tropic.
 As is the case with the barometric, so do the heat tables indicate
 that the annual and daily ranges of the thermometer diminish with
 the elevation of the place of observation above the sea-level, the
 elevated table-land of the Deccan however being an exception to
 this rule. At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the temperature of the
 air was never below 45° with a maximum and minimum thermo
 meter; and at Dodabetta the temperature of the air was never below
 38°5, nevertheless at both places ice and hoar-frost were frequently
 found on the ground at sunrise, resulting from the separate or con
joined effects of radiation and evaporation.
    After stating the want of confidence he has in observations of the
 wet-bulb thermometer as a means of determining the dew-point,
 and that he greatly prefers Daniell's hygrometer for this purpose,
 the author observes that he will not venture to say more with re
spect to normal conditions of moisture in India than that the air of
 the sea coast has always a much greater fraction of saturation than
 the lands of the interior; and that the elevated plateau of the Dec
 can is periodically subject to very high degrees of dryness.
    Some very unexpected phenomena with reference to the distri
 bution of rain are pointed out. It is found both on the sea coasts
and on the table-lands of the Deccan, that within very limited areas,
the differences in the fall of rain may be very great. With nine
rain-gauges employed in the small island of Bombay in the months
of June and July, in the monsoon of 1849, the quantity collected
in the different gauges ranged in July from 46 inches to 102 inches,
and in June from 19 inches to 46 inches.           At Sattarah, in the
Deccan, with three rain-gauges within the distance of a mile, they
differed in their contents several inches from each other; and at
Mahabuleshwur and Paunchgunny, nearly on the same level, the
latter place being only eleven miles to the eastward of the former,
the annual fall of rain was 254 inches and 50 inches respectively
The normal conditions are, that there is a much greater fall of rain
on the sea coasts than on the table-lands of the Deccan, but that the
Ghats intervening between the coasts and the table-lands have three
times the amount of the fall on the coasts, and from ten to fifteen
times the amount of the fall on the table-lands of the interior; the
paucity of the fall of rain at Cape Comorin and in the mouths of the
Indus would also appear to be normal conditions.
   The tables must be referred to for the winds; the normal states are
those of the south-west and north-east monsoons, and the influence of
the latter is periodically felt at the height of 8640 feet at Dodabetta,
which height would appear just at the upper surface of the stratum of
air constituting the south-west monsoon; but hourly observations for
lengthened periods are necessary at Dodabetta, to determine what
really are the periodical winds at that height. From the points other
than those between south and west, and north and east, there is also
at the several stations a certain amount of periodicity in the winds,
the winds that are common to different stations having only a slant

more or less at the different stations; for instance, the south-west and
north-west winds of Bombay blowing in the summer months in Cal
cutta incline rather to be south and north winds, than south-west and
north-west winds; but the author observes that to be enabled to speak
with any precision upon this branch of the meteorology of India, and
indeed upon most other branches with a comprehensive and philoso
phical object, hourly observations are necessary, simultaneously
taken with previously compared instruments by zealous observers;
and having the records in a form common to all the observers, so
as to admit of rigid comparisons:–when this is done, not only in
India but in Europe, meteorologists will be in a better condition
to generalize and propound normal conditions, than the state of our
knowledge at present would justify.
   The author states that he is indebted to that very able and zeal
ous meteorologist, Dr. Buist of Bombay, for the protracted curves
of pressure of the barometer appended to his paper.
    A paper was also read, entitled “On the Structure and Use of the
Ligamentum rotundum Uteri, with some observations upon the
change which takes place in the structure of the Uterus during
 Utero-gestation.” By G. Rainey, Esq., M.R.C.S.E., Demonstrator
of Anatomy, St. Thomas's Hospital. Communicated by Joseph H.
 Green, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author first refers to the discovery of the difference which
 exists between the two classes of muscles; the voluntary, or those
 with striped fibres, and the involuntary, or those with unstriped
 fibres. He then notices that the opinion which is entertained re
 specting the round ligaments being composed of the unstriped variety
 of muscular fibre is incorrect, these organs consisting chiefly of the
 striped muscular fibre.
    In support of the accuracy of this assertion, the author alleges
 the following facts:—
    First, that the round ligament arises by three tendinous and fleshy
 fasciculi; one, from the tendon of the internal oblique, near the
 symphysis pubis, a middle one from the superior column of the
 external abdominal ring, the third from the inferior column of the
 same: from these points the fibres pass backwards and outwards,
 and uniting form a rounded cord—the round ligament; after which,
 traversing the broad ligament, they go to be inserted into the angle
 of the uterus.
    The striped fibres are principally situated in its centre, and extend
 from its origin to within an inch or two of the fundus uteri; as they
 approach which, the fibres gradually lose the striated character and
 degenerate into fasciculi of granular fibres of the same kind as those
 of the Dartos muscle; both these fibres presenting similar micro
 scopic characters when acted upon by glycerine.
    The author then states that the round ligament does not pass
 through the external ring to be lost in the labia and mons veneris;
 and argues from the fact of their consisting mainly of striped fibres,
 &c., that their use cannot be merely mechanical or subservient to
the process of utero-gestation, and therefore he concludes that its

 224                           Royal Society.
 function must be connected in some way with the process of copula
 tion.
     He also adverts to the necessity of examining the round ligament
 by the microscope in glycerine in preference to any other fluid; as
 this substance renders the cellular tissue mixed with the fibres more
 transparent without diminishing the distinctness of their character
 istic markings.     The author next states his views on the changes
 which take place in the uterus during utero-gestation, and observes,
 first, that there is no similarity between the fibres of the round liga
 ment and those of the unimpregnated uterus, the latter being made
 up of spindle-shaped nucleated fibres, contained in a matrix of
 exceedingly coherent granular matter; that these fibres are best
 examined in portions which have been broken up by needles, in
 preference to thin sections; and that this tissue is well seen in the
 larger mammals, as in the Cow, &c.         In the impregnated uterus
 the fibres are found much increased in size and distinctness, but
 devoid of nuclei and comparatively loosely connected; and the en
 largement of these fibres is of itself sufficient to account for the
 increased volume of the gravid uterus, without supposing that a set
of muscular fibres are formed in it de novo.
    Hence he reasons that the unimpregnated uterus consists probably
 of little more than an assemblage of embryonic nucleated fibres, in
 active until the ovum is received into it, after which their develop
 ment commences and continues simultaneously and progressively
 with that of the foetus; so that when this last has arrived at a state
requiring to be expelled, the uterus has acquired its greatest expulsory
 power. Lastly, the author observes, since the fully-developed fibres
 cannot return to their former embryonic condition, they necessarily
 become absorbed, and a new set of embryonic fibres are formed for
the next ovum, so that each foetus is furnished with its own set of
expulsory fibres; which view is in perfect accordance with the
statements of Drs. Sharpey and Weber, with regard to the mem
brana decidua.
    April 18-" On the Solution of Linear Differential Equations.”
By the Rev. Brice Bronwin, M.A. Communicated by S. Hunter
Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
    The methods employed in this paper to effect the solution or re
duction of linear differential equations consist of certain peculiar
transformations, and each particular class of equations is transformed
by a distinct process peculiarly its own. The reduction is effected
by means of certain general theorems in the calculus of operations.
    The terms which form the first member of the first class of equa
tions are functions of the symbols w and r, the latter being a function
of a, and the former a function of a and D, a being the independent
variable. This member of the equations contains two arbitrary
functions of w, and may therefore be of any order whatever. It            the
likewise contains two simple factors, such for example as a<U+017F> and
a<U+017F> +nk, which factors are taken away by the transformation em            Othe
ployed, and consequently the equation is reduced an order lower;         tiº
it is therefore integrated when of the second order. There is a se       §ent
                                                                         COIt

                            Royal Society.                          225
ries of equations of this class, each essentially distinct from the rest,
yet all reducible by a similar process.
   These equations contain two arbitrary functions of w. The num
ber therefore of particular practicable forms, which may be deduced
from each, is very great, a circumstance which renders our chance
of putting any proposed equation under one of these forms greater
in the same proportion. On account of the very large number of
particular integrable equations which each general example furnishes,
selection would be very difficult, and all could not be given; the au
thor has therefore refrained from giving any.
   The second class of equations may be deduced from the first by
the interchange of the symbols D and ar, and changing r into r-i.
The second general theorem can be deduced from the first in like
manner; and this class may be transformed and reduced by it in a
manner exactly similar to that by which the former class is reduced
by the first general theorem. The solution therefore of the one se
ries may be deduced from that of the other by the interchange of
symbols only.    But in the second series the solutions obtained are
not always practicable, that is to say, they cannot always be inter
preted in finite terms. They have therefore been reduced by the
introduction of new arbitrary functions of D, which render them
practicable; this process however necessarily diminishes their gene
ralitv.
   Wien reduced to the ordinary form, these equations are somewhat
complicated; but by giving suitable forms to the arbitrary functions
of D which they contain, we may derive from them particular ex
amples of a form as simple as we please, and by introducing as many
arbitrary constants as possible, these examples may be made very
general of the class to which they belong. In the integration of
linear equations, the coefficients of which are integer functions of ar,
they may prove very useful.
   Next, an equation, a particular case of which was treated by Mr.
Boole in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, is here integrated
under its most general form. Instead of integer functions of a, the
coefficients may be any functions whatever, consistent with the con
dition of integrability, which is ascertained, and the formulae of re
duction assumed by Mr. Boole are shown to be universally true.
An additional function of the independent variable is also introduced
into the operating symbol r. The equation therefore, independently
of the condition of integrability, contains two arbitrary functions of
a, and consequently gives rise to a considerable number of particular
integrable examples.
   Here also the interchange of the symbols D and a is made, both
in the equation to be integrated and in the general symbolical
theorem by which it is reduced, and the same reduction to prac
ticable forms as before is likewise made.
   The next class of equations results from the generalization of an
other equation integrated by Mr. Boole in the Cambridge Mathema
tical Journal. Here the symbol D of Mr. Boole is replaced by the
general symbol ar, and moreover the first member of each equation
contains two arbitrary functions of a ; and by means of another
  Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 37. No. 249. Sept. 1850.

226                         Royal Society.
extension, this example gives rise to a whole series of equations con
stituting a class. The reduction is effected partly by the first general
theorem in the calculus of operations, and partly by other means.
It must be observed that each of the classes is totally distinct from
the others, and its mode of treatment also distinct; also each of the
general examples in the series contains two arbitrary functions of the
independent variable, and will therefore give the solutions of a large
number of particular equations, but for the reason before stated
particular examples are not given.
   Here likewise, by the interchange of the symbols D and ar, another
series of equations with their solutions or reductions is obtained, and
also another general theorem by which they may be transformed and
reduced.     But the solutions of the examples of the one series may
be deduced from those of the other by the interchange of symbols.
It is not a little remarkable that this interchange of symbols in all
these cases should be found possible, it will however be found pos
sible in another case to be hereafter described.
   The last class of equations discussed in this paper is transformed
by means of a general theorem of a very different kind from any of
those which have been employed in reducing and integrating any of
the previous classes. By means of this transformation, the symbol
ar, of which the first member of these equations is a function, is
placed in a position to operate upon the whole of that member, a
certain equation of condition among the coefficients being previously
admitted. Hence by operating upon both members with the inverse
of this symbol, the equation is once integrated, and, if it be of the
second order only, completely solved.
   Here too the interchange of symbols may be made both in the
equation and its solution, and the solution so changed will be the
solution of the equation changed in like manner. The general sym
bolical theorems, which here consist of a series of terms, may be de
rived the one from the other in the same way, and by changing the
signs of the alternate terms.
   Reductions of the arbitrary functions of D, similar to those before
made, are made here also ; and by particularizing some of the func
tions so reduced for the sake of simplification, several very singular
resulting equations are obtained. If in these we assign to the re
maining arbitrary functions, particular forms, and introduce as many
arbitrary constants as we can, we may find particular examples
which may be of great use in the integration of equations with
coefficients containing only integer functions of w.
   By a very obvious substitution an arbitrary function of a may be
introduced into any of this kind of equations, and also another func
tion of D, and the last often with great advantage.
   “On the Oils produced by the Action of Sulphuric Acid upon
various classes of Vegetables,” by John Stenhouse, Esq., F.R.S.
   Nearly thirty years ago Döbereiner observed, when preparing for
mic acid by distilling a mixture of starch, peroxide of manganese and
sulphuric acid, that the liquid which passed into the receiver con
tained a small quantity of oil which rendered it turbid. To this oil
 Döbereiner gave the fanciful name of “artificial oil of ants,” though

                             Royal Society.                          227
 the very limited quantity in which he was able to procure it pre
 vented him from determining almost any of its properties.
    The author's attention was first directed to the subject in 1840,
 when he found that the oxide of manganese was unnecessary, and
 that the oil could be readily prepared by operating on most vege
 table substances with either sulphuric or muriatic acid. The oil, on
 analysis, was found to have the formula C1, Hº Oc, and to contain
 oxygen and hydrogen in the proportions to form water, while all
 other oils and fats contain an excess of hydrogen.
    The late Dr. Fownes took up the subject in 1845, and made the
interesting discovery, that when the oil which he called furfurole is
heated with ammonia, a crystalline amide is formed. When this
amide is boiled with caustic lyes, it is changed into the crystallizable
base furfurine. The paper then describes the best mode of pre
paring furfurole, and also the method of purifying it from an oil with
which crude furfurole is always accompanied, and to which the name
of meta-furfurole has been given. Meta-furfurole is the cause of the
bright red coloration which impure furfurole instantly produces when
it is treated with muriatic or sulphuric acids in the cold. This por
tion of the paper concludes with some new observations on furfurole,
and an examination of some of the salts of furfurine.
   It has been pretty satisfactorily ascertained that the constituent
of plants which yields furfurole is the matière incrustante of M. Payen,
viz. the matter with which the interior of the cells of plants is lined.
This is an amorphous granular substance which has been gradually
deposited from the sap in its passage through the tissue of the plant.
It is most abundant in hard woods, such as oak and teak, especially
in the oldest portions which lie nearest the heart of the tree. As the
author of the paper was led to conjecture that the matière incrustante
of the different great classes of vegetables would be found on exa
mination analogous but not identical, he thought it likely that the
oils derivable from them would also prove not identical with furfurole,
though probably very analogous to it in their nature and properties.
The algae or sea-weeds, whose structure is very different from that
of ordinary herbaceous plants, were employed to test the truth of this
hypothesis. They yielded an aromatic oil to which the name of
fucusole was given. Though essentially different from furfurole, it
closely resembles that oil in its properties, being also isomeric with
it. Fucusole forms a crystallizable amide with ammonia, called fucus
amide, which, when it is boiled with alkaline lyes, is also converted
into an organic base—fucusine, which is likewise isomeric with fur
furine. Fucusine is a rather difficultly crystallizable base; but some
of its salts, especially the nitrate, may be readily procured in large
º:          In solubility and crystalline form they differ from those
of the corresponding base.
    The paper contains an analysis of these salts.
    The mosses and lichens were also found to yield fucusole. The
ferns, on the other hand, yield a peculiar oil, which differs both from
fucusole and furfurole, possessing properties intermediate between
them.
    The results of these   erº seem to indicate some curious
                                      2

botanical relations, as it appears highly probable that the matière
incrustante is the same in all phanerogamous plants, as they yield
 furfurole. On the other hand, the matière incrustante in the Algae,
mosses and lichens, as it yields fucusole and not furfurole, though the
same in each of these classes, is evidently different from that of pha
nerogamous plants. The matière incrustante of ferns appears how
ever to be dissimilar from either of the others, as it yields an analo
gous but peculiar oil.
    April 25–" On the means adopted in the British Colonial Mag
netic Observatories for determining the absolute values, secular
change, and annual variation of the Magnetic Force.” By Lieut.-Col.
Edward Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
    The determination of the mean numerical values of the elements
of terrestrial magnetism in direction and force at different points of
the earth's surface (the force being expressed in absolute measure,
intelligible consequently to future generations, however distant, and
conveying to them a knowledge of the present magnetic state of the
globe), and the determination of the nature and amount of the se
cular changes which the elements are at present undergoing, are, as
the author states, the first steps in that great inductive inquiry by
which it may be hoped that the inhabitants of the globe may at some
date, perhaps not very distant, obtain a complete knowledge of the
laws of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, and possibly gain
an insight into the physical causes of one of the most remarkable
forces by which our planet is affected.
    After stating the inadequacy of the instruments originally pro
posed by the Royal Society, to the attainment of all the objects for
which they had been designed, the author refers to the modifications
which had been introduced, in the instruments and methods of ob
servation for the determination of the absolute values, and the secu
lar changes of the horizontal component of the magnetic force. He
then gives the series of the results of the monthly observations at
Toronto from January 1845 to April 1849 as relatively correct; and
from this series, regarding each monthly determination as entitled
to equal weight, and taking the arithmetical mean of all the values
as the most probable mean value, obtains 3:53043 as the mean value
of the horizontal force at Toronto, with a probable error of +-00055;
and the probable error of +10040 for each monthly determination.
   This is on the most simple hypothesis, in which neither secular
change nor annual variation is supposed to exist. The monthly re
sults however distinctly indicate a secular change, and by means of
them, on the hypothesis of a uniform secular change, the author
deduces -0042 as the annual decrease of the horizontal force during
the period comprehended by the observations, the value of the force
on the 1st of March 1847, the mean epoch being 3:53043, with a
probable error of +.00025.
   For the purpose of deducing the values of the total magnetic force
and its secular change from those of the horizontal force, it is neces
sary to know the magnetic inclination corresponding to the epoch
and its secular change. From the observations of the inclination,
75°16'09 is deduced as the value of this element on the 1st of March

                            Royal Society.                            229
1847, with a secular increase of 0.89 annually; and 13.8832 as the
value of the total force in absolute measure, at the same epoch. As
the annual increase of O'89 in the inclination will not account for an
annual decrease of more than ‘0033 in the horizontal force, there
remains 0009 as indicative of a small annual decrease in the total
force during the period of the observations, and the author considers
that the probabilities are in favour of such a decrease.
   The general fact of an annual variation of the horizontal force at
Toronto, the force being greater in the summer than in the winter
months, is shown by three independent methods of experiment, viz.
the observations from which the foregoing conclusions have been
drawn, the regular observations with the bifilar magnetometer, and
observations undertaken expressly with the view of ascertaining the
fact.   The author also infers the probable existence of an annual
variation of the total force, the force being greatest in the winter
months, or when the sun is in the southern signs, and least in the
summer months, or when the sun is in the northern signs.
   The results obtained from the observations at Hobarton are next
briefly stated. The investigation, conducted in the same manner as
at Toronto, shows at Hobarton a decrease of south inclination of
O'-89 on the average of the months from April to August inclusive,
that is, in the southern winter; and an increase of 0-85 from October
to February inclusive, that is, in the southern summer.
   The series of observations on the horizontal force shows an annual
variation of the same character as respects the seasons, and almost
identical in amount with that at Toronto.          In the months from
October to February inclusive, or in the summer months at Ho
barton, the horizontal force is 0017 greater on the average than its
mean amount; and from April to August inclusive, or in the winter
months at Hobarton, it is on the average 0013 less than its mean
amount.
   The inferences drawn from these variations of the inclination and
horizontal force, taken jointly as respects the total force at Hobarton,
are that this force is subject to an annual variation, being higher
than its mean amount from October to February, and lower than its
mean amount from April to August.
   It thus appears that in the months from October to February the
magnetic needle more nearly approaches the vertical position, both
at Toronto in the northern hemisphere, and at Hobarton in the
southern ; and that the total force is greatest at both stations from
October to February, and least from April to August.
   It is much to be desired, the author states, that so remarkable a
result should receive a full confirmation, by the continuance of the
observations at Toronto and Hobarton for such an additional period
as may appear necessary for that purpose; and that the general con
clusion, indicated by the observations at those stations, should be
verified by similar investigations in other parts of the globe, especially
at the observatories which now exist.     He conceives that these facts
indicate the existence of a general affection of the whole globe
having an annual period, and would appear to conduct us naturally
to the position of the earth in its orbit as the first step towards an

230               Cambridge Philosophical Society.
explanation of the periodic change. He further urges the importance
of following up without delay, and in the most effective manner, a
branch of the research which gives so fair a promise of establishing,
upon the basis of competent experiment, a conclusion of so much
theoretical moment.
   In conclusion the author adverts briefly to considerations which
may give a particular importance to accurate numerical values of the
magnetic elements and their secular changes at Toronto, namely the
proximity of that station to one of the two points on the northern
hemisphere, which are the centres of the isodynamic loops, and are
the points of the greatest intensity of the force (on the surface of
the globe) of apparently two magnetic systems, distinguished from
each other by the very remarkable difference in the rate of secular
change to which the phenomena in each system appear to be subject.

   March 11, 1850.—On the Knowledge of Body and Space. By
H. Wedgwood, M.A.
   No part of the great metaphysical problem chalked out by Locke
has been more assiduously laboured, and none has attained a less
satisfactory solution, than that which relates to the origin of the
idea of space and its subordinate conceptions, figure, position, mag
nitude.
   It was seen that the exercise of the muscular frame must somehow
be instrumental in making us acquainted with the material and ex
tended world, but all hopes of a logical explanation of the process
by which that effect is produced seemed cut off at the outset by a
preliminary objection. The knowledge of motion, it was said, ob
viously involves the knowledge of the body moved. The conscious
ness of the motion of the hand therefore implies the conception of
the hand itself, an object of certain shape and size. The attempt
to account for the notions of shape and size from the motion of the
hand was thus apparently stranded in a hopeless paralogism; and so
insurmountable was the difficulty taken to be, that philosophers were
driven to imagine a second source of elementary ideas, in addition
to the simple apprehension of the thing conceived in actual existence,
maintaining that space is known to us as the condition under which
we perceive external things, or, as others express it, that the notion
of space arises in the mind on the first apprehension of body by a
principle of necessary judgement, which impresses upon us the con
viction that all body is contained in space.
   In the paper laid before the Society, an attempt is made to show
the utter barrenness of this hypothesis of a necessary origin (as it is
called) of the idea of space; and the main object of the paper is to
rest the idea on a more solid foundation, by showing the adequacy
of muscular exertion, in conjunction with the sense of touch, to fur
nish us with complete knowledge of the material and extended world
by the ordinary way of actual experience.
  There are two kinds of action; one instinctive, immediately in

                    Cambridge Philosophical Society.                 231
duced by the physical constitution of the agent independent of the
understanding; the other rational, induced by the discernment of
some object of desire in the end to be accomplished, and of course
implying a previous conception of the action in question.
   Familiar instances of instinctive action are then pointed out, from
whence it would appear that the sensations of touch felt on contact
of any part of the living frame with a foreign body operate as motives
to instinctive exertion through the instrumentality of that part of
the muscular frame on which the sensible impression is made, in
stinctively impelling the sentient being to muscular reaction against
the material cause of the sensation, or leading him to shrink from
it if the sensation is of a painful nature.
   Attention is directed in particular to the action of an infant in
stinctively closing his hand upon a finger placed within his palm;
and it is argued that the effect of such an action on his understanding
will be the direct apprehension of body, a complex object consisting
of surface (undeveloped as yet in form and magnitude) apprehensible
by tactual sensation; and substance, revealed by resistance to mus
cular exertion, constituting a new kind of being essentially different
from any of those discerned by means of the five senses.
    The relation between body and space is illustrated by comparison
 with the case of light and darkness, the second of the two correla
 tives belonging in each case to Locke's class of positive ideas from
 negative causes. As he who has once apprehended light is subse
 quently enabled to look for that phaenomenon in a direction from
 whence no rays actually penetrate the eye, so, it is argued, will he
 who has once made use of his hand in the apprehension of body be
 enabled to stretch out the same member in feeling for body when
 none is actually within reach; and as in the former case the failure
 of the effort to discover light results in the sensible impression of
 black or darkness, so in the latter case the effort unsuccessfully
 aimed at the apprehension of body will take effect on the intelli
 gence in the direct cognition or actual experience of space, viz. of
 that particular portion of space through which the hand is moved in
 the unsuccessful search after body.
    Thus the notion of space, like that of body, or of any sensible
 phaenomenon, is traced to the actual experience of the thing itself
 in concrete existence.    The subsequent enlargement of the idea, so
 as to comprehend the space occupied by the solid substance of bodies
 and that which stretches away to infinity in all directions around us,
 is duly accounted for on the same principle; and that impossibility
 of conceiving the destruction of any portion of space, on which so
 much stress has been laid as establishing the necessity of a deeper
 seated origin than simple experience, is shown to be the natural
 consequence of the negative foundation of the idea as explained by
 the analogy of light and darkness.

tion of a Differential Equation of the first order between two vari
ables. By Professor De Morgan.
    By a singular solution of a differential equation is here meant any
solution which can be obtained by differentiation only, whether it be
a case of the primitive by integration or not.
    By a curve is meant all that is included under one equation, whether
resoluble into what are commonly called complete curves or not.
Thus, the equation
                          (w—y) (a^+y?–1)=0
belongs to a curve, having a rectilinear branch and a circular one.
    By such a symbol as v, is meant the partial differential coefficient
#.wº
      when obtained from an equation in which v is explicitly expressed
in terms of w and (it may be) other variables.
    Let p(r, y, c)=0 be the complete primitive of the differential equa
tion y'-x(x, y).
    ©(a, y, c) belongs to two distinct classes of curves:—
    1. Continuous curves derived from such values of c, real or ima
ginary, as will enable p-0 to exist for points infinitely near to one
another.
     2. Systems of points, derived from
                    A(x, y, o, 3)=0, B(x, y, a, 3)=0,
where
       ©(w, y, a + 3 M-1)=A(x, y, a, 3)+B(x, y, z, 6). V-1.
    When a curve is such that the points on one side of it are on
curves of the first kind, and those on the other side are part of
systems of the second kind, let that curve be called a separator; and
the same when it separates points of both kinds from points which
belong to one kind only.
   No solution of the differential equation can be formed by combining
all those systems of the second kind in which a and 3 are connected
by a real relation.
    The curve which has at every point of it, either
                           9, =   00,    £y   = oo,

is a singular solution. And in the above are contained all the sin
gular solutions.
    Every branch of a singular solution is either—
    A separator, only.
    A curve, every point of which has a contact of the first order at
least with some one real primitive, only. Or both. Or neither.
    If the first or last, it is a case of the complete primitive, And

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                233
such cases may be introduced at pleasure into the singular solution,
by writing the primitive in the form                         -
                             p(x, y, fc)=0.
   A branch of a singular solution has at the utmost n contacts with
each primitive which it touches (n being determined by the nature
of the equation), and all of the first order, generally. Or, p, of the
first order, p, of the second, &c., p +2p2-H 3ps-H... being n or n–
(an even number); or some of these cases for some primitives, others
for others, including the possibility of some cases giving none at all,
when n is even.
   The branches of the singular solution which have contact with
ordinary primitives (whether themselves ordinary primitives or not)
to the exclusion of the branches which are only separators, may be
determined from the differential equation by the following test.
   Let y'ax(x, y) be the differential equation; whence
                            y"=x,4-x,x.
   Find the curves which satisfy either of the following sets of con
ditions:–
                    x=o        x,- OO        y" finite,
or
                    x=o        w= const.     y" finite,
Or
                    x,- 2      y= const.     y" finite.
   Every such curve does satisfy the differential equation, and is a
singular solution having contact with some one primitive at every
point.
   And other such singular solutions there are none except those
designated by are oo, or y= o, or both.
   But if
                    x = 2 and x,- 2           y"= o,
or
                    2.5- o       w= const. y"= o,
or
                    x,- 2        y= const. y"= o,
then the differential equation may or may not be satisfied; but the
curve passes through the singular points of the primitives, with or
without contact, according as the differential equation is or is not
satisfied. An evolute is such a pseudo-singular solution to all the
involutes, passing through their cusps.

        ON THE COMPOUNDS OF IODINE AND PHOSPHORUS.
          B. CORENWINDER remarks that the combinations of
       • iodine and phosphorus have been hitherto unknown, means
not having been found for obtaining them in a definite state and in the
crystalline form. A method however exists of preparing these bodies
crystallized. It consists in successively dissolving phosphorus and
iodine in sulphuret of carbon and cooling the solution. Crystals of
iodide of phosphorus are soon deposited, the composition of which
depends upon the quantities employed.
    In operating on two equivalents of iodine and one of phosphorus,
M. Corenwinder obtained prismatic crystals of large dimensions, of
an orange colour, and which by analysis gave the composition I*Ph.
This is the protiodide of phosphorus. It melts at 230°F., alters
by exposure to the air, and volatilizes at a higher temperature. It
may be advantageously employed for preparing hydriodic acid.
   By taking 3 equivalents of iodine and 1 of phosphorus and con
centrating the solution, irregular crystals of a deep reddish-brown
colour are procured; they have the appearance of hexagonal tables.
This is the deutiodide of phosphorus; it melts at about 115°F., and
decomposes by water, yielding hydriodic acid when heated with a
small quantity of liquid.
   In operating on quantities in the proportions of 1 equivalent of
phosphorus and 1 of iodine, crystals of protiodide are obtained, and
excess of phosphorus remains in the liquid.
   With 5 equivalents of iodine and 2 of phosphorus, protiodide cry
stallizes first, and afterwards deutiodide, which gives the following
equation: 5I--2Ph-I-Ph-H ISPh.
   With 4 and 5 equivalents of iodine and 1 of phosphorus, iodine
is at first deposited, then crystals of deutiodide, ISPh.
   By employing sulphuret of carbon as a solvent, M. Corenwinder
was able to obtain several other compounds, as chloride of phos

     DESCRIPTION OF SOME NEW MINERALS FROM NORWAY.
                         BY M. P. H. WEIBYE.
   Tritomite.—This mineral was found in the island of Lamoe, near
Brevig, in isolated crystals, disseminated in a coarse-grained syenite,
and accompanied by leucophane, mosandate, catapleite, &c.
   The crystals are regular tetrahedrons, the faces of which are dull
and covered with a reddish-brown crust; the fracture is conchoidal,
without cleavage, and the lustre is vitreous and metallic.        This
mineral is very harsh, its colour is a deep brown, and its powder is
yellowish-grey; it is opake or translucent only on the edges. Its
hardness is between that of felspar and apatite, and its density is
4°16 to 4-66.
   Before the blowpipe tritomite whitens, exfoliates, and splits,

sometimes flying into fragments. Heated in a tube it loses water,
which acts as weak hydrofluoric acid. With borax it gives a glass
of a reddish-brown colour, which decolorizes on cooling. Reduced
to powder it is attacked by hydrochloric acid, with the evolution of
chlorine, and the separation of gelatinous silica.
   M. Berlin obtained the following as the results of the analysis of
this mineral, which, however, on account of the rarity of the mineral,
are to be considered as merely approximative:—

   From the analysis, this mineral appears to be a hydrated tribasic
silicate of cerium, lantanium, and lime.
   Catapleite.—This mineral accompanies the preceding. It exists
in imperfect crystals, consisting of a prism of about 120°, terminated
by an oblique base, also inclined at about 120°. Sometimes it
exhibits indications of several vertical faces.                               Cleavage perfect ac
cording to the base. Fracture splintery. Dull or very little lustre,
even when fractured. Colour light yellowish-brown, powder isa
bella-yellow; opake or a little chatoyant. Hardness resembling
that of felspar; density 2-8.
   This mineral readily fuses into a white enamel; it dissolves with
difficulty in borax, forming a colourless glass. A solution of cobalt
renders it blue. Reduced to powder it is readily decomposed by
hydrochloric acid, but does not gelatinize.

   Eudnophite.—This mineral was found in the syenite of the island
of Lamoe, with the two first minerals above described.                    Its crystals
are very rare; they are derived from a right rhombic prism, giving
a prism of about 130°, terminated by a bevil, and truncated at the
acute edges. Cleavage perfect according to the base; there also
exists a more difficult one according to the diagonal planes. Frac
ture even, slightly splintery. The faces are dull or a little brilliant,
lustre slightly pearly when fractured. Colour white, passing to
gray or brown; powder white. Fragments translucent or trans
parent. Hardness between that of felspar and apatite. Density 2:27.
   Before the blowpipe this mineral fuses into a colourless glass.
Reduced to powder, it is decomposed by hydrochloric acid with the
formation of gelatinous silica.
   It has been analysed by M. de Bock (I.), and by M. Berlin (II.).

             ON   THE    HYPOSKLERITE     OF   ARENDAL,
                       BY M. C. RAMMELSBERG,
   Hyposklerite is a mineral of a felspathic appearance, which has
been described by M. Breithaupt. An analysis recently made by
M. Hermann seems to separate it completely from the felspars.
M. Rammelsberg has repeated the analysis with a specimen which
he received from M. Breithaupt himself.      He did not find in it any
traces of cerium and lantanium indicated by M. Hermann, and his
results agree exactly with the composition of an albite, mixed with
about 5 per cent. of pyroxene, a supposition which is supported by
the deep blackish green colour interspersed through some parts of
the hyposklerite. It appears therefore that this mineral should not
constitute a distinct species.—Ibid.
         ON THE EXISTENCE OF IODINE IN BEET-ROOT.
   After the discovery of the existence of so important a substance
as iodine in so many bodies, M. Lamy thought it might be in
teresting to state how he had ascertained its presence in the beet
root of the Grand Duchy of Baden.
   In November last M. Lamy received from M. L. Lintz, chemist
at the sugar manufactory of Waghausel in the Grand Duchy, a spe
cimen of beet-root potash for examination, thinking that it contained
iodine.
   Some fragments were accordingly dissolved in distilled water and
saturated with nitric or sulphuric acid; the solution was of a yellow
colour and exhaled the odour of iodine ; by the addition of solution
of starch, it became of an intense blue colour, which disappeared by
heat and reappeared on cooling.
   After frequently repeating this experiment, and being certain of
the existence of an alkaline iodide in the potash of Waghausel, M.
Lamy examined successively the various products of the manufacture
of sugar of this locality, beginning with the saline matter, molasses,
then taking the refined sugar, unrefined sugar, and cossettes, or
beet-root cut into small parallelopipeds and dried.
   The saline matter was treated with hot water as long as it dis
solved anything; the aqueous solution was evaporated to dryness, and
the residue treated with highly rectified alcohol, the solution being
evaporated to dryness; the residue was divided into two portions;
one of these was treated with sulphuric acid and solution of starch,
and the other was tried by M. Reynoso's process; in both cases
the existence of iodine was evident.
   The ash of the molasses was boiled in distilled water; a portion
of the filtered liquor, saturated with nitric or sulphuric acid, gave,
like the potash, a fine blue colour on the addition of solution of
starch; another portion, on spontaneous evaporation, left a cry
stallized residue which was treated with hot alcohol of 40 degrees

238          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
to dissolve the iodide and separate the foreign salts insoluble in it,
The alcoholic solution was evaporated to dryness, and the residue
treated with water yielded a solution which gave a deep blue colour
with starch. This colour was very permanent, disappeared on being
heated and reappeared on cooling.
   The same treatment was followed with sugar unrefined and refined,
but they gave not the least trace of iodine ; the cossettes, on the
contrary, contained this substance; the experiment was several
times repeated and always with the same result.
   The author examined the beet-root from a manufactory in the
neighbourhood of Versailles, but he discovered no trace of iodine in
it. As the manufactory of Waghausel is of great extent, M. Lamy
thinks it probable that all the beet-root used in it may not contain
iodine, and as salts of iodine are not uncommon in the salt-springs
of Germany, he inquires, without attempting to decide, whether
the presence of iodine may not be derived from the assimilation of
the salts of iodine.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Chim., Juillet, 1850.
           ELECTRO-MAGNETISM AS A MOTIVE POWER.
   Professor Page, in the lectures which he is now delivering before
the Smithsonian Institution, states that there is no longer any
doubt of the application of this power as a substitute for steam. He
exhibited the most imposing experiments ever witnessed in this
branch of science.   An immense bar of iron, weighing 160 lbs., was
made to spring up by magnetic action, and to move rapidly up and
down, dancing like a feather in the air, without any visible support.
The force operating upon the bar he stated to average 300 lbs.
through ten inches of its motion. He said he could raise this bar
100 feet as readily as ten inches, and he expected no difficulty in
doing the same with a bar weighing one ton, or a hundred tons.
He could make a pile-driver, or a forge hammer, with great simplicity,
and could make an engine with a stroke of six, twelve, twenty, or any
number of feet. The most beautiful experiment we ever witnessed
was the loud sound and brilliant flash from the galvanic spark, when
produced near a certain point in his great magnet. Each snap was
as loud as a pistol; and when he produced the same spark at a little
distance from this point, it made no noise at all.   This recent dis
covery is said to have a practical bearing upon the construction of
an electro-magnetic engine. He then exhibited his engine of between
four and five horse-power, operated by a battery contained within a
space of three cubic feet. It looked very unlike a magnetic machine.
It was a reciprocating engine of two feet stroke, and the whole en
gine and battery weighed about one ton. When the power was
thrown on by the motion of a lever, the engine started off magnifi
cently, making 114 strokes per minute; though when it drove a
 circular saw, ten inches in diameter, sawing up boards an inch and
a quarter thick into laths, the engine made but about 80 strokes per
minute. The force operating upon this great cylinder throughout
the whole motion of two feet was stated to be 600 lbs. when the
engine was moving very slowly; but he had not been able to ascer

                       Meteorological Observations.                                                 239
tain what the force was when the engine was running at a working
speed, though it was considerably less. The most important and
interesting point, however, is the expense of the power. Professor
Page stated that he had reduced the cost so far that it was less than
steam under many and most conditions, though not so low as the
cheapest steam-engines. With all the imperfections of the engine,
the consumption of 3 lbs. of zinc per day would produce one-horse
power. The larger his engines, contrary to what has been known
before, the greater the oeconomy.           Professor Page was himself sur
prised at the result. There were yet practical difficulties to be over
come, the battery has yet to be improved, and it remains yet to try
the experiment on a grander scale—to make a power of 100 horse,
or more.—National Intelligencer (American paper).

XXIX. Remarks on the Forces experienced by inductively
   Magnetized Ferromagnetic or Diamagnetic Non-crystalline
   Substances. By WILLIAM THoMson, Professor of Natural
   Philosophy in the University of Glasgow *.
THE remarkable law laid down by Faraday in his Me
      moir on the Magnetic Condition of all Matter, that a
small portion of diamagnetic matter placed in the neighbourhood
of a magnet experiences a pressure urging it from places of
stronger towards places of weaker force, is a simple conclusion,
derived from the mathematical solution of the problem of de
termining the action experienced by a small sphere of matter
magnetized inductively, and acted upon in virtue of its induced
magnetism. Without entering upon the analytical investigation,
which will be found in a paper “On the Forces experienced
by small Spheres under Magnetic Influence; and on some of
the Phaenomena presented by Diamagnetic Substancest,” I
shall, in the present communication, state and explain briefly
the result, and point out some remarkable inferences which
may be drawn from it.
   1. Let P be any point in the neighbourhood of a magnet, and
let P be a point at an infinitely small distance, which may be
denoted by a, from P. Let R denote the force which a “unit
north polef" if placed at P would experience, or, as it is

magnetized bar of “unit strength,” which is repelled on the whole from the
north by the magnetism of the earth; “unit strength "being defined by

242      Prof. Thomson on the Forces experienced by inductively
called, “the resultant magnetic force at P;” and let R/denote
the same with reference to P'. Then, if a small sphere of any
kind of non-crystalline homogeneous matter, naturally un
magnetic, but susceptible of magnetization by influence, be
placed at P, it will experience a force of which the component
along PP is
                                 1 R/2- R2
                           P.7.3–7–,
where a denotes the volume of the sphere, and tº a coefficient
depending on the nature of the substance. This coefficient, P.,
has a value a little less than     47 for soft iron, and it has very
small positive values for all ferromagnetic substances con
taining little or no iron.                                               -
    2. If it be true, as I think it must be, that the forces experi
enced by diamagnetic substances are occasioned by the influ
encing magnet magnetizing them inductively *, and acting
upon them when so magnetized, according to the established
laws of the mutual action of two magnets, the preceding re
sult will hold for all non-crystalline matter; and to apply it
to a diamagnetic substance it will be only necessary to give tº
a negative value.
    3. To interpret this result, we may remark, that, by the ele
mentary principles of the differential calculus as applied to the
variation of a quantity depending on the position      12
                                                            of2 a point in
space, it may be shown that the fraction —z- is greater
when the point P is chosen in a certain determinate direction
from P than in any other; that it is of equal absolute value,
but negative, if P be chosen in the opposite direction ; and
dinally, magnetized, and if, when an end of one is placed at a unit (an
inch, for example) of distance from an end of the other, the mutual force
between these ends is unity; the magnetic strength of each is unity. The
force R, defined in the text, is of course equal and opposite to the force
that a “unit south pole” would experience if placed at P.
   * This most natural explanation of the phaenomena which he had dis
covered is suggested by Faraday in his original paper on the subject, and
it is confirmed by the researches of subsequent experimenters, especially
those of Reich and Weber, who have made experiments to show that a
diamagnetic substance, under the influence of two magnets, will act upon
one in virtue of the magnetization which it experiences from the other.
The extreme feebleness of the polarity induced in diamagnetic substances
is proved by Faraday in a series of experiments forming the subject of his
last communication to the Royal Society; in which an attempt is made,
by very delicate means, to test the induced current in a helix due to mag
netization or demagnetization of a diamagnetic substance which it sur
rounds, but only negative results are obtained.

               Magnetized Non-crystalline Substances.           243
that it vanishes if P be in a plane through P at right angles
to the line of those two directions.      Hence it follows that the
resultant force upon the small sphere is along that line, in one
direction or the other, according as w is positive or negative,
and accordingly we draw the following conclusions:—
     (1.) A small ferromagnetic sphere, in the neighbourhood of
a magnet, will experience a force urging it in that direction in
which the “magnetic force” increases most rapidly.
     (2.) A small diamagnetic sphere, in the neighbourhood of a
magnet, will experience a force urging it in that direction in
which the magnetic force decreases most rapidly.
   . (3.) The absolute magnitude of the force in any case in which
the distribution of magnetic force in the neighbourhood of the
magnet is known, is the value   2
                                    which the expression in § 1 ob
                        R!?—
tains when we give —z- the value found by means of the
differential calculus, for a point P' at an infinitely small di
stance PP in the direction of the most rapid variation of the
magnetic force from P, the actual position of the ball.
     4. It is deserving of special remark, that the direction of the
force experienced by the ball has no relation to the direction
of the lines of magnetic force through the position in which it
is placed. The mathematical investigation thus affords full
 confirmation and explanation of the very remarkable observa
 tion made by Faraday (§ 24.18), that a small sphere or cube
 of inductively magnetized substance is in some cases “urged
 along, and in others obliquely or directly across the lines of
 magnetic force.”      It is in fact very easy to imagine, or actu
 ally to construct, arrangements in which the resultant force
 experienced by a ball of soft iron, or of some diamagnetic
 substance, is perpendicular to the lines of the magnetizing
 force. For instance, if a ball of soft iron be placed symme
 trically with respect to the two poles of a horseshoe magnet,
 and at some distance from the line joining them, it will be
 urged towards this line, in a direction perpendicular to it,
 and consequently perpendicular to the lines of magnetizin
 force in the space in which it is situated; and a ball of bis
 muth, or of any other diamagneticsubstance, similarly situated,
 would experience a force in the contrary direction. Or again,
 if a ball of any substance be placed in the neighbourhood of
 a long straight galvanic wire, it will be urged towards or from
 the wire (according as the substance is ferromagnetic or dia
 magnetic) in a line at right angles to it, and consequentl
 cutting perpendicularly the lines of force, which are circles wit
 their centres in the wire and in planes perpendicular to it.
      5. The preceding conclusions enable us to define clearly the
                                   R 2

244 Prof. Thomson on the Forces experienced by inductively
sense in which the terms “attraction ” and “repulsion” may
be applied to the action exerted by a magnet on a ferromag
netic and a diamagnetic body respectively. A small sphere
of ferromagnetic substance, placed in the      .               of
a magnet, experiences in general, a force; but the term attrac
tion, according to its derivation, means a force towards; and
if we apply it in any case, we must be able to supply an ob
ject for the preposition. Now, in this case the force is towards
places of stronger “magnetic force;” and hence the action
experienced by a ferromagnetic ball may be called an attrac
tion if we understand towards places of stronger force. Places
of stronger force are generally nearer the magnet than places
of weaker force, and hence small pieces of soft iron are ge
nerally urged, on the whole, towards a magnet (in consequence
of which no doubt the term “attraction” came originally to
be applied): but, as will be seen below, this is by no means
universally the case; balls of soft iron being, in some cases,
actually repelled from the influencing magnet; and the term
 “attraction” can only be universally used with reference to
ferromagnetic substances, on the understanding that it is
towards places of stronger force. The term “repulsion,” the
reverse of “attraction,” may, according to the same princi
ples, be applied universally to indicate the force with which a
small diamagnetic sphere is urged towards places of weaker
force, or repelled from places of stronger force,
   6. The following passage, containing a statement of principles
 on some of which Faraday himself lays much stress, but which
have not I think been sufficiently attended to by subsequent
experimenters, is quoted from the article in the Mathematical
Journal already referred to.
   7. “The result obtained above affords the true explanation
of the phaenomenon observed by Faraday, that a thin bar or
needle of a diamagnetic substance, when suspended between
the poles of a magnet, assumes a position across the line
joining them. . For such a needle has no tendency to arrange
itself across the lines of magnetic force; but, as will be
shown in a future paper, if it be very small compared with
the dimensions and distance of the magnet (as is the case,
for instance, with a bar of any ordinary dimensions, subject
only to the earth's influence), the direction it will assume,
when allowed to turn freely about its centre of gravity, will
be that of the lines of force, whether the material of which
it consists be diamagnetic, or magnetic matter such as soft
iron; but Faraday's result is due to the rapid decrease of
magnetic intensity round the poles of the magnet, and to the
length of the needle, which is considerable compared with the

               Magnetized Non-crystalline Substances.                 245
distance between the poles of the magnet; and is thus ex
plained by the discoverer himself.           (§ 2269) “The cause of
the pointing of the bar, or any oblong arrangement of the
heavy glass, is now evident. It is merely a result of the ten
dency of the particles to move outwards, or into the positions
of weakest magnetic action.* The joint exertion of the action
of all the particles brings the mass into the position which, by
experiment, is found to belong to it.’”
    8. It may be added to this, that the tendency of a bar,
whether of ferromagnetic or of diamagnetic substance, in a
uniform field of magnetic force, to take the direction of the
lines of force, depends on the effect of the mutual action of the
parts in altering the general magnetization of the bar, and is
consequently so excessively feeble for any known diamagnetic
substance that the most delicate experiments would in all pro
bability fail to render it sensible+.
   9. Faraday’s law, stated at the commencement of these re
marks, may be illustrated by some very curious although
extremely simple experiments, which I shall now describe
brieflyf.
    10. The special apparatus required is merely a long light
arm (I have used one about four feet in height; but a much
shorter rod, if suspended by a finer or by a longer torsion
thread, would have answered equally well) suspended from a
“torsion-head” by means of a very fine wire, or thread of
unspun silk fibres attached to it near its middle; and a case
round it adapted to prevent currents of air from disturbing its
equilibrium, but allowing it sufficient angular motion in a ho
rizontal plane. A small ball of soft iron is attached to one
end of the arm (or hung from it by a fine thread, which, for
the sake of stability in many of the experiments, as for in
stance, experiments 2 and 3 described below, must not be too
long), and a counterbalance is adjusted near the other end so
as to make the arm horizontal. If only a small angular mo
tion be allowed to the arm, the path of the ball will be sen
sibly straight, and we may consider that, by the arrangement
   * “The extreme feebleness of the diamagnetic action, on account of
which any small sphere or cube of the matter will experience very nearly
the same force as if all the rest were removed, seems fully to justify this
explanation.’
   * A very brief communication on this subject was laid before the British
Association at the meeting of 1848, and is published in the Report for that
year, under the title “On the Equilibrium of Magnetic or Diamagnetic
Bodies of any form, under the Influence of Terrestrial Magnetic Force.”
   f These experiments were shown, in illustration of lectures on magnet
ism in the Natural Philosophy Class in the University of Glasgow, during
the Session 1848-49.

246    Prof. Thomson on the Forces ea<U+017F>perienced by inductively
which has been described, the ball is allowed to move with great
freedom in a straight line, but prevented from all other motion.
   11. In making the experiments described below, it is con
venient to have two stops so arranged that the motion of the
arm may be kept within any desired limits, and manageable
in such a way, that by means of them the arm may be rapidly
brought to rest in any position. In general, before com
mencing an experiment, the arm ought to be brought to rest
near one end of its course, and kept pressing very slightly
upon one of the stops by the torsion of the wire, which may
be suitably adjusted by the torsion-head, and the other stop
ought to be pushed away, so as to leave the arm free to move
in one direction.
   12. Experiment 1–Place a common bar-magnet with either
pole, the south, for instance, near the ball of soft iron in its
line of motion, but on that side towards which it is prevented
from moving by the stop. Taking another bar-magnet of
considerably greater strength than the former, bring its north
pole gradually near the fixed south pole of the other, in the
continuation of the line of motion of the iron ball.      When
this north pole reaches a certain position the arm will cease
to press on the stop, and if we push the north pole a little
nearer still, the arm will altogether leave the stop and take a
position of equilibrium, in which, after it is steadied (as may
easily be done by means of the stops), it will remain stable,
although the stops be removed entirely. If, by means of one
of the stops, the ball be pushed to any distance farther from
the magnets than this position of stable equilibrium, it will
return towards it when left free. If it be drawn a little nearer
by means of the other stop, and, when left for a few seconds,
it be found to continue pressing upon the stop, then, when
the stop is removed, the ball will return to that position of
stable equilibrium. If, however, it be very slowly drawn still
nearer the magnets, when it reaches a certain position it will
cease to press on the stop; and if after this it experience the
slightest agitation, or if it be drawn any nearer, it will leave
the stop and move up till it strikes the nearer magnet, in con
tact with which it will almost immediately come to rest. It
thus appears that there is a position of unstable equilibrium
for the ball between the former stable position and the nearer
magnet. It is easy to arrange the torsion-head so that the
torsion of the suspending-thread or wire may have as little
effect as we please, by finding, by successive trials, either of
these positions of equilibrium, subject to the condition that,
when the magnets are removed, the torsion would not sensi
bly disturb the arm from the position so found.

             Magnetized Non-crystalline Substances.           247
   13. After the explanations which have been given above, it
is scarcely necessary to point out that the position of unstable
equilibrium, determined in this experiment, is a point where
the magnetizing force due to the south pole is destroyed by
that of the more distant but more powerful north pole; and
that the position of stable equilibrium is one where the excess
of the magnetizing force due to the north pole, above that
which is due to the less powerful south pole, has a maximum
value with reference to points in the continuation, through the
less powerful pole, of the line joining the two poles. If the
poles were mathematical points, and the bars so long that their
remote ends could produce no sensible action on the ball, the
position of unstable equilibrium would of course be such that
its distances from the two poles would be directly as the square
roots of the strengths of the magnets; and, by the solution of a
most simple “maximum problem,” it may be shown that the
stable position would be such that its distances from the poles
would be directly as the cube roots of the strengths.
   14. Experiment 2.-Place two equal bar-magnets symmetri
cally with reference to the line of motion, with similar poles
at equal distances on two sides, in a perpendicular to this line,
and, to make the best arrangement, let the lengths of the
magnets be in the continuations of the lines joining their poles.
Operating by means of the stops, in a manner similar to that
described for the preceding experiment, it is readily ascer
tained that there are two positions of stable equilibrium for
the ball at equal distances on two sides of the line joining the
poles, and that the middle point of this line is a position of
unstable equilibrium.
   15. Here, again, the explanation is obvious. The positions
of stable equilibrium being such that, with reference to points
in the line of motion of the ball, the magnetizing force due
to the two similar poles may be a maximum, are readily found
                     0.
to be at distances       on the two sides of the line joining the
                   2A/2
poles (the length of this line being denoted by a), if these be
mathematical points, and if the lengths of the bars be so great
that the distant poles produce no sensible effects.
   16. Experiment 3.—Hold a common horseshoe-magnet with
the line joining its poles perpendicular to the line of motion
of the ball, and, by a suitable management of the stops and
of the torsion-head, the existence of a force urging the ball
perpendicularly across the “lines of force” towards the mid
dle point of the line joining the poles, may be easily made
manifest.
   17. Experiments on diamagnetic substances, and on ferro

248    Prof. Thomson on the Forces experienced by inductively
magnetic substances of feeble inductive capacity.—The phaeno
mena discovered by Faraday relative to the action of magnets
on substances not previously known to be susceptible of mag
netic influence may be exhibited with great ease by means of
the apparatus described above. Small balls of the substances
to be experimented upon may be hung from one end of the
balance (the ball of soft iron being of course removed) by fine
threads of sufficient length to allow the arm, which may be of
any substance containing no iron, to be out of reach of any
sensible influence from the magnet employed. There is in these
cases no difficulty, regarding the length of the suspending
thread, of the kind noticed above with reference to soft iron,
as the magnetic forces experienced are never strong enough
to produce lateral instability (that is, a want of stability in the
line of motion), even with the lightest of the substances ex
perimented on, unless the suspending thread be far longer
than is necessary. In the experiments I have made, the
threads bearing the small balls have not been more than
four or five inches long. The diameters of the balls have
been from a quarter of an inch to an inch, or an inch and
a half. Instead of simple bar-magnets of steel, which are
not powerful enough to be convenient for these experiments,
I have used a bar electro-magnet of very moderate power,
consisting of a helix and soft iron core. This core is a cylin
der of about an inch in diameter and a foot and a half long,
with round ends (nearly hemispherical), which, when the core
is in its central position, extend about an inch beyond the
 helix on each side. By these means the repulsion of balls of
 diamagnetic substance, and the attraction of very feebly ferro
 magnetic substances, may be shown with great facility.
    18. For example, I may mention that I have hung a small
 apple, whole, by a thread three or four inches long, and
 putting it at first at rest, pressing slightly (in virtue of torsion
 produced by the torsion head mentioned above) upon one end
 of the soft iron core previously to the excitement of the elec
 tro-magnet, I have found that as soon as the galvanic current
 is produced, the apple is repelled away; and, by pushing for
 ward the soft iron core, I have chased it across the field
 through a space of four or five inches.
    19. I have also used the same apparatus to show that a body
 which is feebly attracted in air is repelled when immersed
 below the surface of a sufficiently strong solution of sulphate
 of iron in a small trough, so arranged that when, by the force
 of torsion, the body immersed in the liquid is made to
 press on a side of the trough, the electro-magnet may be
 placed with one end of its core pressing on the outside of the

             Magnetized Non-crystalline Substances.          249
trough, close to the point where it is pressed upon by the
body within. Using small glass balls (which, when empty,
exhibit no sensible effects of the influence of the magnet), the
magnetic conditions of different liquids filling them may be
easily tested. Faraday's beautiful experiments on the rela
tive magnetic capacities of solutions of sulphate of iron of dif
ferent strengths, or rather, other experiments to illustrate the
same principles, may be performed in an extremely convenient
manner, by filling a glass ball of this kind with a solution,
hanging it from one end of the arm, and, by a suitable ad
justment of the weight at the other, immersing it below the
surface of another solution contained in the trough. I have
found that whenever the difference of the strengths of the two
solutions was considerable, the ball immersed was attracted
or repelled by the external magnet, according as the solution
contained in the ball was stronger or weaker than the solu
tion surrounding it.
     On the stability of small inductively magnetized bodies
                   in positions of equilibrium.
    20. In the paper published in the Mathematical Journal
(referred to above), I pointed out that a small ball of either
ferromagnetic or diamagnetic substance placed in the neigh
bourhood of a magnet, and not acted upon by any non-mag
netic force, is in equilibrium if it be in a situation where the
 “resultant force’’ (that which was denoted by R) is either a
maximum or minimum, or “stationary” in value; that a dia
 magnetic ball is in stable equilibrium if, and not in stable
 equilibrium unless, it be situated where the force R is a mini
 mum in absolute value; and that “if there be any point
 external to the magnet, at which the resultant force has a
 maximum value, it would be a position of stable equilibrium
 for a small bar of soft iron, and any other position is essen
 tially unstable.” Shortly after the publication of that paper,
 I succeeded in proving that the resultant force cannot be an
 absolute maximum at any point external to a magnet, and
 consequently that no position of stable equilibrium for a ferro
 magnetic ball, perfectly free from all constraint, can exist. . I
 have very recently found that there may be points where the
 resultant force is an absolute minimum without being zero;
 and therefore there may be positions of stable equilibrium for
a diamagnetic ball not included in the case of the force va
 nishing, noticed in the previous paper. This case however
 affords the simplest illustration that can be given of that most
 extraordinary fact, that a solid body may be repelled by a
 magnet, or magnets, into a position of stable equilibrium. If,

250       Prof. Thomson on the Forces ea<U+017F>perienced by inductively
 for instance, we take the arrangement (described for Exp. 2
 above) of two bar-magnets, fixed with similar poles near one
 another, we have obviously between these poles a point where
 the resultant force vanishes, and towards which consequently
 a small diamagnetic ball placed anywhere sufficiently near it
 would be repelled. It is easily shown that, actually under
 the action of gravity, a ball of diamagnetic substance would
 be in stable equilibrium a little below this position, without
 any external support or constraint whatever, if only the
 magnets were strong enough. It is, however, extremely im
 probable that any attempt to realize this by experiment will
 succeed, since, even in the most favourable cases, no diamag
 netic repulsion upon a solid has yet been obtained which at
 all approaches in magnitude to the weight of the body. Still
 we must consider that a true theoretical solution of the cele
 brated physical problem + suggested by “Mahomet's coffin"
has been obtained, which is not the least curious among the
 remarkable consequences of Faraday's magnetic discoveries.
  On the relations of Ferromagnetic and Diamagnetic Magneti
                    zation to the Magnetizing Force.
     21. In the mathematical investigation by which the result
stated above was obtained, it is assumed that the magnetization
of the substance of the ball in each case is proportional to the
magnetizing force (although this assumption may of course be
 avoided by merely supposing a to have a value varying with
the force, which will not affect either the investigation or the
form of the result). It appears to me very probable that this
assumption is correct for all known diamagnetic substances, and
for homogeneous feebly ferromagnetic substances ; since it is
equivalent to an assumption that inductive magnetization of
a substance does not impair or in any way alter its suscepti
bility for fresh magnetization by means of another magnet
brought into its neighbourhood. This opinion cannot how
ever at present be regarded but as a mere conjecture, being
as yet unsupported by experiment. It is indeed directly op
    * It is I believe often thought that this problem is solved in the expe
riment in which a needle is attracted into a galvanic helix held with its
axis vertical; but I have convinced myself that the needle always touches
somewhere on the sides of the tube (if there be one round it) or on the
wire of the helix: and I have also ascertained that, when a powerful helix
is used with, in place of the needle, a tin-plate cylinder, even if it be very
little less in diameter than the inner cylindrical surface of the helix, there
is never stable equilibrium without contact between them. Thephaenomenon
of a solid body, hovering freely in the air, in stable equilibrium, without
any external support or constraint, has never, I am convinced, been wit
nessed as the result of any electrical or magnetical experiment.

                Magnetized Non-crystalline Substances.                  251
posed to the following conclusion to which M. Plücker arrives,
from some of his experimental researches:—“J’ai déduit de
la cette loi générale, savoir : que le diamagnétisme décroit
plus vite que le magnétisme quand la force de l'aimant dimi
nue, ou quand la distance des póles augmente” “: but many
of the curious phaenomena from which M. Plücker was led
to this conclusion, and which he adduces in confirmation of
it, do not appear to me to support it, but rather to be con
nected with the peculiar magneto-inductive properties of cry
stalline or quasi-crystalline structure which he discovered
subsequently f; and with respect to those which appear at
first sight really to support it, I have conjectured that they
may admit of explanation solely on the principle expressed in
 Faraday's law, quoted at the commencement of these remarks.
Thus, the experiments upon a watch-glass containing mer
cury, placed at different distances from a magnet, which show
that the resultant force experienced by the watch-glass, in
virtue of its own magnetization as a ferromagnetic substance,
and the contrary magnetization of the diamagnetic mercury,
 is sometimes increased by removing the whole to a slightly
greater distance from the magnet, do not prove that when the
 magnetizing force is diminished the induced magnetization of
the mercury is diminished by a greater fraction of its former
 amount than that of the watch-glass, but are most probably
 to be explained by the circumstance that the “field of force”
 occupied by the mercury and watch-glass, when removed a
 very short distance, is such that the mean value of the differ
 ential coefficient of the square of the force, with reference to
 co-ordinates parallel to the direction of motion of the watch
 glass, is greater than the mean value of the same function,
 through the field occupied when the watch-glass is in contact
 with the magnet. It is of course impossible to give more than
 a general explanation such as this without some specific know
 ledge of the distribution of magnetic force in the neighbour
 hood of the actual magnet employed; but the phaenomena
 described by M. Plücker in this case are undoubtedly of a
 kind that might be anticipated if a vertical bar-magnet be

 252 Prof. Thomson on the Forces experienced by inductively
 used, especially if the upper pole, over which the watch-glass
 is suspended, be flat. An electro-magnet with, for core, a hol
 low cylinder of soft iron open at the ends, would even repel a
 small ferromagnetic body capable of moving along the axis,
 in some positions, and attract it a little further off, since there
 would be variations of force in this case precisely similar to
 those explained with reference to points in the line of motion
 of the ball in experiment 2.
    22. The most striking experiments adduced by M. Plücker
 to support his hypothesis, that “ diamagnetism increases more
 rapidly than magnetism” when the magnetizing force is in
 creased, are those in which the force experienced by a small
 inductively magnetized body in a constant position is tested
 for different strengths of the same electro-magnet, produced by
 using a greater or less number of cells in the exciting battery.
 At the recent Meeting of the British Association in Edin
burgh, I ventured to suggest that a change in the distribution
of magnetic force in the neighbourhood of the magnet, accom
panying an increase or diminution in the strength of the gal
vanic current, might have contributed to produce some of the
singular phaenomena which had been observed; and that there
is some considerable change in the distribution of force in the
neighbourhood of an electro-magnet with a soft iron core in a
state of intense magnetization when, for instance, the strength
of the current is doubled, seems eatremely probable when we con
sider that a piece of soft iron in a state of intense magnetiza
tion cannot be expected to be as open to fresh magnetization as
it would be if not magnetized in the first instance. On the
same occasion I remarked, that some experiments made by
Mr. Joule in connexion with his researches on changes of
dimensions produced in iron bars by magnetic influence, ap
peared to indicate diminished inductive capacities in states of
intense inductive magnetization*. At that time I was not
aware of the recent experimental researches of Gartenhauser
and Müller on the magnetization of soft iron; but I have
since met with a Number of Poggendorff’s Annalen (1850,
No. 3, published last April) containing an account of these
researchest, which completely confirms the second part of
the conjecture I had thrown out. Whether or not, how
ever, the change in the distribution of force is of such a kind
as to account for the phaenomena by which M. Plücker sup
ports the conclusion which has been quoted, it is impossible
to pronounce without a complete knowledge of the circum

 an electro-magnet without a soft iron core.
    23. In one respect M. Plücker's views receive a remark
 able confirmation by Joule and by Gartenhauser and Müller's
 experiments, if it be true that a homogeneous diamagnetic
 substance is inductively magnetizable to an extent precisely
 proportional to the magnetizing force, or deviating less from
 this proportionality than the magnetization of soft iron. For
 if a complex body were made up consisting of a .
 netic substance (either solid or in powder) and an extremely
 small quantity of soft iron in very fine powder or                  .
 spread uniformly through it; a small ball of this body would,
 when acted upon by a feeble magnetizing force, become on the
 whole magnetized like a ferromagnetic, and would be urged
 from places of weaker towards places of stronger force. If now
 the magnetizing force were gradually increased, the “resultant
 magnetic moment” of the complex body would at first in
 crease, then, after attaining a maximum value, decrease to
 zero, after which it would become “negative,” or the ball
 would be on the whole magnetized like a diamagnetic, and
 would be urged from places of stronger towards places of
 weaker force. Such, if I mistake not, is the bearing which
 M. Plücker expects of any complex solid consisting of a
 suitable mixture of ferromagnetic and diamagnetic substances;
 but mere experiments on soft iron, such as those of Joule and
 of Gartenhauser and Müller, do not render it probable that a
 homogeneous feebly ferromagnetic substance, containing no
 iron, or only a very small quantity and that chemically com
 bined, should have its capacity for fresh magnetization dimi
 nished by the slight magnetization which the strongest magnet
 izing force that could be applied would produce. If however
 M. #. experiments be ultimately admitted as conclusive
 (which I think they certainly must be if those in which the
 position of the substance is unaltered be found to succeed
 with a pure electro-magnet), it would be established that the
 capacity for magnetic induction of a solution of sulphate of
 iron" (ferromagnetic), in water (diamagnetic), would diminish
 as the magnetizing force is increased, becoming zero with a
 certain force; and negative, so that the liquid would be on the
 whole diamagnetic, with any greater force.

   * I assume that the sulphate of iron is in a state of complete solution,
as it would be with a slight excess of acid. If the liquid be at all turbid,
on account of a precipitate of oxide of iron, the phaenomena observed by
M. Plücker might be explained as in the case of the complex solid con
taining soft iron in powder spread through the mass.

              XXX. On the Diffusion of Liquids.
            By THoMAs GRAHAM, F.R.S., F.C.S.
                       [Continued from p. 198.]
      5. Separation of Salts of different Bases by Diffusion.
I.     was now evident that inequality of diffusion supplies a
    method for the separation, to a certain extent, of some salts
from each other, analogous in principle to the separation of
unequally volatile substances by the process of distillation.
The potash salts appearing to be always more diffusive than
the corresponding soda salts, it follows, that if a mixed solu
tion of two such salts be placed in the solution phial, the pot
ash salt should escape into the water atmosphere in largest
proportion, and the soda salt be relatively concentrated in the
phial. This anticipation was fully verified.
   (1.) A solution was prepared of equal parts of the anhy
drous carbonates of potash and soda in 5 times the weight of
the mixture of water. Diffused from a small thousand-grain
phial of 1:1 inch aperture, into 6 ounces of water, for nine
teen days, at a temperature above 60°, it gave a liquid of den
sity l’0350, containing a considerable quantity of the salts.
Of these mixed salts, converted into chlorides by the addition
of hydrochloric acid, 9.89 grs., being treated with bichloride
of platinum in the usual manner, gave 19:39 grs. of the double
chloride of platinum and potassium, equivalent to 591 grs. of
chloride of potassium; and left in solution 3.44 grs. of chlo
ride of sodium: loss 0.04 gr. These chlorides represent 5-46
grs. of carbonate of potash and 3'12 grs. of carbonate of soda.
º salts actually diffused out were therefore in the proportion
O<U+017F>–     se
           Carbonate of soda      .   .   .   .   .    36-37
           Carbonate of potash .      .   .   .   . 63.63
                                                      100'00
   (2.) In another similar experiment from a six-ounce phial
into 84 ounces of water, the liquid of the water-jar, after twenty
five days’ diffusion, contained the two carbonates in nearly the
same proportions as before, namely—
           Carbonate of soda .      .   .   .   .   .   35-2
           Carbonate of potash . .          . .     .   64'8
                                                       100°O
   (3.) A partial separation of the salts of sea-water was effected
in a similar manner.
   The sea-water (from Brighton) was of density 1-0265. One

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.           255
thousand grs. of the liquid yielded 35-50 grs. of dry salts, of
which 2,165 grs, were magnesia. The dry salts contain there
fore 6'10 per cent. of that earth.
    Six thousand-grain phials, of 1:1 inch aperture, were pro
perly filled with the sea-water and placed in six tumblers, each
of the last containing 6 ounces of water. Temperature about
50°. The diffusion was interrupted after eight days. The
salts of the sea-water were now found to be divided as follows:—
Diffused into the tumblers .          92.9 grs, or 36'57 per cent.
 Remaining in the phials . . 161-1 grs., or 63.48 per cent.
                                     254"()        100'00
    Rather more than one-third of the salts has therefore been
transferred from the solution phials to the water-jars by dif
fusion.
    Of the diffused salts in the tumblers, 46.5 grs. were found
to contain, 1.90 gr. magnesia, or 4.09 per cent.        Hence we
have the following result:-
    Magnesia originally in salts of sea-water . 6:01 per cent.
    Magnesia in salts diffused from sea-water . 4.09 per cent.
The magnesia, also, must in consequence be relatively con
centrated in the liquid remaining behind in the diffusion cells.
    A probable explanation may be drawn from the last results
of the remarkable discordance in the analysis of the waters of
the Dead Sea, made by different chemists of eminence. I
refer to the relative proportion of the salts, and not their ab
solute quantity, the last necessarily varying with the state of
dilution of the saline water when taken up. The lake in
question falls in level 10 or 12 feet every year, by evaporation.
A sheet of fresh water of that depth is thrown over the lake
in the wet season, which water may be supposed to flow over
a fluid nearly 1-2 in density, without greatly disturbing it.
 The salts rise from below into the superior stratum by the
diffusive process, which will bring up salts of the alkalies with
 more rapidity than salts of the earth, and chlorides, of either
 class, more rapidly than sulphates. The composition of water
near the surface must therefore vary greatly, as this process
 is more or less advanced.
    (4.) I may be allowed to add another experiment which is
curious for the protracted immobility of a column of water
 which it exhibits, as well as for the separation occurring, which
last may be interesting also in a geological point of view. A
 plain glass cylinder with a foot, 11 inches in height, and of
 which the capacity was 64 cubic inches, had 8 cubic inches
poured into it of a saturated solution of carbonate of lime in

256         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
carbonic acid water, containing also 200 grs. of chloride of
sodium dissolved. Distilled water was then carefully poured
over the saline solution, so as to fill up the jar, a float being
 used and the liquid disturbed as little as possible in the ope
ration. The mouth of the jar was lastly closed by a ground
glass plate, and it was left undisturbed upon the mantel-piece
of a room without a fire, from March 20 to September 24 of
the present year, or for six months and four days. Afterwards,
on removing the cover, the fluid was observed not to have
evaporated sensibly, and it exhibited no visible deposit. This
I was not surprised at, as no deposit appeared in a similar
experiment with the jar uncovered, after the lapse of six weeks.
The liquid in the former jar was now carefully drawn off by
a small siphon with the extremity of both its limbs recurved
so as to open upwards, in four equal portions, which may be
numbered from above downwards. Equal quantities of the
four strata of liquids gave the following proportions of chlo
ride of sodium and carbonate of lime:—
                          Chloride of sodium. Carbonate of lime.
              No.  1.          21-91               O“10
              No.  2.          23°41               O-22
              No.  3.          23°55               O'38
              No.  4.          23°99               0.42
   The diffusion of the chloride of sodium has therefore not
yet reached complete uniformity, although approaching it,
the proportion of that salt obtained from the top and bottom
strata being as 11 to 12. But the diffusion of the carbonate
of lime appears much less advanced, the proportion of that
substance being as 1 to 4 at the top and bottom of the liquid
column. The slight difference in density of the strata, it may
be further remarked, must have been sufficient to preserve
such a column of liquid entirely quiescent, as shown by the
distribution of the carbonate of lime, during the considerable
changes of temperature of the season.
   Chemical analysis, which gives with accuracy the propor
tions of acids and bases in a solution, furnishes no means of
deciding how these acids and bases are combined, or what
salts exist in solution. But it is possible that light may be
thrown on the constitution of mixed salts, at least when they
are of unequal diffusibility, by means of a diffusion experi
ment. With reference to sea-water, for instance, it has been
a question in what form the magnesia exists, as chloride or as
sulphate; or how much exists in the one form and how much
in the other. Knowing however the different rates of diffu
sibility of these two salts, which is nearly chloride 2 and sul

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.        257
phate 1, and their relation to the diffusibility of chloride of
sodium, we should be able to judge from the proportion in
which the magnesia travels in company with chloride of so
dium, whether it is travelling in the large proportion of chlo
ride of magnesium, in the small proportion of sulphate of
magnesia, or in the intermediate proportion of a certain mix
ture of chloride and sulphate of magnesia. But here we are
met by a difficulty. Do the chloride of magnesium and sul
phate of magnesia necessarily pre-exist in sea-water in the
proportions in which they are found to diffuse? May not the
more easy diffusion of chlorides determine their formation in
the diffusive act, just as evaporation determines the formation
of a volatile salt—producing carbonate of ammonia, for in
stance, from hydrochlorate of ammonia with carbonate of lime
in the same solution ? We shall see immediately that liquid
diffusion, as well as gaseous evaporation, can produce che
mical decompositions.
             6. Decomposition of Salts by Diffusion.
   (1.) At an early period of the inquiry, a solution was dif
fused of bisulphate of potash, saturated at 68° and of density
1:280, from the six-ounce phial of 1.175 inch aperture, into
20 ounces of water. The period of diffusion extended to fifty
days. About the middle of that period, a few small crystals
of sulphate of potash, amounting probably to 3 or 4 hun
dredths of a grain, appeared in the diffusion cell and never
afterwards dissolved away. When terminated, the liquid re
maining in the solution cell was found of density 1-154; that
in the water-jar 1.0326. A portion of the latter liquid gave
by analysis—
   Sulphate of potash . . . 20:37
   Sulphate of water . . . 11:47        }Bisulphate  of potash.
   Sulphate of water . . . . 1277
                                  44°61
   It thus appears that the bisulphate of potash undergoes
decomposition in diffusing, and that the acid diffuses away to
about double the extent, in equivalents, of the sulphate of pot
ash. This greater escape of the acid will also account for the
deposition of crystals of the neutral sulphate in the solution
cell.
   (2.) A similar experiment was made with another double
sulphate of greater stability, common potash-alum. The so
lution of 4 anhydrous alum in 100 water, was diffused from
the six-ounce phial into 24 ounces of water, at 64°2, for eight
days. The quantity of salt diffused in that time amounted
only to 7-48 grs. It contained 1.06 gr. alumina, which is
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 37. No. 250. Oct. 1850.          S

258        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
equivalent to 5.33 grs, of alum. The diffused salt gave off
no acid vapours at 600°. We may therefore suppose the ex
cess of salt which is diffused to be sulphate of potash. The
diffusion product of alum, at 64°, appears to be—
        Alum      .   .  .  . .   .    5°33          71°26
         Sulphate of potash   .   . 2:15             28-74
                                       7-48         100'00
   In a second experiment, the diffusion product amounted to
6:39 grs., of which 0.95 gr. was alumina; and it is represented
by 4.77 alum and 1.52 sulphate of potash.
   In connexion with the low diffusibility of the sulphate of
alumina of alum, it was found that the addition of caustic
potash to the alum solution, so as to convert it into an alumi
nate of potash, increased the diffusibility of the alumina. The
diffusion product from the 4 per cent. solution of alum so
treated contained 1-62 gr. of alumina in one experiment and
 1:54 in another.
   As alum is a salt of great stability, it presents a severe test
of the influence in question. The decomposition of this double
salt by diffusion was further confirmed therefore in experi
ments made by means of the four-ounce diffusion phials of
 1.25 inch aperture, and the alteration which the salt undergoes
in the process more exactly ascertained. The experiments
were made at a mean temperature of 57°9, and lasted seven
days; the solution employed being of 4 anhydrous alum to
 100 water, as before.
   In three experiments, the salt diffused out amounted to
5.78, 5.80 and 5'65 grs. ; of which the mean is 5’73 grs. The
latter quantity gave 0.82 alumina and 3.22 sulphuric acid,
which correspond to 4'1 1 anhydrous alum and 1-62 neutral
sulphate of potash. Or, we have as the diffusion product of
alum, in 100 parts—
              Alum .     .  . .   .    .  .  .  71-73
              Sulphate of potash . . .       .  28-27
                                               100'00
   This analysis corresponds closely with the diffusion product
of the former experiments, which gave 71-26 per cent. of alum.
The solution of alum which remains behind in the solution
phials must of course acquire an excess of sulphate of alumina.
   The salt, sulphate of alumina, did not appear to be decom
posed when diffused alone. A four per cent. solution of the
hydrated sulphate of alumina, which is manufactured at New
castle, when diffused in the same circumstances as the prece
ding solutions of alum, gave 3:40 grs. of anhydrous sulphate
of alumina, in which the acid was to the alumina as 2.95 equi
valents of the former to 1 equivalent of the latter, or as nearly
                                    *-  :

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.           259
as possible in the proportion of 3 equivalents of acid to 1 of
base. As the Newcastle salt contained almost exactly half its
weight of water, the 3:40 grs. of anhydrous salt diffused out
are equivalent to 6'80 grs. of hydrated sulphate of alumina.
The sulphate of alumina appears thus to be more diffusive
than the double sulphate of alumina and potash, in the pro
portion of 6-80 to 5’73.
   (3.) It was interesting to observe what really diffuses from
the ammoniated sulphate of copper (CuO, SO", 2NH4+ HO),
and to find if the low diffusibility of that salt is attended with
decomposition. The diffusion of the ammoniated sulphate of
copper was therefore repeated from a 4 per cent. solution in
the six-ounce solution phial, for eight days, at 64°-2 In eva
porating the water of the jar afterwards, the ammoniated sul
phate of copper present was necessarily decomposed, by the
escape of ammonia, and a subsulphate of copper precipitated.
The copper found, however, was estimated as neutral sulphate
of copper. The diffusion product of two experiments may be
represented as follows, in grains:—
                                            I           II.
        Sulphate of copper . . . oši                   O-97
        Sulphate of ammonia . . 5.46                   5°53
                                          6-27         6'50
   The abundant formation and separation of sulphate of am
monia in these experiments, prove that the ammoniated sul
phate of copper is largely decomposed in diffusion.
   (4.) Perhaps the most interesting result of this kind is a
solution which is given of the problem of the decomposition of
the alkaline sulphates by means of lime.
   Solutions were prepared of 4 per cent. of sulphate of potash
and of chlorides of potassium and sodium in lime-water. Two
solution phials were filled with each of these solutions, and
placed for diffusion in water-jars filled with lime-water, at 49°,
for seven days.
   In the sulphate no deposition of crystallized sulphate of
lime took place within the solution phial, while the water
jar acquired an alkaline reaction, which remained after preci
pitating the lime entirely by carbonic acid gas and evaporating
twice to dryness. Hydrate of potash, it will afterwards ap
pear, is an eminently diffusive salt, having double the diffusi
bility of sulphate of potash. The tendency of the former to
diffuse enables the affinity of the lime for sulphuric acid to
prevail, and the alkali is liberated and diffused away into the
external atmosphere of lime-water. By the latter, hydrate of
lime is returned to the solution cell and the decomposition
continued.    The salt diffused in the two cells amounted to
2.60 grs., of which 0.62 gr., or 23.85 per cent., was hydrate
                                S 2

 260         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
 of potash. The chlorides of potassium and sodium, on the
 contrary, were not sensibly decomposed.
     It is known that a precipitation of sulphate of lime may
 occur, with a larger proportion of sulphate of potash in lime
 water, in a close phial without external diffusion. As the
 decomposition of the sulphate of potash, in the latter case,
 has been referred to the insolubility of the sulphate of lime,
 so the decomposition in the former circumstances is referred,
 in a similar sense, to the high diffusibility of hydrate of potash.
                   7. Diffusion of Double Salts.
    How is the diffusion of two salts affected by their condition
of combination as a double salt?        A solution of the double
 sulphate of magnesia and potash, in the proportion of 100
water to 4 anhydrous salt, was operated upon in the four
ounce diffusion phials of 1.25 inch aperture, with a period of
diffusion of seven days, at 57°.9 F. The diffusion product
of the double salt was 8'09 and 7.81 grs. in two experiments:
mean, 7.95 grs.
    The constituent salts, sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of
potash, were now dissolved separately, in the proportions in
which they existed in the double salt, namely, 1.65 gr. anhy
drous sulphate of magnesia in 100 water, and 2:35 grs. sul
phate of potash in 100 water, making up together 4 parts of
salts. The two solutions thus contain equivalent quantities
of the different sulphates.
    The separate diffusion of the sulphate of magnesia was 2:09,
2.11 and 2:40 grs. in three cells; and of the sulphate of pot
ash, 5'83, 5'97 and 5'54 grs. in three cells; the circumstances
of the experiments being the same as those of the double salt.
The means of the two salts are 2:20 and 5.78 grs.; and the
sum of the two means 7-98 grs. The result is, that the sepa
rate diffusion of the constituent salts is almost identical with
their diffusion when combined as a double salt:—
Diffusion of the double sulphate of magnesia and           7.95
                                                                grs.

Diffusion of equivalents of sulphate of magnesia           7-98
    and sulphate of potash in separate cells . .       }        grs.
    It would thus appear that the diffusibility of this double
salt is the sum of the separate diffusions of its constituent salts.
    It has been a question whether a double salt is formed at
once when its constituent salts are dissolved together, or not
till the act of crystallization of the compound salt. Equiva
lents of the same two sulphates, making up 4 parts, were dis
solved together without heat in 100 water. Now the diffusion
from this mixture, which has the composition of the preceding

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.          261
solution of the double salt, exhibited notwithstanding a sen
sibly different result of diffusion, giving 7-28, 7.37 and 7.26
grs. in three cells; mean, 7.30 grs. The diffusion of the double
salt was greater, namely, 795 grs. Hence a strong presump
tion that the mixed salts last diffused were not combined, and
that the double sulphate of magnesia and potash is not neces
sarily formed immediately upon dissolving together its consti
tuent salts.
   In early experiments of a similar nature made upon the
double salt, sulphate of copper and potash, and upon a mix
of the two sulphates newly dissolved together, a similar result
was obtained.     While the diffusion of the mixed salts was
25-6 grs., that of the same weight of the combined salts (the
double sulphate) was 30 grs. The double salt appears more
diffusible, in both cases, than its mixed constituents.
   These double salts appear to dissolve in water without de
composition, although the single salts may meet in solution
without combining. Hence in a mixture of salts we may have
more than one state of equilibrium possible. And when a
salt, like alum, happens to be dissolved in such a way as to
decompose it, the constituents are not necessarily reunited by
subsequent mixing. . Many practices in the chemical arts;
which seem empirical, have their foundation possibly in facts
of this kind.
    8. Diffusion of one Salt into the Solution of another Salt.
   It was curious and peculiarly important, in reference to the
relation of liquid to gaseous diffusion, to find whether one salt
A would diffuse into water already charged with an equal or
greater quantity of another salt B, as a gas a freely diffuses
into the space already occupied by another gas b; the gas b
in return diffusing at the same time into the space occupied
by a. Or whether, on the contrary, the diffusion of the salt
A is resisted by B. The latter result would indicate a neu
tralization of the water's attraction, and a kind of equivalency
or equality of power and exchangeability of different salts, in
respect of that effect, which would divide entirely the phaeno
mena of liquid from those of gaseous diffusion.
   (1.) A solution of 4 parts of carbonate of soda to 100 water,
of density 1-0406, was placed in the six-ounce diffusion phial
of 1' 175 inch aperture, and allowed to communicate with 24
ounces of water.
   Two similar diffusion phials, equally charged, were im
mersed in 24 ounces of a solution of 4 parts of chloride of
sodium to 100 water, having the density 1-0282. The diffu
sion proceeded for eight days, in all cases, at 64°. The pro
portion of carbonate of soda found without in the water-jar

262         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
afterwards, was ascertained by an alkalimetrical process, the
neutralization being effected at the boiling-point. The follow
ing are the results:—
Experiment I. Diffusion product U 9:06 grs. of carbonate of
   into water         e  -  -   - -        soda.
 Experiment II. Diffusion product U8'82 grs. of carbonate of
  into solution of chloride of sodium      soda.
Experiment III. Diffusion product U9-10 grs. of carbonate of
  into solution of chloride of sodium      soda.
   It thus appears that 4 per cent of chloride of sodium
present in the water atmosphere of the jar has no sensible
effect in retarding the diffusion into it, from the solution cell,
of carbonate of soda from a solution containing also 4 per
cent. of the latter.
   (2.) The experiment was varied by allowing the solution
of carbonate of soda to diffuse into a solution of sulphate of
soda, a salt more similar to the former in solubility and com
position. The solution of the latter, containing 4 per cent.,
was of density 1-0352. The temperature and period of dif
fusion were the same as before:—
Experiment IV. Diffusion product U.7:84 grs. of carbonate of
   into solution of sulphate of soda <U+017F> soda.
Experiment V. Diffusion product U.7-82 grs. of carbonate of
   into solution of sulphate of soda       soda.
   Here we find a small reduction in the quantity of carbonate
of soda diffused, amounting to one-eighth of the whole. The
sulphate of soda has therefore exercised a positive interference
in checking the diffusion of the carbonate to that extent. So
small and disproportionate an effect however is scarcely suffi
cient to establish the existence of a mutual elasticity and re
sistance between these two salts.
   Still it might be said, may not the diffusion of one salt be
resisted by another salt which is strictly isomorphous with the
first?
   (3.) A solution of 4 parts of nitrate of potash to 100 of
water, of density 1-0241, placed in the solution phial, was
allowed to communicate with water containing 4 per cent. of
nitrate of ammonia in the water-jar, which last solution was
of density 1-0186; with all other circumstances as before.
With one solution phial having the usual aperture, 1.175 inch,
the diffusion product was 15:32 grs. of nitrate of potash. With
a second phial, having a larger aperture of 1:190 inch, the
diffusion product was 18:03 grs. of nitrate of potash. No
comparative experiment, on the diffusion of nitrate of potash
into water, was made at the same time.        But nitrate of am
monia, which appeared before to coincide in diffusibility with

             Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.         263
nitrate of potash, gave on a former occasion, in similar cir
cumstances, and at 64°9, nearly the same temperature, a dif
fusion product of 15.80 grs. The quantity of nitrate of pot
ash (15:32 grs.) which diffused into the solution of nitrate of
ammonia approaches so closely to the number quoted, that
we may safely conclude that the diffusion of nitrate of potash
is not sensibly resisted by nitrate of ammonia, although these
two salts are closely isomorphous. They are still therefore
inelastic to each other, like two different gases.
    These experiments have been made upon dilute solutions,
and it is not at all impossible that the result may be greatly
modified in concentrated solutions of the same salts, or when
the solutions approach to saturation. But there is reason to ap
prehend that the phaenomena of liquid diffusion are exhibited
in the simplest form by dilute solutions, and that concentration
of the dissolved salt, like compression of a gas, is attended
often with a departure from the normal character.
    On approaching the degree of pressure which occasions the
liquefaction of a gas, an attraction appears to be brought into
play, which impairs the elasticity of the gas; so on approach
ing the point of saturation of a salt, an attraction of the salt
molecules for each other, tending to produce crystallization,
comes into action, which will interfere with and diminish that
elasticity or dispersive tendency of the dissolved salt which
occasions its diffusion.
    We are perhaps justified in extending the analogy a step
further between the characters of a gas near its point of lique
faction and the conditions which we may assign to solutions.
The theoretical density of a liquefiable gas may be completely
disguised under great pressure. Thus, under a reduction by
pressure of 20 volumes into 1, while the elasticity of air is
 1972 atmospheres, that of carbonic acid is only 1670 atmo
spheres, and the deviation from their normal densities is in
the inverse proportion. Of salts in solution the densities may
be affected by similar causes, so that although different salts
in solution really admit of certain normal relations in density,
these relations may be concealed and not directly observable.
    The analogy of liquid diffusion to gaseous diffusion and
 vaporization is borne out in every character of the former
 which has been examined. Mixed salts appear to diffuse in
dependently of each other, like mixed gases, and into a water
 atmosphere already charged with another salt as into pure
 water. Salts also are unequally diffusible, like the gases, and
separations, both mechanical and chemical (decompositions),
are produced by liquid as well as by gaesous diffusion. But
 it still remains to be found whether the diffusibilities of differ
ent salts are in any fixed proportion to each other, as simple

264        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
numerical relations are known to prevail in the diffusion velo
cities of the gases, from which their densities are deducible.
    It was desirable to make numerous simultaneous observa
tions on the salts compared, in order to secure uniformity of
conditions, particularly of temperature. The means of greatly
multiplying the experiments were obtained by having the so
lution phial cast in a mould, so that any number of solution
cells could be procured of the same form and dimensions.
The phials were of the form represented (fig. 3), Fig. 3.
holding about 4 ounces, or more nearly 2080 grs. of
water to the base of the neck, and the mouths of all
were ground down, so as to give the phial a uniform
height of 3-8 inches. The mouth or neck was also
ground to fit a gauge-stopper of wood, which was
0.5 inch deep and slightly conical, being 1:24 inch
in diameter on the upper, and 1.20 inch on the lower
surface.    These are therefore the dimensions of the
 diffusion aperture of the new solution cells. A little
 contrivance to be used in filling the phials to a constant di
 stance of half an inch from the surface of the lip, proved useful.
 It was a narrow slip of brass plate, having a descending pin
 of exactly half an inch in length fixed on one side of it (fig. 4).
This being laid across the
mouth of the phial with the                   Fig. 4.

the neck was then filled up
with distilled water, with the aid of the little float as before
described. The water-jar, in which the solution phial stood,
was filled up with water also as formerly, so as to cover the
phial entirely to the depth of 1 inch. This water atmosphere
amounted to 8750 grs., or about 20 ounces. A glass plate
was placed upon the mouth of the water-jar itself to prevent
evaporation. Sometimes 80 or 100 diffusion cells were put
in action at the same time. The period of diffusion chosen
was now always exactly seven days, unless otherwise men
tioned.                -
      II. DIFFUsion of SALTs of PotASH AND AMMONIA.
   Solutions were prepared of the various salts, in a pure state,
in certain fixed proportions, namely, 2, 4, 63 and 10 parts of
salt to 100 parts of water by weight. The density of these
solutions was observed by the weighing-bottle, at 60°. The
solutions were frequently diffused at two different tempera

tures; one, the temperature of the atmosphere, which was
fortunately remarkably constant during most of the experi
ments to be recorded at present, and the other, a lower tem
perature, obtained in a close box of large dimensions, con
taining masses of ice. The results at the artificial temperature
were obviously less accurate than those of the natural tempe
rature, but have still considerable value. Three experiments
were generally made upon the diffusion of each solution at the
higher, with two experiments at the lower temperature.
   (1.) The carbonate and sulphate of potash and sulphate of
ammonia were first diffused during a period of seven days, of
which the temperatures observed by a thermometer placed
near the water-jars were 64°-5, 65°, 63°5, 68°, 63°, 68°5, 65°
and 66°; mean temperature 64°-2.

   The diffusion product was obtained by evaporating the
water of each jar separately as before, and the result is ex
pressed in grains.
   It will be observed at once, on comparing the means of the
experiments, that the three salts under consideration are re
markably similar in their diffusion, particularly with the smaller
proportions of salt. Thus the mean diffusion of the 2, 4, 63
and 10 parts of the salts is as follows:—
                         Diffusion at 64°2.

   The proportions diffused are sensibly equal, of the different
salts, at the higher temperature, with the exception of the
largest proportion of salt, 10 per cent., when a certain diver
gence occurs. This last fact is consistent with our expecta
tions, that the diffusion of salts would prove most highly
normal in dilute solutions. Some of the irregularities at the
lower temperature are evidently of an accidental kind.
   (2.) The neutral chromate and acetate of potash were dif
fused at a temperature ranging from 63° to 65°, or at a mean
temperature of 64°1, which almost coincides with the higher
temperature of the last experiments.

    It is singular to find that salts differing so much in consti
tution and atomic weight as the chromate and bichromate of
potash, may be confounded in diffusibility. The diffusion
products of these two salts are, for the 2 per cent. solutions,
5-77 and 5'65 grs., and for the 4 per cent. solution, 11:19 and
11:49 grs. The bicarbonate of potash also exhibits a consi
derable analogy to the carbonate, but resembles still more
closely the acetate. It is thus obvious that equality, or simi
larity, of diffusion is not confined to the isomorphous groups
of salts.
   (4.) The nitrates of potash and ammonia have already ap
peared to be equidiffusive at two different temperatures.
They were diffused again in the same proportions as the last
salts, at a temperature varying from 63° to 67°5.

   Although these salts correspond closely, it is probable that
neither the diffusion of these nor the diffusion of any others is
absolutely identical. The nitrate of ammonia appears to
possess a slight superiority in diffusion over the nitrate of pot
ash, which increases with the large proportions of salt in solu
tion. They are both considerably more diffusible than the
seven preceding salts.

   These two salts agree well in diffusibility, and are also evi
dently related to the preceding nitrates. The quantity of
chloride of ammonium diffused was determined by evapora
tion, which is troublesome and may lead to small errors, from
the volatility and efflorescent tendency of this salt. It would
be easier and more accurate to determine this and other chlo
rides by the use of a normal solution of nitrate of silver, and
so avoid evaporation.

   The quantities diffused of these two chlorides are more
closely in proportion to the strength of the original solution,
than with any of the preceding salts of potash. Thus the
quantities diffused from the 2 and 10 per cent. solutions of
chloride of potassium are 7.70 and 86-93 grs., which are as 2
to 9'6, which is nearly as 2 to 10. Chloride of sodium was
observed before to be nearly uniform in this respect; but other
salts appear to lose considerably in diffusibility with the higher

proportions of salt.              It is possibly a consequence of the cry
stallizing attraction, to which reference was lately made, coming

temperature ranging from 63° to 65°, of which the mean was
64°1.

   The solutions of chlorate of potash must be evaporated and
the residuary salt dried at a temperature not exceeding 212°,
otherwise a very sensible quantity of chloride of potassium
may be formed. The chlorate appears to be sensibly inferior
in diffusibility to the nitrate of potash. From the 4 per cent.
solution of the chlorate we have a diffusion product of 13.27
grs., and from the corresponding solution of the nitrate 1397
grs.; but the latter was obtained at a temperature 1°8 higher
than the former. It remains a question whether chlorate of
potash does not really belong to the nitre group of salts, but
has its diffusion interfered with by some secondary agency,
 such as its sparing solubility and consequent nearer approach
 to the saturating proportion.
    It is certainly true that the uniformity of diffusion generally
 increases with the dilution of the solutions. This appears on
 comparing the diffusion of the 4 per cent. solution of what
 may be called the sulphate of potash group, with the diffusions
 of the 2 per cent. solutions of the same salts.

    Thus while the 4 per cent. solutions range from 10:27 to
 11:49 grs., or from 100 to 1118, the 2 per cent. solutions
range from 5:45 grs, to 5'85 grs., or from 100 to 107.3.
    As it appeared to be in dilute solutions that the greatest
uniformity of diffusion is to be expected, a series of experi
ments was instituted upon the preceding salts, with the ad
dition of acetate of potash, which appeared to belong to the
same class, the solution employed being that of 1 salt to 100
water. The experiments were made in a vault, of which the
temperature was nearly uniform, falling in a gradual manner
from 59° to 58°, with a mean of 58°5 during the period of
seven days which the diffusion lasted. Eight phials of each
salt were diffused, and the liquids of four water-jars evaporated
together.
    Carbonate of potash gave 10:42 and 10:59 grs. of salt dif
fused; mean 10:51 grs., or 2.63 grs. for one cell.
   Sulphate of potash gave 10-72 and 1078 grs. of salt dif
fused: mean 1075 grs., or 2.69 grs, for one cell.
   Acetate of potash, its diffusion product being treated with
an excess of hydrochloric acid, gave 8:30 and 8.04 grs. of
chloride of potassium, equivalent to 10-91 and 10:57 grs. of
acetate of potash; mean 1074 grs. of acetate of potash, or
2.68 grs. for one cell. The diffusion of these three salts is
therefore remarkably similar:-
           Diffusion of 1 per cent. solutions at 58°5.
           Carbonate of potash . . . . 2-63 grs.
           Sulphate of potash . . . . 269 grs.
           Acetate of potash . . . . 2.68 grs.
   The 1 per cent. solution of neutral or yellow chromate of
potash in good crystals gave 11:28 and 11'35 grs.; mean
 11:31 grs, or 2.83 grs. for each cell. It was remarked of the
diffused chromate in this experiment, that it contained a sen
sible quantity of green oxide of chromium. The diffusion of
a salt appears indeed to try its tendencies to decomposition
very severely.
   The bicarbonate of potash gave 8-83 and 8:35 grs. of chlo
ride of potassium, the diffusion product being neutralized with
hydrochloric acid; equivalent to 11:25 and 11-21 grs. of bi
carbonate of potash; mean 11:23 grs., or 2.81 grs. for one cell.
   The bichromate of potash gave 11:54 and 11:49 grs. of salt
diffused; mean 11:51 grs., or 2.88 grs. for one cell. These
last three salts give all a larger diffusion product than the
preceding three, while they agree well together. It is doubtful
whether this excess in their diffusion is occasioned by a par
tial decomposition in the act of diffusion, which might be of

   such a kind as to increase the real or apparent diffusion in
   every one of them, or whether it is a peculiar character of this
   little group, to which the ferricyanide of potassium, it will be
  afterwards seen, falls to be added, while the ferrocyanide ap
  pears to belong to the other group :-

      The divergence from each other of two salts so closely iso
   morphous as sulphate and chromate of potash, in the propor
  tion of 100 to 105-2, is certainly remarkable, unless due to a
  slight decomposition of the latter.
           (7.) Ferrocyanide and Ferricyanide of Potassium.
      Of these two salts the 1 per cent. solution only was diffused.
  The time of diffusion was seven days, as usual; the mean tem
  perature 54°5. In evaporating the liquid of the water-jars,
  both salts were partially decomposed, so that it became neces
  sary to estimate the diffusion product by a determination of
  the potash. Eight cells were employed for one salt and six
  for the other, and the liquids of the water-jars evaporated two
  together.
      The diffusion product of ferrocyanide of potassium (anhy
  drous) was 5:02, 5:22, 5.02 and 5:20 grs. ; mean 5'12 grs., or
  for one cell 2.56 grs.
      The diffusion product of ferricyanide of potassium was 5'54,
  5:64 and 5.36 grs.; mean 5.51 grs., or for one cell 2.75 grs.
      Three cells of a similar solution of sulphate of potash which
  were diffused for seven days at a mean temperature 1* lower,
  or of 53°5, gave 2:56, 2:53 and 2.62 grs. ; mean for one cell
  2.57 grs., a number which almost coincides with that of the
  ferrocyanide of potassium (2.56 grs.). The ferricyanide of
  potassium, on the other hand, is sensibly more diffusive, as
  107.6 to 100, and appears to rank with the bicarbonate and
  bichromate of potash. The ferricyanide of potassium, again,
  is a salt which probably undergoes a slight decomposition in
  diffusion like those salts mentioned:—

same manner, and I shall now add a third series of results
obtained from the diffusion of 1 per cent. solutions of the same
salts. The temperature of diffusion of this new series was
64°5. Six phials of each salt were diffused, and they were
evaporated afterwards two and two. This double diffusion
product, however, is divided by 2 in the table.

    It is interesting to observe how the chlorate of potash rises
in the lower proportions and approaches to the normal rate
of its class. The diffusion products of all the salts are obvi
ously more uniform for the two than for the 4 per cent. solu
tions, and again more uniform for the 1 than for the 2 per
cent. solutions. The extremes in the 1 per cent. solutions
are 3:66 grs. chlorate of potash, and 3.89 grs. chloride of am
monium, which are as 1 to 1-0628. We have here an ap
proach to equality in diffusion, which appears to be as close
as the experimental determinations are of the specific heat of
 different bodies belonging to one class. The numbers for the
specific heat of equivalents of the metallic elements are known
 to vary as 38 to 42.                                            -
    The salts of potash thus appear to fall into two groups of
very similar if not equal diffusibility. What is the relation
between these groups?                                            -
    The diffusion of 4 per cent. solutions of carbonate and ni
 trate of potash was repeated at a temperature rising gradually
 from 63° to 65° during the seven days of the experiment, with
 a mean of 64°1. The diffusion products of the carbonate
 were 10:31, 10:05 and 10:44 grs. in three cells; mean 10:27
grs. Of the nitrate, 13.98, 1886 and 13.60 grs.; mean 13.81
 grs. We have thus a diffusion in equal times of
          Carbonate of potash . . 10:27               1
          Nitrate of potash . . . 13.81               1.3447
 These experiments are almost identical with the former re
 sults, 10.25 carbonate of potash, and 1897 nitrate of potash.
    But the numbers thus obtained cannot be fairly compared,
 owing to the diminishing progression in which the diffusion of

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.           275
a salt takes place. Thus when the diffusion of nitrate of pot
ash was interrupted every two days, as in a former experiment
with chloride of sodium, the progress of the diffusion for eight
days was found to be as follows in a 4 per cent. solution, with
a mean temperature of 66°.
                         Nitrate of Potash.
          Diffused in   first two days . .     4.54 grs.
          Diffused in   second two days .      4.18 grs.
          Diffused in   third two days . .     4.06 grs.
          Diffused in   fourth two days .      3:18 grs.
                                              15'91
   The absence of uniformity in this progression is no doubt
chiefly due to the want of geometrical regularity in the form
of the neck and shoulder of the solution phial. A plain cy
linder, as the solution cell, might give a more uniform pro
gression, but would increase greatly the difficulties of mani
pulation.
   The diffusion of carbonate of potash will no doubt follow a
diminishing progression also; but there is this difference, that
the latter salt will not advance so far in its progression, owing
to its smaller diffusibility, in the seven days of the experiment,
as the more diffusible nitrate does.     The diffusion of the car
bonate will thus be given in excess, and as it is the smaller
diffusion, the difference of the diffusion of the two salts will
not be fully brought out.
   The only way in which the comparison of the two salts can
be made with perfect fairness, is to allow the diffusion of the
slower salt to proceed for a longer time, till in fact the quan
tity diffused is the same for this as for the other salt, and the
same point in the progression has therefore been obtained in
both; and to note the time required. The problem takes the
form of determining the times of equal diffusion of the two
salts. This procedure is the more necessary from the inap
plicability of calculation to the diffusion progression.
   Further, allowing the Times of Equal Diffusion to be
found, it is not to be expected that they will present a simple
relation. Recurring to the analogy of gaseous diffusion, the
times in which equal volumes or equal weights of two gases
diffuse are as the square roots of the densities of the gases.
The times, for instance, in which equal quantities of oxygen
and hydrogen escape out of a vessel into the air, in similar
circumstances, are as 4 to 1; the densities of these two gases
as 16 to 1. Or, the times of equal diffusion of oxygen and
protocarburetted hydrogen are as 1.4142 to 1, that is as the
                                    2

276        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
square root of 2 to the square root of 1 ; the densities of these
gases being 16 and 8, which are as 2 to 1. The densities are
the squares of the equal-diffusion times. . It is not therefore
the times themselves of equal diffusion of two salts, but the
squares of those times which are likely to exhibit a simple
relation.
    (1.) While the 4 per cent. solution of nitrate of potash was
diffused as usual for seven days, the corresponding solution
of carbonate of potash was now allowed to diffuse for 9-90
days; times which are as 1 to 1.4142, or as 1 to the square
root of 2.
   The results were as follows: diffused of
Nitrate of potash at 64°1, in seven days, 13.81 grs. 100
Carbonate of potash at 64°3, in 9.9 days, 1392 grs. 100.8
    The three experiments on the nitrate of potash, of which
 13.81 grs. is the mean, were 13-98, 13.86 and 13.60 grs., as
already detailed. The three experiments on the carbonate
were 14:00, 13.97 and 13-78 grs. The difference in the means
of the two salts is only 0'll gr. The results appear to be as
near to equality as could be reasonably expected from the
method of experimenting. Seven and 9.90 may therefore be
considered as the times of equal diffusion indicated for nitrate
and carbonate of potash. The times of equal diffusion, or the
diffusibilities of nitrate and carbonate of potash, would appear
therefore to be in the proportion of the square root of 1 to
the square root of 2.
    The explanation of such a relation suggested by gaseous
diffusion has been anticipated.     It is that the two salts have
different densities in solution, that of nitrate of potash being
 1, and that of carbonate of potash 2. We are thus led to
ascribe, what may be called Solution Densities, to the salts.
The two salts in question are related exactly like protocarbu
retted hydrogen gas, of density 1, to oxygen gas of density 2.
The parallel would be completed by supposing that the single
volume of oxygen to be diffused was previously mixed with
 100 volumes of air (or any other diluting gas), while the 2
volumes of protocarburetted hydrogen were also diluted with
 100 volumes of air; the diluting air here representing the
water in which the salts to be diffused are dissolved in the
solution cell. The time in which a certain quantity of proto
carburetted hydrogen would come out from a vessel contain
ing 1 per cent of that gas being 1 (the square root of den
sity 1), the time in which an equal quantity of oxygen would
diffuse out from a similar vessel containing 1 per cent. also
would be 1.4142 (the square root of density 2).

               Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.         277
       (2.) A solution of 4 parts of sulphate of potash in 100 water
    was diffused simultaneously with the last solution of carbonate
    of potash, and therefore in similar circumstances. The diffu
    sion products of three experiments were 14:46, 14:21 and
    14:53 grs. ; mean 14:40 grs. This is in the proportion of
    104-27 sulphate of potash to 100 nitrate of potash; so that
    the approximation to equality of diffusion with nitrate of pot
    ash, in the selected times, is not so close for the sulphate as
    for the carbonate of potash.
       (3.) The diffusion was repeated of 2 per cent. solutions of
. . the nitrate and carbonate of potash at a lower temperature by
    about 10°. The temperature of the solutions was rather un
    steady; ranging from 56° to 52°-25 for the first period of
    seven days, from 56° to 50°5 for the period of 9.90 days, and
    from 55° to 50°-5 for a second period of seven days; the ex
    ternal atmospheric temperature having fallen during the same
    period more than 20 degrees. Six phials of each solution
    were diffused and evaporated two together; so that the results
    are all double quantities.
       At a mean temperature of 54°3, the nitrate of potash gave
    in seven days 12.60 and 12 13 grs. ; mean 12:36 grs.
       Again, at a mean temperature of 52°4, the nitrate of potash
    gave in seven days 11.85, 12:40 and 11.95 grs. ; mean
    12:06 grs.
       The carbonate of potash gave in 9-90 days, with a mean
    temperature of 53°4, 1269, 12:40 and 12:12 grs. ; mean
    12:40 grs.
       The general results are—
       Nitrate of potash, in seven days, at 54°3 . 12'36 grs.
       Carbonate of potash, in 9.9 days, at 53°4 . 12:40 grs.
       Nitrate of potash, in seven days, at 52°4 . 12:06 grs.
    As the first nitrate is 0°-9 above the carbonate and the second
    nitrate 19 below it, we may take the mean of the two nitrates
    as corresponding to the temperature of the carbonate. We
    thus finally obtain, diffused at 53°4, of
          Nitrate of potash in seven days, 12'22 grs. . 100
          Carbonate of potash in 9.9 days, 12:40 grs. . 101'47
    The difference in the amount of the diffusion of the two salts
    in these times is only 0.18 gr., or 1% per cent.
       These last experiments may be held therefore as tending to
    the same conclusion as the former series, although the circum
    stances were more than usually unfavourable to their success.
    To find whether the same relation existed between the salts
    through a considerable range of temperature, an opportunity

278         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
was taken during cold weather to repeat the experiments at a
low temperature.
    (4.) Solutions of 1 salt in 100 water were diffused from
eight solution cells, for each salt. The times were increased,
but the same ratio of 1 to 1.4142 was preserved between them.
 The liquids of the cells were found to retain a temperature
ranging slowly between 41° and 38°8 during the whole period
 of the observations. Sulphate of potash was substituted for
 the carbonate, as of these two equi-diffusive salts the former
had been found to be least in accordance with nitrate of pot
ash, in the 4 per cent. solutions, and appeared therefore to
afford the severest test of the relation.                          -
   For nitrate of potash, at a mean temperature of 39°7, du
ring nine days, the diffusion product of two cells together was
6'97, 6'93, 6-77 and 6-64 grs. ; mean 6'83 grs, for two cells.
    For sulphate of potash, at the same mean temperature of
39°7, during 12-728 days (twelve days, seventeen hours,
twenty-eight minutes), the diffusion product of two cells
together was 7:05, 6'93, 7-28 and 6.90 grs. ; mean 7.04 grs,
for two cells.
   The general results are—
Nitrate of potash in nine days at 39°7 . . 6-83 grs. 100
Sulphate of potash in 12728 days at 39°7 7.04 grs. 103-07
    (5.) Solutions of 2 salt in 100 water were diffused simulta
neously with the preceding experiments, and in precisely the
same conditions of time and temperature.
   The diffusion product of nitrate of potash during nine days,
at a mean temperature of 39°7, was 7:03, 6-63, 6'88 and 6'83
grs. for one cell; mean 683 grs. for one cell, or the same num
ber as for two cells with the 1 per cent. solution.
   The diffusion product of sulphate of potash during 12-728
days was 6'84, and 6'80; mean 6'82 grs. for one cell. These
experiments almost coincide with the number for nitrate of
potash.
           Nitrate of potash, 6.83 grs. . . . 100
            Sulphate of potash, 6.82 grs. . . 99.85
   (6.) The existence of the relation in question was also se
verely tested in another manner. Preserving the ratio in the
times of diffusion for the two salts, the actual times were varied
in duration, in three series of experiments, as 1, 2 and 3.
The experiments were made in the vault, with a uniformity
of temperature favourable to accuracy of observation. Eight
cells of the 1 per cent. solution of each salt were always dif
fused at the same time.
   (a.) Nitrate of potash diffused for 3-5 days, at 47°2, gave

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.          279
for two cells, 3:55, 3:63, 3.33 and 3’51 grs.; mean for two
cells, 3:50 grs.
   Sulphate of potash diffused for 4.95 days, at 47°3, gave for
two cells, 3:54, 3:31, 3’51 and 3.63 grs. ; mean for two cells,
3:50 grs., or exactly the same as for nitrate of potash above.
   (b.) Nitrate of potash diffused for seven days, at 48°6, gave
6-1, 6-2, 5-9 and 5'92 grs. ; mean for two cells, 6.04 grs.
 . Sulphate of potash diffused for 9.9 days, at 49°1, gave
6'13, 5'92, 6'18 and 6'59 grs. ; mean 6:20 grs., or, excluding
the last experiment, 6.08 grs.
   Chromate of potash diffused also for 9.9 days, at 49°1, gave
6:19, 6:18, 6.40 and 6.38 grs.; mean for two cells, 6.29 grs.
The diffused chromate presented no appearance of decompo
sition on this occasion.
   (c.) Nitrate of potash diffused for 10.5 days, at 48°, gave
8:36, 8-95, 8.82 and 8-84 grs. ; mean for two cells, 8.74 grs.
   Sulphate of potash diffused for 14-85 days, at 48°6, gave
8-99, 8.94, 8:66 and 8:56 grs. ; mean for two cells, 8-79 grs.
   The mean results for the three different sets of periods of
diffusion are as follows:—
    3.5 and 4.95 <U+017F>Nitrate of potash, at 47°2, 3:50 grs. 100
         days       Sulphate of potash, at 47°-3, 3•50 grs. 100
                    Nitrate of potash, at 48°6, 6.04 grs. 100
 7 and 9.9 days: Sulphate of potash, at 49°1,620 grs. 102.65
                    Chromateofpotash, at 49°1,629 grs. 104'14
 10.5 and 14.85<U+017F> Nitrate of potash, at 48°, 8.74 grs. 100
    days            Sulphate of potash, at 48°6, 8-79 grs. 100-57
    The concurring evidence of these three series of experi
 ments appears to be quite decisive in favour of the assumed
 relation of 1 to 1.4142, between the times of equal diffusion
 for the nitrate and sulphate of potash, and consequently of the
 times for the two classes of potash salts, of which the salts
 named are types. The same experiments are also valuable as
 proving the similarity of the progression of diffusion, in two
 salts of unequal diffusibility. I shall return again to the rela
 tion between nitrates and sulphates, under the salts of soda.
                     (8.) Hydrate of Potash.
    (1.) Eight cells of the 1 per cent. solution of pure fused
 hydrate of potash were diffused for seven days in the vault,
 with a temperature ranging only from 59° to 58°, of which
 the mean was 58°-6. The product of four cells evaporated
 together was 17°57 grs. of hydrate of potash, and of the other
 four cells 17:19 grs. ; mean 17'38 grs., or 4’345 grs. for one
 cell. The hydrate of potash was estimated from the chloride

280        Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
of potassium which it gave when saturated with hydrochloric
acid. The diffusion product of sulphate of potash for seven
days, at 58°5, or almost the same temperature, was 10-75 grs.
for the four cells, as already stated, and consequently 2-64 grs.
for one cell. It thus appears that the hydrate of potash is
greatly more diffusive than the sulphate of potash in the same
period of seven days, namely, as 4,345 to 2-64. Such a re
sult indeed is not inconsistent with the times of equal diffusion
of these two substances, differing as much as 1 to 2.
   (2.) Of pure fused hydrate of potash, a 1 per cent. solution
was diffused from four cells for 4.95 days at a mean tempera
ture of 53°7, against a 1 per cent. solution of nitrate of potash
in six cells, for seven days, at a mean temperature 0°-1 lower,
or of 53°6. The hydrate of potash which diffused, is calcu
lated as before from the chloride of potassium which it gave,
when neutralized by hydrochloric acid. Hydrate of potash
diffused from two cells 5'97 and 6:28 grs. ; mean 6-12 grs.,
or 3.06 grs. for a single cell.
   Nitrate of potash diffused from two cells 6'22, 6'54 and
5:93 grs. ; mean 6:23 grs., or 3:11 grs. for a single cell. The
diffusion of nitrate of potash being 100, that of the hydrate of
potash is 98.2, numbers which are sufficiently in accordance.
But the times were as 1 to 1.4142, and their squares as 1 to 2.
So far then as this series of experiments on hydrate of potash
entitles us to conclude, we appear to have for the salts of pot
ash a close approximation to the following simple series of
squares of equal diffusion times:—
 Squares of Times of Equal Diffusion, or Solution Densities.
                 Hydrate of potash      . . . 1
                 Nitrate of potash . . . . 2
                 Sulphate of potash . . . 4
   (3.) The hydrate of potash was also diffused at the lower
temperature, 39°7, in company with the nitrate and sulphate
of potash for a period of 6.364 days (six days, eight hours,
forty-four minutes).
   The 1 per cent. solution of hydrate of potash gave in eight
cells, evaporated two together, 6'93, 6'93, 6'93 and 6'89 grs.;
mean 6'92 grs.
   The 2 per cent. solution of hydrate of potash gave in three
single cells, 6-77, 6.49 and 7.10 grs.; mean 679 grs.
   The diffusion of nitrate of potash in nine days at the same
temperature, as already detailed, was sensibly the same, or
6'83 grs. for both the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions. The times
for the two salts were as 1 to 1.4142.
   The diffusion of hydrate of potash, at 39°7, may therefore

               Mr. J. Cockle on Impossible Equations.                     281
be stated with reference to that of nitrate of potash, for the
selected times, as follows:—
   Nitrate of potash, 1 and 2 per cent. solutions .. 100
    Hydrate of potash, 1 per cent. solution . . . 101.3
    Hydrate of potash, 2 per cent. solution . . .                   99.4
   These experiments at the low temperature concur, there
fore, with those made at the higher temperature, in proving
that the times of equal diffusion of the two substances have
been properly chosen.

   * Communicated by T. S. Davies, Esq., F.R.S. Lond. and Ed., who
adds the following note.
   “From my having become accidentally involved in the discussion of
“congeneric surd equations’ (though merely from having called the atten
tion of Mr. Horner to Garnier's equation, and not from any contribution
of my own towards its elucidation), several of my friends, and some gen
tlemen who were strangers, have addressed their views on the subject pri
vately to me. Those of Mr. Cockle, from the somewhat close agreement
with my own, and from the form suitable for publication in which they
were drawn up, I have sent for insertion in the Philosophical Magazine.
Most others were put in forms that would have required modification for
the purpose; and this I did not feel myself at liberty to make, lest I should
fail to express in my own language the exact view of the writers. There
is one friend, however, a very eminent analyst, who takes a view directly
opposed to these; and he has given me at different times his own explana.
tion of most of the equations that have been hitherto mooted. When I
state that, being opposed to his views (the opposition being founded, as I
conceive, on the general principles of analysis), and yet having been uni
formly unsuccessful in detecting any specific fallacy in his reasoning, I can
not view the question as being settled. On this account it is that I think
the discussion should be kept open; and I trust that the gentleman to
whom I refer will afford us the benefit of having his “vein of thought’ laid
open in his own way. . Exceptions and failing cases are always the most
instructive subjects of inquiry in every science;—in analysis they always
betoken something yet left to be seen or done.
   “On one point, however, I wish to be distinctly understood; viz. as not
expressing the slightest opinion, at present, on the subject of Quaternions,
Tessarines, or any of the inquiries into which i, j k enter.”

282         Mr. J. Cockle on Impossible Equations,
   As by linear equations, taken in their utmost generality,
we are led to contemplate negative quantity; and as by qua
dratics, cubics, and the higher equations, we are in like manner
led to form the notion of unreal quantity; so by surd or irra
tional equations we may be conducted to the idea of impos
sible quantity.
   Let
                   1 + Way—4— Way—1 = W,
                   1 – May–4 + War—I =X,
                   1 + Va.-4+ w(x-T-Y,
                   1 — Va.-4 – A/w-1 = Z.
Then, by actual multiplication, we obtain
                 6–2, 4-2 w"zº–52-E4 = W. X,
                 6–22–2 wº–52-E4=Y.Z;
and hence, on multiplication and reduction,
                     4(5–4)=W.X.Y.Z.
   Let WXYZ=V, then 5 is the only value of a which satis
fies V=0.      Hence, no value of a other than 5 can make
either of the factors W, X, Y, or Z equal to zero; for, if so,
such other value must make one at least of the remaining
factors infinite, and we should have to subject a to incompa
tible conditions.
   Now W = 0 may, by a transposition, be rendered identical
with the equation (1) given by Garnier at p. 335 of the second
edition of his Analyse, and is satisfied by the value a = 5. But
X==0 (which may, by transposition, be rendered identical
with the equation numbered (2) by Garnier at the page just
cited) is not satisfied by that value; at least, not if we con
sider the symbol w/ to be such that the quantities included
under it are necessarily affected with (+1)*. This appears to
me to be the true meaning of that symbol of radicality, provided
that, in the development of algebra from arithmetic, we adhere
as closely as we can to the analogies afforded by the latter
science, in the most general form of which (universal arith
metic or arithmetical algebra) all the quantities (i.e. symbo
lized numbers) employed are, implicitly at least, considered as
affected with (+1)*. Accordingly I adhered to this view in
forming the equation which led me to my Theory of Tessa
rines, and by which I sought to connect that theory with
ordinary algebra. There is no real loss of generality by thus
restricting the symbol w/. The root corresponding to the

          Mr. R. Phillips on the Magnetism of Steam.             283
affection (–1)* may always be obtained by prefixing the sign
– to that of radicality.
   Waiving this discussion however for the present, let us
admit that, in the equation X=0, a may have given to it the
value was 5(-1)*. Then X=0 is obviously satisfied. But
the ordinary double algebra is not relieved from its difficulty.
For neither 5(+1)* nor 5(–1)” will satisfy either Y=0 or
Z=0. If, in the above instances, the difficulty is to be evaded,
it is only by greatly refining our solution, and, as it has oc
curred to me, by usingexpressions of the form m(+1)*-i-n(–1)*,
and by following certain rules respecting our reductions, and
the signs to be affixed to the radicals. To those who would
attempt such a complex and artificial system of solution rather
than admit the existence of an impossible equation I may
hereafter address some observations. They will however
probably find, as I have done, that their attempts are unsatis
factory, and the results not philosophically admissible. But
I shall here content myself with remarking, that, by any
system of rules, however artificial, the difficulty is only thrown
further back. Thus, the equation
                         Wa: + War + 1 =0
is utterly intractable.
    .# the restricted view which I have taken of the sym
bol w/ be deemed ultimately inadmissible, it would not be
difficult to frame a new impossible equation, other than that
which I have employed in my Theory of Tessarines, and
which should give us a new imaginary, determined, like the
unreal quantities of double algebra, by means of an equation,
and so constituting a natural extension of that algebra. In
reframing the fundamental equation of the Tessarine Theory,
or in adopting one which should give rise to a different theory,
geometric interpretation should always be borne in mind, and
the uniaxal geometry thence arising would be as direct an
application of algebra as that which occurs in interpreting and
applying the ordinary double algebra.

              XXXII. On the Magnetism of Steam.
                   By ReUBEN PHILLIPs, Esq.
                  [Continued from vol. xxxvi. p. 511.]

       THE       modification used
            is agalvanoscope         in the
                                of that      following
                                          formerly        experiments
                                                       described (2.).
Instead of two astatic needles, I have employed one sus

284       Mr. R. Phillips on the Magnetism of Steam.
pended needle, with its directive force partly neutralized by
placing near it another fixed magnet. In some experiments
this was done by attaching a magnetized needle to a piece of
copper wire sliding through a cork stuck on the inside of the
beaker; this fixed needle lay horizonally under the suspended
needle, and the degree to which it was necessary to balance
the earth’s magnetism was effected by means of the copper
wire. As this adjustment, although in other respects excellent,
could not be executed with sufficient rapidity, the needle was
subsequently removed from the copper wire, and the swinging
needle was partly balanced by a steel magnet placed at a di
stance. When the fixed magnet was applied, it brought the
marked end of the suspended needle to point about 20 or 30
degrees west of the position which it otherwise took up; the
needle of the galvanoscope stood rectangularly to the axis of
the coils and on the east side. The swinging needle was 1.8
inch long, and its point, which was observed in the micro
scope as before (3, 4.), pointed to the south. A and C stand
for the same sides of the field of view, and the general mode
of using the instrument and the zinc screen was as formerly.
It may be as well to mention that the microscope inverted.
The steam was usually employed at pressures ranging from
15 to 25 lbs. on the inch, the magnetism, so far as my expe
riments with coils have yet gone, being sensibly the same
between these limits. A principal reason for using these
lower pressures was, that the temporary joints and pewter
coils of the discharging apparatus were much more easily
kept in order than at the higher pressures. The stop-cocks,
T-pieces, &c., were such as are generally used about oxy
hydrogen blowpipes, and care was taken that they should have
sufficient steam-way. The temporary joints were made as
follows: having adequately supported and brought together
the two ends which it was desired to unite, a strip of common
sheet caoutchouc about ; inch wide was wound once round
the tubes at the juncture, and then a strip of oiled silk about
an inch wide was wound twice round outside the caoutchouc
and slightly bound on with fine thread. Three or four rounds
of a piece of tinfoil rather wider than the silk were now laid
on and carefully rubbed down smooth, and then well bound
on with strong thread.
   131. A pewter tube 5 feet 7 inches long, having tº inch for its
internal, and #5 inch for its external diameter, was inserted in
another pewter tube rather shorter, having an internal diameter
about <U+017F>º inch and an external diameter of gº, inch; the whole
was then made into a dense cylindrical coil, 3-3 inches long,
having a cylindrical space l'? inch diameter to receive an iron

          Mr. R. Phillips on the Magnetism of Steam.         285
core. The smaller pewter tube projected from the larger to the
extent of about 2 inches at one end and 3 inch at the other; I
shall call these the longer and shorter ends of the pipes. A
T-piece was nowplacedon the longerend of the pipes,so that while
it could receive the discharge from the larger pipe, the smaller
pipe was allowed to stand through the straight way of the
T-piece; a stop-cock was placed on the branch of the T-piece, .
which therefore served to regulate the flow of steam through
the outer coil. The end of the smaller pipe after its exit from
the T-piece was also furnished with a cock, having a steam
way #, inch diameter; I call this stop-cock S. The shorter
end of the pipes terminated in a short brass connecting piece,
the steam-way of which was much larger than the combined
steam-ways of the coil, and this connecting piece served to
unite the coils with the condenser of the hydro-electric machine.
 The condenser was interposed between the boiler and the
coils during all these experiments, but it was always dry, ex
 cept where it is said that water was placed in it. The coil
 having been thus connected with the boiler, one end of a
 piece of soft iron, l inch diameter and 8 inches long, was in
 serted in the coil; the iron was supported quite independently
 of the coil, and the axis of the iron and coil of course lay in
 a horizontal plane. Supposing the back of a watch to have
 been placed against the east end of the iron core, the steam
 circulated in a contrary direction to the motion of the hands
 of the watch.
    132. The stop-cock on the branch of the T-piece was closed
 and S opened, then, the coil being cool, on opening the cock
 of the boiler, the needle flew across the field of view towards
 C; with a single puff the motion was perhaps through an
 angle of 5°.
    133. The stop-cock on the branch of the T-piece was
 opened a little, and the cock of the boiler was opened; an
 agitation of the needle, or a swing to C, was always observed;
 as soon as it subsided and steam issued from the branch stop
 cock, S was opened, the needle immediately started off to A;
 the swing, although less than the foregoing, could easily be
  made by successive puffs quite visible to the unassisted eye.
    134. The iron was now removed from the coil, and the last
  experiment repeated. On opening S the needle went towards
  A, and by successive puffs it could be vibrated across the field
  of view and checked by inverse puffs, but the amount of
  motion was much less than when the iron was in the coil;
  thus showing that the iron had been magnetized by this ap
  parently new magnetic force. The swing to C was also much
  reduced (26.). Water was now placed in the condenser, and I
  think the swing to A became more powerful in consequence.

286       Mr. R. Phillips on the Magnetism of Steam.
   135. The brass connecting piece which united the short
end of the pipes to the condenser was taken away from the coil,
and another T-piece was now placed on the other end of S, and
the stop-cock removed from the branch of the former T-piece;
the branches of these T-pieces stood parallel and were united
by a piece of pewter tube bent like the letter U. The last
added T-piece was united to the boiler. By this arrangement
it will be seen, that on opening the cock of the boiler the steam
could always enter the outer coil, but not the inner coil unless
S was open. The iron core was placed in the coil, and the
steam circulated in the same direction as before.      When the
steam was turned on the swing was to A, whether S was open
or not, but stronger when S was open. I thought too much
steam escaped from between the two pipes at their shorter
end, notwithstanding the end of the outer pipe had been con
siderably contracted; this discharge was sufficiently diminished
by twisting a quantity of thread about the place where the
larger pipe ended.
   136. The coil being cool and S closed, the cock of the
boiler was opened; the needle was much agitated, being driven
a little in one direction and then in the other very irregularly,
but in the main towards A.      As soon as the needle became
tolerably steady I began to open and shut S at the alternate
vibrations of the needle, but could not obtain a certain swing
in either direction. The stop-cock S was now closed, and
afterwards the cock of the boiler, then S was immediately
opened, which sent the needle rather strongly towards C.
   137. Another stop-cock, V, was now placed at the shorter
end of the pipes, and affixed so as to receive the steam only
from the inside coil; the steam could escape from between the
two coils as in the last experiment (136.). The cocks S and
V were thrown open; there was a strong swing to A as before,
 when the cock of the boiler was opened. S was now shut,
and after sufficient time had elapsed to allow the coil to be
come well heated, on working S with each alternate vibration,
a scarcely perceptible swing to A was produced when S was
opened, which swing-producing power generally went off after
some puffs. V was now closed and the cock of the boiler and
S opened. On opening V the needle started for C. Both
the swings to A and C were as strong as before (132, 133.),
but regarding the direction of the steam, it is to be observed
they were inverted.
    138. The stop-cock V was now so united to the shorter
end of the pipes, as to receive the discharge from between the
coils as well as that of the inside coil.  The steam circulated
in the same direction as the hands of the watch, and the iron
core was still in the coil.  When the cock of the boiler was

          Mr. R. Phillips on the Magnetism of Steam.        287
opened, S and V being previously opened, the needle swung
to C; and to A when the cock of the boiler and S were opened,
and V then opened. When the iron was removed, the swings
both to C and A were much diminished.
   139. The coil was removed from the condenser and turned
about in a direction parallel to the needle, so that the steam
could enter through V and escape through the combination
of T-pieces at the other end of the pipes; the steam being,
in fact, blown through the coils in a direction opposite to that
of the last experiment. Opening V and S, and then opening
the cock of the boiler, gave a swing to C. Opening V and
the cock of the boiler, and then letting out the steam by open
ing S, gave the swing to A. The iron core was not used with
this arrangement.
   140. The coil was moved through an angle of 180° as be
fore (19.). Both swings were now reversed, as compared with
the former experiment; that is, using the steam as before, the
swing to C became a swing to A, and the swing to A became
a swing to C.
   141. The pewter coil (29.) was united to the condenser by
a piece of brass, the steam-way of which was of larger dia
meter than the bore of the coil.    The steam circulated in a
contrary direction to the hands of the watch. When the cock
of the boiler was opened, the swing was to A and rather
strong.
   142. The other end of the pipe of the coil was united by
the same piece of brass to the condenser, and the steam cir
culated in the same direction as the hands of the watch ; the
swing was still to A.
   143. A stop-cock was now placed on one end of the tube
of this pewter coil, and the other end was affixed to the con
denser, as in the two preceding experiments; the steam cir
culated in a direction contrary to the hands of the watch; also
the iron core was placed in the coil. The stop-cock being
open and the coil cool, turning on the steam produced a
strong swing to C. The stop-cock was now closed with the
cock of the boiler open ; on opening the stop-cock at the
proper positions of the needle, a swing to A was obtained on
opening the stop-cock, but it was not nearly so strong as the
corresponding swing with the double coil. The diameter of
the steam-way of the stop-cock was <U+017F>º inch.
    144. The iron was now removed. The swing to C when
the coil was cool, although less, was still very good, as one
 puff sent the edge of the needle rather more than the whole
 length of the micrometrical scale. The swing to A was, how
 ever, very feeble; and it required about ten puffs to produce
a swing one-third the length of the scale.

   145. A glass tube 28 inches long was formed into a coil of
five convolutions. This glass tube happened to be rather
conical; its internal diameter at one end being <U+017F>º inch, and
at the other end about 4% inch, and the tube was #5 inch ex
ternal diameter. The end of the tube having the larger dia
meter was united to the condenser, and the iron was placed
in the coil; the steam circulated in a direction contrary to
that of the hands of the watch. In these experiments, 10 lbs.
on the inch was found to be an advantageous pressure for the
steam. On opening the cock of the boiler the needle moved
towards C; the steam being then shut off, the needle made a
sudden start towards A ; and I think the force which sent the
needle towards A was greater than that which moved it to C.
Three puffs of steam sent the needle nearly across the field
of view.
   146. The iron was now removed, the swing remained much
as before ; if there was any difference, I think it was rather
#. without the iron.            After many experiments I thought
  could perceive that the needle, when the iron was in, did
not so promptly obey the steam as when the iron was out, but
seemed to move rather sluggishly, as if the iron resisted the
production of the magnetic force of the coil.
   147. The end of the tube having the smaller diameter was
now united to the condenser by the same piece of brass which
was used in the preceding experiment, and the steam circulated
in the same direction. The swing, when the steam was turned
on, was to C, but much more feeble than before, and the coil
worked better at a higher pressure. I could not perceive that
the iron varied the magnetic energy of the coil.
   148. It immediately follows from the foregoing experiments
(132, 135, &c.), that the direction of the magnetism imparted
to a coil is not directly, if indeed it is at all, connected with
the direction of the motion of the steam. In these experi
ments two magnetic forces are observable, always opposite in
direction and about equal in power: one of these I have be
fore shown to be intimately connected with condensation, the
other is produced under circumstances where condensation
cannot take place, but where evaporation does. The experi
ments (136, 187.) show very conclusively that the friction of
steam along a pipe, apart from condensation or evaporation,
produces no magnetic effect. A more complete consideration
of all these experiments must be deferred until I have finished
a further set.

regard it as the expression of the analytical results. I selected
for this purpose the soda salt, which is the most easily crystal
lized. The impure nitroprusside of sodium, which was ob
tained in solution by the saturation of the acid with carbonate
of soda, was precipitated by the addition of sulphate of copper
in the form of nitroprusside of copper; this was thoroughly
washed with water, and lastly carefully decomposed by caustic
soda. The solution of nitroprusside of sodium thus obtained
was separated by filtration from the oxide of copper liberated,
and evaporated at a gentle heat; large crystals were then ob
tained, which I submitted to analysis.
   The iron and soda were estimated in the form of peroxide
of iron and sulphate of soda, after the decomposition of the
salt with concentrated sulphuric acid.
   I. 0.531 grm. gave 0-1490 grm. of peroxide of iron and
0-2505 grm. of sulphate of soda.
   II. 0471 grim. gave 0-1330 grm. of peroxide of iron and
0.2223 grm. of sulphate of soda.
   Regarding the combustions, the first was made with chro
mate of lead, the second with peroxide of copper and oxygen
gaS.
ºf 0.5157 grm. gave 0.3937 grm. of carbonic acid and 0.0610
grm. of water.
   II. O-4394 grm. gave 0.3265 grm. of carbonic acid and
0.0526 grm. of water.
   The determination of the nitrogen was made according to
the method of Dumas: 0.298 grim, gave 74 cub. cent, of moist
nitrogen at 57°F., and with the barometer at 28".
   I shall now compare these results with those of the com

Playfair, and the mean of the same chemist's analyses of the

exhibits the greatest difference, and the quantity of carbon
found is decidedly in favour of the more simple formula.
XXXV. On the Anomaly-Ruler, an Instrument to assist in the
   graphic representation of the place of a Gravitating Projectile

IT may       sometimes be desirable, in lecturing on or in dis
      cussing the motions of comets, to possess the means of
easily and rapidly laying down on a diagram, with as much
accuracy as the scale of the drawing will permit, the places of
such bodies in their elliptic orbits at given instants of time,
The instrument which I shall now describe is intended to
facilitate this operation.
   It is simply a thin flat ruler, the form of which is repre
sented by the shaded figure in the drawing, and which may
be made of any convenient size.

    The fiducial edge, from C to N, is straight. Those two
 points ought to be marked by fine transverse lines on both
 faces of the ruler. From N to I the fiducial edge has the

form of the involute of the circle whose radius is CN, and
centre C. The length of the curved portion of the ruler should
be somewhat more than one-half of that of the straight part.
   The use of this instrument is as follows:—                     -
   Problem.—The elliptic orbit of a body, gravitating towards
a given focus, being given, to represent on a diagram the place
of the body corresponding to a given mean anomaly.
   Solution.—About a centre C with the radius CN describe
the circle PNQADP, and let its diameter AP be taken to
represent the major axis of the given elliptic orbit. Let S
represent the focus of attraction, P the perihelion, and the
angle PCN the given mean anomaly. Apply the anomaly
ruler to the diagram as shown in the drawing, so that the mark
C shall be over the centre of the circle, the mark N at the
end of the arc of mean anomaly, and the convexity of the in
volute NI towards the perihelion. From the focus S draw a
straight line ST touching the involute NI. Through the
centre C draw a straight line CQ parallel to ST and on the
same side of AP. From the point Q, where CQ cuts the
circle, draw a straight line QB perpendicular to AP; divide
this line by the point M in such a proportion that BQ: BM: :
major axis : minor axis of the elliptic orbit. Then the point
M represents the place of the body corresponding to the mean
anomaly PCN. Q. E. I.
   The proof of this solution follows immediately from the
31st proposition of the first book of Newton's Principia.
   If the entire ellipse PMAEP, similar to the given orbit, can
be described with sufficient accuracy, the point M may be
determined by the intersection of the ordinate BQ with the
ellipse, without performing the proportional division of thatline.
   It has been suggested by the Astronomer Royal for Scot
land, that by means of a turning-lathe a series of ellipses might
be engraved on a plate with the same major axis, varying in
excentricity between a circle and a straight line; and that
impressions of this plate might be used in the graphic repre
sentation of cometic motions, with the aid of an anomaly-ruler
of suitable size.

we can form thirty-five triplets thus, so as to employ oncé
every duad that can be made with the fifteen symbols:

         aop —bnp        cno     dlp    elo   fln —glm.
   If we consider every triplet taken with its sign to be equal
to negative unity, as
                       abc= —bdf=–1,
and to imply three equations, such as
      a =bc, b=ca, c=ab; —b-df, -d-fb, —f-bd;
equivalent to the equations
      a=-cb, b=-ac, c=-ba; b-fil, d-bf, f=db;
we shall find that the three equal values of each of the seven
imaginaries, abcdefgh, deduced from the first seven triplets A,
are all congruous with all; and that the seven equal values of
each of the eight imaginaries, hiklmnop, deduced from the
twenty-eight remaining triplets B, are all congruous with all.
Thus the two values of h, given by the triplets ahi and —chl,
                        * h =ia=cl,
are congruous with the values of k, given by the triplets -cik
and akl,
                           k = ic-la;
for ic=la follows from ia =cl.
   But if we compare the values of the first seven imaginaries,
as given by the first seven triplets, with those deduced from
the other twenty-eight, we find them contradictory. From
the triplets dhm and eim, we have
                           m=dh -ei,

a pair of results that can be reconciled on no less violent sup
position, than that the duad imaginary hi retains its value
when it changes its sign: and I have shown, at page 450 of the
thirty-third volume of this Magazine, that no one of the
twenty-seven triplets following ahi can be admitted along with
it, if we interpret each to express three such conditions as
a=hi, h-ia, i=ah. It is there proved impossible to make
consistently the 15 × 7 suppositions, such as ab=c, ac= -b,
ad=e, &c., which are necessary to enable us to eliminate the
duads ab, ac, ad, &c. from the product of two pluquaternions

From this consideration may be framed a proof of a celebrated
negative, which has not yet lost its interest, although the
question has been some time ago set at rest by a master of
analysis, who has achieved the floº task of establishing
the negative by ordinary algebra. See a memoir in the
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxi., “On an
extension of a Theorem of Euler, &c., by J. R. Young, Pro
fessor of Mathematics in Belfast College,” a gentleman in
whose recent and most cruel wrongs every cultivator of science
in this empire has been bitterly insulted. The proposition
meant is, that “Two sums each of sixteen arbitrary     i.
squares cannot have for their product a sum of sixteen alge
braic squares.”
    Let it be supposed, for a moment, that they can, or that

              =(wº-Haº-H biº-H...+pº),

Q–15 denoting a function differing from Qis only in the signs
of the fifteen imº          abc.. p, which have the properties
above defined. We have then, as an equivalent form of the
above equation,
                QisG!—150'150'-is- Q"150"—is ;
or, since Q's Q' is is real,
                 Q150'150–150– 15 = Q"150"—    15°
The left member of our supposed equation is thus divided
into a pair of factors, QisQ'is and Q–150'-1s, which differ only
in the signs of the fifteen imaginaries; and since no such pair
of factors can be found to produce the right member, different
in form as to the imaginaries from Q"is and Q"—is, we must
have
                        Q150's=Q"is,

congruous equations, considered as functions of our imagina
ries: but both these are proved above to be contradictory.
The negative proposition seems thus established: but all this
involves the petition of this other negative, that our factors Q
cannot be formed with less than fifteen monad imaginaries.
Why not with nine monads and six duads, as at page 453 of
vol. xxxiii. ?
   Let us return to our refractory triplets, and try to induce
the imaginaries to submit to the violence above hinted at. If
in any argument it suits our convenience, for the sake of
elearness or symmetry, to retain a term AZ, in which A is
not infinite, and Z is zero, we may exhibit it at different points
of the process with different signs; for AZ is a quantity which
changes not its value when we reverse its sign. Suppose that
A is not a symbol of real quantity, but given in value by the
equation A= B, when B is an imaginary having one value
only: if there is no term in our reasoning that is affected by
our definition of A, except AZ, we may, on reviewing our
process, in which AZ appears with contrary signs at different
points, conceive that the property, which the term has, of re
taining its value when its sign is changed, is conferred on it by
A, considered to be, whether affected by a positive or negative
sign, constantly equivalent to +B: and evidently, if it facili
tates the establishment of relations between A and other like
Quantities, considered apart from real numbers, we may en
dow A by definition with the property, that its value is inde

 296    Rev. T. P. Kirkman on Bisignal Univalent Imaginaries.
 pendent of its sign, provided that we take care in our result,
 to reduce to zero every term which is affected by the value or
 sign of A.
    Let me beg the reader's forbearance for a little while, and
 his permission to lay down, for brevity's sake, the definition
 following:—
    A bisignal univalent, or more briefly, a bisignal, is a quan
 tity whose value is independent of its sign; and such that it
 may be employed in the same argument with contrary signs,
 and yet remain always equivalent to one defined value.
    In real arithmetic there can be no bisignals, except zero
 and its reciprocal; in imaginary arithmetic we may establish
 any number, each having a value neither null nor infinite,
 if they are not suffered to affect any finite terms of our results.
    We shall then venture to define, that all the twenty-eight
 duads, hi, hk, hl, &c., made with the imaginaries hikimnop are
 bisignal imaginaries, whose values are given by the twenty
 eight lower triplets: and we have now the power of asserting,
at one point of our argument, that a =hi and not = ih; and
again, at another point of the argument, that a = ih and not
 =hi. Through all this we must retain the definition that
hi + ih=0, which is the common property of all our imagi
naries, by an extension of Sir W. R. Hamilton's definition of
the three imaginaries of his quaternion theory. I am con
vinced that it is in vain to attempt to prove this property, at
least in the case of those imaginaries which are not combined
into a congruous system of seven. We are to conceive, then,
that whenever we change for our convenience the sign of hi,
we change by the same supposition the sign of ih; and that
these obliging duads are always of contrary signs.
    By this definition of the twenty-eight duads, hi, &c., we
remove all contradiction among our triplets, if only the reader
will grant that the definition itself is not a flat contradiction.
There is no need that we should swallow the absurdity that
hi is of two opposite signs at once, i. e. in the same circum
stances: when we are about to compare, as in a preceding
paragraph, the four triplets dhm, eim, ade and ahi, we establish
the proposition a = ih== —hi; and the result of our comparison
agrees with this: at another moment, in other circumstances,
when we compare together the four triplets bhk, -cik, abc and
ahi, we first lay down that a = hi- —ih, and our way is clear
again. We are in a condition to bid defiance to every diffi
culty about the comparison of the first seven triplets with the
lower group of twenty-eight; and we proceed without fear to
the formation of our sixteen functions, wi<U+017F>abu &c., which are
to appear on the right side of the equation

or that the product of two sums, each of sixteen algebraic

   That they are sufficient, is evident from inspection, and is in
fact a known truth, discovered by Prof. J. R. Young, and esta
blished by ocular demonstration in the memoir already referred
to; although the author gives no account of the process by
which he arrived at the result.     Should the reader hesitate to
accept this conclusion on the strength of my arguments, from
a very natural suspicion that the latter are more to be admired
for their luck than their learning, I trust that he will allow
the result to be an apology for the reasoning, and be lenient
to the logic for the conclusion's sake. Is there not room to
indulge the hope, that when the theory of these imaginaries
is perfectly understood, as instruments of the algebra of time
and order, what is here offered on bisignal univalents may
amount to something better than fortunate nonsense and two
useless words?

requires that the sixty-four duads, hk' hi' hk' &c., made each
from both groups hi, p and h'i'...p', should be eliminated or
 otherwise disposed of Elimination by substitution of a monad
 imaginary is impracticable; for hk' e.g. cannot be equal to any
 of the seven abodefº, nor to any of the eight hik . . p, nor to
 any of h'i'k...p', without introducing a linear relation between
 two of our twenty-three imaginaries, contrary to hypothesis.
 Thus the supposition hk'=f, combined with either of the ex
 isting conditions —ho-fi m'k'-f, would give a linear relation
 between two monads. These sixty-four duads must then per
 force appear in the product Q, Q's, unless they are made to
 vanish by null coefficients. From our definition of hi', h'k', &c.
 as bisignals, it will follow, as before in the case of hi, hk &c.
 and their coefficients, that the seven equations
                   h':h',-i': i.-k': k,+ ... =p': p',
 must be satisfied; but there is no necessity, from these con
 ditions, that the ratios h : h, and h': h", should be equal. Now
 the duad hk' will introduce into the product of Q, and Q's,
 with one sign or other, the term hk',-k'hp and no more.
 This will not vanish, unless, h : h =k': k,+h': h', ; but does
 vanish, if the ratios h : h, and h':h', are equal. As this equa
 lity of ratios, being admitted, will cause all the sixty-four duads
 hh', hi', hk', &c. to disappear, we have our product Qas. Q'as

 of the required form Q".s; from which it follows, that the pro
 duct of two sums each of twenty-four squares can be reduced
 algebraically to a sum of twenty-four squares, if fifteen con
 ditions are satisfied; or that
 (w”--a”--b”--. ..+g” + h^+h”--i°+i” +...+ p^+p”)(w; +a;”

          h: h, <U+2192>h':h'=i: i-i': il-... =p: p,-p': p<U+017F>.
   We can readily prove, by adding continually a new group
of twenty-eight triplets made with eight new imaginaries, giving
rise to twenty-eight new bisignal duads, that the product of
two sums each of 8(n+1) (n > 0) algebraic squares can be re
duced to a sum of 8(n+1) algebraic squares, if the given
squares satisfy 8m – 1 conditions. Hence we have the follow
ing theorem :
   The product of (r-- 1) sums, each of 8(n + 1) algebraic squares
(n > 0), can be reduced to a sum of 8(n+1) algebraic squares if
the given roots satisfy 8mr—r assignable simple equations.
   In the case of 2"–1 imaginaries, triplets can be formed by
which every duad may have an equivalent monad, and this
consistently with a law that must pervade every congruous
system of such triplets: namely, this law, that if abc and ahi
be two triplets, giving values a =bc=hi, both bi=ch and
bh = ic must hold good; that is, bi and ch must be completed
into triplets by the same imaginary m, and bh and ic must be
combined with the same monad n.
 . Such a system is completed for thirty-one imaginaries by
adding to the groups A B B' the following, the signs being
here of no importance.

Essay on the Theory of Attraction. By John KINNERSLEY SMYTHIEs,
                  Barrister-at-Law of the Middle Temple.
This paper consists of two distinct parts, geometrical and me
         chanical : in the former, the author deserves high praise for
his accuracy and ingenuity; in the latter, he must bear to be told
that he is ingenious, but not accurate.
   The geometrical part of the paper consists in a determination of
the relation existing among the ten distances of five points in space.
This problem was first solved by Carnot, who published a tract on
the subject. Mr. Smythies appears not to be aware of this, by his
not alluding to Carnot.
   The mechanical part is the asserted deduction of a principle which
will startle every reader who is competent to be startled: it is, that
any five material” particles have a necessary mathematical relation
eristing between their distances and central forces independently of
their velocities. The reasoning is of the following kind. The di
stances between the five points being a, b, &c., the relation existing
between them leads to a relation of the form
                      f(a, da, dºa, b, db, dºb,....)=0.
Where the particles are at rest, say that this becomes
                          W(a, d'ºa, b, d'ºb,....)=0.
We now quote from Mr. Smythies, altering the numbers of his
equations into the letters f and b.
   “The second differentials in (f) denote the whole forces, central and
centrifugal; and as the central force is a function of the distances only
dependent on the positions not on the velocities of the points, the assump
tion that the velocities vanish destroys the centrifugal forces but does not
alter the central. The result of that assumption, then, gives the ratios of
the central forces when the particles begin to move from a state of rest
when no centrifugal forces exist. But the ratios of the central forces in
   * Mr. Smythies ought to have expressed the supposition of equal par
ticles, since he uses no ratio of masses different from unity.

302                            Royal Society.
that case are their ratios also when the particles move with any velocities,
for otherwise they would be functions of the velocities and not of the po
sitions only. The last equation ()) therefore gives the necessary relation
between the distances and central forces of five moving particles.”
   On this we make no comment, nor on the conclusion that “when
the number of spheres exceeds ten the number of equations is more
than sufficient to determine the law of force, and no law of force is
possible but that which varies directly as the distance.” We shall
merely remark, in justification of this notice, that a writer who is
capable of the independent deduction of the relation existing among
the distances of five points in space, is one whose errors are worth
recording.

March 14,         N so-called Chylous Urine.         By H. Bence Jones,
   1850.             M.D., A.M., F.R.S. &c.
   The definition given of chylous urine is, that it is urine which is
white from the suspension of fatty matter in it. An opportunity of
observing a case of this disease having occurred to the author, he
was led to make the experiments described in this paper. A harness
maker, age 32, half-caste, who had lived in London for twelve years,
had been passing such water for nine months. On examination of
the water made at 2 P.M. it solidified, looking like blanc-mange in
ten minutes. It was very feebly acid, contained fibrine, albumen,
blood-globules and fat; specific gravity = 1015. 1000 grs, of this
 urine gave—
                       44'42 grs. total solid residue.
                         8:01 grs. total ash.
                        14'03 grs. albumen.
                         8:37 grs. fat.
                       13:26 grs. urea and extractive matter.
                          “75 gr, loss.
                      955-58 grs. water.
   In order to watch the variations produced by food and exercise
in the appearance of the urine, every time the urine was made, for
five days and nights it was passed into bottles marked with the hour,
From these observations, and more particularly from the third, fourth,
and sixth days, it was evident that the fibrine and albumen appear in
the urine when no fat is there, and that the albuminous urine occurs
before food has been taken, and disappears during the night with
perfect rest. Thus the fourth day, at 7' 15" A.M., on first getting
up the urine contained the slightest trace of albumen. The specific
gravity = 1027; the precipitate by alcohol =0.8 gr. per 1000 grs.
urline.
   At 9" 50” A.M., just before breakfast, the urine formed a solid
coagulum free from fatty matter, but contained a visible deposit of

blood. Specific gravity =1015.6; the precipitate by alcohol = 14.1
grs. per 1000 grs, of urine.
   At 11 A.M., the urine was chylous or white from fatty matter.
   Further experiments on the influence of rest and motion in less
ening or increasing the albumen in the urine previous to food are
then given.
   On five different mornings, by rising early or late, and by col
lecting the precipitate from the urine by alcohol, the influence of
rest and motion was determined.       The author states that he could
fix beforehand whether the urine should be albuminous or not, by
directing the patient to get up, or to lie still.
   The patient was bled and the serum was opalescent, but did not
clear with aether: the blood contained no excess of fat. 1000 parts
of blood gave—
                       2.63 grs, fibrine.
                      1593 grs. blood-globules.
                       78.1 grs. solids of serum.
                    240-03 grs. total residue.
                    759-97 grs. water.
   The urine made the same day was examined at different hours;
that made immediately before the bleeding was quite white, and that
made an hour and a half afterwards was very milky also. Specific
gravity=1018. 1000 grs, of urine gave—
                     56'87 grs. total residue.
                      10.80 grs, total ash.
                      13.95 grs. albumen.
                       7.46 grs. fat.
                     24.06 grs. urea, &c.
                        ‘60 gr, loss.
                    943-13 grs. water.
   The conclusions from these experiments are,
   1. That so-called chylous urine, besides fat, may contain albumen,
fibrine, and healthy blood-globules.
   2. That, although the fat passes off in the urine after food is taken,
yet the albumen, fibrine and blood-globules are thrown out before
any food has been taken. During perfect rest the albumen ceases
to be excreted; and it does not appear in quantity in the urine even
after food is taken, provided there is perfect rest. A short time after
rising early the urine may coagulate spontaneously, although no fat
is present; and this may happen previous to food, when the urine is
free from fat.
   3. Though the urine made just before and a short time after
bleeding was as milky as it usually was at that hour of the day, yet
the serum of the blood was not milky: it did not contain a larger
quantity of fat than healthy blood does.
   The general results are,—
   1. That the most important changes in the urine in this disease
take place independently of the influence of digestion.
   2. That the urine in one respect only resembles chyle, and that

304                         Royal Society.
is in containing, after digestion, a large quantity of fat in a very fine
state of division. The supposition that the disease consists in an
accumulation of fat in the blood, which is thrown out by the kidneys,
carrying with it albumen,fibrine, blood-globules and salts, is altogether
disproved, both by actual analyses of the blood, and by the frequent
occurrence of a jelly-like coagulum in the urine when no white fatty
matter can be seen to be present.
   3. The disease consists in some change in the kidney by which
fibrine, albumen, blood-globules and salts are allowed to pass out,
whenever the circulation through the kidney is increased; and if at
the same time fat is present in the blood, it escapes also into the
urine. That this change of structure is not visible to the naked eye
on post-mortem examination, Dr. Prout long since demonstrated;
and in a case of this disease which was in St. George's Hospital, and
was examined at Plymouth, no disease of the kidney was observed.
From the total absence of fibrinous casts of the tubes from the urine,
it is not improbable that by the microscope a difference may be de
tected in the structure of the mammary processes, rather than in
that of the cortical part of the kidneys.
   April 25.—“On the Temperature of Steam and its corresponding
Pressure.” By John Curr, Esq. Communicated by J. Scott Russell,
Esq., F.R.S.
   The author states that it is intended in this paper to propose a
simple law to determine the pressure of steam corresponding to any
given temperature, irrespectively of experiment, taking as the sole
datum, that the vaporizing point of water under a given pressure is
100 degrees, that number being taken to correspond with the scale
of Celsius; also to construct formulae in accordance therewith ; and
afterwards to compare their results with the actual experiments of the
Academy of Sciences of Paris. He further states that the rationale
of the subsequent formulae is expressed as follows. Let it be con
ceived that a given quantity of water is vaporized under the condition
that the pressure thereon is increased in the same ratio that the vo
lume is increased, or that at intervals of temperature 1, 2, 3, &c. the
volume is increased the same or in equal proportions; the tempe
rature of the volume will be increased exactly as the square of the
temperature indicated by the thermometer, supposing the instrument
to be a true measure of temperature, and as the square of the vo
lume; and the same of the pressure.
   Steam being generated from an indefinite quantity of water and
confined within a limited space, as in the usual boiler, he considers
the foregoing case is reversed; for the volume being constant, the
action of the fire is entirely exerted in producing increased elastic
tension of the vapour; therefore the temperature of the steam at the
interval 1 to 2 degrees is increased inversely in the duplicate ratio
of the ratio in the case first described; that is, the pressure is in
creased directly as the square of the square, or fourth power of the
temperature; whence the following law. The pressure of steam
generated in the usual steam-boiler is directly proportional to the
fourth power of its temperature, when measured by a true scale.

   June 20–" Observations on the Nebulae.” By the Earl of Rosse,
Pres.R.S., &c. &c.
    The object of this paper is to lay before the Royal Society an ac
count of the progress which has been made up to the present time
in the re-examination of Sir John Herschel's Catalogue of Nebulae
published in the Phil. Trans, for 1833.
   Before describing any of the interesting objects the peculiar fea
tures of which the extraordinary powers of the telescope employed
for their examination has brought to our knowledge, the author
 enters upon some details concerning the instrument itself. This
 telescope, which for apertures and the consequent power it possesses
 for the examination of faint details must for a considerable time, at
least, remain unrivalled, has a clear aperture of 6 feet, with a focal
length of 53 feet. It has hitherto been used as a Newtonian, but
 by the easy application of a little additional apparatus it may be
 conveniently worked as a Herschelian; and the author thinks it not
 improbable that, in the further examination of the objects of most
 promise with the full light of the speculum undiminished by a second
 reflexion, some additional features of interest will come out.
    The tube reposes at its lower end upon a very massive universal
joint of cast-iron, resting upon a pier of stonework buried in the
 ground, and it is counterpoised so that it can be moved in polar
 distance with great facility. The extreme range of the tube in right
 ascension at the equator is one hour, but greater as the polar distance
 diminishes. By a little subsidiary apparatus the movement of the
 telescope can be rendered almost exactly equatorial; but up to the
 present time this apparatus has not been used, as without it, the
 movement was found to be sufficiently equatorial for such measure
 ments as have been required. The whole mounting was planned
 especially with a view of carrying on a regular system of sweeping,
 but as yet the discovery of new nebulae has formed no part of the
 systematic work of the observatory, the known objects which re
 quire examination being so numerous that hitherto the observers
 have been fully occupied with them.
    A clock movement was part of the original design, but as yet the
 telescope is not provided with one, and the want of it has not been
 very much felt.
    Various micrometers have been tried, but, upon the whole, the
 Phil. Mag, S, 3, Vol. 37, No. 250, Oct. 1850,                   X

 common wire micrometer with thick lines has been found to succeed
 the best ; for the faint details of the nebulae are extinguished by any
 micrometrical contrivance which either diminishes the light of the
 telescope or renders the field less dark; and thick lines have been
 found to be visible without illumination in the darkest night.
    The telescope has two specula, one about three and a half, and
 the other rather more than four tons weight. Each is provided with
 a system of levers to afford it an equable support. Upon this
 system it was placed before it was ground, and has rested upon it
 ever since. The systems of levers with the mode of applying them
 in the support of the speculum are described in the paper, and also
 the precautions taken to guard against strain and consequent flexure
 of the metal. Notwithstanding these precautions, undoubted evi
 dences of flexure in the speculum have occasionally shown them
 selves.   It has not, however, been found that flexure, even to the
 extent of materially disfiguring the image of a large star, interferes
 much with the action of the speculum on the faint details of nebulae,
 although it greatly lessens its power in bringing out minute points
 of light, and in showing resolvability where, under favourable cir
 cumstances, resolution had been previously effected.
    It is stated that, in the spring of 1848, the heavier of the two
specula, for nearly three months, performed admirably, very rarely
exhibiting the slightest indication of flexure. It then remained in
active for some time before and after the solstice, and when obser
vations with it were again commenced, it was found to be in a state
of strain. On cautiously raising it a little by screws, for the pur
pose of readjusting the levers, it was found that the unequal strain
of the screws had produced permanent flexure, so that the speculum
did not again perform well until after it had been reground. Re
cently an alteration has been made in the mode of supporting the
lighter of the two specula, which now rolls freely on eighty-one
brass balls that support it nearly equably. After referring to other
causes of unequal action, among which the varying state of the
atmosphere is one of the most serious, the author remarks that the
Society will not be surprised should it be in his power at a future
time to communicate some additional particulars, even as to the
nebulae which have been most frequently observed.
   The very beautiful sketches which illustrate the paper, are, it is
remarked, on a very small scale, but are sufficient to convey a pretty
accurate idea of the peculiarities of structure which have gradually
become known. In many of the nebulae they are very remarkable,
and seem even to indicate the presence of dynamical laws we may
perhaps fancy to be almost within our grasp.
   On examining these sketches it will at once be remarked, as stated
by the author, that the spiral arrangement so strongly developed in
H. 1622, 51 Mesier, is traceable more or less distinctly in several of
the sketches. More frequently indeed there is a nearer approach
to a kind of irregular interrupted annular disposition of the luminous
material, than to the regularity so striking in 51 Mesier; but it can
scarcely be doubted that these nebulae are systems of a very similar

mature, seen more or less perfectly, and variously placed with refer
ence to the line of sight. The author adverts to the description of
this nebula by Mesier, Sir William Herschel and Sir John Herschel,
and remarks, that taking the figure given by Sir John, and placing
it as it would be seen with a Newtonian telescope, we shall at once
recognize the bright convolutions of the spiral which were seen by
him as a divided ring: thus with each increase of optical power the
structure has become more complicated, and more unlike any thing
which we could picture to ourselves as the result of any form of
dynamical law of which we find a counterpart in our system. After
pointing out the importance of measurements and the difficulty of
taking them satisfactorily, the author states, that of a few of the
stars with which the nebula is pretty well studded, measurements
with reference to the principal nucleus were taken by his assistant
Mr. Stoney in the spring of 1849, and that these have been repeated
this year during the months of April and May, and also some mea
sures taken from the centre of the principal nucleus to the apparent
boundary of the spiral coils in different angles of position. A hope
is then expressed that, as several of these stars are no doubt within
reach of the great instruments at Pulkova and at Cambridge, U.S.,
the distinguished astronomers who have charge of them will consider
the subject worthy of their attention.
    The spiral arrangement of 51 Mesier was detected in the spring
of 1845, and in the following spring an arrangement, also spiral,
but of a different character, was detected in 99 Mesier. The author
 considers that 3239 and 2370 of Herschel's ‘Southern Catalogue’
are very probably objects of a similar character; and as the same
instrument does not appear to have revealed any trace of the form
of 99 Mesier, he does not doubt that they are much more conspicu
ous, and therefore entertains the hope that, whenever the southern
hemisphere shall be re-examined with instruments of great power,
these two remarkable nebulae will yield some interesting result.
    The author briefly refers to the other spiral nebulae discovered
up to the present time, which are more difficult to be seen, and to
 clusters in the exterior stars of which there appears to be a tendency
to an arrangement in curved branches. He then passes to the re
 gular cumular nebulae, in which, although they are perceived at once
 to be objects of a very different character, there still seems to be
 something like a connecting link.
    Among the nebulous stars two objects are stated to be well
 worthy of especial notice—No. 450 of Sir John Herschel's Catalogue,
 and i Orionis. A representation of No. 450, as seen with the six
 feet telescope, is given. It has been several times examined, but as
 yet not the slightest indication of resolvability has been seen. The
 annular form of this object was detected by Mr. Stoney when ob
 serving alone, but Lord Rosse has since had ample opportunities of
 satisfying himself that the object has been accurately represented.
 A representation of i Orionis is likewise given. The remarkable
 feature in this object, the dark cavity not symmetrical with the star,
 was also discovered by Mr. Stoney when observing alone with the

 three feet telescope. Lord Rosse has since seen it several times and
 sketched it. A small double star n, fi has similar openings, but
 are not so easily seen. These openings appear to be of the same
 character as the opening within the bright stars of the trapezium of
 Orion, the stars being at the edges of the opening. Had the stars
 been situated altogether within the openings, the suspicion that the
 nebula had been absorbed by the stars would perhaps have suggested
 itself more strongly. As it is, the author thinks we can hardly fail
 to conclude that the nebula is in some way connected with these
 bright stars, in fact that they are equidistant, and therefore, if the
 inquiries concerning parallax should result in giving us the distances
of these bright stars, we shall have the distance of this nebula.
    The long elliptic or lenticular nebulae are stated to be very nu
merous, and three sketches of remarkable objects of this class are
given.
    In proceeding with the re-examination of Sir John Herschel's
Catalogue, several groups of nebulae have been discovered, in some
of which nebulous connexion has been detected between individuals
of the group, in others not. Sketches of some have been made and
measures taken; but although the subject of grouped or knotted
nebulae is considered one of deep interest, it has not yet been pro
ceeded with far enough to warrant entering upon it in the present
paper.
    The conclusion of the paper is occupied with remarks relating to
each figure, in order to render the information conveyed by it more
complete, and these are stated to be for the most part extracts
selected from the Journal of Observations.

                         TENACITY OF METALS.
A*      the results of numerous experiments, M. Baudrimont has
        arrived at the following conclusions:—
    1. That the tenacity of metals varies with their temperature.
   2. That it generally decreases, though not without exception, as
the temperature rises.
   3. That with silver the tenacity diminishes more rapidly than the
temperature.
   4. That with copper, gold, platina and palladium, it decreases less
rapidly than the temperature.
   5. That iron presents a very peculiar and remarkable case: at
212°F. its tenacity is less than at 32°; but at 392° its tenacity is
greater than at 32°.—Comptes Rendus, Juillet 29, 1850.

ON THE ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF LACTIC ACID AND ALANIN.
   M. A. Strecker states that lactic acid, when treated with binoxide
of lead, yields carbonic acid and aldehyd; on the other hand, it is
separated by heat into oxide of carbon, aldehyd and water, as

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            309
 shown by M. Engelhardt. These reactions induced the author to
 suppose that lactic acid might be a compound constituted of formic
 acid and hydruret of benzoyl (aldehyde benzoigue). Guided by
 these ideas, M. Strecker succeeded in forming lactic acid by means of
 lºyd and hydrocyanic acid, which is readily converted into lactic
 aC101.
    The following are the results of M. Strecker's experiments:–
    Aldehyd, ammonia and prussic acid, treated in aqueous solution
 by hydrochloric acid, combine and fix two equivalents of water:
 there are formed sal-ammoniac and the hydrochloric combination of
 a new substance homologous with glycocoll and leucin, which the
 author has named alanin. The following equation represents the
 formation of alanin:—
                 C*H* O2+C2 NH +2HO=C6H NO4.
                   aldehyd                      alanin
    Alanin is isomeric with lactamide, urethran and sarcosin; it differs
 from these compounds by its properties. Alanin crystallizes in
 oblique rhombic prisms; it dissolves readily in water, but is insoluble
 in alcohol or in aether.      The solution of alanin has a distinct
 sugary taste; it has no action on litmus paper. Alanin exposed to
 a moderate heat undergoes no change; it requires a temperature ex
ceeding 392°F. to sublime it, and, this is effected without changing
its composition.
    Alanin combines with acids, and gives a double salt with chloride
of platina; these combinations, the composition of which does not
differ from the salts formed with organic bases, possess an acid re
 action. They are readily soluble in water and in alcohol. M.
 Strecker has analysed the following compounds:—
                   C6H NO+, NO6 H;
                   C6 HT NO4, H Cl;
                   2(C6H7NO.,) H Cl;
                   2(C6H7NO.) HCl, 2PtCl2.
    Alanin combines also with metallic oxides, forming compounds
soluble in water, and less soluble in alcohol.   In these combinations
the metallic oxide replaces 1 equivalent of the water of the alanin.
The author has analysed the copper salt, crystallized in prisms of a
fine blue colour (C6H5NO3, CuO + HO), and which loses 1 equi
valent of water at 248°F.; the silver salt (C6H5NO3, AgO), and
the lead salt (C6H5NO3, PbO, --PbO, HO).
    Alanin combines also with nitrate of silver.   This compound, re
presented by Cº HT NO”, AgO, NO", crystallizes in colourless rhom
bic tables; it is soluble in alcohol.
   It will be observed that the properties of alanin differ much from
those of urethan and lactamide, with which it is isomeric ; it more
nearly resembles sarcosin, from which however it is distinguished by
its property of combining with metallic oxides. It is therefore
alanin, and not sarcosin, which is the homologue of glycocoll and
leucin. By substituting valeral for aldehyd, the author hopes to
obtain leucin.

310             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   Alanin is not acted upon by acids, nor by a boiling concentrated
solution of potash. When fused with hydrate of potash, hydrogen
is evolved, and there are formed hydrocyanic and acetic acids, which
remain combined with the potash.
   If nitrous gas (NO3) be made to act upon a solution of alanin,
much nitrogen is evolved: the solution evaporated with a gentle
heat gives a syrupy residue, which, treated with aether, yields an
acid which was readily recognized by its reactions, and by the ele
mentary analysis of its zinc salt, to be lactic acid. In fact the ana
lysis of this salt led to the formula C* Hº O', ZnO--3Aq. At 212°F.
it loses 3 equivalents of water. It is therefore common lactic acid,
and not that found in muscular flesh.
   The formation of lactic acid, in the reaction described is repre
sented by the equation
                C6 HT NO.4+NO3=C6H6 O6-i-HO-H2N.
                   alanin             lactic acid
   This reaction is interesting, especially when it is considered that
the lactic acid, the formula for which ought probably to be doubled,
is derived from grape-sugar by a simple molecular modification.—

                ON THE ACTION OF BASES UPON SALTS.
                         BY M. ALWARO REYNOSO,
   It is generally admitted that when a salt, the oxide of which is
insoluble, is treated with an alkaline solution, the oxide is precipi
tated without redissolving, unless in its uncombined state it is so
luble in an excess of the alkali with which the salt containing it is
mixed.
   On investigating the action of potash and soda on the arsenites,
the author observed some facts, which, if they be not precisely
contrary to the general law which he has cited, prove at least that
this phaenomenon of precipitation is sometimes intimately connected
with the nature of the salt above the precipitate; so that, in certain
 cases, this salt may determine the solubility of the oxide.
   Thus, for example, the oxides of copper, uranium, cobalt, nickel,
silver, mercury and sesquioxide of iron, being insoluble in potash and
in soda, when these alkalies are poured into the arsenites of these
bases, precipitation of the insoluble oxide ought merely to occur,
with the formation of arsenite of potash or soda, unaccompanied
with any action on the oxide; M. Reynoso has, however, found that
the arsenites of all these oxides are completely soluble in potash,
although in a separate state they are insoluble.
   Arsenite of iron is very soluble in potash; the solution of arsenite
of copper is blue, and after a certain time it decomposes into prot
oxide of copper, which precipitates, whilst the arsenite of potash
becomes arseniate.
   The decomposition of the solution of arsenite of mercury is almost
instantaneous. The solution of silver is colourless, and decomposes
very slowly, precipitating silver as a black powder. This solution

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               311
 does not precipitate with chloride of sodium; on the contrary, chlo
 ride of silver, which is insoluble in potash, dissolves in it very readily
 when arsenite of potash is added.
    M. Reynoso took advantage of these two properties of arsenite of
 silver to effect the reduction of the salts of palladium by means of
 silver. The experiment is performed as follows: chloride of palla
 dium, to which arsenite of potash is previously added, is poured into
 a solution of arsenite of silver in potash. A black powder is readily
 precipitated, which contains metallic silver and palladium. Chloride
 of platina is much more readily reduced than that of palladium.
 It is to be observed that, in these reactions, arsenite of silver decom
 poses much more quickly than when it is alone.
    The arsenites of cobalt, nickel and uranium, dissolve completely
in potash and soda, only in the nascent state. For this purpose it
is necessary to employ arsenite of potash with a great excess of pot
 ash, and to pour this solution into a soluble salt of cobalt, nickel or
Ulranium.
    These reactions will be readily understood, by admitting that
arsenite of potash is capable of forming a double soluble salt with
the compound of potash and these oxides, and that it is under this
influence that their solution is effected. When potash is made to
act upon an insoluble salt, the oxide of which is itself soluble in an
excess of potash, a solution can only occur on the condition of the
formation of a soluble double salt.      Thus, for example, the author
has stated that arsenite of lead is insoluble in potash. The proof that
these reactions depend upon the nature of the salt formed is, that
arsenite of lead, which is insoluble in potash, is completely soluble
in soda.
    When potash is added to an insoluble salt, it first combines with
the acid, and the oxide set free will remain without acting upon the
salt formed; but if excess of potash be added, and the oxide is so
luble in it, then if the compound of this oxide with potash cannot
unite with the supernatant salt, two soluble salts will be present,
which, being able to form an insoluble salt by their decomposition,
will regenerate the primary salts. This, however, is a very rare
case; for experiment has proved that almost all the salts of potash
have the property of forming a soluble double salt with the oxides
soluble in potash.
   With respect to ammonia, the author has stated the solubility
therein of arsenite of sesquioxide of iron.
   In concluding, M. Reynoso observes that four cases of the action
of potash on insoluble salts may occur :—
   1. In the case of certain oxides, which, when uncombined, are
soluble in potash, and which form soluble double salts with all the
salts of potash, the solution may be observed under all circumstances.
   2. In some cases, uncombined oxides, which are soluble in potash,
will form salts insoluble in potash when the acid is not such as yields
a soluble double salt with the compound of the oxide and potash.
   3. Some other uncombined oxides, insoluble in potash, may ne
vertheless sometimes form a soluble double salt, and they will con

312            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
sequently dissolve, when, in the nascent state, they are put into con
tact with potash, in the presence of the salt of potash with which
they can combine.
   4. When the oxide is insoluble in the alkalies, it precipitates
without redissolving, when the salt which it contains is treated with
an excess of alkaline base. This last case happens when the oxide
precipitated cannot form a soluble double salt.—Comptes Rendus,

    M. Strecker remarks, that the excellent researches of M. Wurtz

much light on the constitution of alkaloids in general. M. Hof.

the reaction of ammonia on the chlorides and bromides of the radicals
of the alcohols. The following is a method of preparing ethyalmin,
which probably possesses some advantages.
    If the vapour of anhydrous sulphuric acid be absorbed by common
aether, sulphuric aether, properly so called, or sulphatic aether
(C4H8O, SO3) is formed, which, when water is added to it, remains
dissolved in the excess of aether, from which it may be separated by
spontaneous evaporation.
    Sulphatic aether, treated with ammonia, acts like an anhydrous
acid; it absorbs this base, and forms an ammoniacal salt of an amided
acid. This new salt is represented by the formula 4SO3, C16 H23
NO++NH3; 4 equivalents of the compound aether have absorbed 2
equivalents of ammonia, one of which has entered into the compo
sition of the acid. On treating this salt with carbonate of barytes
or of lead, ammonia is evolved, and barytic or lead salts are formed
with the new acid, named by M. Strecker ethamic acid. This acid,
treated with a hot solution of potash, yields ethyalmin, as proved by
 the analysis of the platina salt, which gave as its composition C*H" N,
 HCl, PtCl2; there are also formed alcohol and sulphuric acid.—

       ON THE ACTION OF CARBON ON METALLIC SOLUTIONS.
                               BY M. ESPRIT.
     It is stated by the author, in reference to the experiments on the
 above subject by M. Schönbein, that long since MM. Chevallier,
 Girardin, Graham and Weppen, had noticed some of the interesting
 phaenomena produced by it. But all these chemists made their ex
 periments with perfectly purified animal charcoal; M. Schönbein,
 on the contrary, made use of ivory-black and coke, that is to say, of
 two varieties of carbon of complex constitution, and but little fa
 vourable for studying the action peculiar to carbon and for distin
 guishing it from that attributable to the foreign substances which
 accompany it. Ivory black, according to the analysis of M. Braconnot,
 contains only 79 per cent. of carbon, the remaining 21 parts being
 composed of resinous matters, sulphate and phosphate of ammonia,
  chlorides, &c., all of which are substances which can and must ever
 possess a decided influence on the results of the experiment. It is
 indeed true that the greater part of these impurities may be got rid
  of; and it would be satisfactory to know that the precaution had
  been taken, but it is not mentioned that it was so. The same may
 be said of coke, which always contains, according to the manner in
  which it has been prepared, variable proportions of sulphur and of
  sulphurets, of which it is requisite to take notice.
     M. Esprit is of opinion that the reduction of metallic solutions by
  carbon does not always occur; and he differs from M. Schönbein in
  supposing that bichloride of mercury is by its action reduced to pro
  tochloride.    It is quite true that when a cold solution, even of bi
  chloride of mercury, is treated with powdered charcoal, no trace of

  814          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 the bichloride is to be found in the filtered liquor; and at first it
 would be quite natural to suppose that reduction had occurred, and
  that protochloride of mercury would be found insoluble in the filter;
  it is however readily shown that this is not the case, as was proved,
 according to M. Esprit, by the following experiment:—a solution
 was made of 1 grm. of sublimate in 100 grims. of distilled water,
 and this solution was treated with 20 grims. of well-washed animal
 charcoal: the liquor, treated with potash, hydrosulphate of ammonia
 and iodide of potassium, did not indicate the presence of a mercu
 rial salt; but on washing the charcoal which had been used in the
 experiment with a mixture of alcohol and aether, sublimate was
 rapidly dissolved; and in so large quantity, that when a tube was
 dipped into the solution, it gave a very distinct red precipitate with
 a solution of iodide of potassium.
     This experiment, which the author repeated several times, and
 always with the same success, induced him to think that carbon does
 not act upon metallic solutions merely as a reducing agent, nor does
 he attribute it to the mere porosity of the charcoal, but he supposes
 that the metallic salt is retained by a peculiar force or special affinity.
 In studying the action of charcoal on metallic solutions, it is requi
 site to employ it quite free from sulphurets and calcareous salts, the
 presence of which complicates the operation, and does not allow of
 a proper estimate of the peculiar action of the charcoal.—Journ. de
 Chim. Méd., Septembre 1850.
       ON THE COPPER TEST FOR SUGAR.            BY M, LASSAIGN.E.,
     It has been long known, according to the experiments of M.
Frommherz, that tartrate of copper dissolved in a solution of potash
is easily reduced when heated with glucose, and converted into sub
oxide of copper. The same author has stated that cane-sugar, which
 differs in composition from glucose, does not act upon this reagent.
 It is on these facts that M. Barreswil has founded his process for
 estimating the quantity of sugar.
    The employment of this reagent is even indicated, in several recent
chemical works, as capable of distinguishing between cane-sugar and
 glucose.
    The alkaline solution of copper, employed as a test liquor, is pre
pared by two published methods; one by M. Barreswil, and the
other by M. Poggiale. The first consists in dissolving with heat, in
one-third of a litre of distilled water, 50 grammes of bitartrate of
potash, and 40 grammes of carbonate of soda, and afterwards adding
30 grammes of powdered crystallized sulphate of copper; after boil
ing, allow the solution to cool, and lastly add 40 grammes of potash
dissolved in one-fourth of a litre of water; it is made up a litre and
again boiled. The second method, proposed by M. Poggiale to de
termine the presence of sugar of milk, which also reduces the oxide
of copper, like glucose, consists in dissolving in 200 grammes of
water i0 grammes of crystalline sulphate of copper, 10 grammes of

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            315
bitartrate of potash, and 30 grammes of potash. This solution when
filtered is of an intense blue colour, and ought to be kept in the dark.
    The trials made with this solution proved that cane-sugar or beet
sugar may produce the same reaction as glucose on the alkaline
solution of oxide of copper, according to the conditions of operating
and the modifications which this kind of sugar may undergo by the
influence of heat alone, or with water.
    M. Lassaigne thinks he has ascertained that glucose acts more
readily, and at a lower temperature, on the copper reagent than
common sugar does; but the latter, if heated till it begins to assume
an amber colour of less or greater depth, then acts like the former.
In fact, an aqueous solution of glucose artificially prepared with
starch, and containing one-fiftieth of its weight of this sugar, treated
with the copper test at a heat of 64° to 68°F., reacts in less than
three or four minutes, or by holding the tube inclosed in the palm
of the hand. Under similar conditions cane-sugar produces no effect
on the solution of copper; but it may be kept for some time near
 212° without giving any appearance of reduction.        By prolonging
 the time of boiling, action is at first perceived by change in the
 blue colour of the solution, slight turbidness, and the separation of a
pulverulent yellow precipitate, which eventually becomes brick-red.
     The action of cane-sugar, not modified by heat, is slow upon the
 alkaline solution of copper; whereas when it has been subjected to
 a more or less high temperature, the action is often as prompt as
 that of glucose on the same reagent.
     Heat, by its action on cane-sugar, ought naturally to put us on
 our guard in employing the solution of copper above mentioned for
 determining glucose in manufactured products in which it is sup
 posed to exist. The employment of this reagent is to be suspected
 of inducing error in certain cases; thus barley-sugar and pate de
 gomme, prepared with cane-sugar slightly caramelized by heating
  the substances which enter into their composition, acted as readily
  on the test as pure glucose.
     It has also been proved that potash, which acts in so characteristic
  a manner upon glucose, and which has been proposed for distin
  guishing this kind of sugar from cane or beet-sugar, often gives with
  these latter sugars reactions analogous to those developed by glucose.
  In the examination of sugars, and various alimentary or medicinal
  preparations into which they enter, the influence which heat may
  produce on these products, and the modifications which result from
  it, should be considered.—Journ. de Chim. Méd., Juillet 1850.
                 NEW REAGENT FOR OxIDE OF CARBON.
      MM. Stas, Dogere and Felix Leblanc, wishing to determine the
  oxygen in carburetted hydrogen by ammoniacal protochloride of
  copper, found that this reagent dissolved a great quantity of oxide
  of carbon and even of olefiant gas. M. Leblanc, having undertaken
  the investigation of this property, obtained the following results:—

  316             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
      1. In passing a current of oxide of carbon into a solution of pro
  tochloride of copper in hydrochloric acid, the gas was absorbed in
  considerable quantity, and with a rapidity comparable to that with
  which carbonic acid is absorbed by potash; but the temperature was
  comparatively but slightly raised.
      2. The ammoniacal protochloride of copper, out of the contact of
  the air, acts in the same manner, and the quantity of gas absorbed
  is the same for the same quantity of copper dissolved. This solution
  becomes blue afterwards by exposure to the air, and may again serve
  to absorb oxygen.
     3. The acid protochloride of copper, saturated with oxide of car
 bon, may be diluted even with a large quantity of water without
 precipitating protochloride of copper, as before absorption, and with
 out any disengagement of gas. The addition of alcohol does not
 render it turbid. AEther appears to destroy, at least partially, the
 compound which M. Leblanc has not hitherto been able to isolate.
 Ebullition or a perfect vacuum expels the gas.
     4. The fact of the absorption of oxide of carbon by the proto
 chloride of copper appears to be of the same order as the absorption
 of nitric oxide by the salts of protoxide of iron, inasmuch as the
 absorption appears to occur in definite proportions. The numbers
 approximate equal equivalents of copper and oxide of carbon.
    5. The protosalts of iron or tin do not act upon oxide of carbon.
     6. The various salts of protoxide [suboxide j of copper dissolved
 in ammonia absorb oxide of carbon like the protochloride of copper.
     7. Cyanogen is also absorbed by protochloride of copper; there
 is then formed a deposit of a chrome-yellow colour, which is rapidly
 modified in the air.—Journ. de Chim. Méd., Juillet 1850.
    ON A CAUSE OF WARIATION IN         THE ANGLES     OF CRYSTALS.
                           BY M. J. NICKLES.
    The author states that the cause is the intervention of foreign
substances. In September 1849 he pointed out this cause in the
variations of the angles of the prisms of sugar of gelatine; and he
now adduces a new fact which readily allows of verifying the influ
 ence that a small quantity of foreign substances may exert on the
crystalline form of bodies which are deposited in its presence. When
a solution of chloride of cobalt containing an excess of sal-ammoniac
is allowed to evaporate spontaneously, crystals of the last-mentioned
salt are obtained which are more or less coloured, the angles of which
are always near, but never 90°: the difference often exceeds 7°, and
yet these crystals contain only 0.5 to 1 per cent. of chloride of co
balt. The same fact has been observed with respect to crystals of
hydrochlorate of ammonia deposited in the presence of bichloride of
platina, chloride of nickel, and also with chloride of potassium depo
sited under similar circumstances.—L'Institut, No. 852.

  ON THE EXTRACTION OF IODINE FROM PLANT'S AND FROM
                        COAL.    BY M, BUSSY.
   Some doubts having been expressed by several persons in the
Academy with respect to the accuracy of the statements respecting
the existence of iodine in certain plants, the author deposited a spe
cimen of cress and of the iodine which he had obtained from it, and
also of iodide of potassium procured from the same plant.
   M. Bussy also remarks that in 1839 he showed that the coal of
Commentry contains iodine. Some portions of this coal contain
much sulphuret of iron; whence it happens that whilst working,
masses often undergo a kind of slow combustion. The heat thus
produced gives rise to thick vapours which condense on the surface,
and the product is found to consist of sulphuret and other arsenical
compounds, with much sal-ammoniac, containing hydriodate of am
monia: at the period mentioned the author merely stated the pecu
liar reactions of iodine, without trying to isolate it. Not having
any of the natural product in his possession in which he had first
met with iodine, he had recourse to the products of the distillation
of coal for obtaining gas; and he found in the ammoniacal liquor a
considerable quantity of iodine, and such as he could separate and
estimate.                          -
   The process which he adopted was to add to a certain quantity
of the condensed water enough potash to convert the hydriodate of
ammonia into iodide of potassium ; by evaporation to dryness and
calcination, the tarry matter was destroyed; and the residue being
treated with alcohol, yielded iodide of potassium.     The iodine was
estimated by means of iodide of palladium, by the decomposition of
which by heat iodine was obtained, of which a specimen was pre
sented to the Academy.
   Three kilogrammes of the condensed water of the establishment
at the barrière of Fontainebleau yielded 0-59 gr. of iodine, nearly 0:2
per kilogramme, or 2 ten-thousandths: iodine was also found in the
liquor of another establishment, which renders it probable that it will
be found in all varieties of coal.
   M. Bussy remarks that the quantity stated does not include the
whole of the iodine contained in the coal, since a quantity remains
in the coke, which may be obtained by incineration.
   M. Bussy observes, that the distilled product of gas-works may
possibly be employed for the oeconomical preparation of iodine, espe
cially if it could be obtained without prejudice to the separation of
the ammoniacal salts.—L'Institut, No. 853.

                             BY M. MENE.
   The author, who is chemical assistant at the College of France,
states that he has discovered bromine in the ammoniacal liquor ob
tained as above mentioned. He has also found the iodine previously
mentioned by M. Bussy.—Ibid. No. 854.

DECOMPOSITION OF METALLIC ACIDS BY IODIDE OF POTASSIUM.
                           BY M. SCHöNBEIN.
   The author states that the antimonic, chromic, molybdic, tungstic,
stannic, titanic, arsenic and even phosphoric acids, are decomposed
either with or without heat by iodide of potassium. The iodine is
disengaged, and a salt of potash is formed. Perchloride of iron,
peroxide of iron, the persalts of iron and the salts of copper, act
similarly on iodide of potassium.
   Bromide of potassium acts like the iodide; but neither the chlo
ride of potassium or sodium is decomposed under the same circum
stances: the chlorides of barium, strontium, calcium and magnesium,
and probably those of many other metals, lose chlorine when heated
with bichromate of potash.
   M. Schönbein states also several experiments performed to show
the deoxidizing power of powdered charcoal in different solutions.
   A solution of sesquichloride of iron is reduced to that of proto
chloride when agitated with powdered charcoal. Calcined lamp
black is more powerful than common wood-charcoal: even coke pro
duces the effect.
   The solutions of persulphate, pernitrate and peracetate of iron are
reduced, like the perchloride, by charcoal. The red prussiate of
potash dissolved in water is reduced to the state of yellow prussiate
when treated with the powder of common charcoal.
    Under the same circumstances the bichloride and permitrate of
mercury are reduced to protosalts of mercury. These reactions are
 certainly very curious; but the interest is doubled by experiments
undertaken to explain them. What is the effect of the charcoal on
these reductions? This question is not solved by M. Schönbein.
It is difficult to believe that carbonic acid is formed; and yet if cal
cined lamp-black is proper for these experiments, as stated by M.
Schönbein, it is impossible to attribute these reductions to the hy
drogen which charcoal may contain.—Journ. de Pharm., Avril, 1850.

   NoTE By M. DU BoIS-REYMonD on M. MATTEUCCI's PAPER
                       ON ELIECTRO-PHYSIOLOGY.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    The Philosophical Magazine for June 1850 (vol. xxxvi. p. 489)
 contains an extract from a paper on Electro-Physiology by Signor
 C. Matteucci, read at the Royal Society, in which I find the follow
 ing sentence —“M. Du Bois-Reymond (Comptes Rendus) has related
 an eaperiment seeming to lead to the inference that section of the spinal
 marrow increases the eacitability of the lumbar nerves, at least during
 a certain period of time.”
    I beg to state that I never have, either in the Comptes Rendus or
  anywhere else, described such an experiment, or any similar obser

                       Meteorological Observations.                              319
vation. I cannot but express some surprise at being quoted by
Signor Matteucci on a subject which I have not touched upon;
whilst, on so many important occasions, this author seems to have
been quite unacquainted with the real results I have obtained in
electro-physiology.
                           I am, Gentlemen,

 XL. Remarks on an alleged proof of the “Method of Least
    Squares,” contained in a late Number of the Edinburgh Re
    view. In a Letter addressed to Professor J. D. Forbes, by

       MY DEAR SIR,
      HE review of Quetelet’s “Lettres à S. A. R. le Duc
        régnant de Saxe Cobourg et Gotha,” which appeared
 in the July Number of the Edinburgh Review, contains a new
 demonstration of the method of least squares which ought not,
 I think, to pass unnoticed. If it is correct, it is so much
 simpler than those which have hitherto been received, that it
ought to supersede them; and if not, the sooner its incor
 rectness is pointed out the better.
    Some years since, in a paper published in the Cambridge
Transactions for 1844, I made an analysis of all the demon
strations, or professed demonstrations of the method of least
squares, with which I was then acquainted, and I therefore
read this new one with more attention than you perhaps have
given to it.
    The reviewer gives some account of the history of the sub
ject, and remarks that the demonstration of the least squares
was first attempted by Gauss, but that his proof is no proof
at all, because it assumes that in the case of a single element
the arithmetical mean of the observed values is in all cases the
most probable value, “a thing to be demonstrated, not as
sumed.” Gauss afterwards gave another demonstration, which
is perfectly rigorous; but of this the reviewer takes no notice,
though it is mentioned in at least one of the works on the
                   * Communicated by the Author.

322         Mr. R. L. Ellis on an alleged Proof of
theory of probabilities which he has recommended to the
attention of students.   However, in the proof which the re
viewer refers to, which is contained in the tract entitled
 Theoria Mottis Elliptici, Gauss undoubtedly does assume that
the arithmetical mean is the most probable value in the case
of direct observations of a single element. From this assump
tion, he shows that the probability, that the magnitude of an
error lies between a and a +da, must be
                          _4_ e-hº dr,
                             T
h being an indeterminate constant. It follows from this, that
the results of the method of least squares are always the most
probable values that can be assigned to the unknown elements.
Without referring to the Theoria Motiis, you can see the de
tails of Gauss's reasoning in a paper by Bessel, of which a
translation appeared in Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs. The
reviewer is right in saying that Gauss was not entitled to as
sume that the arithmetical mean is the most probable value.
But when he speaks of this as a thing to be proved, and not
assumed, we are led to suppose that he believes that subsequent
writers have actually proved it. In truth this appears, not
only from his statements, but also from the illustrations of
which he has made use.      Thus he states that if shots are fired
at a wafer which is afterwards removed, and we are asked to
determine from the position of the shot-marks the most pro
bable position of the wafer, “the theory of probabilities affords
a ready and precise rule, applicable not only to this but to far
more intricate cases;” and he goes on to say that it may be
shown that the most probable position of the wafer is the
centre of gravity of the marks. Now this result is only then
true when the law of probability of error, which is implied in
Gauss's assumption, really obtains; so that, according to the
reviewer, the demonstration of the principle of least squares
must amount to showing that this law obtains universally; or,
which is the same thing, that the arithmetical mean is always
the most probable value in the case of direct observations of
a single element. If this can be proved, it is doubtless a very
curious conclusion; but it is at any rate certain that Laplace
has not proved it, of whom however the reviewer asserts that
he has given a rigorous demonstration of the principle of
least squares. From one end of Laplace's great work to
the other, there is nothing to justify the assertion that the
centre of gravity of the shot-marks is the most probable
position that can be assigned for the wafer; that is, that the
concurrent existence of the deviations or errors which must

have taken place if the wafer really occupied this position
is more probable than that of those which are similarly implied
in any other hypothesis as to its place. If you find anybody
sceptical as to this, pray ask them to point out the passage,
either in the introductory essay, or in the work itself, or in the
supplements.
   What, then, did Laplace demonstrate 2 something so un
like this, that one is disposed to wonder how he can have been
thus misunderstood. The method of least squares is simply a
method for the combination of linear equations, of which the
unknown quantities are the elements to be determined; the
constant term of each being a direct result of observation, and
therefore affected by an unknown error, while the coefficients
are supposed absolutely known.
   If there are more equations than requisite, that is, more than
elements to be determined, what is the best way of combining
them? In the first place, they must clearly be combined by
some system of constant multipliers, else the resulting equa
tions, not being linear, would generally be insoluble. This
condition, however, though absolutely necessary in practice,
is in no way derived from the theory of probabilities. It is a
merely practical limitation. The question thus narrowed is
simply to determine the system of factors to be employed for
obtaining the value of any particular element. The factors
must of course be such that, in the final equation, the coeffi
cient of this element may be unity, and those of the others
severally equal to zero.
   These conditions being fulfilled, we get a value for the ele
ment in question which is affected by an unknown error, namely
the sum of the errors of observation multiplied respectively
by the corresponding factors. The mean arithmetical value
of this sum may in theory at least be determined, if we know
the law of probability of error for each observation; and
Laplace calls that system of factors the most advantageous
which makes this mean value a minimum.           If, however, the
law of probability of error is unknown, the mean value of the
error cannot be determined.      Nevertheless, if the number of
observations is very large, this mean value approximates to a
certain limit, the form of which is independent of the law of
probability. The essence of Laplace's demonstration consists
in its enabling us to determine this limit. When this is done,
it may easily be shown that the most advantageous system of
factors, those, namely, which make this limiting mean value
of the error a minimum, will give the same value to the ele
ment to be determined as the system of final equations ob
tained by employing the      mº   2
                                      of least squares, provided

324          Mr. R. L. Ellis on an alleged proof of
equal positive and negative errors are equally probable. And
the same is of course true with respect to the remaining ele
 ments. Thus this system of final equations gives to each
element a value affected by a smaller average error than any
other linear system, if the number of observations is suffi
 ciently large. It nowise follows that these values are the most
probable; that is, that the errors which must have been com
mitted if these are the true values, form a combination d priori
more probable than the errors which in like manner have been
committed if any other set of values are the true ones. The
most advantageous set of factors for determining any element
depends only on the coefficients of the equations to be dis
cussed, and not on their constant terms, which are the direct
result of observation. Thus these factors are determinable,
d priori, before the observations are made. But it is only after
the observations have been made that the most probable values
of the elements can be found, and then only if we know the
law of probability of error. Laplace has pointed out the
difference between the two investigations.
    This difference, however, the reviewer does not seem to
have apprehended. He plainly supposes that Laplace proves
the results of the method of least squares to be the most pro
bable results, which can only be the case, as Gauss had in
effect shown, if a special law of error obtains. He therefore
undertakes to prove, that for all kinds of observations this is
actually the only possible law.
    But for the supposed authority of Laplace, he would pro
bably have perceived that nothing can be more unlikely than
that the errors committed in all classes of observations should
follow the same law; and that at any rate this proposition, if
true, could only be proved inductively, and not by and priori
demonstration. For it is beyond question distinctly concei
vable, that different laws may exist in different classes of ob
servation; and that which is distinctly conceivable is a priori
possible. So that we cannot prove it to be impossible, though
we may be able to show empirically that it is not true.
   You will probably agree with me in thinking that a wrong
notion of Laplace's reasoning lies at the root of the reviewer's
new demonstration.     But we now come to the demonstration
itself. The assumption that the law of error is in all cases
the same, is, we are told, justified by our ignorance of the
causes on which errors of observation depend. The law
“must necessarily be general, and apply alike to all cases,
since the causes of error are supposed alike unknown in all.”
Two remarks are suggested by this statement: in the first
place, that our ignorance of the causes of error is not so great

                 the “Method of Least Squares.”               325
but that we have exceedingly good reason to believe that they
operate differently in different classes of observations; and in
the second, that mere ignorance is no ground for any infer
ence whatever.     Ex nihilo nihil.   It cannot be that because
we are ignorant of the matter we know something about it.
Or are we to believe that the assumption is legitimate, inas
much as it in a manner corresponds to and represents our
ignorance? But then what reason have we for believing that
it can lead us to conclusions which correspond to and repre
sent outward realities? And yet the reviewer at the conclu
sion of his proof asserts, that, on the long run, and exceptis
excipiendis, the results of observation “will be found to group
themselves...... according to one invariable law.” Thus the
assumption, though “it is nothing more than the expression
of our state of complete ignorance of the causes of error and
their mode of action,” leads us by a few steps of reasoning to
the knowledge of a positive fact, and makes us acquainted
with a general law, which is as independent of our knowledge
or our ignorance as the law of gravitation.
   Let us, however, suppose it to be true that the law of error
is always the same, and that equal positive and negative errors
are equally probable. To determine the special form of the
law, the reviewer employs a particular case—he supposes a
stone to be dropt with the intention that it shall fall on a
given mark. Deviation from this mark is error; and the pro
bability of an error r may be expressed by the function f(r”)
or f(a”--y”), the origin of coordinates being placed at the mark.
It is of course supposed that equal errors in all directions are
ºly      probable. We have now only to determine the form
off. This the reviewer accomplishes in virtue of a new as
sumption, namely, that the observed deviation is equivalent
to two deviations parallel respectively to the coordinate axes,
 “and is therefore a compound event of which they are the sim
ple constituents, therefore its probability will be the product
of their separate probabilities. Thus the form of our unknown
function comes to be determined from this condition, viz. that
 the product of such functions of two independent elements is
equal to the same function of their sum.” Or in other words,
 we have to solve the functional equation
                      f(a")f(y”)=f(w”--y”).
 But it is not true that the probability of a compound event is
the product of those of its constituents, unless the simple
events into which we resolve it are independent of each other;
and there is no shadow of reason for supposing that the oc
currence of a deviation in one direction is independent of that

326         Mr. R. L. Ellis on an alleged proof of
of a deviation in another, whether the two directions are at
right angles or not. Some notion of an analogy with the
composition of forces probably prevented the reviewer from
perceiving that, unless it can be shown that a deviation y oc
curs with the same comparative frequency when a has one
value as when it has another, we are not entitled to say that
the probability of the concurrence of two deviations a and y
is the product of the probabilities of each. Without this sub
sidiary proof, the rest of the demonstration comes to nothing.
The conclusion to which it leads is in itself a reductio ad ab
surdum. Of the above written functional equation the solution
is f(r”)=e”, m being a constant, so that the probability of
an error of the precise magnitude a is a finite quantity; and
I need not point out to you that it follows from hence, that
the probability of an error whose magnitude lies between any
assigned limits is equal to infinity, a result of which the in
terpretation must be left to the reviewer. He may have
thought that the exponential factor is the essential part of the
expression
                          h       o
                        —t-e-hºr” da,
                           T
and that the others might, for the sake of simplicity, be dropt
out. But whatever his views may have been, his conclusion
is unintelligible.
   The demonstration may, however, be amended so as to
avoid this difficulty, and we will suppose that the reviewer
meant something different from what he has expressed. Let
f(a”)da be the probability of a deviation parallel to the axis
of abscissae, of which the magnitude lies between a and a +da.
Then,f(y”)dy is similarly the probability of a deviation parallel
to the axis of ordinates, and lying between y and y + dy. Thus
the probability that the stone drops on the elementary area
dardy, of which the corner next the origin has for its coordi
nates w and y, seems to be f(a”)f(y”)dardy; and as all devia
tions of equal magnitude are equally probable, this probabi
lity must remain unchanged as long as the sum of the squares
of a and y remains the same ; so that we have for determining
the unknown function the equation
                    f(wº)f(y”)=f(0)f(cº-y”),
of which the solution is             -
                          f(r)=Ae”;
and as the deviation must of necessity have some magnitude

                 the “Method of Least Squares.”              327
included between positive and negative infinity, we must have
                        A/. *a-
                             - OK
                                          1.
Hence m must be negative; if we call it —h”, it is easy to
show that A is equal to –4–        so that finally
                             A/T
                                   h
                        f(v*)= Wi e-hº,
which is what may be called Gauss's function.
   But to this demonstration, though it leads to an intelligible
conclusion, the original objection still applies: the probability
that the stone drops on the elementary area dardy is not, ge
nerally speaking, equal to f(r”)f(y”)dardy; so that the equation
for determining the form of the function, namely,
                     j(a”).f(y”)=f(0)f(x^+y”),
is not legitimately established.
   To illustrate this, let ar(ry)drdy be the probability that the
stone falls on the elementary area in question; then the con
dition that the probability of a deviation of given magnitude
is constant will be expressed by
                       wr(ry)=w(w/*-Hy”, 0). . . . . (A.)
Moreover, we shall plainly have
                                   + ox
                       f(w”) =/. a<U+017F> (ay)dy
and
                       f(y”)=i<U+017F>    º da: ;
and in order that the demonstration may be valid, we must have
                        f(wº) f(y”)= ~(ay),
Or
               + O.            +o,
           J’ º/ ºr=~(~). . . . (B)
If this be true, then, and then only, equation (A.) may be re
placed by
                    f(a”)f(y”)=f(0)f(w°4-y”).
But in order that (B.) may be true, w(ay) must evidently be
the product of two factors; one of them a function of y only,
and the other of ar, and the integral of each factor, taken be
tween infinite limits must be equal to unity. Combining this

conclusion with (A.), we find that
                               Ji?
                       w(r)=#e
                             – " 2-h”(z”--u”
                                       (*+y”),
and consequently
                       f(e)=#e-re.
Consequently the equation for determining the form of fre
sults from a tacit predetermination of that function.
   The assumption expressed by
                         f(a")f(y”)=w(xy)
is therefore either a simple mistake or a petitio principii: the
former, if it is deduced from the general principle that the pro
bability of a compound event is equal to the product of those
of its elements; the latter, if it is made to depend on the par
ticular form assigned to f(a").
    After all, too, if the demonstration were right instead of
wrong, it would not prove what is wanted. For if the law of
probability of a deviation parallel to a fixed axis is expressed
by the function
                          _*-e-º da,
                             T
which is what the amended demonstration tends to show, the
probability that the stone falls on the area dray is plainly
                           2
                          *e-lºaty) dardy.
                          T
Transforming this to polar coordinates, and integrating from
0 to 2 T for the angle vector, we get 2hºe-”rdr for the pro
bability that the deviation from the mark lies between r and
r--dr; a result which may be verified by integrating for r
from zero to infinity, the integral between these limits being
equal to unity. Thus if the deviations measured parallel to
fixed axes follow the law which the reviewer supposes to be
 universally true, the deviations from the centre or origin fol
low quite another; and hence it appears that his illustration
is altogether wrong. For if 2hºe-”rdr is the probability of
an error lying between r and r + dr, the centre of gravity of
the shot-marks is not the most probable position of the wafer.
So that his hypothesis is self-contradictory.
   The original source of his error was probably the analogy
between Gauss's law, and the limiting function in Laplace's
investigation.

XLI. An Account of some Thunder-storms and extraordinary
   Electrical Phaenomena that occurred in the neighbourhood of
   Manchester on Tuesday the 16th of July 1850. By PETER
   CLARE, F.R.A.S., Vice-President of the Literary and Phi
   losophical Society of Manchester*.
                             [With a Plate.]
ON the        16th of July in the present year several severe
        storms of thunder, lightning, hail and rain, attended
with fatal results, occurred in the southern part of Lancashire
and northern part of Cheshire, which were succeeded by some
very extraordinary electrical appearances, such as I do not
remember to have previously noticed, although I have been
an attentive observer of electrical discharges in the atmosphere
for more than half a century.
   These storms, with one exception (which occurred in Der
byshire), appear to have originated in different localities,
within a range of fifty miles from north to south, and forty
miles from east to west; extending from the river Ribble
below Preston in the north to the neighbourhood of Nantwich
in the south, and from the course of the river Irwell near
Bury in the east, to North Meols in the west.
   For several days previous to that on which the storms oc
curred, the weather had been generally very fine, the barometer
varying only from 30:15 inches to 30 inches, giving a mean
for the three preceding days of 80.07 inches. The thermo
meter for the same period, at eight o'clock in the morning,
varied from 65 to 67 degrees of Fahrenheit; at two o'clock P.M.,
from 77 to 79 degrees; and at ten o'clock in the evening,
from 65 to 69 degrees, giving a mean for the four days of
70-33 degrees; whilst during the same period the wind near
the earth blew from the north, or north-north-east, and the
clouds during the whole time moved from east to west.
   On the morning of the 16th, previous to the commencement
of the storms, the weather was very fine at Manchester, with
some thin clouds floating in the atmosphere; but as the day
advanced the clouds became more dense, although the pressure
of the air did not vary more than the one-hundredth part of
an inch from eight o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock in
the evening. About two o'clock in the afternoon some dark
clouds had formed in the north and east, and afterwards ex
tended towards the west; at four o'clock those in the north
west had become much more dense and dark, and one or two
distant peals of thunder were heard in that direction, but with

Philosophical Society, October 1, 1850.

 330           Mr. P. Clare on some Thunder-storms
 out the usual signs of an approaching storm.        It appears,
 however, that about this time a violent storm of thunder and
 lightning had commenced in the neighbourhood of Bolton,
 twelve miles north-north-west of Manchester, accompanied
 with very heavy rain and large hail-stones, and continued for
 nearly two hours, extending westward, and to the west-south
 west and north-west, for many miles; it also extended five or
 six miles to the east, as far as Bury, a distance of nine miles
 north of Manchester; but the rain and hail were not quite in
 such profusion as at Bolton, or to the north-west of it, never
 theless a boy and horse were killed by the lightning about a
 mile and a half beyond and to the north of Bury: the boy
 was about ten years of age, and riding on a horse with milk
 cans attached to it; and when they got to Littlewood Cross
 they were struck by the electric fluid, and both boy and horse
 killed on the spot. During the storm a house near Union
 Square, Bury, was also struck by the lightning, but not much
damaged.
    At six o'clock the rain ceased at Bolton for nearly an hour,
 after which the thunder, lightning and rain recommenced to
 the west, north-west, and east of the town, and continued for
some time. The damage done within the borough of Bolton
was much less than might have been expected, considering
the severity of the storm; yet there were not less than seven
houses and mills struck with the lightning; but the damage
actually done was not to any great extent, as the fires which
it occasioned were soon subdued.      The effects of the storm
were however more appalling in a west and north-westerly
direction, to a distance of several miles, where the rain de
scended in torrents, causing the water to rush down the hills
with immense force, covering whole meadows, carrying abun
dance of hay with it, and overflowing the banks of rivers to a
considerable extent, by which one of the trains was stopped at
the Horwich station on the Bolton and Preston Railway for
about twenty minutes.
   In the district below the Rivington Hills the water advanced
so unexpectedly, so rapidly, and with such impetuosity, as to
remove whole bales of cotton from the mills, and also pieces
of cloth from the print-works, to a considerable distance.
Other casualties also occurred, comprising the following, some
of which are of a melancholy character.
   At Horwich the flood rose to such a height, that the water
burst through the windows of the cotton mill of William Ben
nett, jun., at Wilderswood, doing damage to the amount of
several hundred pounds; other mills in the same neighbour
hood also sustained considerable injury from the flood. At

           and extraordinary Electrical Phaenomena.          331
Adlington, a colt belonging to Ralph Shaw was drowned by
the flood. At Blackrod, Joseph France, aged forty years,
was engaged with another man in sinking a shaft at a colliery,
when the water rushed so suddenly into it that he could not
be got out and was drowned.
   At Burnden the head gearing of a chain belonging to a coal
pit of Mr. Scowcroft's was struck by the lightning and da
maged; and in the same neighbourhood, a chimney-piece in
the house of Thomas Braughton was struck and shattered.
   At West Houghton, a large stack of hay belonging to
Thomas Woods was set on fire, but soon extinguished.
   At Adlington, the electric fluid entered a house where a
woman and her five children were sitting, and after breaking
a looking-glass that hung over her head, and destroying the
chimney ornaments, it left the house without injuring any of
the inmates.
   At Horwich, the electric fluid entered the house of Mr.
Welsh, broke a large mirror and sundry other articles, and
struck a boy twelve years of age, who afterwards lay in a pre
carious state for some time.
   At Dobhill, to the west of Bolton, a cow belonging to Peter
Boardman was killed in a field by the lightning.
   At Lostock, Ralph Shaw had a foal killed in a field from
the same cause.
   James Lathom, also of Lostock, had a three-years old colt
and a horse both killed by the lightning.
   At Belmont, a cow belonging to Benjamin Helme was killed
by the lightning on the road near to the church.
   At Hindley, a valuable cow belonging to John Battersby,
of Castle Hill, was killed whilst grazing in a field with nine
others.
   At Horrocks Fold Farm, two girls, named Alice Makinson
of Preston, and Ellen Longworth of Horwich, were sitting in
the kitchen with four other persons, when the electric fluid
came down the outside of the chimney, through the roof and
the floor, and struck Alice Makinson dead on the spot: the
fluid hit her on the shoulder, and passing down her body tore
the sole from one of her clogs in its resistless progress. There
were no appearances on the body of the other girl, Ellen
Longworth, of having been struck by lightning, but she was
taken out of the kitchen in a state of insensibility; and though
she revived a little, and was restored to consciousness, she
only lingered until five o'clock the next morning, when she
died.
   These instances of the destructive violence of the storm
occurred chiefly to the north-west and west of Bolton, between

 332          Mr. P. Clare on some Thunder-storms
 that town and Wigan, in which direction it seems to have
 progressed; for a little before five o’clock distant thunder was
 heard towards the east and south-east of Wigan, and about
 six another storm arose to the north of the last-named town,
 which spread or extended southward, so as to unite with that
 approaching from the east; and when they united, the rain
 began to descend in torrents, having more the appearance of
 the descent of a water-spout than of a shower of rain: the
 thunder and lightning were terrific; but I have not been able
to ascertain whether there was any loss of life in this imme
diate neighbourhood, although it is reported that a person
 was killed at Wigan.
   At St. Helens, which is six or eight miles to the south-west
of Wigan, John Rigby, a coal miner, aged forty-six years,
was looking out of an upstairs window of his house during
the thunder-storm, about seven o'clock in the evening, when
he was struck by the electric fluid and killed on the spot:
there was a mark on his breast, and the shoe on his right foot
was torn to pieces. Several persons in the same house were
knocked down, but all of them recovered.
   Robert Gore, a farm-labourer, of Marsh-side in North
Meols, aged twenty years, was driving his master's cart home
between six and seven o'clock the same evening, when the
mare took fright at the noise of the thunder and ran away;
the man and a little boy were riding in the cart at the time:
when the master's son came up with them, he found the mare
and cart on the ground, and Gore lying by the side of the
cart quite dead: the horse and boy escaped.
   Evan Rimmer, a farm-servant, aged eighteen years, was
taking shelter with four others in a stable or shed adjoining
William Wright's farm in Moss Lane, North Meols, when
the building was struck by the electric fluid about seven o'clock
the same evening during the thunder-storm, and they were all
knocked down.      Rimmer was killed; the others were put to
bed and recovered.
   In the country between St. Helens and North Meols, a
distance of about twenty miles in a north-westerly direction,
several persons sustained injury by the lightning; but except
ing the three above mentioned, no fatal cases occurred. At
Ormskirk, a woman who was sewing was struck blind by a
flash of lightning, but recovered her sight in a few days.
   From North Meols the storm passed northward towards
the river Ribble and Lytham, but it does not appear that any
damage was done there by the lightning.
   At about eight o'clock the same evening the town of War
rington, which is situated several miles to the south of the

           and extraordinary Electrical Phaenomena.         333
direction in which the storm above described had raged, was
also visited by a violent storm of thunder and lightning; the
lightning was intensely vivid, and the peals of thunder fol
lowed each other in rapid succession : several accidents oc
curred, but no fatal cases are recorded. At Sankey, a little
to the north-west of Warrington, a stack of hay was set on
fire by the lightning, and a large quantity burnt before the
flames were extinguished. A flat sailing on the canal was
also set on fire by the same cause, but the damage done was
not extensive. This storm appears to have been limited to a
comparatively small district.
   About six o'clock the same evening a storm of thunder and
lightning accompanied with heavy rain commenced about ten
miles to the west of Warrington, and proceeded in a south
easterly direction. After crossing the river Mersey near
 Runcorn and Weston Point, it passed up the valley of the
river Weaver towards Northwich, a town situated ten miles
south of Warrington. At Anderton, about a mile short of
the town, the lightning struck a stack of hay and set it on fire,
but the torrents of rain soon extinguished it. At Witton to
the east, and Leftwich to the south, and both immediately ad
joining Northwich, it appears as if a discharge of electricity
had struck three places at one and the same time; viz. a cot
tage near the toll-bar in Witton was struck, but not much
damaged; a church in Leftwich was also struck, and a quan
tity of stone broken and forced off the gable-end by the light
ning, which passed from thence to a gutter and down a metal
spout to the ground; the third was a poplar-tree in Leftwich,
which was shivered at the top and down the trunk to the
ground. In about an hour afterwards the spire of Davenham
 Church, situated two miles to the south, was also struck by
the lightning; it first came in contact with a wind-vane at the
 top of the spire, after which it passed down a copper rod
about two inches diameter inserted through the solid stone
 work for several yards, with a screw and nut at the bottom to
hold the masonry together; and when it got to the lower end
of the metal, left it and made a large hole in the spire about
two yards long and one foot wide; it then proceeded along
 the masonry to the bottom of the spire, where it made another
 large opening in the stone-work, from whence it immediately
 entered the tower; here an iron pipe or smoke-flue on the
 outside of the tower served as a conductor for the lightning,
 which was conveyed without injury to the building as far as
 the metal went; but where it terminated, towards the bottom
 of the tower, some damage was done to the stone-work before
 the lightning entered the ground.

334           Mr. P. Clare on some Thunder-storms
   Later in the evening a cow belonging to the Rev. Mr.
France of Davenham was killed in Bostock Park, about two
miles further south; and soon afterwards a barn at Winsford,
about a mile and a half to the west of Bostock, was struck by
the lightning but not much damaged; and a little later in the
evening a cow was killed at Minshull, a few miles south of
Winsford.
   The storm extended some distance further to the south and
west, visiting in its progress Holmes Chapel, Over, Nant
wich, &c.
   The electrical state of the atmosphere during the progress
of these storms must have been very much disturbed, as ma
nifested by the frequency and intensity of the electrical dis
charges; whilst the torrents of rain that fell for some time
were probably caused by the currents of air in the higher part
of the atmosphere being much agitated, and moving in various
directions, thereby allowing them to mix freely, and large
clouds to be rapidly generated.
   With the limited knowledge we have of the operation of
those causes which produce thunder-storms, the following
view may not be undeserving a little consideration.
   If we suppose that the quantity or intensity of the electric
fluid connected or combined with each particle or atom of
water is not the same when the atom is in a liquid as it is when
in an aériform state, but, like heat, abounds more when the
atoms are in a state of vapour than when they are in a liquid
state, and which view some experiments appear to support;
then, whenever a quantity of vapour is suddenly condensed in
the atmosphere, the water, whether in the state of a liquid
mass or in innumerable drops, would probably give out elec
tricity, or under favourable circumstances become positively
electrified; by this hypothesis we may account for most, if
not all, the phaenomena that occur in thunder-storms.
   For if the currents of warm and cold air in the atmosphere
are in a very disturbed state, moving in opposite or various
directions, and both nearly saturated with vapour, and if
under such circumstances they become mixed, a portion of
the vapour in the warm air will be condensed and form clouds:
the clouds would be electrified with an intensity proportioned
to their density, magnitude, rapidity with which they were
formed, and the hygrometric state of the air between them
and the earth; and if sufficiently electrified, would remain in
masses separated from each other: this appearance is often
observed in the vicinity of an electrified cloud, or previous to
a thunder-storm. And further, as clouds are generally of
different magnitudes and densities, the electrical power of

            and extraordinary Electrical Phaenomena.           335
those most intensely charged will cause the electricity of the
sides, or portions of other clouds nearest to them, to be elec
trified in a different state, according to the well-known laws
of electrical induction: and as the larger clouds increase in
density or electrical intensity, they will discharge portions of
their electricity to the smaller and less intensely charged
clouds; these again may discharge themselves to more remote
clouds that are still more slightly charged, and thus a succes
sion of flashes of lightning and peals of thunder may occur
for some time. But if the general state of the atmosphere
below the clouds be very damp, the superabundant electricity
would be quietly conveyed to the earth without producing any
electrical appearances whatever.
   In those regions of the atmosphere where clouds, float or
are formed at a considerable elevation, and where the air is
much more rare than near the surface of the earth, the resist
ance to the passage of electricity through it is much less than
near the ground, and consequently the discharges from cloud
to cloud will be more frequent and to greater distances than
from the clouds to the earth.
   If the clouds are rapidly formed and discharge their elec
tricity frequently to the earth, it is probable that a very large
amount of rain will ensue; for during the time they are charged,
the small particles of water of which they are composed will
be repelled from each other by the diverging power of their
electricity; whilst the moment a discharge takes place, espe
cially if it be to the earth, the electricity which kept the par
ticles from uniting together being removed, the drops of water
will immediately unite in immense quantities, and, falling to
the earth, will suddenly increase the shower, not only in quan
tity but in the size of the drops, as is frequently noticed by
attentive observers.     As the different strata of air continue to
mix, the clouds increase and again become charged with elec
tricity, the drops again diverge by repulsion, and the rain
ceases to fall as copiously as it did soon after the discharge of
electricity to the earth; in this manner we may account for
the occasional change during a thunder-storm, from an im
mense profusion to a moderate fall of rain, and vice versä.
   In a thunder-storm prevailing over a considerable extent of
country, and with the clouds at a great elevation, the discharges
of electricity may pass several miles through the air from one
cloud to another; in such cases an observer may have con
siderable difficulty to ascertain in what portion of the sky the
lightning has prevailed; but our late eminent president, Dr.
Dalton, has elegantly described, at page 203 of the second
edition of his Meteorology, how the difficulty can be explained.

 336         Mr. P. Clare on some Thunder-storms
   The electrical state of the atmosphere must have been
greatly disturbed for a much wider district than has been de
scribed; but though we have no account of a thunder-storm
having occurred on the 16th of July between Bury and the
Derbyshire Hills, yet beyond them there was a severe storm;
for Mr. Ransome, F.R.C.S., informs me he was travelling on
that day between Matlock and Buxton, and whilst on the
railway, before arriving at Rowsley, they experienced a violent
storm of thunder, lightning and rain, about five o'clock; but
on arriving at Buxton he did not hear that the storm had visited
that neighbourhood.
   In the country between Buxton and Holmes Chapel in
Cheshire, a distance of twenty-five miles from east to west,
and with some lofty hills to the west of Buxton, there was
not any severe storm of thunder and lightning on that day;
but some sheet lightning and distant thunder were noticed
over a considerable extent of that country in the course of the
evening, with a little rain about sixteen or eighteen miles to
the west of Buxton.
   The storms herein described have no extraordinary features,
except their violence and the melancholy casualties that ac
companied them; but they exhibit a case of electrical disturb
ance deserving notice in connexion with, or immediately pre
ceding the very extraordinary appearances that occurred in
the course of the same evening.
   As the evening advanced, the sheet lightning became more
frequent and vivid at Manchester; and before nine o'clock
the clouds in the south-south-west and west had become very
dark, whilst those towards the south and south-east were not
near so dense, and were separated into masses, with open
spaces between them; these spaces became very plainly visible
when the sheet lightning occurred, which about this period
was very frequent, and accompanied with distant thunder.
   From a quarter before until half-past nine some very extra
ordinary appearances of lightning were observed, such as I
never before witnessed; several flashes seeming to be almost
continuous, or repeated at such short intervals as were scarcely
appreciable, whilst at other times the light actually continued
for a considerable portion of a second.
   The bright coruscations of the electric fluid, which on or
dinary occasions pass between one cloud and another, or be
tween a cloud and the earth, in a tortuous or zigzag line, on
this occasion presented a great variety of forms and ramifi
cations towards the south and south-south-west, similar to the
accompanying sketches, and at an elevation of from fourteen
to twenty degrees above the horizon (see Plate I.); sometimes

            and extraordinary Electrical Phaenomena.         337
 they appeared branched like the roots of a tree, and occasion
 ally with bright balls at the termination of all or some of the
 branches. These coruscations of light commenced about
 the south-west by south, and in all cases proceeded from west
 to east, or from right to left, passing through a horizontal
 space of from eight to fourteen degrees; and at times the
 motion of the electric fluid appeared to be so slow, that its
 progress could be easily observed.
    On three or four occasions, immediately after a ray or nar
 row line of light had passed through a horizontal space of ten
or twelve degrees, a luminous ball of considerable size, more
than twice the diameter of Venus when at her greatest bril
liancy, suddenly appeared, and moved along in the same di
rection as the ray of light had passed, with a progressive
motion from right to left, as from A to B in figs. 2 and 6,
and occupied at least the tenth of a second in its progress.
The other appearances were of a similar character to what are
given in the different figures, and their motion varied from a
horizontal to a vertical direction, as much as the position of
the figures represented in the sketches.
    Some of the coruscations of the electric fluid terminated
with a bright ball at the extremity of each branch, as in
fig. 5; whilst at other times bright balls were seen at only
two or three branches, as at fig. 7. In all cases these lumi
nous appearances seemed to commence from a point where
the clouds were not dense or dark, and to proceed through
the air to their termination without entering or being obscured
by a cloud.
    These, or similar phaenomena, were observed by Mr. Ran
some and his son at Fairfield, near Buxton, in a westerly di
rection, about eight o'clock; but with this difference, that the
branches appeared to pass from left to right, whilst those I
witnessed passed from right to left; similar appearances were
seen by Mr. Chrimes to the north of the zenith, about a mile
beyond Wilmslow in Cheshire, who also observed that the
branches passed from left to right, beginning in the west and
moving towards the north-east; and in some cases they were
so near the ground, that when they disappeared he thought
they were in contact with the hedges,
   Edward Brooke, Esq., of Marsden House, about five miles
to the east of Stockport, with some friends who were on a visit
to him, also observed these remarkable coruscations, which
he says proceeded from left to right, similar to those observed
near Buxton and Wilmslow ; and Colonel Stott, who was of
the party, and who had been several years resident in the
East Indies, declared he had very frequently noticed the dis

338          Mr. P. Clare on some Thunder-storms
play of lightning in that part of the world, but never saw any
thing like the coruscations that appeared that evening.
   Mrs. Clayton, of Adlington in Cheshire, whose residence
is situated three or four miles to the south of Marsden House,
also observed these brilliant coruscations, and likewise says
they appeared to proceed from left to right, or in a direction
contrary to the drawings in the Plate.
   Mr. Alderman Shuttleworth informs me that his sister-in
law observed these remarkable coruscations of lightning in
the neighbourhood of Bolton, which, being twelve miles to
the north-north-west of Manchester, gives a much wider ex
tent of country in which they were observed than the previous
accounts have stated.      In the extract of a letter from her
which he has sent, she says, “I was at Bolton on the 16th of
July, and witnessed an awful storm of thunder and lightning
* * * * about eight a servant who was watching at an upper
window came to say that she saw rings of fire in the sky.
There was a large black cloud in the south-west; behind it
the heavens appeared to open, throwing forth sometimes
 showers of brilliant sparks or of balls of fire, sometimes circles
of flame, sometimes fiery serpents, and at others forked light
ning of unusual breadth, the clouds always edged with beau
tiful sheet lightning.”                          -
    Mr. Joule, F.R.S., has published a highly interesting ac
 count in the Philosophical Magazine for August, of these re
 markable phaenomena as observed by him. He says, some
 of the coruscations passed across the zenith; and from the
 time that elapsed between seeing them and hearing the thunder,
 he considers their general elevation to have been about three
 miles and a half: he likewise observed that the branches
 moved from right to left, similar to what I saw, as shown in
 the accompanying figures. His residence is about a mile and
 a quarter to the west-north-west of mine. He has given a
 sketch in the Magazine of the appearance observed by him,
 which terminated in more numerous branches than those I
 noticed; but though I did not observe any branches so much
 fimbriated at the end as he has represented, yet Mrs. Clayton,
 to whom I showed his account, said she saw some branches
 very much like the figure accompanying his paper, but with
 curves at the ends bent more inwards than in his figure.
    With regard to the identity of these luminous appearances
 seen by different individuals, and the apparent difference in
 the direction of their motion, as stated by the observers at
 Buxton, Marsden House, Adlington and Wilmslow, com
 pared with the account given by the observers at Manchester
 and its vicinity, it may be remarked that Marsden House is

           and extraordinary Electrical Phaenomena.            339
to the south of east, Buxton and Adlington to the south-east,
and Wilmslow nearly south of Manchester. Now if we sup
pose these coruscations to have moved from south-west to
north-east, and some of them at no great elevation above the
earth or distance from Manchester, they would appear to
move from right to left at that town or its vicinity; but if the
same were observed at Marsden House, Adlington or Wilms
low, they would appear to move in an opposite direction with
regard to the spectator, or from left to right, although in both
cases their motion would actually commence in the south-west
and be continued towards the north-east.
    Considering the distance of Buxton from Manchester, it is
not likely that the same coruscations would be seen at both
places; nor would those observed near Buxton be identical
with those seen near Marsden House, Adlington or Wilmslow,
on account of the lofty hills intervening, and the low elevation
of the electrical discharges seen at the latter place; it is there
fore probable that these discharges of the electric fluid were
not confined to a very limited space, but prevailed in the at
mosphere over a considerable district of country, and at a very
moderate elevation; but there is not sufficient evidence to
enable us to determine either their height, or to what extent
they prevailed.
    Mr. Chrimes states that he did not hear any sound as if it
proceeded from the coruscations of light which he observed
in the neighbourhood of Wilmslow; although at the same
time he heard distant thunder in the west, but not any sound
in the north or north-east, although that was the direction in
which the lights were observed to pass and disappear. And
as all parties agree that these brilliant ramifications did not
proceed with the usual velocity of lightning, is it not probable
that their motion was not sufficiently rapid to cause such a
violent concussion in the air as to produce sound?
    There were no very dense clouds where the coruscations
appeared; but in the same direction the sky was mostly ob
scured with clouds of different heights, some of which, as well
 as various strata of the air, were probably in different states of
electrification, whereby the electric fluid might be induced to
 pass from clouds positively electrified to those in a negative
 state, or to a stratum of air negatively electrified. . In the
 passage of electricity from a body positively electrified, it fre
 quently becomes divided into various branches, especially as
 it approaches the negative body: this is often illustrated in
 the progress of electrical discharges from the clouds to the
 earth, when they are observed to be divided into several
 branches as they approach the ground. Similar appearances

340             Essay on the Theory of Attraction.
are often noticed in strong electrical discharges with a powerful
machine, especially where the electric fluid has to be diffused
on or amongst imperfect conductors.
   Probably these or similar phaenomena are not uncommon
in the torrid zone, where it is said the coruscations of light
ning are frequently seen in the sky when there are no clouds;
but as similar appearances are rarely, if ever, observed in this
neighbourhood, I have been induced to draw up the foregoing
account in the hope that if similar phaenomena have been no
ticed, some description of them may be given by other writers.

      GENTLEMEN,                              October 14, 1850.
     ADMIT that my essay noticed in your last Number con
      tains a serious error. I now perceive that wherever p
(the function of the distance, according to which the attractive
force varies) occurs in an equation, the term involving it is
multiplied by a function of the distances and angles, which is
zero for all positions of the bodies, so that p may have any
value consistently with the equations containing it. The cor
rection of this error requires that sections 11, and 13–18 in
clusive, and some short references to them, should be cancelled:
the remainder will be free from this error.
   Till I read your notice, I supposed that my equation be
tween the ten mutual distances of five points in space was
new ; and having since referred to Carnot's memoir, I find
that the labour I spent on the solution of that problem is
not wholly lost, since my demonstration is much shorter
and less laborious for the reader than Carnot's. When all,
in which I have been anticipated or have erred, shall have
been deducted from my essay, I venture to express my hope
that something new and true will still remain. By the publi
cation of this short statement in your Magazine you will much
oblige, Gentlemen,
                           Your obedient Servant,

(1.) THE only salts of soda which I have yet had an oppor
               tunity of diffusing in a sufficient variety of circum
stances are the carbonate and sulphate. These salts appear
to be equidiffusive, but to diverge notwithstanding more widely
in the solutions of the higher proportions of salt than the cor
responding potash salts. It is a question whether this in
creased divergence is not due to the less solubility of the soda
salts, and the nearer approach consequently to their points of
saturation in the stronger solutions.

was 42° the first day, 38° the second, and 37° steadily for the
remainder of the period; the mean being 37°7.
   The mean results at 64° are as follows:—

  Sulphate of soda ......   4-31       8-17    13°50    19-14
   Another series of experiments was made upon a 1 per cent.
solution of the same salts at a mean temperature of 64°9. Six
phials of each solution were diffused, and the water of two
jars afterwards evaporated together, so that the quantities
stated are double.                                       -
   The diffusion product in three experiments with the sul
phate of soda was 477, 4.75 and 4.80 grs. ; mean 4-77 grs.
The diffusion product in three experiments with the carbonate
of soda was 4-61, 4.68 and 4.67 grs.; mean 4-65 grs. The
difference between the carbonate and sulphate is 0.12 gr.; it
is less for the present proportion of 1 per cent. of salt, than
for 2 per cent, so that the diffusion of the salts may be con
verging to a perfect equality in very weak solutions. One
half of the preceding quantities, or the mean results for a single
diffusion cell, are—
           Diffusion of 1 per cent. solutions at 64°9.
           Carbonate of soda, 2.32 grs. . .        100
           Sulphate of soda, 2.38 grs.      . .    102:58
   (2.) The diffusion of the carbonate of soda was further
compared with the nitrate of the same base, to find whether
their times of equal diffusion are related like those of the cor
responding potash salts. The mean temperature of the first
seven days, which was the period of diffusion for the nitrate
of soda, was 66°-9; of the last three days, 65°:2; and of the
whole period of 9.9 days occupied by the carbonate of soda,
66°4. The 4 per cent. solutions were employed.
   The nitrate of soda gave a diffusion product, in three ex
periments, of 11:48, 11:58 and 12-13 grs. ; mean 1173 grs.
   The carbonate of soda, in three experiments, gave l l '66,
11:53, and 11:52 grs. ; mean 11.57 grs. A slight addition
should be made to the latter quantity to raise the diffusion
product from 66°4 to 66°-9. It will appear from a subsequent
experiment that the diffusion of the carbonate of soda in
creases 0.096 gr. for a rise of one degree of temperature;
which will give 0.05 gr, for the half degree in question.

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.            343
Bringing the diffusion of the two salts to the same temperature
of 66°-9, we have therefore diffused, o<U+017F>—
      Nitrate of soda, in seven days, 11.73 grs. .      100
      Carbonate of soda, in 99 days, 11-62 grs. .         99.06
The difference in the quantity diffused of the two salts is only
0-11 gr., or 1 per cent., which is quite within the unavoidable
errors of observation.
   (3.) The diffusion of a 2 per cent. solution of the same salts
was repeated at the same inferior temperature of 54°3 as with
the salts of potash, and under the same difficulties from fluc
tuation of atmospheric temperature. Two water-jars were
evaporated together, so that the results are double.
     itrate of soda, diffused for seven days at a mean tempera
ture of 54°3, gave 10:15, 10:24 and 9.92 grs. in three expe
riments; mean 10:10 grs.
   Carbonate of soda, diffused for 9.9 days at a mean tempe
rature of 53°4, gave 9-93, 9:54 and 10:10 grs. in three expe
riments; mean 9:86 grs.       But the latter amount is to be in
creased by 0.09 gr. to bring it to the diffusion of 54°3. We
have then for the diffusion product of the two salts at the same
temperature of 54°3–
        Nitrate of soda, in 7 days, 10:10 grs. . 100
        Carbonate of soda, in 99 days, 9.95 grs.        98.51
   The difference is again small, namely, 0-15 gr., or 13 per
cent, and within the limits of unavoidable error.
   It appears therefore that the times of equal diffusion of the
nitrate and carbonate of soda are related like those of the ni
trate and carbonate of potash, or as the square root of 1 and
2, that is, as 1 to 1:41:42.
          Relation of Salts of Potash to Salts of Soda.
   It appeared probable, from many of the experiments already
recorded, that if any relation, in the times of equal diffusibility,
existed between the corresponding salts of potash and soda, it
was that of the square root of 2 to the square root of 3. They
were accordingly diffused for times having this ratio; namely,
the nitrate of potash for seven days, the nitrate of soda for
8'57325 days; the sulphate and carbonate of potash for 9.9
days, and the sulphate and carbonate of soda for 12' 125 days.
If these times are rightly chosen, the eventual diffusion pro
ducts of all the experiments should be equal. The l per cent.
solution was selected, and the number of experiments simul
taneously made on each salt was eight or six. The liquids of
two water-jars were evaporated together, so that each of the

344           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids,
results in the table below represents the diffusion of two cells.
These experiments also afford another opportunity of testing
the assumed relation between the nitrates and sulphates of the
same base.

    The range of temperature during the period of these expe
riments rather exceeded 3 degrees, so that they cannot be
considered as fortunate in that respect; but still the similarity
between the different sets of experiments, and the near equa
lity of their means, is very remarkable. The two nitrates and
the two sulphates may be said to coincide, the extreme differ
ence of the means of the four salts not being quite so much as
1 per cent. The two carbonates fall about 3.4 per cent.
below the sulphates and nitrates, but agree perfectly with each
other, showing a uniformity in their irregularity. This de
viation of the carbonates would appear essential, as it has been
observed every time they have been compared with the sul
phates.
    The double relation between salts of potash and salts of
soda, and between the nitrate and sulphate class of each of
these bases, will, I believe, be allowed to acquire considerable
additional support from this new series of observations.
           IV. DIFFUsion of SULPHATE of MAGNESIA.
    In a set of preliminary experiments upon sulphate of mag
nesia in comparison with sulphate of potash, the 4 per cent.
solutions of both salts were diffused for seven days at a mean
temperature of 57°-9, with very little fluctuation, the extreme
range being from 58°5 to 57°75. The sulphate of magnesia
is taken anhydrous in all the following experiments. The
diffusion of sulphate of potash in three cells was 9:16, 9-22
 and 9:57 grs. ; mean 9:32 grs.
    The diffusion of sulphate of magnesia in three cells was
 5:21, 4'98 and 5:34 grs. ; mean 5:18 grs. The diffusion, in

           Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.         345
equal times, appears here to be as 100 sulphate of potash to
55-58 sulphate of magnesia. We know, however, when un
equally diffusible salts are diffused for equal times, that the
diffusion of the slower is exaggerated. Consequently the dif
fusion of sulphate of magnesia is likely to be represented in
excess in these experiments.
    In a second preliminary series of experiments the same 4
per cent. solutions were diffused, the sulphate of potash for
eight days and the sulphate of magnesia for nineteen days,
with the view of discovering their times of equal diffusibility.
    During the first period of eight days the temperature fluc
 tuated considerably, beginning at 54°, falling gradually in four
 days to 50°5, and rising again in four days to 53°; the ave
rage of the whole period was 52°2. The diffusion of sulphate
 of potash from three cells was 9:36, 9:25 and 10:52 grs. ;
mean 9°71 grs.
    During the second period of nineteen days, which included
 the first period, the mean temperature was 54°6. The dif
 fusion of sulphate of magnesia from three cells was 11-81,
 11.6l and 10.90 grs. ; mean 11:44 grs. The variation in the
 amounts diffused of both salts is greater than usual, owing no
 doubt to the changes of temperature, which were imperfectly
 controlled.
    Dividing the quantity of salt diffused by the number of days,
 we have of sulphate of potash 1-214 gr, diffused per day, and
 of sulphate of magnesia 0.602 gr. per day; or the latter salt
 exhibits sensibly half the diffusibility of the former in equal
 times. This suggested the trial of times for these two salts in
 the proportion of 1 to 2, with the view of obtaining equal dif.
 fusions.                                                       -
     (1.) A one per cent, solution of sulphate of magnesia (an
 hydrous) was diffused for the long period of 19.8 days, at a
 mean temperature of 54°7, in eight cells. The diffusion
 products of four pairs of cells were 7:07, 6-71, 7.07 and 7.35
 grs.; mean 7.05 grs., or for one cell, 3:53 grs.
     A similar solution of sulphate of potash diffused for 9.9
 days, or half the preceding period, at a mean temperature of
  55°4, or 0°7 higher, gave a mean product, for two cells, of
  6.79 grs., as before stated, or for one cell, of 3:40 grs. The
 diffusion of sulphate of potash being 100, that of sulphate of
  magnesia is therefore 103.7, a fair approximation to equality.
     (2.) In a second series of experiments upon I per cent.
  solutions of the same two salts, diffused in the vault for four
  teen and seven days respectively, with a mean temperature of
  53°8 for the sulphate of magnesia, and 54°3 for the sulphate
  of potash, the temperature was remarkably uniform, gradually

 346         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
 falling from 55’2 to 53° during the longer period, but without
 any injurious oscillation.
    From eight cells, evaporated two together, the sulphate of
 magnesia obtained was 6'12, 6:12, 6-04 and 6:08 grs.; mean
 6:08 grs, or 3.04 grs. for one cell.
    The sulphate of potash gave from eight cells, in experi
 ments already detailed, a mean result of 5-84 grs. of salt for
 two cells, or 2.92 grs. for one cell. The diffusion is in the pro
 portion of 100 sulphate of potash to 104'll sulphate of mag
 nesia, the times being as 1 to 2 for the two salts respectively.
    From these two series of experiments, it appears that, at
 54°, sulphate of magnesia has nearly, if not exactly, half the
 diffusibility of sulphate of potash, and consequently one-fourth
 of that of hydrate of potash. Or, the times of equal diffusion
for these three salts appear to be 1, 2 and 4. The squares of
these times and the solution densities are 1, 4 and 16. Hy
drate of potash may possibly therefore have the same relation
to sulphate of magnesia in solution, density and diffusibility,
that hydrogen gas has to oxygen gas.
    (3.) A two per cent. solution of sulphate of magnesia, dif
fused for fourteen days, gave at 53°9, for two pairs of cells,
9:57 and 10:00 grs. of salt, of which the mean is 9-79 grs,
or 4'85 grs. for one cell.
    A similar solution of sulphate of potash diffused for seven
days gave a mean result of 497 grs, of salt for one cell, at
54°2, as already stated. The result is a diffusion of 100 sul
phate of potash to 97-59 sulphate of magnesia,
    (4.) A four per cent, solution of sulphate of magnesia, dif.
fused for fourteen days, gave at 53°7, in two pairs of cells,
 18:00 and 18:20 grs. of salt; mean 18- 10 grs. for two cells,
or 9:05 grs, for a single cell.
    A similar solution of sulphate of potash, diffused for seven
days at 54°2, gave a mean result of 9:30 grs, of salt for a single
cell, as already stated. This is a diffusion of 100 sulphate of
potash to 97.4 sulphate of magnesia.
   The diffusion of the 2 and 4 per cent. solutions of sulphate
of magnesia is so nearly equal to the diffusion of the same
proportions of sulphate of potash in half the time, that they
may be considered as supplying additional support to the
assumed relation between the diffusibilities of these salts.
   I may add, that a 4 per cent. solution of anhydrous sulphate
of zinc was diffused for fourteen days, simultaneously with the
similar solution of sulphate of magnesia, and of course at the
same temperature of 53°7. Two cells, evaporated two toge
ther, gave 17:40 and 17:36 grs, of ignited sulphate of zinc;
mean 17:38 grs, The salt remained, after ignition, entirely

             Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.                                 347
soluble. This is a diffusion of 8-69 grs. for one cell, while the
sulphate of magnesia gave 9:05 grs. ; or of 100 sulphate of
zinc to 104-14 sulphate of magnesia. This result is interesting,
as we here find two salts which are isomorphous, and of which
the equi-diffusion is on that account in a high degree probable,
differing between themselves so much as 4 per cent.
   Another numerous series of experiments was made at a
considerably lower temperature, with the view of testing several
of the same relations. The temperature in commencing the dif
fusion was 41°, but fell in the course of three days to 38°8, and
afterwards rose to 39°, from which it never varied afterwards
more than a degree during the diffusion of the salts of potash
and soda.       The mean temperature for their periods did not
vary above 0°-1 or 0°-2 from 39°7, so that it may be supposed
the same for all these salts. For the sulphates of magnesia,
the mean temperature was 38°9, or 0°-8 lower. The times
chosen are as the square-roots of 2, 3, 6 and 16.

   Several other salts were diffused in the same circumstances
as the preceding, of which the diffusion products have been
previously given. Of these salts, both the 1 and 2 per cent.
solutions of nitrate of potash gave 6.83 in nine days, or in the
same time as chloride of potassium in the table. The latter
salt maintains a sensible equality of diffusion with the present
series at the low, as well as it was found to do at the former
high temperature. Chloride of sodium is here introduced for
the first time: it appears to be equi-diffusive with nitrate of
soda. . If the sulphate of magnesia diffused be increased by
0:07, for its lower temperature, this salt will be in close ac
cordance with the salts of potash and soda.
   Taking nitrate of potash 6'83, as 100, for a standard, the

 848         Prof. Graham on the Diffusion of Liquids.
 salt which deviates most considerably is sulphate of soda,
 which for the 1 per cent. solution is 6'55, or 95.9. A low
 temperature, however, must be unfavourable to diffusion ex
 periments, from increasing the tendency of salts to crystallize.
     In conclusion, I may sum up the results of most interest
 which this inquiry respecting liquid diffusion has hitherto fur
 nished.
     1. I would place first the method of observing liquid dif.
 fusion. This method, although simple, appears to admit of
 sufficient exactness.    It enables us to make a new class of
 observations which can be expressed in numbers, and of which
 a vast variety of substances may be the object, in fact every
thing soluble. Diffusion is also a property of a fundamental
 character, upon which other properties depend, like the vola
 tility of substances; while the number of substances which
 are soluble and therefore diffusible, appears to be much greater
than the number of volatile bodies.
    2. The novel scale of Solution Densities, which are sug
gested by the different diffusibilities of salts, and to which
alone, guided by the analogy of gaseous diffusion, we can refer
these diffusibilities. Liquid diffusion thus supplies the den
i.
them.
        of a new kind of molecules, but nothing more respecting
    The fact that the relations in diffusion of different sub
stances refer to equal weights of those substances, and not to
their atomic weights or equivalents, is one which reaches to
the very basis of molecular chemistry. The relation most
frequently possessed is that of equality, the relation of all
others most easily observed. In liquid diffusion we appear to
deal no longer with chemical equivalents or the Daltonian
atoms, but with masses even more simply related to each other
in weight. Founding still upon the chemical atoms, we may
suppose that they can group together in such numbers as to
form new and larger molecules of equal weight for different
substances, or if not of equal weight, of weights which appear
to have a simple relation to each other. It is this new class
of molecules which appear to play a part in solubility and
liquid diffusion, and not the atoms of chemical combination.
    3. The formation of classes of equi-diffusive substances.
These classes are evidently often more comprehensive than
the isomorphous groups, although I have reason to imagine
that they sometimes divide such groups; that while the dif
fusion of salts of baryta and strontia, for instance, is similar,
the diffusion of salts of lead may be different.
   4. The separation of the whole salts (apparently) of potash

Mr. H. J. Brooke on the Crystalline Form of Beudantite.        349
and of soda into two divisions, the sulphate and nitrate groups,
which must have a chemical significancy. The same division
of the salts in question has been made by M. Gerhardt, on
the ground that the nitrate class is monobasic and the sulphate
class bibasic.
   5. The application of liquid diffusion to the separation of
mixed salts, in natural and in artificial operations.
 , 6. The application of liquid diffusion to produce chemical
decompositions.
   7. The assistance which a knowledge of liquid diffusion will
afford in the investigation of endosmose. When the diffusi
bility of the salts in a liquid is known, the compound effect
presented in an endosmotic experiment may be analysed, and
the true share of the membrane in the result be ascertained.
   But on the mere threshold of so wide a subject as liquid
diffusion, I must postpone speculation to the determination of
new facts and the enlargement of my data, of the present in
completeness of which I am fully sensible.
        XLIV. On the Crystalline Form of Beudantite.
                By H. J. BRookE, Esq., F.R.S.*
IN     a paper by Dr. Percy in the September Number of this
      Journal, on the chemical constitution of Beudantite, it is
stated that its form is certainly very similar to, if not identical
with, that of cube-ore; that Levy maintained it to be an
obtuse rhombohedron with the vertical angle truncated; and
that Descloizeaux, on the other hand, asserts that the crystals
are cubes similar in all respects to those of cube-ore from
Cornwall. It is clear from this statement that the crystals
examined by Descloizeaux were different in form from those
examined and described by Levy, which have only one of the
solid angles of the supposed cube truncated, the truncating
face being large in comparison with the size of the crystals;
and instead of being bright, like the other faces, is of such a
velvety dullness as scarcely to reflect any light.
   The composition seems therefore to have influenced the
form and character of the crystals of Levy's specimen, the

XLV. Theory of Ætherification. By ALEXANDER WILLIAM
   son, Professor of Practical Chemistry in the London Uni
   versity*.
 W W 7 HEN sulphuric acid is brought in contact with alcohol
          under certain circumstances, a new arrangement is
effected in the elements of the alcohol, which divide into two
groups, forming aether and water. Now it is well known that
the process by which this change is effected may be repre
sented in two ways, the difference of which consists in their
respectively selecting for starting-point a different view of the
constitution of alcohol. According to the one view, an atom
of alcohol weighs 23, and is made up of C*H* O'; so that to
form aether, two atoms of it are needed, one of which takes
C*H* from the other, setting free the water with which these
elements, were combined; whereas, according to the other
view, alcohol weighs 46, and contains aether and water. These
are not the only points of difference which are urged; but
they are the most real and tangible, and their consideration is
sufficient for our present purpose. If by any direct fact we
could decide which of these two expressions is the correct
one, the ground would be clear for an examination of the
process of aetherification itself. In order to show more clearly
the true meaning of the facts I have to adduce on this point,
I will bring them before you in the order in which they arose.
   My object in commencing the experiments was to obtain
new alcohols by substituting carburetted hydrogen for hy
drogen in a known alcohol. With this view I had recourse
to an expedient, which may render valuable services on similar
occasions. It consisted in replacing the hydrogen first by
potassium, and acting upon the compound thus formed by the
chloride or iodide of the carburetted hydrogen which was to
be introduced in the place of that hydrogen. I commenced
with common º, which, after careful purification, was
saturated with potassium, and as soon as the action had ceased,
mixed with a portion of iodide of aethyle equivalent to the po
tassium used. Iodide of potassium was readily formed on the
application of a gentle heat, and the desired substitution was
effected; but, to my astonishment, the compound thus formed
had none of the properties of an alcohol—it was nothing else
than common aether, C* H19 O.
   Now this result at once struck me as being inconsistent
with the higher formula of alcohol; for if that body contained
twice as many atoms of oxygen as are in aether, I ought clearly

to have obtained a product containing twice as much oxygen .
as aether does. The alternative was evident; for having ob
tained aether by substituting C*H* for H in alcohol, the rela
tive composition of the two bodies is represented by expressing
                                                     #
that fact in our formula. Thus alcohol is C2 5 O, and the
        -                . C2 H5                   -
potassium compound is          k O; and by acting upon this by
iodide of aethyle,
               2 LI3
                      we have                 2   5
              °ºotc. H I-IK+ šo.
    Of course the proportion between the two bodies is the only
point upon which I here enter, and the same reasoning would
be applicable to any multiple of the formulae assumed. Some
chemists may perhaps prefer doubling them in order to avoid
 the use of atoms of hydrogen, potassium, &c.; but I have not
 felt myself justified in doing so, because that would involve
 doubling the usual formula for water; for, as I will presently
 show, water is formed in aetherification by replacing the car
 buretted hydrogen of alcohol by hydrogen, which, of course,
obliges us to assume the same unity of oxygen in both. Alcohol
 is therefore water in which half the hydrogen is replaced by
 carburetted hydrogen, and aether is water in which both atoms
 of hydrogen are replaced by carburetted hydrogen : thus,
                               2 H5        2 LI 5
                      #o, “Ho, ºfto.
    This formation of aether might however be explained after
 a fashion by the other theory—by supposing the potassium
 compound to contain aether and potash, which separate during
 the action of the iodide of aethyle; so that half the aether ob
 tained would have been contained in that compound, and the
 other half formed by double decomposition between potash
  and iodide of aethyle: thus—
             4 L T 10
            °;"B+c. Hºr-21K+2(c. Hºo).
  But although the insufficiency of this explanation becomes
  evident on a little reflection, I devised a further and more tan
  gible method of arriving at a conclusion.       It consisted in act
  ing upon the potassium compound by iodide of methyle, in
  which case I should, if that compound were aether and potash,
  obtain a mixture of aether and oxide of methyle; whereas in
  the contrary case I should obtain a body of the composition
  C*H* O.     Now this substance I obtained, and neither aether
  nor oxide of methyle.

  352      Mr. A. Williamson's Theory of Ætherification.
     In this experiment the two theories cross one another, and
  must lead to different results; for it is evident that, in the
 first-mentioned decomposition by which aether was formed,
  the only difficulty in explaining the process decisively consisted
 in our inability to prove that the carburetted hydrogen intro
 duced instead of the hydrogen did not have in the product an
 atom of oxygen to itself, but that, on the contrary, it was
 coupled with the carburetted hydrogen already contained in
 the alcohol—the two in combination with one atom of oxygen.
 It is clear that if alcohol contain aether and water, and the
 carburetted hydrogen in my first experiment formed a second
 atom of aether by taking the place of the hydrogen of this
 water, that the process being the same in the second experi
 ment, we should then have obtained two aethers.        Whereas if
 the formation of aether from alcohol be effected by synthesis,
 a new carburetted hydrogen being added to the one already
 contained in the alcohol, we ought to obtain the new interme
 diate asther which I obtained.
    The complete description of this remarkable body, and of
 its decompositions, will form the subject of a future paper. I
 will now merely state that its boiling-point is a little above
 10° Cent. ; it is possessed of a very peculiar smell, distinctly
 different from that of common aether; and, like that body, it
 is only slightly soluble in water. It is not acted upon by the
 alkali-metals at the common atmospheric temperature.
    By acting upon the potassium-alcohol in like manner by
 iodide of amyle, I effected a similar substitution of the ele
 ments of that carburetted hydrogen in the place of the hy
drogen of alcohol, and obtained an aether boiling at 111°C.,
having the composition C7H16O. There is some reason to
believe that this body is the same which Balard obtained by
decomposition of chloride of amyle by an alcoholic solution
of hydrated potash, and which that distinguished chemist took
for oxide of amyle.
    From the perfect analogy of properties between the known
terms of the alcoholic series, it was to be expected that similar
substitutions might be effected in the others; and I have ve
rified this by experiment. Of course the formulae of the other
alcohols must be reduced to half, for the same reasons as that
of common alcohol. Methylic alcohol is therefore         expressed
by the formula    c;                                    #
                         O, as common alcohol is C2 LI 5 O; and
                                                 l
in the same manner amylic alcohol is         H     O, and the same
of the higher ones. In conformity to this fact, we must be
able to obtain the same intermediate aethers by replacing hy
drogen in these alcohols (methylic and amylic) by the carbu

retted hydrogen of iodide of aethyle, as by the inverse process
described above. This I have verified in the case of the three
carbon aether, which may be obtained indifferently by repla
cing one-fourth of the hydrogen of methylic alcohol by C*H*,
or by replacing one-sixth of the hydrogen of common

    By acting upon the compound          º   O by iodide of amyle,
I obtained 3
              a third aethereal compound, of which the formula
is  & #.     O. This is evidently the only one of the three new
aethers, which, containing an even number of carbon atoms,
might be conceived to have been formed from one alcohol;
but when treated with monobasic acids, as hydrochloric, it
cannot be expected to act in the same manner as its homoge
neous isomeric, the aether C3H7

C  3
      # O;    but of this I will give an exact account in the paper
above alluded to.
     My task is now to explain the process of aetherification by the
action of sulphuric acid (SO*H*) upon alcohol; and in order to
accomplish that, I must show the connexion between those sub
stances and the reagents used in the above-described experi
ments. With this view, I have merely to add to the above
facts the acknowledged analogy of the simple and compound
radicals in their compounds. I must first show how a sub
stance analogous to my iodide of aethyle is formed, and then
how by double decomposition with alcohol it produces aether.
This is very easy; for sulphovinic acid is strictly analogous
to iodide of aethyle plus iodide of hydrogen, which we should
obtain by replacing SO" in its formula by an equivalent of
iodine; and in order to represent the formation of this sul
phovinic acid, which is well known to precede that of aether,
the simplest mode is at the same time the one most free from
hypothesis; it consists in stating the fact, that sulphuric acid
and alcohol are transformed into sulphovinic acid and water,
by half the hydrogen of the former changing places with the
carburetted hydrogen of the latter: thus—
                          #so         c.;so

                          # O             #O
Now from this point it is clear that the process is the same as
in the decompositions above described; for by this sulphovinic

 acid coming in contact with an atom of alcohol, it reacts ex
 actly in the same manner as the iodide did, forming of course
 sulphuric acid and aether:

                     cºo             &#o
    The sulphuric acid thus reproduced comes again in contact
 with alcohol, forming sulphovinic acid, which reacts as before;
 and so the process goes on continuously, as found in practice.
    We thus see that the formation of aether from alcohol is
 neither a process of simple separation, nor one of mere syn
 thesis; but that it consists in the substitution of one molecule
 for another, and is effected by double decomposition between
 two compounds. I therefore admit the contact theory, inas
 much as I acknowledge the circumstance of contact as a ne
 cessary condition of the reaction of the molecules upon one
another. By reducing the formulae of the alcohols to one atom
of oxygen, I also retain the equality of volumes which the con
tact theory insists upon between the vapours of these bodies
and their aethers, so that aether truly contains the elements of
olefiant gas in addition to those of alcohol in one atom. But,
on the other hand, I attach equal importance to all the essen
tial facts of the chemical theory, and rest my explanation of
the process as much upon them as upon those of the contact
theory; for, one-sixth of the hydrogen in alcohol truly ex
hibits different reactions from the remaining five, and must
therefore be contained in that compound in a different manner
from them ; and the alternate formation and decomposition
of sulphovinic acid is to me, as to the partisans of the chemical
theory, the key to explaining the process of aetherification.
   Innovations in science frequently gain ground only by dis
placing the conceptions which preceded them, and which served
more or less directly as their foundation; but, if the view which
I have here presented be considered a step in our understand
ing of the subject, I must beg leave to disclaim for it the title
of innovation; for my conclusion consists in establishing the
connexion and showing the compatibility of views which have
hitherto been considered contrary; and the best possible jus
tification of the eminent philosophers who advocated either
one of the two contending theories, is thus afforded by my
reconciling their arguments with those of their equally illus
trious opponents.                                                -
   Before quitting the subject of aetherification, I would wish
to add a few words on an application which naturally enough

       Mr. A. Williamson's Theory of Ætherification.           355
suggests itself of the fact to which the process is here
ascribed. I refer to the transfer of homologous molecules in
alternately opposite directions, which, as I have endeavoured
to show, is the cause of the continuous action of sulphuric acid
in this remarkable process. It may naturally be asked, why
do hydrogen and carburetted hydrogen thus continuously
change places? It cannot be from any such circumstance as
superior affinity of one molecule over another, for one moment
sees reversed with a new molecule the transfer effected during
the preceding one. Now in reflecting upon this remarkable
fact, it strikes the mind at once that the facility of interchange
must be greater the more close the analogy between the mo
lecules exchanged; that if hydrogen and amyle can replace
one another in a compound, hydrogen and aethyle, which are
more nearly allied in composition and properties, must be able
to replace one another more easily in the same compound;
and that the facility of interchange of hydrogen and methyle,
which are still more similar, will be still greater. But if this
be true, must not the exchange of one molecule for another of
identical properties be the most easily effected of all? Surely
it must, if there be any difference at all; and if so, the law of
analogy forbids our imagining the fact to be peculiar to hy
drogen among substances resembling it in other respects.
We are thus forced to admit, that, in an aggregate of mole
cules of any compound, there is an exchange constantly going
on between the elements which are contained in it.         For in
stance, a drop of hydrochloric acid being supposed to be made
up of a great number of molecules of the composition Cl H,
the proposition at which we have just arrived would lead us
to believe that each atom of hydrogen does not remain quietly
in juxtaposition with the atom of chlorine with which it first
united, but, on the contrary, is constantly changing places
with other atoms of hydrogen, or, what is the same thing,
changing chlorine. Of course this change is not directly sen
sible to us, because one atom of hydrochloric acid is like
another; but suppose we mix with the hydrochloric acid some
sulphate of copper (of which the component atoms are under
going a similar change of place), the basilous elements hy
drogen and copper do not limit their change of place to the
circle of the atoms with which they were at first combined, the
hydrogen does not merely move from one atom of chlorine to
another, but in its turn also replaces an atom of copper, form
ing chloride of copper and sulphuric acid. Thus it is, that at
any moment of time in which we examine the mixture, the
bases are divided between the acids; and in certain cases,
where the difference of properties of the analogous molecules
                               2 A 2

356       Mr. A. Williamson's Theory of Ætherification.
is very great, it is found that the stronger acid and stronger
base remain almost entirely together, leaving the weaker ones
combined.     This is well known in the case of a mixture of
sulphuric acid and borax, and is a confirmation of our funda
mental assumption, that the greater the difference of proper
ties, the more difficult is the alternate interchange of one mole
cule for another.                                         -
   But suppose now that instead of sulphate of copper, we
mixed sulphate of silver with our hydrochloric acid in aqueous
solution, and that a similar division of the bases between the
acids established itself in the first moment, forming four com
pounds, SO'H”, SO*Ag”, ClFI, Clag; it is clear that this
last-mentioned compound, being insoluble in water, must, on
its formation, separate out and remove from the circle of de
compositions which solubility established. But of course the
three compounds remaining in solution continue the exchange
of their component parts, and give rise successively to new
portions of chloride of silver, until as much of that compound
is precipitated as the liquid contained equivalents of its com
ponent parts, a very small quantity remaining in solution and
in the circle of decompositions.            -      * *:* … . . . . . . .
   Such is the general process of chemical decomposition.
Of course a compound is removed as effectually from the circle
of decompositions by possessing the gaseous form under the
circumstances of the experiment, or even by being a liquid
insoluble in the menstruum. I believe this explanation coin
cides in its second part with the one proposed many years ago
by Berthollet; but not making use of the atomic hypothesis,
upon which my explanation is based, that eminent philosopher
went no farther back than the division of the acids between
the bases on the mixture of salts, a fact which I have here
deduced from the motion of atoms.         It is well known that the
general fact upon which Berthollet founded his view is denied
by some eminent chemists of the present day; but I believe
the instances which they adduce are only apparent exceptions
to the law, and will on further examination be found to afford
additional confirmation of the truth of the great Savoysien's
conception, as I have shown in the case of boracic and sul
phuric acids.                    * .      -                 -
   In using the atomic theory, chemists have added to it of
late years an unsafe, and, as I think, an unwarrantable hy
pothesis, namely that the atoms are in a state of rest. Now
this hypothesis I discard, and reason upon the broader basis
of atomic motion.

XLVI. Account of a remarkable Meteor, seen December 19,
              1849. By Professor J. D. For BEsl.
ON the evening of the 19th December 1849, whilst walking
      * near the southern part of Edinburgh, about fifteen mi
nutes past five, Greenwich time (as I afterwards estimated),
I observed a meteor, fully brighter than Venus at her average
brilliancy, moving from W. towards N., parallel to the horizon,
elevated 15° above it, and followed by a distinct luminous
train. This angle was subsequently taken by estimation by
daylight, with the aid of a theodolite; and the compass-bear
ing of the meteor, when first seen, ascertained in the same
way, must have been 47° W., of N.1). When it bore 29° E. of
magnetic north, it was observed to have divided into two, the
one part following the other at some distance; and I soon
after lost sight of it in the obscurity of the smoke of the town.
When it split, its altitude was estimated at 6°. It thus de
scribed an arc of no less than 76°, in doing which it occu
pied, as I roughly estimated, about fifteen seconds, or possibly
more...yºtº nº 2 ºf               -           yº / . . . . ... .
    Having sent a short notice of the appearance of the meteor
to the Courant newspaper, I received from many quarters
accounts of its having been seen under circumstances remark
ably similar to those just described. I believe that nearly
forty communications on the subject, have reached me from
places included between Longford, in the centre of Ireland, to
near Bervie in Kincardineshire, a distance of above 300 miles,
in a direction nearly N.E. and S.W.; whilst in a perpendi
cular direction, or from N.W. to S.E., the range of observa
tion, has been comparatively small; for I have received no
information from beyond Renfrew in the one direction, and
Durham in the other, being about 140 miles distant in a
straight line. The meteor was seen at Longford, in Ireland,
 74 miles west of Dublin, but not in Dublin itself. It was
seen at Belfast, between Carlisle and Gretna at Stewarton, in
 Ayrshire, at Johnstone, at Paisley, Renfrew, and by many
persons in Glasgow and the neighbourhood. o. It was also
generally seen in Edinburgh, in East Lothian, near Melrose,
and at Durham, as already mentioned. Further north, I have
received accounts from Crail, St. Andrews, Dundee, Perth,
and Johnshaven to the north of Montrose.
    The greater number of these communications concur in
estimating the direction of the motion of the meteor to have
been from S.W. to N.E., although, as might be expected,

No. 39.

358      Prof. Forbes's Account of a remarkable Meteor,
they vary excessively as to its distance and magnitude; being
described by some persons as only 50 or 100 yards off, and
as large as the moon; by others, as a ball of 9 inches in dia
meter, or the size of a large egg. One person only professes
to have heard a sound. The time during which it was seen
was variously estimated. At Longford, by Mr. Curtis, 20
seconds; at Glasgow, by Mr. Stevenson, at 20 seconds; at
Johnstone, by Mr. Cunningham, 15 seconds; at Perth, 15
or 20 seconds; at Durham, by Mr. Carrington, 30 seconds;
at St. Andrews, 15 seconds according to one observer, and
18 to 21 seconds according to another; at Johnshaven, #ths
of a minute. The hour of the appearance of the meteor, in
most of the descriptions, is stated at between 5' 10m and 5h 16”.
   The arc of the horizon which it was seen to traverse de
pended, of course, on the point where the meteor first caught
the observer's eye. At Granton, it was traced by Professor
Kelland through 125° of azimuth; at Perth, 180°; at St. An
drews, 74°; at Edinburgh, 76°; at Durham, 65°; at Glas
gow, from 60° to 70°. The division of the head or nucleus
into several parts, and, first of all (in most cases), into two, has
been noticed with remarkably slight variation; consequently,
the explosion of the meteor marks a well-determined point in
its path. The separation was specially noticed at Edinburgh,
Granton, Glasgow, Renfrew, Melrose, Haddington, Johns
haven, Perth, Durham and St. Andrews.
   In a majority of cases a luminous train was observed; and
I am confident that the existence of this train, which has been
estimated at from 2° to 3° long, cannot be questioned. Dr.
Adamson, however, especially remarked that no train was to
be seen at St. Andrews.
   On revising the whole accounts, it does not appear that any
of them can be relied upon for ascertaining the position of
the meteor in space, except the observations of Mr. Carring
ton of the Durham observatory; of Professor Kelland, Mr.
Stirling and myself, at Edinburgh; of Dr. Adamson and an
other observer, communicated by Professor Fischer of St.
Andrews; of a young gentleman at Perth, communicated by
Thomas Miller, Esq., Rector of the Perth Academy; and of
A. D. Stevenson, Esq., and W. Gourlie, Esq., jun., at Glas
gow. My inquiries were chiefly directed to the two following
points: first, the angular elevation of the meteor in the N.W.
quarter of the heavens, where it is admitted by all that its
path appeared almost horizontal; secondly, to the bearing of
the meteor at the instant of explosion.
   At Durham, Mr. Carrington saw the meteor first when the
bearing was true N.W., the altitude (by theodolite) was then

                      seen December 19, 1849.                  359
 10°, or not exceeding 11°; when it burst it was due N. (true),
 and continued to move 10° or 12° further before it disap
 peared. Professor Chevallier, who obligingly communicated
 these results, states that the meteor appeared rather to rise as
 it approached the north, but with a doubt. This supposition,
 however, appears inadmissible, from the unanimity of the
 other accounts.
    At Granton, near Edinburgh, Professor Kelland caught
 sight of the meteor a little to the N. of the moon, and several
diameters below it. This corresponds, by after estimation
with a theodolite, to 75° W. of magnetic N., and an altitude
of 12°.    Professor Kelland thinks that it rather rose after
 wards. It split into two at 20° E. of magnetic N., having
then an altitude of only 5°; it continued for a considerable
time bright, then began to fade, as if by the effect of distance,
and also to separate into several parts: it was finally lost sight
of 50° E. of magnetic N. (this bearing is well ascertained),
with an altitude estimated at only half a degree. The position
and circumstances of these observations, made at an elevated
station above the Frith of Forth, were eminently favourable.
    Mr. J. Stirling, civil engineer, looking up North Hanover
Street, Edinburgh, saw the meteor separate into two parts;
the bearing he afterwards estimated at 25° E. of magnetic N.
(the probable error not exceeding 1°), and the altitude at
8° 30', certainly not exceeding 9°.
    I think we may conclude, that at Edinburgh the meteor
attained a maximum elevation of 15° (that mentioned in the
commencement of this paper), since it no doubt rose after
Professor Kelland first saw it to the S. of the true W., with
an altitude of only 12°. The course of the meteor was evi
dently such as to be nearest the spectator when in the true
N.W. or W.N.W.
    The place of the meteor when it burst stands thus:—
              Kelland, N. 20° E. (mag.) Alt. 5°.
              Stirling, N. 25° E.         Alt. 8° 30'.
              Forbes, N. 29° E.            Alt. 6°.
    The average is almost 25° E. of N., or about 1° W. of the
true meridian, the variation being nearly 26°. The mean of
the three observations of altitude would be 6° 30'; but admit
ting Mr. Stirling's to be entitled to the greatest confidence,
we may suppose it 7°, or possibly a little more.
    At St. Andrews, the meteor was seen by Dr. Adamson,
when riding in a northerly direction on the Largo road. Pro
fessor Fischer was so kind as to accompany him afterwards
to the spot, and to reduce his observations with all the accuracy

360       Prof. Forbes’s Account of a remarkable Meteor,
of which they were capable. It was first noticed when bear
ing 83°W. of magnetic N., and disappeared at 42}^ E. of N.;
the altitude was conjecturally stated as between 14° and 184°,     s
and it appeared to move horizontally, but rather declining
towards the N.
   After describing three-fourths of its course, it split into two
parts, which went on close together for a little, then broke
into four or five, became dull red, and rapidly disappeared;
the separate pieces travelling on together until the last.
   Another intelligent observer near St. Andrews, whose evi
dence was taken by Mr. Fischer, first saw the meteor 29#9 W.
of magnetic N., and estimated the point where the meteor
burst at 44° E. of N; but this last number coincides so closely
with Dr. Adamson's estimate of the point of final disappear
ance, that it is perhaps allowable to suppose, that this second
observer had mixed up these two events in his description.
Dr. Adamson's statement, that one-fourth of the arc which
he saw was described after the meteor had split, would give
an azimuth at that moment of almost 30° E. of N. magnetic,
or 4° E. of N. true, as Mr. Fischer determined the magnetic
declination to be about 25° 46'. The altitude of the meteor,
as seen by this observer, appears not to have exceeded 15°
(the same as at Edinburgh); which number we shall therefore

   At Perth, the passage of the meteor was seen from the
North Inch, by a young gentleman of intelligence, whose ob.
servations were reduced to numbers by Mr. Miller, Rector of
the Perth Academy, who was so good as to accompany him
to the spot, and take the ºgº with a theodolite. Its bear
ing, when first seen, was 46° S. of W. true; its angular alti
tude was at that time only 3° 30'. This is by far the most
southern azimuth which has been observed.            Its bearing,
when it disappeared, was 6° W. of N., but it was then lost in
a cloud. If I understand right, it had by this time separated
into fragments. Its apparent altitude in the middle of its
course was about 17° 30'. These observations, extending
over an arc of 130°, taken along with Professor Kelland's,
clearly demonstrate that the meteor appeared with a very low
altitude in the S.W. quarter of the heavens, and disappeared
in a similar way in the N.N.E., attaining its greatest elevation
about W.N.W. (true).       *        * *    * * * * * *          *
   At Glasgow the meteor was very generally and well seen.
Mr. William Gourlie, jun., saw it move from S.W. to N.N.E.,
over an arc of 60° or 70°, and divide into two, when it bore
40° E. of magnetic N.     He estimates its greatest elevation at
30°; and that it decreased to between 15° and 17°, or even

                                             seen December 19, 1849,                                                  361
 less at the time of its separation: he adds, that he is not much
 accustomed to such observations,                                                  Mr. A. D. Stevenson,
 living in South Portland Street, Glasgow, saw the meteor
 moving along at a height just sufficient to clear the chimney
 tops, on the west side of the street; an elevation which he
 afterwards estimated, as he states, with considerable accuracy
 at 28°.              I have received further and more minute accounts of
 the appearance of the meteor from Mr. Stevenson, who has
 been most kind and intelligent in his communications; and
 my friend Mr. James Peddie has verified the accuracy of Mr.
 Stevenson's observations beyond the possibility of mistake.
 It appears that the ineteor passed quite clear of a stack of
 chimneys on the opposite side of the street, which would give
 it a well-defined minimum altitude of 25° 41'; but Mr. Ste
 venson is of opinion that it rose more than 2° higher, or to
 not less than 28° (perhaps even to 28° 21'); when it was
 highest, its bearing was 52}* W. of N. (magnetic), and it dis
 appeared from his view, when it bore 40° 27' E. of magnetic
 N. It was then decidedly single. Now this bearing coincides
 with that at which Mr. Gourlie observed it to become double,
 and consequently the limit towards the N. of this event is se
 verely defined.                                       * ,, ,    ; ; ;; , , ,            -

     1. On the whole, these observations are not consistent, and
 cannot (I conceive) be cleared up without additional and accu
 rate ones, which it may now be too late to procure. The
 central group of stations, Edinburgh, Perth and St. Andrews,
 are sufficiently accordant, and indicate that the path of the
 meteor must have been, nearly parallel to a line passing
 through the first and last of those places, or in a direction N.
 27° E. (true); which accords well with the observations at
 most of the individual stations, and particularly with the va

362       Prof. Forbes's Account of a remarkable Meteor.
mishing direction in Professor Kelland's remarkable observa
tion at Granton.
   2. The Durham observation is compatible with the above          t
mentioned group within the limits of error. By the combina
tion of Durham and Edinburgh (the base line perpendicular
to the assumed direction of the meteor's motion being ninety
five miles), I calculated that the meteor passed vertically nearly
over the Island of St. Kilda, with an absolute elevation of
about eighty-eight miles. But this solution seems absolutely
excluded by observations at Glasgow which admit of no ques
tion, and which I have spared no pains in verifying. Had
the position of the meteor been such as I have first assumed,
it could not possibly have been seen over even the roofs of the
houses from the station occupied by Mr. Stevenson, much less
over the chimney-tops. The bearing at the moment of ex
plosion at Glasgow, also singularly enough corroborates suf
ficiently well the comparatively small elevation (about twenty
miles above the earth) which the combination of Edinburgh
and Glasgow gives; and this bearing we have seen to have
been also accurately defined by the physical obstacles bound
ing the observer's view; it would have given a parallax of 15°,
subtended by the perpendicular on the meteor's path, referred
to Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively. Now, if this calcu
lation were anything like correct, the Perth observation is
entirely wrong; and the meteor could not have risen about
6° above the horizon of Durham, instead of 10° or 11° as esti
mated.    I am unable in any degree to explain these conflicting
results.
   3. The observations of Professor Kelland at Granton, and
those at Perth, through the great azimuths of 125° and
130°, described by the meteor with such remarkable delibe
ration of motion, lead, when analysed, to the very same results
which presented themselves to the mind of the spectator in
tuitively; namely, that the motion must have been sensibly
rectilinear, equable, and parallel to the horizon at Edinburgh.
Assuming that the greatest altitude at Edinburgh was 15°,
and the bearing then N. 68° W. (true), we may calculate that
the altitude should have been on this hypothesis, when first
seen by Professor Kelland, 11°47', instead of 12° as observed;
at explosion, 6° 59' (7° observed), and at its final disappear
ance o' 47" (instead of 0° 30' observed). Again, at Perth, the
observed altitude, when first seen, was 33°, and the calculated
altitude 5° 3', taking the maximum altitude at 173°. The
coincidence is, on the whole, remarkable; though it would be
rash to push it to an extreme, as an error of some degrees
may exist in the assumption of the direction of the meteor's

       Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.      363
course.    Some later observations, received from Mr. Curtis
at Longford, and a consideration of the effects of perspective
at Perth and Edinburgh, incline me to admit that the path
might make an angle 3° or 4° greater with the meridian than
I have above supposed. These conclusions are independent
of the actual distance or parallax of the meteor; which, as I
have said, cannot be determined without further observations,
which I should be glad to receive from any quarter, but more
particularly from Ireland, and from the centre and N.W. of
Scotland. If correct, they entitle us to infer that the meteor
in question was most probably a body moving in space, in a
path little curved, and not revolving round the earth.
XLVII. Additions to the articles in the September Number of
   this Journal, “On a new Class of Theorems,” and on Pascal's
   Theorem.     By J. J. SylvestER, M.A., F.R.S.*
FIRST addition.—I have alluded in the above         article to a
        more general theorem, comprising, as a particular case,
the theorem there given for the simultaneous evanescence of
two quadratic functions of 2n letters, or n linear equations
becoming instituted between the letters.
   In order to make this generalization intelligible, I must
  remise a few words on the Theory of Orders, a term which
F.       invented with particular reference to quadratic func
tions, although obviously admitting of a more extended appli
cation. A linear function of all the letters entering into a
function or system of functions under consideration I call an
order of the letters, or simply an Order. Now it is clear that
we may always consider a function of any number of letters
as a function of as many orders as there are letters; but in
certain cases a function may be expressed in terms of a fewer
number of orders than it has letters, as when the general
characteristic function of a conic becomes that of a pair of
crossing lines or a pair of coincident lines, in which event it
loses respectively one and two orders, and so for the charac
teristic of a conoid becoming that of a cone, a pair of planes
or two coincident planes, in which several events, a function
of four letters, becomes that of only three orders, or two
orders, or one order, respectively. When a function may be
expressed by means of r orders less than it contains letters, I
call it a function minus r orders. I now proceed to state my
theorem.
   Let U and V be functions each of the same m letters, and
                   * Communicated by the Author.

  364         Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.
 suppose that the determinant in respect of those letters of
 U+AV contains i pairs of equal linear factors of p. ; then it is
 possible, by means of i linear equations instituted between the
 letters, to make U and V each become functions of the same
 m–2i orders; and conversely, if by i equations between the
 letters U and V may be made functions of the same m—2i
 orders, the determinant of U+AV considered as a function of
 a will contain quadratic factors.
     Thus when m =2n and i-n, U and V will each become
 functions of zero orders, i. e. will both disappear, provided
 that on the institution of a certain system of n linear equations,
 among the letters of which U and V are functions, the deter
 minant of (U+AV) is a perfect square, which is the theorem
given in the article referred to.                     *   -
     So (ear. gr.) if U and V be quadratic functions of four letters,
and therefore the characteristics of two conoids, TI(U+AV)
being a perfect square, expresses that these conoids have a
straight line in common lying upon each of their surfaces.
    If U and V be quadratic functions of three letters only, and
admit therefore of being considered as the characteristics of
two conics, [T](U+H.W) containing a square factor, is indi
cative of these conics having a common tangent at a common
point, i.e. of their touching each other at some point; for it
is easily shown that the disappearance of two orders from any
quadratic function by virtue of one linear function of its letters
being zero, indicates that the line, plane, &c. of which the
linear function is the characteristic is a tangent to the curve,
surface, &c. of which the quadratic function is the character
istic.
    I pass now to a generalization of the theorem which shows
how to express, under the form of a double determinant, the
resultant of one linear and two quadratic homogeneous func
tions of three letters (which I should have given in the original
paper, had I not there been more intent upon developing an
ascending scale than of expatiating upon a superficial ramifi
cation of analogies), and which constitutes my Second addition
to that paper, to wit—
    If U and V be homogeneous quadratic, and Li Le. ...L.

the demonstration is precisely similar to the analytical one

      Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.          365
given in the September Number for the particular case of
n = 1.
   When n=0, we revert to Mr. Boole's theorem of elimina
tion between U and V already adverted to. The proof, it
will be easily recognized, does not require the application of
the more general theorem relative to the simultaneous de
pression of orders of two quadratic functions, but only the
limited one before given, which supplies the conditions of their
simultaneous disparition. . I now proceed to develope more
particularly certain analogies between the theory of the mutual
contacts of two conics, and that of the tangencies to the inter
section of two conoids.     .                t     ;   : *     - -
   But here again I must anticipate some of the results which
will be given in my forthcoming memoir on Determinants and
Quadratic Functions, by explaining what is to be understood
by minor determinants, and the relation in, which they stand
to the complete determinant in which they are included. This
preliminary explanation, and the statement of the analogies
above alluded to, will constitute my Third and last addition.
   Imagine any determinant set out under the form of a square
array of terms. This square may be considered as divisible
into lines and columns. Now conceive any one line and any
one column to be struck out, we get in this way a square, one
term less in breadth and depth than the original square; and
by varying in every possible manner the .. of the line
and  j. excluded, we obtain, supposing the original square
to consist of n lines and n columns, n° such minor squares,
each of which will represent what I term a First Minor Deter
minant relative to the principal or complete determinant.
Now suppose two lines and two columns struck out from the
                                                           – 1 \T 2
original square, we shall obtain a system        of{ º: 9)
squares, each two terms lower than the principal square, and
representing a determinant of one lower order than those
above referred to. These constitute what I term a system of
Second Minor Determinants; and so in general we can form
a system of rth minor determinants by the exclusion of r lines
and r columns, and such system in general will contain
                 {".   (n-1).... (n—r-H 1)TU”
                        l. 2 . . . . . . . r   }
distinct determinants.
   I say ‘in general;’ because if the principal determinant be
totally or partially symmetrical in respect to either or each of
its diagonals, the number of distinct determinants appertaining
to each system of minors will undergo a material diminution,
which is easily calculable.

366        Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.
    Now I have established the following law:—
    The whole of a system of rth minors being zero, implies
only (r-H 1)* equations, i.e. by making (r-1-1)* of these minors
zero, all will become zero; and this is true, no matter what
may be the dimensions or form of the complete determinant.
But furthermore, if the complete determinant be formed from
a quadratic function, so as to be symmetrical about one of its
di                  (r-H 1)(r-1-2)                    -      -          -
  iagonals, then —a - only of the rth minors being
zero, will serve to imply that all these minors are zero. Of
course, in applying these theorems, care must be taken that
the (r-H 1)” or (r-H 1y      tº+2) selected equations must be mutu
ally non-implicative, and shall constitute independent condi
tions.
    In the application I am about to make of these principles,
we shall have only to deal with a system of first minors and of
a symmetrical determinant. If three of these properly selected
be zero, from the foregoing it appears that all must be zero.
    Now let U and V be characteristics of two conics, i.e. let
each be a function of only three letters, it may be shown (see
my paper in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal
for November 1850) that the different species of contacts be
tween these two conics will correspond to peculiar properties
of the compound characteristic U+AV.
    If the determinant of this function have two equal roots, the
conics simply touch ; if it have three equal roots, the conics
have a single contact of a higher order, i. e. the same curva
ture; if its six first minors all become zero simultaneously for
the same value of pu, the conics have a double contact. If the
same value of pu, which makes all these first minors zero, be
at the same time not merely a double root (as of analytical
necessity it always must be), but a treble root of
                        | | (U+AV)=0,
then the conics have a single contact of the highest possible
order short of absolute coincidence, i. e. they meet in four
consecutive points.
    The parallelism between this theory and that of two qua
dratic functions P, Q, and one linear function L" of four letters,
say ar, y, x, t, is exact F.     For let P-- Lu +p Q be now taken
   * Observe that P=0, Q=0, L=0 now express the equations to two co
noids and a plane respectively.
   t This parallelism may be easily shown analytically to imply, and be
implied, in the geometrical fact, that the contact of the plane L with the
intersection of the two surfaces P and Q, is of exactly the same kind as the
contact (which must exist) between the two conics which are the intersec
tions of P and Q respectively with the plane L.

       Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.                      367
 as our compound characteristic (a function, it will be observed,
 of five letters, w, y, z, t, u); if its determinant have two equal
 roots, L has two consecutive points in common with the inter
 section of P and Q, i. e. passes through a tangent to that in
 tersection; if it have three equal roots, L has three consecu
 tive points in common with the said intersection, i. e. is an
 osculating plane thereto; if its fifteen first minors admit of all
 being made simultaneously zero, L has a double contact with
 the intersection of P and Q, i. e. it is a tangent plane to some
 one of the four cones of the second order containing this in
 tersection; if the same linear function of A which enters into
 all these first minors be contained cubically in the complete
 determinant, then the plane L passes through four consecutive
 points of the intersection of P and Q, and the points where it
 meets the curve will be points of contrary plane flexure; and,
 as it seems to me, at such points the tangential direction of
 the curve must point to the summit of one or the other of the
 four cones above alluded toº. In assigning the conditions for L
 being a double tangent plane to the intersection of P and Q,
 we may take any three independent minors at pleasure equal
 to zero. One of these may be selected so as to be clear of
 the coefficients of L; in fact, the determinant of P-FuQ will
 be a first minor of P--AQ+ Lu; p, may thus be determined
 by a biquadratic equation; and then, by properly selecting
 the two other minors, we may obtain two equations in which
 only the first powers of the coefficients of a, y, z, t in L appear,
and may consequently obtain L under the form of
             (ae-Ho.)a' + (be-H 8)y--(ce--y)2+(de--8)t,
where a, a ; b, £3; c, y; d, 8 will be known functions of any
one of the four values of u. The point of contact being given
will then serve to determine e, and we shall thus have the equa
tion to each of the four double tangent planes at any given
point fully determined.
    In the foregoing discussions I have freely employed the
word characteristic without previously defining its meaning,
trusting to that being apparent from the mode of its use. It
is a term of exceeding value for its significance and brevity.
The characteristic of a geometrical figure f is thefunction which,
   * If this be so, then we have the following geometrical theorem:—“The
summit of one of the four cones of the second degree which contain the inter
sections of two surfaces of the second order drawn in any manner respectively
through two given conics lying in the same plane, and having with one another
a contact of the third degree, will always be found in the same right line,
namely in the tangent line to the two given conics at the point of contact.”
   t More generally, the characteristic of any fact or existence is the func

equaled to zero, constitutes the equation to such figure.
Plücker, I think, somewhere calls it the line or surface func
tion, as the case may be. Geometry, analytically considered,
resolves itself into a system of rules for the construction and
interpretation of characteristics. One more remark, and I
have done. A very comprehensive theorem has been given
at the commencement of this commentary, for interpreting
the effect of a complete determinant of a linear function of two
quadratic functions (U+AV), having one or more pairs of
equal factors (e.--ep). But here a far wider theory presents
itself, of which the aim should be to determine the effect and
meaning of this determinant, having any amount and distri
bution of multiplicity whatsoever among its roots. Nor must
our investigations end at that point; but we must be able to
determine the meaning and effect of common factors, one or
more entering into the successive systems of minor determi
nants derived from the complete determinant of U+AV.
    Nor are we necessarily confined to two, but may take several
quadratic functions simultaneously into account.
    Aspiring to these wide generalizations, the analysis of qua
dratic functions soars to a pitch from whence it may look
proudly down on the feeble and vain attempts of geometry
proper to rise to its level or to emulate it in its flights.

      September 3, 1850.
    The law which I have stated for assigning the number of
independent, or to speak more accurately, non-coevanescent
determinants belonging to a given system of minors, I call
the Homaloidal law, because it is a corollary to a proposition
which represents analytically the indefinite extension of a pro
perty common to lines and surfaces to all loci (whether in
ordinary or transcendental space) of the first order, all of
which loci may, by an abstraction derived from the idea of
levelness common to straight lines and planes, be called Ho
maloids. The property in question is, that neither two
straight lines nor two planes can have a common segment; in
tion which, equaled to zero, expresses the condition of the actuality of such
fact or existence.
   Perhaps the most important pervading principle of modern analysis, but
which has never hitherto been articulately expressed, is that, according to
which we infer, that when one fact of whatever kind is implied in another,
the characteristic of the first must contain as a factor the characteristic of
the second ; and that when two facts are mutually involved, their charac
teristics will be powers of the same integral function.
   The doctrine of characteristics, applied to dependent systems of facts,
admits of a wide development, logical and analytical.

      Mr. J. J. Sylvester on a new Class of Theorems.        369
other words, if n independent relations of rectilinearity or of
coplanarity, as the case may be, exist between triadic groups
of a series of n+2, or between tetradic groups of a series of
n+3 points respectively, then every triad or tetrad of the
series, according to the respective suppositions made, will be
in rectilinear or in plane order. So, too, if n independent
relations of coincidence exist between the duads formed out of
n+1 points, every duad will constitute a coincidence.
   This homaloidal law has not been stated in the above com
mentary in its form of greatest generality. For this purpose
we must commence, not with a square, but with an oblong
arrangement of terms consisting, suppose, of m lines and n
columns.     This will not in itself represent a determinant, but
is, as it were, a Matrix out of which we may form various
systems of determinants by fixing upon a number p, and se
lecting at will plines and p columns, the squares corresponding
to which may be termed determinants of the pth order. We
have, then, the following proposition. The number of unco
evanescent determinants constituting a system of the pth order
derived from a given matrix, n terms broad and m terms deep,
may equal, but can never exceed the number
                       (n—p + 1) (m-p+ 1).     -
        Remark on Pascal's and Brianchon's Theorems.
   I omitted to state, in the September Number of the Journal,
that the demonstration there given by me for Pascal's, ap
plied equally to Brianchon's theorem. This remark is of
the more importance, because the fault of the analytical de
monstrations hitherto given of these theorems has been, that
they make Brianchon's a consequence of Pascal's, instead of
causing the two to flow simultaneously from the application
of the same principles. No demonstration can be held valid
in method, or as touching the essence of the subject-matter,
in which the indifference of the duadic law is departed from.
 Until these recent times, the analytic method of geometry, as
given by Descartes, had been suffered to go on halting as it
were on one foot.    To Plücker was reserved the honour of set
ting it firmly on its two equal supports by supplying the com
plementary system of coordinates. This invention, however,
had become inevitable, after the profound views promulgated
by Steiner, in the introduction to his Geometry, had once taken
hold of the minds of mathematicians.       To make the demon
stration in the article referred to apply, totidem literis, to
Brianchon's theorem (recourse being had to the correlative
system of coordinates), it is only needful to consider U as the

XLVIII. On the solution of a System of Equations in which
    three Homogeneous Quadratic Functions of three unknown
    quantities are respectively equaled to numerical Multiples
    of a fourth Non-Homogeneous Function of the same.           By
    J. J. SYLVESTER, M.A., F.R.S.*
Lº<U+017F>        U, V, W be three homogeneous functions of r, y, z,
        and let a be any function of w, y, z of the nth degree,
and suppose that there is given for solution the system of
equations
                             U=A.o
                             V = B.o
                            W = C. o.
    Theorem.—The above system can be solved by the solution
of a cubic equation, and an equation of the nth degree.
    For let D be the determinant in respect to w, y, z of
                          fU +g.V--hW,
then D is a cubic function of f, g, h. Now make D=0
                         Af+ Bg + Ch –0,
the ratios of f: g : h which satisfy the last two equations can
be determined by the solution of a cubic equation, and there
will accordingly be three systems of f, g, h which satisfy the
Same, as
                         Ji      81     h,

    Now D=0 implies that fu +g V-EhW breaks up into two
linear factors; accordingly we shall find
              (lºw 4-miy-Haiz). (Ma' + pºly-FV12)=0

                                RR<U+017F> – O.
   Since the given equations are perfectly general, it is readily
seen that the equations
         (P=0 P=0) (Q=0 Q =0) (R-0 R'-0)
will severally represent pairs of opposite sides of a quadrangle
expressed by general coordinates a, y, & ; so that one of the
two functions R, R' will be a linear function of P and Q and
also of P and Q', and the other will be a linear function of P
and Q and also of P' and Q+.
   In order to solve the equations, we need only consider two
such pairs as PP'-0 QQ'-0; we then make
                             P=0        Q=0,
Or
                              P=0      Q = 0,
Or
                             P'-0       Q=0,
Or
                              P'-O      Q'—0.
Any one of these four systems will give the ratios of a y : z;
and then, by substitution in any one of the given equations,
we obtain the values of ar, y, & by the solution of an ordinary
equation of the nth degree. The number of systems a, y, z
is therefore always 4n.
   The equations connected with the solution of Malfatti's
celebrated problem, “In a given triangle to inscribe three

   * Were it not for this being the case, the number of solutions would be
n times the number of ways of obtaining duads out of three sets of two
things, excluding the duads forming the sets, i. e. the number of solutions
would be 12m in place of 4n, the true number.

    It follows from my theorem that the eight intersections of
three concentric surfaces of the second order can be found
by the solution of one cubic and one quadratic equation; and
 in general, if we have b, \r, 6 any three quadratic functions
of a, y, z, and b-0, y =0, 6–0 be the system of equations
 to be solved, provided that we can by linear transformations
 express b, \!, 6 under the form of

 U, V, W being homogeneous functions, and w a non-homo
 geneous function of three new variables, a', y', 2', we can find
 the eight points of intersection of the three surfaces, of which
  U, V, W are the characteristics, by the solution of one cubic
  and one quadratic. . But (as I am indebted to Mr. Cayley for
 remarking to me) that this may be possible, implies the coin
 cidence of the vertices of one cone of each of the systems of
 four cones in which the intersections of the three surfaces
  taken two and two are contained.

   Meteorological Society, &c.”
THE mean daily temperature of the air was below its ave
       rage value till July 13; the mean defect was 2°2. From
July 12 to the 24th, the period was warm ; the average excess
of temperature was 4°8. From July 25 to August 3, the
temperature was below the average; its mean deficiency was 1°.
From August 4 to August 18, it was above the average; the
mean excess was 2°; this was followed by a long period of fine,
clear, dry, but cold weather. The average deficiency of tem
perature between August 19 and September 17 was 3°5; and
after September 18, the daily temperatures were slightly above
their average values. Snow fell on Ben-Lomond on August 23.
   The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich for the three
months ending August, constituting the three summer months,
was 61°1, being 1°-2 above the average of the preceding
seventy-nine summers.
   For the month of July was 62°2, exceeding that of the ave
rage of seventy-nine years by 0°-9, and of nine years by 0°7.
   For the month of August was 60°2, being 0°-3 less than
the average of seventy-nine years, and 0°-9 less than that of the
preceding nine years.
   For the month of September was 56°4, exceeding the ave
rage from seventy-nine years by 0°1, and less than that of
the preceding nine years by 0°7.
   The mean for the quarter was 59°6, exceeding that of the
average of seventy-nine summer quarters by 0°2, and less
than that of the nine preceding years by 0°3.
   The mean temperature of evaporation at Greenwich—
   For the month of July was 58°6; for August was 56°6;
and for June was 52°-9. These values are 0°-9 greater, 0°2
greater, and 19.6 less than those of the averages of the same
months in the preceding nine years.

    The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich—
    For the months of July, August and September, were 55°8,
 53°1, and 47°-7 respectively. These values are 1°5 greater,
 2°0 less, and 4°-7 less respectively than the averages of the
 same months in the preceding nine years.
    The mean elastic force of vapour at Greenwich for the quarter
 was 0.422 inch, being less than the average from the preceding
nine years by 0:008 inch.
    The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the
 #. was 4.8 grains, being of the same value as the average
  rom the preceding nine years.
    The mean degree of humidity in July was 0.88, in August
 was 0.81, and in September was 0-75. The averages from
 the nine preceding years were 0.79, O'83 and 0.85 respectively.
    The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich in July
was 29-789 inches, in August was 29.787, and in September was
 29'930. These readings are 0.010 less, of the same value,
and 0°121 greater respectively than the averages of the same
months in the preceding nine years.
    The average weight of a cubic foot of air in the quarter
was 527 grains; exceeding that of the average of the preceding
nine years by 1 grain.
   The rain fallen at Greenwich in July was 2.9 inches, in
August was 4.9, and in September was 1-3. The falls for the
three months on an average of nine years, are 23, 2-6, and 2-3
inches respectively.
   The average daily ranges of the readings of the thermometer
in air at the height of four feet above the soil, in July was
20°-0, in August was 18°6, and in September was 17°1.
The averages for the three months from the preceding nine
years were 19°4, 17°6 and 18°-9 respectively.
   The minimum readings of the thermometer on grass, with its
bulb fully exposed to the sky, in July was at or below 40° on
eight nights; the lowest was 34°, and was above 40° on
twenty-three nights; the highest reading was 55°5 In
August the readings were at and below 32° on two nights;
the lowest reading was 26°; between 32° and 40° on six
nights, and above 40° on twenty-three nights; the highest
reading was 58°. In September the readings were at or
below 32° on nine nights; the lowest reading was 24°; be
tween 32° and 40° on six nights, and above 40° on fifteen
nights; and the highest reading was 50°.

   At Uckfield, during the third week of July, the weather
was very wet, and many places in this county were visited by
severe thunder-storms.
   At Hartwell Rectory, on the 15th of July, at 1" 30m P.M.,
there was a storm with thunder and lightning, and rain fell to
the depth of 0.51 inch. July 17, at 6' 30" P.M., there was
another thunder-storm, but very little rain; sheet lightning
occurred at intervals during the evening to the south and
west. July 18, at 3h 30m P.M., there was a thunder-storm
with heavy rain; and sheet lightning was seen all the evening,
followed by continued rain, which measured in the gauge, on
the following morning, 1-610 inch.
   At York, on August 8, a thunder-storm occurred between
six and eight in the evening. The Diocesan School and the
Roman Catholic Chapel were struck by lightning and injured.
Sheep were killed, and two individuals were knocked down,
but no human life was lost.   This was the severest storm that
has occurred in York for the last twenty years. Thunder and
lightning occurred again on the 9th.
   At Stonyhurst, the lightning during the thunder-storm of

    Whirlwind.—On September 30, during a thunder-storm, a
 whirlwind was seen by G. A. Fryer, Esq., at Trowbridge,
caused by the meeting of two currents from the north-west
 and east. They took a southerly direction, and coming in
 contact with a thatched house, carried the thatch to a distance
 of sixty yards, and then meeting with three elm-trees, it broke
 the tops off and carried them to a distance of some thirty
yards: the diameters of the parts of the trees where broken
off were about fifteen inches.

 inch fell, of which 0.8 inch fell in little more than half an hour.
    At Exeter, from August 25 to September 19, no rain fell,
 and the weather was close, warm and fine for several days;
 the sky was cloudless: the average reading of the barometer
 was about 30°25 inches.
    The amount of rain which fell during the thunder-storm on
 September 20 was 1.95 inch, which is the amount by which
 the rain in the month exceeded the average; the former being
 4’33 inches, and the latter 2:39, or rather more than one
 half.
    At Uckfield, on July 17, the depth of rain which fell within
 an hour was 1-81 inch, which is almost an unprecedented
 amount to have fallen in so short a time in the south of En
 gland. Much heavy rain fell during the last week of Sep
 tember, which was very beneficial to the autumnal crops.

inch, and on August 7 to the depth of 0.858 inch.
   At North Shields, on July 25 and 26, rain fell to the depth
of 1:482 inch. The month of September was remarkably

                   and the South of Scotland.              379
fine and dry till the 20th; on that day there was a heavy fall

   On July 4, at 9h 26" P.M., a meteor, which increased in
brilliancy and size as it progressed, until from a mere point
it attained a size equal to three times the apparent dia
meter of Jupiter, and was nearly six times as bright as that
planet; its colour was pale blue; and it fell nearly perpen
dicularly downwards, inclining very slightly towards the E.
It passed from half-way between X and 6 Antinous, fading
away 2° to the E. of a Capricorni, and on the same level
with that star. Its motion was slow ; duration 2 seconds; at
first unaccompanied by sparks; finally it suddenly separated,
and almost instantaneously vanished.
   On July 9, at 10" P.M., a meteor was seen twice the size of
Jupiter, and similar in colour; it fell downwards from the

being in the zenith.                                   -

380       Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteorology of England
   On August 12, at 10h 32m P.M., E. J. Lowe, Esq. saw a
meteor which moved horizontally, and which increased in
brilliancy from being equal to a star of the fifth magnitude to
one of the second.      Its colour was blue, and duration 05:2.
Its path was from 24 Camelopardalis towards A Draconis.
   On August 12, at 10° 32m P.M., a meteor passed T Cassio
peia near p Ursae Majoris, and was equal in size to a star of
the third magnitude. Its colour was blue, and its dura
tion 4°.
   ôi the same night, at 11" 9m P.M., a meteor fell from be
tween 8, y and A Pegasi, perpendicularly down to within 20°
of the horizon, when it went behind a cloud; and from 15 to
2* after a flash resembling lightning, and quite as vivid, pro
ceeded from behind the cloud, followed immediately by a
second flash.    The meteor itself was about 12' in diameter,
was globular in form, and yellow in colour. It moved very
slowly. This meteor was followed by a train of light.
   On August 14, at 8h 45* P.M., a meteor was seen four or
five times larger than Jupiter. It was of a pale straw-colour,
very globular in form, with a red defined disc. No train of
light visible. It fell from between X Bootis and m Ursae Ma
joris perpendicularly downwards. It passed 3° or 4° N. of
the large group of stars in Coma Berenices. Its duration
was 28.
   On August 14, at 9h 48m P.M., a small meteor moved from
24 Camelopardalis to Ursae Majoris. Its colour was blue,
and duration #5.
   On the same night, at 9h 49* P.M., a meteor was seen in
the zenith.
   On August 22, at 10h P.M., a meteor fell from e Cephei
through X Andromedae.
   On August 22, at 10h 24” P.M., a meteor was seen about
the size of Arcturus, and of a yellow colour. It fell perpen
dicularly down, inclining to the N., from 5° below y Bootis.
   On August 29, at 9h 59m 35°, a meteor of the size of a star
of the third magnitude. It was blue in colour, and moved
very rapidly. It passed from m Bootis to Arcturus. Its du
ration was 0°-5.
   On August 29, at 10h 1” P.M., a meteor of the size of a
star of the second magnitude. Its colour was red. It left a
train of red sparks, and moved rapidly from y Trianguli to
Saturn.
   On August 29, at 10h 4" P.M., a meteor was seen of an
orange-scarlet colour. It moved slowly from e Persei to near
21 Pegasi in a horizontal direction. Its duration was 2*.
When first seen it was equal to a star of the fifth magnitude,
but gradually increased in diameter as it progressed until it

                    and the South of Scotland.               381
became three times as large as Saturn. There was no large
ball of light. It disappeared suddenly.
   On the same night, at 10h 7m P.M., a meteor was seen,
which moved rather slowly, was of a blue colour, with a slight
tail; duration, 1*; in size, superior to a star of the second
mº   n September 1, at 9h 5m P.M., a meteor was seen      in the
zenith.
   On September 2, at 11h 13m P.M., a meteor was seen pass
ing rapidly from 8 Aquilae to 6.
    On the same night, at 11h 16" P.M., a similar one from
e Aquarii to 8 Capricorni.
    On the same night, at 11” 19” P.M., a meteor passed from
a Taurus to 8 Ophiuchi.
    Again, on the same night, at 10" 20" P.M., from m Ursae
 Minoris to e Ursae Majoris. Duration, 1*; colour, yellow.
    On September 12, at 12* 6m P.M., a meteor was seen of the
size of a star of the third magnitude. Its colour was blue,
and moved from below a Aquila towards the west.
    On September 28, at 10h 45* P.M., a meteor, which moved
 from S.S.E. to S.W., at an elevation of 45°, and leaving a
 long train of light behind.
    The temperature of the water of the Thames, from the ob
 servations of Lieut. Sanders, R.N., Superintendent of the
 Dreadnought Hospital Ship, was 64°6 in July, 63°-2 in Au
 gust, and 57°9 in September.
    The daily horizontal movement of the air at Greenwich, in
 July was 79 miles, in August was 119 miles, and in September
 was 82 miles. At Liverpool, in July was 166 miles, in Au
 gust was 174 miles, and in September was 129 miles. These
 determinations are by the use of Whewell's anemometer at
 both places; and Mr. Hartnup says, that his daily determi
 nations are made in the same manner as at Greenwich.
    The series of observations of the direction of the wind, at
 9" A.M., taken at the various railway stations, and published in
 the Daily News, has been extended during the past quarter
 to Ireland. The following Tables have principally been
 formed from them. The results for Belgium have been
 formed from monthly reports furnished to the Astronomer
  Royal :—

            Their quarterly values are shown in the preceding

inches, and it represents that portion of the reading of the ba
rometer due to the pressure of the air; the remaining portion,
or that due to the pressure of water, is 0.397 inch; the sum of
those two numbers is 30.002 inches, and it represents the mean
reading of the barometer at the mean level of the sea for the
quarter ending September 30, 1850.
   The mean of the numbers in the second column for Guern
sey and Jersey is 60°. 1; for those places in the counties of
Cornwall and Devonshire, is 59°2; south of latitude of 52°
is 58°4; between latitudes 52° and 53° is 57°3; between
the latitudes of 53° and 54° is 55°7; at Liverpool and White
haven is 57°3; for Durham, Newcastle and North Shields, is
54°6; and for Glasgow and Dunino is 56°-1.
   The highest reading of the thermometer in air was about 88°,
and the lowest was 32°. The extreme range of temperature
during the quarter in England was therefore about 66°. The
least daily ranges of temperature took place at Guernsey and
Liverpool, and the greatest occurred at Uckfield and in the
Vale of Aylesbury.
   Rain fell on the least number of days at Jersey and Torquay,
and on the greatest number of days at Wakefield, Stony
hurst and North Shields. The places where the least falls
took place are London and Truro; and the mean amount at
these places was 5-3 inches. The largest falls occurred at
Whitehaven and Falmouth, and their average was 12-4 inches.

     GENTLEMEN,
I   AM permitted by my friend Professor Thomson to com
     municate the following letter to the Philosophical Maga
zine, containing an explanation of the true cause of the non
scalding property of steam issuing from a high-pressure boiler.
The proposition announced by Mr. Rankine is certainly one
of very great importance; as it would appear from it that
when saturated steam is allowed to expand so as to evolve

        connected with the Theory of the Steam-Engine.                 387
work, a part of it is condensed, and that this condensation
affords heat for the expansion of the remainder of the steam.
This fact, which is analogous to that of the production of a
cloud when air saturated with vapour is rarefied in the re
ceiver of an air-pump, explains the approach of the oecono
mical duty of the steam-engine to that of the air-engine, on
which I propose to make a few observations shortly.
         I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen,
                                   Yours very respectfully,
                                                  JAMES P. Joule.
       MY DEAR SIR,                            Paris, October 15, 1850.
IN Mr. Rankine’s paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat",
the following very remarkable resultisannounced:—“If vapour
at saturation is allowed to expand, and at the same time is
maintained at the temperature of saturation, the heat which
disappears in producing the expansion is greater than that set
free by the fall of temperature, and the deficiency of heat must
be supplied from without, otherwise a portion of the vapour
will be lique<U+017F>ted in order to supply the heat necessary for the ea
pansion of the rest.”      This conclusion can, I think, be recon
ciled with known facts only by means of your discovery, that
heat is evolved by the friction of fluids in motion. For it
is well known that the hand may be held with impunity in
a current of steam issuing from the safety-valve of a high
pressure boiler; and again, it is known that “Watt's law”
does not rigorously express the actual decrease in the latent
heat of saturated steam with an elevation of temperature; but,
on the contrary, Regnault shows that the “total heat” of satu
rated steam increases slowly with the temperature, at an ap
proximately uniform rate. These two facts are consistent and
connected with one another; for, according to the latter, steam
issuing from a high-pressure boiler ought, in the immediate
neighbourhood and on the outside of the orifice, where, of
course, its pressure scarcely exceeds that of the atmosphere, to
be at a temperature sensibly above 212°, and consequently su
persaturated, and quite dry; and it is well known that the hand
experiences no pain from being exposed to a hot current of a
dry gas, even if the temperature considerably exceeds 212°.
 But, according to Mr. Rankine's proposition, steam allowed
to expand from saturation will, if no heat be supplied to it, re
main saturated, except a small portion which becomes liquefied.
 Either then Mr. Rankine's conclusion is opposed to the facts,

388     Prof. Thomson on a remarkable property of Steam
or some heat must be acquired by the steam as it issues from the
boiler. The pretended explanation of a corresponding circum
stance connected with the rushing of air from one vessel to
another in Gay-Lussac's experiment, on which you have com
mented, is certainly not applicable in this case, since instead
of receiving heat from without, the steam must lose a little in
passing through the stop-cock or steam-pipe by external ra
diation and convection. There is no possible way in which the
heat can be acquired except by the friction of the steam as it
rushes through the orifice. Hence I think I am justified in
saying that your discovery alone can reconcile Mr. Rankine's
discovery with known facts.
   In connexion with this subject it is to be remarked, that if
your fundamental principle regarding the convertibility of
heat and mechanical effect, adopted also by Mr. Rankine, be
true, a quantity of water raised from the freezing-point to any
higher temperature, converted into saturated vapour at that
temperature, and then allowed to expand through a small ori
fice wasting all its “work” in friction, will, in its expanded
state, possess the “total heat” which has been given to it; but,
on the contrary, if it be allowed to expand, pushing out a pis
ton against a resisting force, it will in the expanded state pos
sess less than that total heat by the amount corresponding to
the mechanical effect developed. If the proposition quoted
above of Mr. Rankine’s be true, this amount must exceed the
amount of deviation from Watt's law measured by Regnault;
and must consequently bear a very considerable ratio to the
total heat, instead of being, as I believe all experimenters ex
cept yourself have hitherto considered it to be, quite inappre
ciable.
   In the paragraph following that from which I have quoted,
Mr. Rankine remarks,—“There is as yet no experimental
proof” of the preceding proposition. “It is true that in the
working of non-condensing engines it has been found that the
steam which escapes is always at the temperature of saturation
corresponding to its pressure, and carries along with it a por
tion of water in the liquid state; but it is impossible to distin
guish between the water which has been liquefied by the ex
pansion of the steam, and that which has been carried over
mechanically from the boiler.” The circumstances of the
passage of steam through the various parts of a non-conden
sing engine, are certainly very complicated. Even if there were
no water “carried over mechanically from the boiler,” we could
not conclude the truth of Mr. Rankine's proposition from the
fact of the steam issuing moist and at 212° from the waste
steam-pipe, since this might be accounted for by the external

        connected with the Theory of the Steam-Engine.            389
loss of heat from the cylinder, steam-pipes, &c.; nor could we
conclude that Mr. Rankine's proposition is false, if the steam
were observed in any case to issue dry from the steam-pipe,
and at a temperature above 212°, unless the expansive prin
ciple were known to be pushed to the utmost in the actual work
ing of the engine. It is however certain that if Mr. Rankine's
proposition be true, steam, after having passed through a high
pressure engine in which the expansive principle is pushed to
the utmost, whether there be any “priming” or not, and whe
ther there be any heat lost externally from the different parts
of the engine or not, will issue at the temperature of 212°,
and moist (and consequently scalding to the hand), from the
waste steam-pipe; and, Regnault's modification of Watt’s law
being considered as established, it is certain that steam issu
ing immediately from a high-pressure boiler into the open air
will be above 212°, and dry.
   The demonstration which Mr. Rankine gives of his propo
sition is partially founded on certain hypotheses regarding the
specific heats of gases and vapours. But, besides this propo
sition, he derives another conclusion from the same investiga
tion which is experimentally verified by Regnault's modifica
tion of Watt's law: and hence, as it is easy to show, if we are
contented to take Regnault's result as an experimental fact,
and if we adopt your mechanical equivalent for a thermal unit
(or Rankine's value, which is about ºths of yours), we may
demonstrate Mr. Rankine’s remarkable theorem without any
other hypothesis than the convertibility of heat and mechani
cal effect.
    In a paper by Clausius+, published in Poggendorff’s Annalen
for last April and May, a similar conclusion to that which I
have quoted of Mr. Rankine’s (whose paper was read before
the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 4th of February), is
announced. I have not yet been able to make myself fully ac
quainted with this paper; but, from the principles and methods
of reasoning explained at the commencement, which differ from
those of Carnot only in the adoption of your axiom instead of
Carnot's, I have no doubt but that the demonstration of the
proposition in question is the same in substance as Mr. Ran
kine's modified in the manner I have suggested.

    LI. On the Conductibility of the Earth for Electricity.
                   By JAMEs NAPIER, Esq.”
A",    the recent meeting of the British Association in Edin
     burgh, Professor Matteucci communicated a paper upon
the conductibility of the earth, in which are given many inter
esting experiments; but it is there stated that hitherto “nothing
had been known of the laws and theory of this singular phe
nomenon.” I thought that the theory of the conductibility of
the earth for electricity had been long known to men of science
in this country, and the cause to be, as Mr. R. Hunt stated
at the conclusion of the paper, depending upon the water con
tained in the superficial stratum of the earth. In corroboration
of Mr. Hunt's remarks, I send you the results of a few ex
periments made in 1843 upon this subject, which were not
published at the time, from the belief that the conclusions they
led to were previously well known.
   My object in these experiments was to apply the electricity
obtained from the earth to the deposition of metals; the first
experiments were, placing pieces of zinc and copper in the
earth so as to constitute a battery; but I was soon struck with
the fact that it did not appear of any consequence, as regards
the quantity and power of the electric current, whether these
metals were placed only a few inches apart or a number of feet,
or yards, or acres, or whether there stood between them trees,
houses, or streets; indeed many of the experiments were made
by having one plate of metal imbedded in the garden in front
and another in the garden behind my house, which had a sunk
flat; and there was no apparent difference in the results ob
tained under these conditions to those obtained when both
metals were imbedded a few inches apart in one garden. The
question which suggested itself from these results was, whether
this conducting power was dependent upon the nature of the
materials composing the earth 2 To ascertain this, a plate of
zinc and copper were laid upon a large table a few inches apart,
and connected by a wire. When the table was wet there was
a current passing, but not when dry; when these plates were
imbedded in sawdust and in sand, a current was always ob
tained when these materials were wet, but ceased when they
were dry. A large vessel was then filled with earth from the
garden, and a zinc and copper plate imbedded in it, and the
whole placed in such a condition as to allow the earth to dry

 slowly. It was interesting to remark during this experiment
 the gradual decline of the galvanometer needle, until the earth
was perfectly dry, when it ceased to indicate any passing cur
rent.    The earth was now made wet around, and in contact
with the plates, leaving a portion of the earth between them
dry. Under these conditions there was no current; but when
ever the earth was all moistened between the plates, the cur
rent of electricity became as strong as at first. A common
Wollaston's battery, charged with acid, having the two termi
nals or poles connected by the earth in the vessel, gave similar
results; when the earth was dry there was no conduction;
when wet, the current passed through easily. All these led to
one conclusion, that the conducting medium was the water,
which, if I mistake not, had been pointed out some time pre
vious to my experiments, both by Mr. Hunt and Mr. Fox.
And they are also the conclusions which Professor Matteucci
has more recently come to.

 ON THE MINERALS OF THE AURIFEROUS DISTRICTS OF WICK
                 LOW.    BY WILLIAM MALLET, ESQ.
rTHE      circumstances attending the original discovery of native gold
       in the beds of some of the streams of the County of Wicklow,
have been already often detailed, and will therefore need but a brief
repetition.    The source of the auriferous streams is the mountain
Croghan Kinshela, whose summit forms a portion of the boundary
between the counties of Wicklow and Wexford.          The stream from
which most of the gold has been obtained rises on the north-east
side of this mountain, and flowing down one of the glens with which
that part of the country is intersected in almost every direction, joins
the Aughrim river, a little above the confluence of the latter stream
with the Avonmore.       It receives several smaller streams at different
parts of its course, in all of which some gold appears to have been
found, though in general in such small quantity as not to repay the
cost of its extraction.
   Although this part of the country, since it has been known to be
auriferous, has been an object of some attraction to mineralogists,
but little attention seems to have been directed to the other minerals
which are to be found accompanying the gold in the alluvial deposits.
These, however, are interesting, not only from their number and
variety, but also from the occurrence amongst them of some of the
rarer species, which do not appear to have been noticed in any other
locality in Ireland. The following minerals were obtained from a
considerable mass of sand and gravel taken from various parts of the
bed of the principal stream:—
      Gold.                                 Galena.
      Platina.                              Sulphuret of molybdenum.
      Tinstone.                             Sapphire.
      Magnetic oxide of iron.              Topaz.
      Micaceous iron.                       Zircon.
      Red iron ochre.                       Garnet (two varieties).
      Hydrous peroxide of iron.             Quartz.
      Common clay ironstone.               Prase.
      Iron pyrites.                        Augite.
      Titaniferous iron.                   Chlorite.
      Wolfram.                             Felspar.
      Oxide of manganese.                  Mica.
      Copper pyrites.
   The author has since observed, in addition to those here men
tioned, arsenical iron, in small fragments, and also spinelle.      The
latter occurs in very small grains along with the second variety of
garnet, from which it is readily distinguished by its peculiar purplish
red colour.
   Gold.—This mineral occurs here in probably its most beautiful
form. It possesses the true golden yellow colour and metallic lustre

which characterize the metal, and, owing to the attrition to which it
has been subjected, generally presents a beautifully brilliant surface.
It occurs in grains of all sizes, from the smallest spangle up to a
mass weighing twenty-two ounces, the largest hitherto found. The
specific gravity of some small grains Mr. Mallet found to be 16'342.
The analysis of these grains gave— .

This is equivalent (neglecting the iron) to 8} atoms of gold and 1
of silver.
   Platina.-Mixed with the gold are some very small flattened
grains of a white colour and metallic lustre, which, as far as their
minute size permitted an examination, appear to present all the
characters of platina. They are infusible before the blowpipe, and
insoluble in nitric acid, but dissolve in aqua-regia. Their occurrence
intermixed with the gold when all other minerals have been washed
off, is a proof of their high specific gravity*.
   Tinstone.—The occurrence of this mineral in the sand is men
tioned by Weaver in his reports on the gold-stream-works, but he
does not seem to have been at all aware of the large quantities in
which it exists. From the comparatively small portiont of sand
which the author had an opportunity of examining, he obtained
about 3% pounds of stream tin; a portion of which being reduced,
yielded an ingot, which, when refined by a second fusion, is hardly
inferior to the finest grain tin;. Should this mineral be found in
the mass of the sand in a quantity at all approaching that in which
it existed in the specimen from which this was obtained, it would
probably richly repay the labour and expense of its collection and
smelting. From the small quantity in which other minerals of high
specific gravity exist in the sand, and the constant supply of water,
very little difficulty would be experienced in separating it from the
rest of the sand; and the almost total absence of arsenic and lead
would render it extremely easy to obtain from it metallic tin of the
very first quality. The mineral itself occurs in grains varying in
size from fine sand up to pebbles of half an inch in diameter, and
for the most part of a dark brown colour, with some fragments of
various tints of yellow and red; some presenting the peculiar ap
pearance to which the name “wood tin’” has been given. All these
varieties are slightly translucent, some of them highly so. Many
of them present distinct traces of the obtuse octohedron, the same

ascertained.—ED. Phil. Mag.

but thinks it certainly did not exceed 150 lbs.
   f The specimen smelted in this experiment yielded about 61 per cent.
of tin; but more would be obtained on the great scale, as in this case no
pains were taken to extract the tin remaining in the scoriae.

   The greater number of the minerals here enumerated are men
tioned by Mr. Weaver in his reports to Government on the district,
and which are to be found in the Transactions of the Royal Dublin
 Society; but some of them, the author believes, have not been no
ticed before, at least he has seen no published account of the occur
rence in this locality of platina, titanic iron, sulphuret of molybdenum,
topaz, zircon, the small manganesian garnets, or augite. Hence it
 seemed interesting, while noticing these, to collect into a uniform
and as far as possible complete list, all the scattered notices of the
 mineral wealth of this particular district, which are to be found in
Mr. Weaver's papers already referred to, and elsewhere.
   The principal point, however, with respect to the examination of
these minerals, which appears to merit further and more particular
attention, is the fact of the existence of tinstone in such considerable
quantity in these auriferous streams;–a fact which would seem to
indicate the probable existence somewhere in the surrounding di
strict, of masses of the ore of this valuable metal of great extent,
and possibly forming the continuation, on this side of the Channel,
of those vast deposits which have contributed to furnish occupation
and support to the inhabitants of Cornwall for more than two thou
sand years.—Transactions of the Geological Society of Dublin.

     ON THE ALTERATION WHICH WELL-WATER UNDERGOES.
                          BY M. C. BLONDEAU.
   The analysis which the author has performed on the water of a
great number of the wells of Rhodez, has led him to adopt the fol
lowing conclusions:—
    1. Well-water may be altered by two causes; by the presence of
mineral salts held in solution, and by that of animal matters.
    2. The mineral substances which occur in solution are silica, alu
mina, carbonates and phosphates of lime and magnesia, potash-alum,
chlorides of calcium, magnesium and sodium, with nitrates of the
same bases.      These different substances are not hurtful to the animal
oeconomy when they exist only in small quantity. Well-water, [of
which a litre Pl contains only 4 to 5 centigrammes of these sub
stances in solution, may be employed for all domestic uses, provided
it does not contain too large a proportion of animal matter.
    3. Water, of which a litre contains one gramme of the above
mentioned substances, may still be good for drinking; but it is not
fit for cooking vegetables or washing linen when it contains 0 1 grim.
of lime or magnesia.
   4. Water, of which a litre contains 0 1 grim, of lime or of mag
nesia, and 0 1 grim. of organic matter, is improper for any domestic
uS6.
   5. It is of the utmost importance to state the existence and de
termine the quantity of animal matter held in solution in waters;
for if they exceed the limits above-stated, they act disastrously on
the oeconomy, and may occasion dysentery, and various maladies
which appear to be contagious because the whole population acquire
the seeds at the same sources.
   6. The presence of magnesia in drinkable waters does not produce
so hurtful an action as supposed by some persons. The well-water
of Rhodez contains on an average five times as much magnesia as
the waters of the valley of the Iser, analysed by M. Granger; and
yet endemic diseases, as goitre and cretinism, are entirely unknown
in the chief town of Aveyron.
   7. The water of certain wells possesses a very disagreeable earthy
taste; this taste is derived from alumina held in solution by carbonic
acid.    It is observed that those well-waters which contain most of
this base have the strongest earthy flavour.
   8. It results from these experiments, that a classification of drink
able waters, based on the relations which exist between the sulphates
and the chlorides, must be a defective one; for this relation varies

with respect to the same kind of water, within limits of considerable
extent; and it is never certain that the water operated on has not
met in its course, either above or below the soil, with substances
which have altered and changed the proportions in which these salts
enter into its composition.—L'Institut, No. 851.
      on EMERY, AND THE MINERALs Associated WITH IT.
   M. J. Laurence Smith has read a memoir before the French Aca
demy on the Emery of Asia Minor, its geological and commercial
relations, and on the minerals associated with it.
   Previously to 1846, emery had not been stated to exist either in
Asia Minor or the surrounding islands, except perhaps in the Isle of
Samos, where it was mentioned as occurring by Tournefort in his
Travels in the seventeenth century. Numerous and important de
posits are now known in these countries: and Mr. Smith, by direc
tion of the Turkish government, has explored them. He has chiefly
examined this mineral in situ near the ruins of the ancient city of
Magnesia on the Meander, and at first at the village of Gumuch, at
the foot of a mountain of the same name.
   With respect to this deposit, it is to be observed that all the sur
rounding rocks and country appear to belong to the ancient series.
The limestone is entirely free from fossils, and possesses metamorphic
characters; it lies upon schists, of which the micaceous appears to
be the most abundant, and this further to the north occurs in contact
with gneiss. In some situations there are found in the limestone,
deposits of siliceous schists containing small fragments of titaniferous
iron. The limestone is of a light blue colour, passing into granular
marble. Towards the south, the rocks by their decomposition pro
duce lofty precipices, which add much to the picturesque appearance
of the country. The emery is found in different places in the moun
tain of Gumuch; it is, however, most abundant upon a part of the
summit, at about a league and a half from the village of Gumuch,
and 2000 feet above the level of the valley. This summit commands
the magnificent plain of the Meander, the tortuous windings of which
look as if they had been drawn upon a map.           The emery occurs
scattered on the soil in angular fragments of a deep colour.      Enor
mous blocks weighing many tons project from the surface of the
soil; and by digging, blocks of emery of different sizes are met with.
On going a little deeper the rock which contains it is arrived at.
   On breaking the marble which in this place projects from the soil,
fragments of emery are always found.
   Sometimes this mineral forms a mass of several feet long and wide,
and they are now working a mass which is from thirty to sixty feet
square; all the rocks which they obtain are emery. The spaces
which occur, which are merely fissures formed by the contraction of
this substance at its formation, are filled with earth containing oxide
of iron. In some places the masses are consolidated by carbonate
of lime introduced by infiltration, and which must not be confounded
with the marble which is the original gangue of the emery.           In

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            397
the infiltrated carbonate of lime sometimes round fragments, and at
other times angular fragments of emery occur; it is never met with
in veins, or with any appearance of stratification.
   After Gumuch-Dagh, Kulah is the most important locality of Asia
Minor.    Kulah is a city about thirty leagues distant from Gumuch,
seven leagues from the ancient city of Philadelphia, and not far from
the river Hermes. Emery exists also in many other localities. After
having studied this mineral, and the rocks which accompany its va
rious deposits, Mr. Smith is of opinion that the emery was formed
and consolidated in the calcareous rock in which it is found; and
that it has not, like granite or gneiss, been detached from more
ancient rocks, and deposited in the calcareous rock when the forma
tion of the latter occurred.—L Institut, Juillet 17, 1850.
on THE IDENTITY OF THE EQUISETIC, Acon ITIC AND citridic
                 ACIDS, AND ON SOME ACONITATES.
   M. Baup observes that doubts existed as to the identity of the
pyrogenous citridic and maleic acids; in order to decide this question,
he extracted the acid from the Equisetum fluviatile, and from the
Aconitum napellus, and compared them with the pyrogenous citric
acid, called citridic acid, and with maleic acid.
   From the comparative examination which the author made of
their properties and several combinations, he has concluded with
certainty that the aconitic, equisetic and citridic acids, are one and
the same acid, and that they ought to be called exclusively aconitic
acid, whatever may be the source from which they are procured.
Maleic acid, although isomeric with it, is not however identical, and
ought to retain its name.
   In examining several aconitates, M. Baup has met with a fact
which merits the attention of chemists, as being the first example of
a compound of three atoms of an organic acid with one atom of base.
The ter-aconitate of potash and also of ammonia have but very few
representatives, even in inorganic chemistry: as an example, the
teriodate of potash of M. Serullas may be mentioned.
   During these researches on the Equisetum fluviatile, M. Baup dis
covered in it a peculiar yellow crystalline matter, which imparted
to aluminated cotton a yellow tint not inferior to weld.        He has
given it the name of flaveguisitin.—Comptes Rendus, Sept. 9, 1850.
  ON THE PRODUCTION OF SUCCINIC ACID BY FERMENTATION.
   M. Dessaignes states, that when he gave a short account of the
conversion of rough malate of lime into succinate of lime by spon
taneous fermentation, he proposed to add to this first observation
such facts as he might obtain from analogy. This research was con
siderably advanced when M. Liebig published a memoir on the same
subject; some facts, however, were observed by M. Dessaignes

   M. Dessaignes employs rough caseine as a ferment; it is thoroughly
mixed with water, holding either in solution or suspension the sub
stance experimented upon, and the whole is to be exposed to summer
heat for three weeks or a month.      The author's experiments were
performed upon perfectly pure neutral malate of lime, supermalate
of lime, malate of potash, aspartate of potash, aspartate of lime, fu
marate of lime, maleate of lime, and aconitate of lime extracted from
the Aconitum napellus. All these salts are readily converted into
succinate under the influence of the fermentation of caseine.      Aspa
ragin, under the same influence, begins by changing into aspartate
of ammonia, and this is converted into succinate.        In fact, if the
fermentation is interrupted long before it is finished, a large quantity
of aspartic acid is found in the liquor, as well as succinic acid.
   The body which exists in the family of the leguminous plants,
which has not hitherto been isolated, and is converted by germination
into asparagin, is also susceptible of being converted into succinic
acid. In fact, if the meal of peas be diffused through water for twelve
hours, and then fermented, after having added chalk and filtered the
liquor, a notable quantity of succinate of lime is formed. M. Des
saignes separately fermented legumin, the liquor from which it was
precipitated, and also a nitrogenous body which has been noticed by
M. Braconnot; by these means it was hoped that the substance
which produces the succinic acid might be discovered. All these
fermentations yield succinic acid in quantities which are certainly
unequal, but the author has not yet terminated this part of his re
searches; the same acid was also produced by fermenting the emul
sion of sweet almonds, separated from its oil and mixed with      chalk.
It appears, therefore, that the succinic fermentation occurs in nature
as frequently as the acetic, metacetic, butyric, and valerianic fer
mentations.
   He adds some observations on the isomeric acids with the formula
C4 H2O4.
   It has been stated above, that the fumaric, maleic and aconitic
acids, are all of them convertible into succinic acid. This similarity
of conversion is remarkable; for, on the one hand, the citrates of lime
or soda fermented with caseine do not yield succinic acid, and on
the other hand, the two acids derived from the malic acid are very
clearly distinguished from aconitic acid by another metamorphosis.
 In fact, it was found that the bifumarate and bimaleate of ammonia,
submitted to dry distillation, yield a substance much resembling in
most of its reactions, but not identical with, the bimalate of ammonia
produced under similar circumstances. This matter, by the pro
longed action of hydrochloric acid, is converted into aspartic acid,
absolutely the same as that obtained with malic acid. But the bi
aconitate of ammonia and the biequisetate of ammonia, submitted to
the same treatment, do not produce aspartic acid. The neutral ma
late of ammonia does not precipitate perchloride of iron, whilst the
 neutral aconitate and equisetate of ammonia do precipitate this salt.
 In the comparative examination which the author commenced of
 these three acids, he was readily convinced of the perfect identity of

the aconitic and equisetic acids, and of the non-identity of the latter
 with maleic acid; but M. Dessaignes states, that the details which
he could give on this subject are rendered useless by the recent pub
lication of M. Baup thereon. The author concludes this notice by
stating a method of obtaining, with asparagin, an aspartic acid
which crystallizes in the same form as aspartic acid procured from
the bimalate of ammonia. Heat to 392°F. aspartate of ammonia
obtained from asparagin, till no more ammoniacal odour is percep
tible, there remains a brown substance that is very slightly soluble,
which, treated with hydrochloric acid, reproduces aspartic acid,
crystallizing in short hard prisms, like those of the acid derived from
the malic, maleic and fumaric acids.—Comptes Rendus, Septembre 16,

  LIV. On the alleged evidence for a Physical Connevion be

 1. AN opinion has long obtained amongst astronomers that
          the great number of cases which occur in the heavens

 another (constituting what have been called double, triple or
 multiple stars), constitutes of itself an argument for a more
 than apparent connexion between the members of those
 groups.
    2. It is evident that two stars may constitute an apparently
 double star without any real proximity between them, merely
 because a line passing through the eye of the spectator and
 the nearer star may, if prolonged into space (no matter how
 far), pass somewhere near a second star, whose position would
 therefore seem almost to coincide with the first, although the
 distance which separates them might be indefinitely great.
 Such stars are sometimes said to be “optically ” double. On
 the other hand, it may happen that the two stars are really

of May 1850, with the intention of its being read at the meeting of the
British Association in August. Circumstances prevented its completion or
revision; and what I had written in May I read to the Physical Section of
that body on the 6th of August. The only addition then made was a sum
mary of conclusions which I have inserted verbatim in the present paper,
and which form the first four of those given in § 37. Those articles which

402    Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connevion
as well as seemingly near, and may act upon one another by
their mutual attractions, after the manner of sun and planet.
Such stars are called “physically” double.
   3. Now it is an interesting fact, that long before we had
the convincing proof that many binary stars are “physically.”
as well as “optically ” double, which was afforded by the
splendid discovery of Sir William Herschel that such stars do
in many cases describe orbits round their common centre of
gravity, the Rev. John Mitchell, a philosopher of great and
original talent, had inferred inductively the probability that
such a physical connexion existed, merely from their closeness
of apparent position, and without any proof of their exerting
a sensible attraction, or other reciprocal influence. Having
arrived himself inductively at the conclusion, he endeavoured
to put his grounds of belief into a mathematical shape, which
should compel the assent of all reasonable persons, by showing
the great numerical probability which exists (according to him)
against the contrary supposition, namely, that such stars are
only “optically,” not “physically” double.
   4. Mitchell’s argument is contained in a paper, remarkable
on many other accounts, entitled “An Inquiry into the pro
bable Magnitude and Parallaw of the Fived Stars from the
quantity of Light which they afford to us, and the particular
circumstances of their situation,” printed in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1767*. Amongst other results he obtains
this one (so often quoted since), that “the odds are near
500,000 to 1, that no six stars out of 1500 equal in splendour,
scattered at random in the whole heavens, would be within so
small a distance from one another as the Pleiades aret.”
    5. The principles of reasoning employed in this paper (to
which we shall presently revert), and the results contained in
it, have been sanctioned by the authority of writers of the
very highest eminence, whether on astronomy or on the theory
 of probabilities; who, since the time of Mitchell, or for more
than eighty years, have adopted them without (so far as I
know) a dissentient voice; and the extent to which the prin
 ciples of Mitchell have been implicitly admitted by his suc
cessors may be understood from the following statement, rest
ing on the very highest living authorities on sidereal astronomy.
 M. Struve, director of the Pulkowa Observatory, “calculates
 the odds at 9570 to 1 against any two stars, from the 1st to
 the 7th magnitude inclusive, falling (if fortuitously scattered)
within 4" of each other. Now the number of such binary
combinations actually observed at the date of this calculation
was already 91, and many more have been added to the list.

     between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.                 403 .
Again, he calculates that the odds against any (two?) such stars
fortuitously scattered falling within 32" of a third, so as to
constitute a triple star, is not less than 173,524 to 1. Now,
four such combinations occur in the heavens.”                   Sir John
Herschel, from whose Outlines of Astronomy I take this state
ment of Struve's results, adds, “the conclusion of a physical
connexion of some kind or other is therefore unavoidable +.”
    6. Now I desire it to be most distinctly understood, that
the argument which I have to state is not meant to controvert
the truth of the general result at which Mitchell and Struve
arrive, namely, that the proximity of many stars to one spot,
or the occurrence of many close binary stars distributed over
the heavens, raises a probability, or rather we would call it an
inductive argument, feeble perhaps, but still real, that such
proximity may be actual, not merely apparent; but I deny
that such probable argument is capable of being ea pressed nu
merically at all; and I hope clearly to prove, that it has no
absolute and compulsory form addressing itself alike to all un
derstandings and to all capacities, and to persons ill and well
informed alike; but that the grouping of stars is like any
phaenomenon occurring in physical investigations, which sug
gests further inquiry; which points at a result not improbable,
but requiring to be inductively established by bringing together
other considerations, whose accumulation may impel convic
tion upon minds capableofestimating logical evidence, although
this evidence is no more capable of being expressed by num
 bers than is the evidence for the truth of the theory of gravi
tation.
    7. These convictions were stated in a short letter addressed
 (principally, however, in the language of doubt and inquiry)
 to the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
 which was published in that periodical for August 1849. I
had not then read Mitchell’s paper, nor had I studied his ar
gument; my incredulity was based on the general logical
ground that the data, as stated, do not contain the elements
 for arriving at a numerical estimate of the probabilities for or
 against such results. Having since considered the matter at

it quite necessary to recite this passage, which includes the reasoning, or
results of reasoning, to which I object; because I have been supposed to
 refuse my assent to reasonings by no means of the same class, or liable to
 the same objections as those contained in these sentences, which were
specifically quoted in my letter to the Editors of the Philosophical Maga
zine mentioned in art. 7. M. Struve and Sir John Herschel have only
 adopted and extended the conclusions implicitly received by many illus
trious predecessors, and are of course not more individually answerable for
them than they.

404 Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connerion
leisure, and studied Mitchell's arguments, I am confirmed in
my conviction of the fallacy of the numerical estimates of the
so-called proof of the physical connexion of double stars. I
also believe that the refutation of the fallacy (if such it be) is
of great importance; first, because any abuse of the mathe
matical sciences, such as to give definite demonstrations and
results where no such demonstrations and results can, in the
nature of things, be legitimately attained, tends to weaken our
confidence in mathematical conclusions generally; and se
condly, and still more strongly, because the evidence for final
causes is so peculiar, and its discussion so confessedly difficult
and delicate, that all attempts to base the proof of design on
strictly d priori and geometrical grounds, and to estimate it
numerically, should be received with scrupulous caution.
These are questions in regard to which our suspicions cannot
be too sensitively awake. The natural philosopher, in par
ticular, who must rely at every instant on the certainty of
mathematical proof, must not harbour even a doubt of its
accuracy without probing the matter to the bottom. After
doing so, should he remain unsatisfied, he must feel it a duty
to communicate to others the result at which he has arrived,
for correction, if need be, but in any case regardless of the
authority of names which may be arrayed on the other side.
    [8.] Mitchell's argument, stated in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1767, to prove the proposition that when two or
more stars appear very near one another in position they are
not merely apparently but really so, “either by an original act
of the Creator, or in consequence of some general law, such
perhaps as gravity,” is to the following effect. Let a star be
given in (apparent) position, and call it A. Let other similar
stars, B, C, D, &c., be “scattered by mere chance as it might
happen" over the heavens. “Now it is manifest,” says Mit
chell, “upon this supposition, that every star being as likely
 to be in any one situation as another, the probability that any
 one particular star should happen to be within a certain di
stance (as, for example, one degree) of any ether star would
 be represented by a fraction whose numerator would be to its
delichii)ator as a circle of one degree radius to a circle whose
 raditis is the diameter of a great circle (this last quantity being
 equal to the whole surface of the sphere), that is, about I in
 13131.” This ratio expresses the probability (according to
 Mitcheil), that i<U+017F> there were but two stars in the heavens, they
 should be found (supposing them placed “at random'') within
                          13 l 30
 1° of one another, and   | 3 || 31 will express the probability that
they shall not be so near.

     between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.              405
    9. Next suppose that there are n other stars in the same
category with the given star A, and the independent probability
that each shall not be within a degree of it to be that just found,
the probability that these n events shall concur, or that no one
star shall be within 1% of A, will be expressed by multiplying
                                                             131 30 \?
the several probabilities together, or by the number       ( 1313 1/ "
“And farther,” adds Mitchell, “ because the same event is
equally likely to happen to any one star as to any other, and
therefore any one of the whole number of stars n might as well
have been taken for the given star as any other, we must again
repeat the last found chance n times, and consequently the frac

                 will represent the probability that nowhere in the
whole heavens, any two stars amongst those in question would
be within the distance of one degree from each other; and
the complement of this quantity to unity will represent the
probability of the contrary *.”
    10. So far as I see, the first part of the argument (in § 8)
involves an error, or rather two errors in principle ; the second
part (contained in the last paragraph) an error in detail, which
vitiates the numerical results arrived at. The last, as being of
little consequence if the first be established (which would
overthrow the entire calculation), I shall refer for discussion
to a note at the end of this papert.
   11. It is evident that the argument for the physical con
nexion of double stars, derived from the Theory of Chance,
depends entirely upon our admission of the primary result,
that two given stars cannot be within one degree of one an
other without inferring a reason for it sufficiently powerful to
balance the adverse probability of 13131 to 1. All the rest
follows, or may be made to follow, as a matter of course.
    [12.] Let us look at the case straightforwardly. Suppose
two luminaries in the heavens, as two dots on a sheet of paper
of known dimensions and figure. Is it or is it not common
sense to say, that the position of one luminary or one dot being
given, the n. of “random scattering ” can assign any other
position in the field as more or less probable or improbable
for the second. If one star be in one pole of the heavens, is
the most probable position of the second in the opposite pole,
or is it 90° from it, or is it 30°, or is it in any assignalble
position whatever? I think not. Every part of the field, even
that close to the star A, is an equally probable allotment for
the star B, if we are guided by no predetermining hypothesis

406    Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connexion
or preconception whatever. Whence, then, this astounding
probability of 13130 to 1 that B shall not be within a degree
of A 2 If it express anything, what does it express?
   [13.] What the probability          #          expresses may be thus
illustrated *. Suppose it to be known that two comets exist at
once in the sky, of which one is telescopic, and its position
has not been indicated. The probability in question repre
sents the expectation which will exist in the mind of a person
possessed of this partial information, that if he takes a tele
scope with a field of 2° in diameter, and fixes the cross wires
upon the larger comet, the telescopic one shall not be some

where in the field, which includes 131 31 of the whole sphe
rical area. Mitchell’s probability is therefore a significant
number; but it belongs to an estimation of chance totally
distinct from that to which he applied it; for it is evident, on
reflection, that the ratios or probabilities of which we have
been speaking have no absolute signification with reference to
an event which has occurred, such as the distribution of stars
on the celestial sphere, or the throwing of any number of dice.
They represent only the state of ea pectation of the mind of a
person before the event has occurred, or having occurred be
fore he is informed of the result; for that can make no differ
ence on the grounds of his expectation of a given event. The
dice are thrown, the result is determined; but the expectation
of a person as to that result is unchanged until he casts his
eyes on the table, at which instant expectation, and all rea
soning founded on chance, random, hazard, or by whatever
name we choose to call it, vanishes, and Certainty takes the
place of Doubt. The possible combinations, in respect of
position, of even a limited number of stars is evidently infinite;
and it does appear to be an illegitimate application of mathe
matics to infer the antecedent probability of any one arrange
ment which experience presents us with, since but one arange
ment can exist at a time. I suspect that as we narrow the
field of speculation by withdrawing every inference from as
sumed causation, we shall have very little, if anything, to
reason about. I shall give an instance in illustration of my
meaning.
   [14] Suppose a person wholly unacquainted with the game
of chess to notice a chess-board with two or more pieces stand
ing upon it; will several pieces standing near to one another
on one part of the board give him any idea of their places being

      between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.          407
other than accidental? Will, for instance, the position of two
pieces (even if they were the only two on the board) occupy
ing adjacent squares, appear to him to be more the result of
design than if they occupied opposite corners of the board 2
I altogether disbelieve it: and I am disposed to say that even
if four, five, or more pieces stood close together, the idea would
arise in the mind that they were placed there by some localizing
cause, not because mere chance has any distributive tendency
which leads us to suspect that it has been interfered with, when
we observe a conglomeration, but from the impatience of the
mind of causeless phaenomena. And since the grouping toge
ther of pieces in one part of the board is a phaenomenon striking
to the sense and intellect, just as a uniform spacing of them
over the board would be also such a phaenomenon, the mind
hastens to conjecture some cause which may account for that
localization, not because the phanomenon rebels against the laws
of hazard, but because it affords a kind of salient point to
which the reasoning faculty may attach some threads of argu
 ment, however feebly united. Thus, from the belief of causa
tion in the abstract, some faint probability arises in the spec
tator's mind that the arrangement of the pieces in question
was not (as it might have been) purely accidental.
     [15.] But now let an experienced chess-player step in. He
 sees not merely certain pieces in certain places, but, knowing
 the rules of the game, he can say, almost at a glance, whether
 the pieces placed before him were placed by design or other
 wise, whether, in short, he sees a step of the game. If he
 does, his estimate of the grouping not being the result of
 hazard, rises to the very highest degree of probability, and
 higher in proportion to the number of the pieces and the
 critical character of the positions. Yet his    º        estimate,
 like the last, is only a relative estimate, incapable of being ex
 pressed accurately by numbers: if it were otherwise, the num
 bers could only express the impression made by the combina
 tion on his own individual mind.
    [16.] I am persuaded that the case of the stars is very similar.
 A group like the Pleiades attracts notice. It is a phaenomenon.
 The mind hastens to attempt to assign by induction a cause
 for it. The symmetry of certain nebulous and multiple stars
 has a similar effect on the reasoning faculty. A star, for ex
 ample, exactly in the centre of a nebulous mass nearly circular,
 has a position neither more nor less probable than any other
 position within or without the nebula. It is the inductive bias
 of every rational mind which thrusts into our reasonings the
 notion of cause, and forbids us to think that accident might
 have placed it there as well as anywhere else. A happy and

408     Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connevion
just propensity of man’s mind it is to reason thus; but the
science of numbers refuses its aid to estimate the arithmetical
force of such arguments.
    [17.] The impression of design deduced from symmetry is one
of the most striking which it is possible to suppose; and yet, as
far as I know, it is impossible to represent the improbability that
it should be the result of chance. In fact, a symmetrical arrange
ment, so far from being an improbable one, would, if Mitchell’s
argument were founded in reason, appear the most conform
able to that most hazardous of the laws of hazard, the law of
sufficient reason. This I shall endeavour presently to illustrate
further. Meanwhile I observe that a symmetrical arrange
 ment of points placed “at random,” being one of many random
 ways of placing those points, all equally probable, would ap
pear to have neither preference nor the contrary on the doc
trines of chance”. And here we also notice the important
distinction already referred to, between an accomplished fact
and an event which is anticipated, though there would be
millions or even infinity to one against the probability of a
symmetrical arrangement;-once made, it takes a position (by
the laws of mere chance) as a result as probable as any other
 arrangement which might have presented itself. But the eye
 of reason can never acquiesce in this conclusion, from the
 simple consideration of antecedent probabilities. TWere the
 stars (for example) disposed in square or hexagonal order over
 the entire sky, could we for a moment tolerate the conception
 of a “random scattering,” which (at first sight) appears con
 sistent enough with their actual distribution; and does not
 the occurrence of condensed groups or pairs of stars in some
 places, and of great vacuities in others, seem to be rather the
 rule of chance than its exception ?
    [18.] It is not many years since the idea of the foot-prints of
 animals, which walked over the then soft surfaces of the older
 rocks ages before man's creation, being yet in evidence, was
 scouted as absurd: and it might have been so still had the
 proof been to be sought solely in the clearness of the foot
 prints being those of an animal, differing as they no doubt
 did from those of any species now existing. But the symmetry

with which the prints succeeded one another on the surfaces
of the sandstone, reproducing group after group of steps in
two rows marked by the irregularity of interval characterizing
the motion of quadrupeds, furnished an argument, geome
trical no doubt, but incapable of numerical definition, which,
when combined with the likeness of the individual marks to the
foot-prints of certain animals, raised the evidence to the
amount producing conviction.
    19. The arguments and illustrations now adduced to in
validate the conclusion of Mitchell and his followers, that it
is possible to assign numerical probabilities for or against the
present distribution of the stars, or of any part of them, or even
of two or three individual stars especially selected, may I think
be reduced to the shape of two main objections to the principle
and its primary results, either of which would, I conceive, be
fatal to Mitchell’s conclusions.       I shall state them in the order
in which they appear most likely to be at once assented to... I
 shall first state the objection to the application made of the
principle of “random scattering;” I shall next state an objec
 tion to the fundamental definition or implied axiom on which
 the whole argument is based.
    20. FIRST OBJEction.—The doubt existing in the mind of
 a reasonable person, whether an event still future, and which
may happen many ways, shall occur in a particular given way, is
 erroneously considered as equivalent to an inherent improbabi
 lity of its happening, or having happened, in that way.
    21. Thus, 10,000 balls numbered consecutively being
 placed in a bag, the antecedent chance or expectation of draw
                                 l
 ing a given number is 10000 ; but it is not the less necessary
 that a specific number be drawn. It was 9999 to 1 that the
 number 65 (suppose) should not be drawn; but 65 being de
Jacto the number drawn, every vestige of improbability con
 cerning it vanishes. Has not every fall of two common dice
 an antecedent probability of 17 to 1 against it if the numbers
 turned up be different”, and 35 to 1 if they be doublets? But
 have these probabilities any longer a meaning after the dies
 are cast and the numbers read 2           We then see one individual
 result neither more nor less likely in itself to happen than any
 other individual result. Now, to apply this to the case of
 double stars, we must take an illustration already made use off
    * For out of thirty-six possible cases, two cases satisfy the condition;
 for instance, three shown by the 1st die and five by the 2nd; or else five
 by the lst and three by the 2nd; in the case of doublets the throw of each
 die is specifically determined.
    t See note A.

410     Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connevion
as conformable to Mitchell’s fundamental supposition. To
express the antecedent improbability (which Mitchell con
founds with an inherent improbability) of two stars falling
within 1° of each other, or what is the same thing, of a star
falling within a circle 2° in diameter described round the
position of any other star as a centre, it is shown in Note A
at the end of this paper, that we may imagine as many dice to
be thrown at once as there are stars to be considered, and
each die to have as many faces as there exist spaces 2° in dia
meter in the whole heavens (which is 13131), then the occur
rence of any doublet in such a throw of dice is equivalent to
the duplication of any star by another within 19 of it; and
the chance against the occurrence of doublets is (on Mitchell's
theory) the chance against the duplication of any star. The
chance of throwing a doublet with 100 dice may thus be shown
to be about     #.     If there were only two dice the chance would
be just   Hist the reciprocal of the number of faces on each *.
 But though there are 13131 different throws for one which is
a doublet, there is no more improbability in that than in any
other given throw, and therefore, although the appearance of
a series of doublets produce a reasonable suspicion of an in
terfering cause, the grounds of that suspicion can by no means
 be expressed by the numerical antecedent improbability of the
event.                                                                   -
    22. A little consideration will show that no event, tolerably
 complex (such as the distribution of stars, supposed by chance,
or the fall of many dice at once), can occur without the
chances, reckoned on the principle of expectation, being per
 fectly enormous against it, and giving to it the air of an extra
 vagant d priori improbability. The improbability, for in
 stance, of a given deal producing a given hand at whist is so
 immense, that were we to assume *... principle, we
 should be compelled to assign it as the result of an active
 cause with far more probability than even that found by him
for the physical connexion of the six stars of the Pleiades.
    23. A natural but very important error has been made in
 the use of the term “most probable result.” A result which,
 on the long run of many trials made under the same circum
 stances, may be expected to occur oftenest, is truly called the
    * Thus with common dice, having six faces, the number of ways the dice
 may fall is thirty-six; but six cases give doublets; the chance of throwing
 doublets is therefore evidently  k

    between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.               411
most probable result; and yet the improbability of that result
(though less improbable than any other given result) may
be very great. At the game of whist the most probable result
is, that each player should have as nearly as possible an equal
number of cards of each suit in his hand; and if the cards
admitted of equal subdivision, an evactly equal number: yet
such a result is manifestly most improbable. Its very occur
rence in all the four hands would provoke the suspicion of an
interference with the common course of chance, at least as
much as (let us say) the total absence of one suit in one hand
would do. If we then were witnesses of only a single game,
how preposterous would be the idea of subtracting the num
bers of any suit in any hand from the “most probable num
bers,” and declaring that the difference is a proof that the deal
has not been fair | *
    24. I have thought it worth while to test a little by simple
 experiment the differences to which “mere chance” gives
 rise in the grouping of bodies dispersed over a surface, by a
 method of “random scattering” which I conceive to be as
 nearly as possible analogous to Mitchell’s idea of chance as
 affecting the placing of the stars. I had referred in my letter
 in the Philosophical Magazine to the pretty fact noticed by
 Mr. James Naysmith, that the sparkings of a brush loaded
 with white paint produced a distribution of spots on a dark
 ground which represented exceedingly well the general aspect
 of the grouping of the stars, including many double and mul
 tiple specks; and I quoted this partly as an illustration, and
 partly as an argument against the assumed improbability of
 producing such combinations by chance. The experiment
 having been objected to as not free from causes of doubt, I
 have made some trials in the following way. I placed a chess
 board, having, as usual, sixty-four squares, on the floor, and
  I provided a large sieve into which I put a quantity of grains
  of rice, which did not fall through the sieve until it was some
  what shaken. I then shook the sieve at a considerable height
 above the chess-board until it was pretty well scattered over
  with grains. And the “random scattering” of these grains
  was much increased by the circumstance, that the board was
  so elastic that every one of the grains rebounded from the
  surface and fell once or oftener, so that their mutual posi
 tions were thus as much as possible interchanged.
     25. The following diagrams contain the results of five expe
  riments, the number of grains which fell on each of the sixty
 four squares being counted and registered. Only these five
 experiments were made; none have been rejected.
    * Such an argument has actually been used to prove the physical con
 nexion of double stars.

   26. Observations on the preceding experiments.
   (1.) I will first of all remark, that though the idea was to
hold the sieve in such a manner as to bear uniformly over the
whole board, there appears in most of the experiments a slight
tendency to greater concentration towards the centre, as is
shown by the horizontal and vertical summations which I have
added. This might have been probably corrected by such an
alteration as filling the sieve more completely; but an exami
nation of the contents of the squares, and the irregularities
marked by contiguous squares, show that this cause has but
slightly operated in producing the observed inequalities of
distribution. I conceive, then, that under the given conditions

   between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.           415
of scattering, the inequalities of dispersion from one square to
another due to “accident” are well represented, and can be
ascribed to no assignable “cause.”
   (2.) In these experiments we observe that the most loaded
squares contain from nearly two to more than four times the
average number of grains, whilst in four out of five experi
ments one or more squares were vacant.
    (3.) It is quite certain that, had the spaces been smaller
and more numerous, the inequalities would have been still
greater; for in this form of experiment extent of surface has
an equalizing tendency.
    (4.) In all the experiments we observe squares having
heavy and light loads very much intermixed. In three cases
out of five the heaviest squares are adjacent to others alto
gether blank.
    (5.) If we were to take any one of these experiments, and
 attempt to calculate the antecedent probability of the grains
 so arranging themselves on Mitchell's supposition, we should
 unquestionably find numerical chances far greater against these
 configurations being the result of accident, than those on which
 we are told that we form our most certain ordinary judge
 ments. Thus if an experimental argument may be admitted,
 the reasoning of Mitchell and his followers is altogether fal
 lacious; for we find that it would lead to results extravagantly
 absurd in cases admitting of no doubt.
    27. It will perhaps be said, that though Mitchell’s reason
 ing was wrong, and his calculations of the chances adverse to
 any particular arrangement of the stars altogether false and
 exaggerated, the doctrine of probabilities has other and spe
 cial methods applicable to such cases as experiment has here
 been employed to illustrate. If it be so, they have never been
 applied to the astronomical question before us, the question
 whether the double stars are so “optically” or “physically;”
 and consequently we are not required to refute investigations
 which have never been made. The argument which has been
 now used appears to be sufficient to prove that Mitchell's
 attempt to express the numerical probability of a causal con
 nexion between the pairs of double stars is a complete failure.
 I think, too, that I have demonstrated that the presumption
 for such a connexion, which unquestionably arises when the
 number of close double stars is considerable, arises in the
 mind in the same way as the belief in the physical connexion
 of many phaenomena of nature which can only be treated in
 ductively, and whose ultimate probability is altogether inca
 pable of estimation by numbers. I might therefore close my
 paper here. But I do not think it right to omit a conside

  416     Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connexion
  ration which seems to me not unimportant with reference to
 the theory of causation treated by the doctrine of chances,
 though less obvious, and therefore perhaps less easily assented
 to at first sight, than the objection already made. It aims at
 showing that Mitchell's axiom or postulate is inconsistent with
 any idea which we can form of a “random scattering.” As
 it is difficult to state what these words really mean, we shall
 frame our objection so as to rest entirely upon what they ob
 viously do not mean.
    28. SEcond OBJECTION.—To assume that “every star is as
 likely, not hypothetically, but actually, to be in one situation as
 another” leads to conclusions obviously at variance with the idea
 of random or lawless distribution, and is therefore not the ea
pression of that Idea.
    29. Let me first quote the words in which Mitchell states
 the principle of his argument (which principle has certainly
 been accepted down to this time). “Let us examine,” he says,
 “what would have been the least apparent distance of any two
 or more stars, anywhere in the whole heavens, upon the sup
 position that they had been scattered by mere chance, as it
 might happen. Now it is manifest, upon this supposition, that
 every star being as likely to be in any one situation as another,
the probability that any one particular star should happen to
be within a certain distance (as, for example, one degree) of
any other,” and so forth, as quoted in § 8. I think that it is
impossible to doubt that Mitchell meant to say, that the equa
lity of chance referred to exists in the nature of things, in the
same sense exactly as we admit an actual equality of chance
that any one side of a well-poised die shall turn up, as well
as a hypothetical equality of chance that a given side shall
turn up independently of our knowledge of whether the die
be loaded or no. In treating of our first objection, we have
shown that Mitchell and his followers have confounded the
measure of hypothetical antecedent probability of a given re
sult with a probability in the nature of things, or an actual
probability, and have used the measure of the former (which
we admit may be found correctly) for the measure of the latter,
The Idea from which Mitchell starts is “scattering by mere
chance,” the application of the idea to the special case is
“that every star is as likely to be in any one situation as an
other.” The two things are assumed to be equivalent, the
effect of the one supposition is the same as the effect of the
other, and either is to be compared with the effect observed;
and the probability or improbability of the Idea is to be thus
tested.     I believe that Mitchell held, and that most of those
who have followed him hold this to be the true basis of the

      between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.                   417
  argument; since a hypothetical probability or ea<U+017F>pectation,
 based on ignorance, and failing the moment that it is con
 fronted with a fact, can hardly be seriously claimed as a source
 of Knowledge. Let us see, then, to what this definition of
 “scattering by mere chance as it may happen” must neces
 sarily lead.
     30. It appears from the reasoning already cited from Mit
 chell’s paper, that, however numerous may be the stars in
 cluded by the terms of the problem, the approximation of any
 two of them within a certain distance of one another, affords
 a presumption which increases in force without limit as the di
 stance diminishes”, that such an approximation has been the
 result of a specific cause, and is not casual, a result surely inad
 missible. The argument therefore for the physical duplicity of
 two stars, because their apparent distance is less than a given
 number of degrees or minutes, shows that there must be a limit
 to the argument, or a certain distance at which no such conclu
 sion would be deducible.         If no one star deviated from the ave
 rage distance which each star in the heavens may have from its
 neighbours, no argument could be drawn one way or other for
 the physical connexion of two stars, since there is nothing in re
 spect of juxtaposition to distinguish these two stars from the en
 tire mass of stars which we suppose to be spaced in a perfectly
 uniform manner. Let us conceive the stars to be in fact quite
 symmetrically distributed over the sky. Mitchell’s argument
 for duplicity is derived from comparative smallness of angular
distance; but if the angular distance of each star from its
neighbours be throughout the same, no argument can be
 applied to one star which will not be equally applicable to
 every other, and consequently the numerical argument for
physical connexion or prevailing cause will cease the moment
that a distribution perfectly symmetrical is supposed, a result
too absurd to require refutation.
     [31.] It is in reality explicitly assumed as the basis of the
argument, that by the law of mere chance, scattering as it
might happen, the chance of finding one star in a given space
is proportional exactly to the space included in the imaginary
limit. When there are many stars in question, the chance of
finding each one in a given space is still stated to be as the
space considered, and it is stated as an improbability that two
stars should be found crowded into one space, or three stars
into two spaces, or four stars into three spaces, and so forth.
Thus our random law appears to indicate a preference for
    * For, as the area which includes the two stars diminishes, the fraction
in    8, which expresses the improbability of their both being contained in
it, approaches indefinitely nearer to unity.

equal spacing, since unequal spacing corresponds to a dimi
nished probability of occurrence.
    32. For further illustration of Mitchell’s principle, let the
heavens be divided into p equal areas, and let the fall of a die
having p sides indicate the allotments into which a given star
is expected to fall “at random,” there being as many dice
to throw as there are stars to distribute, then the question
resolves itself into this:—“Of all GIVEN possible distribu
tions to assign that in favour of which the d priori proba
bility is greatest.” I answer, that a UNIForM (and therefore
generally symmetrical) distribution is more probable than
any other given (i. e. observed) distribution. For, to recur
to the case of the dice, let there be 100 dice, each having
100 faces inscribed with the uniform series 1 .... 100.                      It is
no doubt very improbable, d priori, that the 100 dice thrown
at random shall turn up exactly the arithmetical series 1... 100;
but it is at least twice as probable as any other DEFINITE sup
position of distribution of numbers that can be made;—as for
instance that the number 100 should be wanting, and that
there should be two 99's. And the proof of this is sufficiently
simple; the reason is the same as that there is a less chance of
throwing given doublets than a given pair of numbers not alike,
 as A, B.      For there are two combinations, A, B, and B, A,
in favour of the latter event, but only a simple combination,
as A A, in favour of the former *.                 Now the case of the 100
dice showing 100 consecutive numbers, represents the case of
 100 stars, one of each of which falls into each of 100 different
allotments into which the sky may be divided. And this is
evidently a symmetrical distribution, or the nearest approach
to symmetry which is geometrically possible. Hence, if Mit
chell’s rules of reasoning be applicable in this case, the proba
bility is greater for a distribution of the stars having occurred
 “by mere chance, as it might happen,” if such distribution
 were (as an observed fact) mathematically symmetrical, than
if any given deviation from symmetry were observed in nature.
 I think that it cannot be necessary to insist upon the error of
 a conclusion so repugnant to common senset.
    * See note B.
    # When I stated this result as that at which I had arrived in disproof of
 Mitchell’s theory, at the Meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh,
 an able mathematician present entered into a calculation to show that the
 uniformity of distribution of bodies falling at random would not be the most
 probable result. Now the truth or error of his conclusion depends upon
 the use of the words “most probable.” If by “most probable” we mean
 that a uniform distribution, or (as in the case we have taken to refer to) the
 turning up of all possible faces of the dice, is meant, the probability in favour
 of it compared to all other possible cases taken together, which might occur,

    between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.                     419
   33. Assuming that this conclusion will not be contested,—
that geometrical symmetry will never be accepted by a rea
sonable man as a proof that hazard has prevailed instead of
design, “accident” against “cause,”—we are necessarily led to
infer that the vague premiss of “scattering by mere chance as
it may happen,” includes, as an essential conception, a sphere
of possibilities wider than that of throwing dice in the manner
supposed; and though we may be at first sight reluctant to
admit this, I conceive that the reductio ad absurdum proves
the necessity of it, and I shall endeavour to explain the kind
of enlargement of the notion of chance or random which I
conceive will meet the case.
   34. It is plain from Art. 32, that there does exist an actual
probability of symmetry when the chance of a given fall of
dice is considered against the chances of any other given fall.
But there is something assumed as previously known or tried.
That something is the perfect indifference of the dice. This
may be either assumed as a fact—suppose upon the informa
tion of the maker—or it may be ascertained by experiment.
In the latter case it can only be known by the long run of a
vast number of trials, proving that all faces turn up indiffer
ently in the long run. But in the case of the stars we have
witnessed no such series of experiments. The actual proba
bility of the number of the stars being as the area considered,
is here equivalent to the equality of balance of the dice in the
last problem. Neither dare be assumed where the premisses
are utterly vague. The result of many trials in the one case
would be the tendency of all the numbers on the dice to turn
up equally; in the other, the equality of interspacing of stars;
each a most unlikely event, considered as a solitary result, yet
my mathematical friend was undoubtedly quite right. But if it mean the
probability of the given symmetrical result, compared to the probability of
some other given result not symmetrical, I hope to have shown that he is as
certainly in the wrong. Now it is with a case in esse, an event which has
occurred, not with a case in posse, an event which may or may not occur,
with the previous probability for which we are here concerned. To take
a very simple illustration. The chance of throwing heads and tails being
reckoned to be precisely equal, it is yet absolutely very unlikely as a predi
cable result that on 1000 throws there should be exactly 500 heads and
500 tails. We know in fact that there are almost forty chances to one, that
some one of the other possible events shall happen instead of the required
one (Galloway on Probability, p. 134); but if we had seen the experiment
tried, and had seen 499 heads and 501 tails as the result, the individual re
sult of absolute equality is more probable (upon obvious grounds) than
the individual result that there should be any given discordance; for the
fact that such a preponderance of probability for heads or for tails existed,
would be tantamount to an assertion that the chance was not indifferent,
but that the coin had really a bias, which is contrary to the hypothesis.

420 Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connerion
in the nature of things more likely than any other event which
could come singly under our notice. If we could form an idea
of utter confusion or material chaos, it would not surely be of
anything in which uniformity would have a conspicuous share;
it would rather be the most heterogeneous variety in number
and paucity, bulk and figure, density and rarity. It appears
to me to be as arbitrary to assume this uniformity or want of
bias, as it would be in attempting to reason about the proper
ties of a mass whose figure is unknown, that it must be a
sphere, because, in our ignorance of how it was formed, we
can assign no reason why one of its diameters should be
greater or less than another.         -                              -    ?
   35. How then are we to enlarge the idea of “random” so
as to meet the case? We must suppose that the dice have
been formed out of non-homogeneous matter; that they are
biassed in every possible way; that out of a great number of
sets of such dice we are shown the result       j'.     fall of one
set only. Here we have no ultimate or ideal distributive
tendency of chance to look to, because the result to which
many experiments with one set of dice would tend, would not
be that of uniformity. The bias is unknown; it is itself a con
dition of “chance” of a higher order.                        . ..    .   ;
   36. Yet notwithstanding, with such dice two consequences
follow. (1.) The final result of many throws, each with                 a
different set of such biassed dice, would tend to uniformity,
because the chance of the bias would ultimately run through.
all the possible cases. (2.) The expectation, or hypothetical
probability of a given number turning up at any throw, would
be exactly the same as if the dice were known to be un
biassed.                                      *  *    *    *     * *   * **
   37. In like manner the experiments with the sieve droppin
grains of rice in § 25 can only be considered as in a very limite
degree the representation of the phaenomenon of “random scat
tering,” though they approach as nearly to Mitchell's theory as
any experiment which I can imagine; and therefore it is a case
which serves well to discriminate between the two wholly di
stinct objections which I have attempted to establish against
this application of the theory of probabilities to the distribution.
of the stars. The first objection (Art. 20) would     º to the
results of that experiment treated by Mitchell’s method (as has
been explained in its proper place). The second objection,
(Art. 28) does not apply, because the action of the sieve is not
“random scattering” in the extreme sense in which our utter
ignorance of causation would require it to be represented. It
is only random in respect of subordinate distribution, the me
chanical arrangement is such as to produce a clear and well.

       between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.                     421
  defined tendency to ultimate uniformity. The large dimen
  sions of the sieve, the symmetry of its pattern, and its position
- verically above the chºboard, are the conditions of this ap
    roximate uniformity of distribution, and they are evidently
    r from casual circumstances. To generalize the experiment
  with the sieve, we must imagine a great number of sieves
  pierced with holes in every conceivable variety of pattern, one
  of which has been selected at random for a given experi
  ment. By these considerations I believe that the ordinary
  axioms of probability are not interfered with, but that the
  problem of the distribution of stars “by chance as it may
  happen’ receives as definite an illustration as so vague an
  assumption admits of, and is shown to be incompatible with
  the axiom that “each star is as likely [not hypothetically, but
  actually] to be in one situation as another.” This would only
  be true on the almost infinitely improbable supposition of a set
  of dice, not so formed expressly, being each and all perfectly
  homogeneous and unbiassed. . .                          -

  *(1.) The fundamental principle of Mitchell is erroneous.
  The probability expressed by it is an altogether different pro
  bability from what lie asserts.          His calculations are also ap
  parent y inaccurate, in some instances at leastt.
      (2.) All the numerical deductions of his successors are
  equally baseless. . .             . . . .
      (3.) Were Mitchell’s principle just, a perfectly uniform
  and symmetrical disposition of the stars over the sky would
  (if possible) be that which could alone afford no evidence of
  causation, or any interference with the laws of “random ;”—
  a result palpably absurd.
      (4.) Special collocations, whether (a) distinguished by their
  symmetry, or (8) distinguished by an excessive crowding to
  gether of stars, or the reverse, inevitably force on the reason
  ing mind a more or less vague impression of causation;–an
  impression necessarily vague, having nothing absolute, but
  depending on the previous knowledge and habits of thought
  of the individual, therefore incapable of being made the subject
  of exact [i. e. mathematical] reasoning.
    * (5.) The form of error into which those have been led who
  had stated numerical probabilities against given arrangements
  of stars being the result of accident, is two-fold. First, a con

        It would probably be more correct to say that all Mitchell's calculations
   are wrongly deduced from his own premisses.

422 Prof. Forbes on the evidence for a Physical Connewion
fusion between the ea<U+017F>pectation of a given event in the mind of
a person speculating about its occurrence, and an inherent im
probability of an event happening in one particular way when
there are many ways equally possible. Secondly, a too limited
and arbitrary conception of the utterly vague premiss of stars
being “scattered by mere chance, as it might happen;”—a
statement void of any condition whatever.
    39. Having thus stated broadly the errors of deductive
reasoning (as I conceive them to be) to which the sanction of
many eminent authorities has been given, I would guard
myself, once more, in conclusion, from being supposed to
 doubt either the fact of the physical connexion of double stars
generally, or to deny that Mitchell was right in suspecting
 that fact from the mere circumstance of the proximity of two
 stars observed in so many cases. This was, on his part, no
 more than the first stage of an induction (the nature of which
is now so well understood by all students of physical science),
 being a mere collecting and arranging of a certain class of
 facts, and assuming the probability of a common cause to be
 afterwards investigated. Mitchell’s appeal to the mathematical
 theory of probabilities was a false step, tending to weaken not
 confirm his argument. Still less do I object to the inference
 drawn by some of Mitchell’s distinguished successors in favour
 of the physical connexion of binary stars from the following
 fact, viz. that if we arrange such stars in groups, each of which
 includes double stars whose angular distance is between cer
 tain limits, as for instance from 0" to 4", 4" to 8", 8" to 16", &c.,
 the class of close stars is actually far more numerous than
 those contained within wider limits, and which we might there
 fore fancy ought to be of more frequent occurrence. This is
 a very curious and a very striking fact, and carries the process
 of induction one step higher than it was carried by Mitchell.
 It shows a greater frequency of occurrence for small distances,
 and furnishes something like a law connecting those two
 things, the fact of duplication and the angular distance. Such
 an empirical law, if well supported by facts, is undoubtedly a
 good inductive argument. We are brought nearer to the
 conception of a cause by this observation, and our conviction
 is complete when we observe one such star revolving round
 another with a clear orbital relation.
    40. I should hardly have thought it necessary to state so
 much, had not my views been strangely misunderstood, par
 ticularly by an ingenious writer in the Edinburgh Review”,
                    * Edinburgh Review, July 1850.

    between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.         423
who has represented me as making averments altogether
foreign to my thoughts, and has quite overlooked the pre
cise objections contained in my letter printed in the Philo
sophical Magazine, and the precise statements quoted from
Herschel’s Astronomy, which I have again cited in § 5
of this paper. The reviewer charges me with “a singular
misconception of the true incidence of the argument from pro
bability.” I can only say that my error, if such it be, is one
sanctioned by Sir John Herschel, to whom I referred as my
authority; for in his “Outlines” he states Mitchell's argu
ment from the Pleiades, and Struve's arguments against the
chance combination of a solitary double, or treble star, as I
have shown in the text, but makes no mention, so far as I
have been able to discover, of a generalized argument from
the number of double stars in the different classes, depending
upon the disproportionate number of close double stars to those
wider apart; and either to understand or express that argument
aright, it would be an insult to common sense to invoke the aid
of the theory of probabilities; being neither more nor less than
this, that the occurrence of double stars increases exceedingly
much slower than the area of space including two members of
the same pair. I never found fault with this argument: it is an
argument good as an induction, but nothing more; the argument
complained of by me was this, “that the odds are 9570 to 1
against any two stars falling within 4" of each other, and the
odds against any two such stars fortuitously falling within 32"
of a third is not less than 173,524 to 1;” and Sir John Her
schel's inference from these premisses, and these alone, “the
conclusion of a physical connexion of some kind or other is
THEREFor E unavoidable.” The reviewer ignores these state
 ments, joins issue on a point never before brought into the con
 troversy, and silences objection by the general assertion that if
 this case be given up “there remains no possibility of applying
 the theory of probabilities to any registered fact whatever,”—
 a conclusion which of course I dispute as simply an assump
 tion of the point in debate.
    41. I am sorry to have to allude even thus briefly to the
 controversial article in the Edinburgh Review; but it has
 been brought under my notice in a manner so authoritative
 that I could not overlook it; although, as an argument, it ap
 pears to me to be destitute of weight, and in fact to proceed
 on a misapprehension. To criticize it minutely would not
 only prolong this paper beyond due limits, but would involve
 me in the invidious, and by me unsought task of dwelling on
 other mistakes of eminent authors connected with the subject
 of these pages. The principle of Mitchell is, evidently, that

424      Prof. Porbes on the evidence for a Physical Connétion
sanctioned and adopted by all succeeding writers on this par
ticular application of the doctrine of chances”. I have pur
posely avoided citing the names of many of these writers, and
the passages in their works where Mitchell's results are incor
porated, and his method of research applauded, although I
could have made a list both numerous and distinguished. It
 was necessary for me however to show how far that principle
 was pushed by living writers of eminence, thus becoming more
widely spread and perpetuated. The necessity of such a de
finite citation has become evident from the misapprehensions
to which I have been exposed. If Mitchell’s deductions had
remained buried in the heavy quartos of the Philosophical
Transactions, I should not have thought that the refutation of
them was so important.

 signing the probability 13131 for not finding one out of n
stars within a distance of 1° of a given star, I conceive that he
is wrong in raising that quantity again to the nth power in order
to include all the equal chances which exist in favour of B,
 C, D being duplicated equally with the given star A. For
though the probability of a compound event is measured by the
product of the several probabilities of the independent events
which must concur to produce it, the several probabilities with
reference to the different stars cannot be considered as alto
gether independent. The duplication of A by B, and of B
by A, which constitute one event, are counted separately;
and again, the probability of the duplication of the star A by
the star B, and that of the star C by the star B (which are
two independent events), are not independent of the duplica
tion of C by A.
   * The Edinburgh Reviewer thus explicitly adopts Mitchell’s principle of
reasoning refuted by our “First Objection.” “As probability is the mu
merical measure of our expectation that an event will happen, so it is also
that of ourbelief that it has happened, or that any proposed proposition is true.
Expectation is merely a belief in the future, and differs in no way so far as
the measure of its degree is concerned from that in the past.”—Ed. Rev.
July 1850, p. 7. I do not of course mean to say that all writers on Pro
bability have adopted Mitchell's argument, although none that I know of
condemn it. I must however cite Mr. Leslie Ellis's paper in the Cambridge
Transactions (vol. viii. part 1), as containing a bold and clear exposure of
the errors sanctioned by many eminent philosophers on questions of chance,
—errors a good deal allied to that which we have here discussed.

    between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups.         4.25
   The case may be illustrated by a reference to one of those
games of chance which serve best to fix the ideas as to every
kind of hazard, adopting of course Mitchell's opinions on the
mode of conceiving the fundamental question. Let there be
as many dice as stars, and let n be that number. Let each
die have p sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, &c. I say that the chance
of doublets occurring amongst the n dice thrown at once is
the same as that of two stars being found at a less distance
than the radius of a small circle of the sphere which includes
          1             -
an area ºth of the entire surface of the sphere. For take any
star, and describe round it as a centre the small circle which
-          1                -                                 -
includes ºth of the spherical surface, a second star falling
within this circle will constitute it a double star; and the
chance against its doing so is evidently p to 1, or the chance
of not throwing doublets with two dice having p sides. But
there are n stars altogether, and each may duplicate the other
under like conditions, so that the probability of the occurrence
of a doublet amongst n dice is the same as the chance that
two of n stars shall duplicate one another, or shall be included
in a circle 1° in diameter; the occurrence of a triplet repre
sents three stars being within distance of one another, and so
forth.
   Having myself no aptitude or practice in calculating chances,
and knowing the oversights sometimes made in such cases
even by persons who have been considered as authorities on
the subject, I requested a mathematical friend, whose skill
in these matters gives the utmost attainable assurance of his
accuracy, to solve this and some other questions to which I
shall have occasion to refer. He kindly complied with my
request, and has given me the following solution.
   The number of arrangements which the n dice can form
without duplication is the same as the number of permutations
of p things taken n together, or
                p(p–1)(p–2). ... (p-n + 1);
also the total number of falls is p".  Consequently the chance
of a fall without duplication is
                      p(p– 1)...(p-n
                               p”      + 1) e
And the chance that two or more of the dice show the same
face is
                   1—  p(p-1).... (p-n + 1)

   We may apply this theorem to Mitchell's case of the star
£8 Capricorni, which consists (he states) of two stars within 3}
minutes of one another, and there are in the sky 230 stars of
similar brightness. Now the area of a space 34' radius is
4254603 less than the area of the entire sphere. Hence
p=4254603 and n=230. The value of the above expression,
carefully calculated by the aid of Stirling's theorem.*, gives the
chance for the proximity in question =-00617, or about               <U+017F>º
Mitchell finds it; (Phil Trans. lvi. p. 246). The proce.
dure of Mitchell where several stars are concerned—for in
stance the Pleiades—seems to me to be still more deficient in
evidence; and, in fact, I find from my mathematical friend,
that when the question is as to the chance of several such dice
showing at once the same face, the problem rises to an exces
sive degree of complication. I conclude, therefore, that the
probability of 500,000 to 1 against the fortuitous concourse of
the Pleiades is, even granting all the premisses, erroneously
calculated.
                               Note B.
   In the first supposed case, the probability of the compound
event of 100 dice turning up all the running numbers 1... 100
may be conceived to be the product of the independent proba
bilities of 98 out of the 100 dice showing the numbers 1 ... 98,
or any other different numbers which are predetermined (we
will call the probability of this #). and of the two remaining
dice (having 100 faces each) showing the two faces 99 and
100, or the two remaining numbers. As this latter event may
happen two ways, the probability of it is

    In finally sending this paper to the press, after several mo
difications and additions, I may be permitted to express a
hope that its arguments may be weighed with deliberation,
and that first impressions, however strong, of a contrary ten
dency may be distrusted. The extreme generality of the con
siderations which enter into the discussion renders it difficult
to lay down propositions sufficiently large to include them,
and yet free from the risk of error through that very gene
rality. I would therefore invite attention to the particular
conclusions which I negative, and which must be maintained,
I conceive, by any one who is disposed to adopt the views of
Mitchell and his followers —(1.) That there is any calculable
probability, such as 9570 to 1, against the observed occurrence
of 2 stars out of more than 10,000, within 4" of one another,
having been fortuitous (Arts. 5, 40). (2.) That the fact of two
stars being seen within an infinitely small distance of each
other, amounts to a mathematical proof of the certainty of
their being physically connected (Art. 30). (3.) That were
the stars uniformly spaced over the heavens or arranged with
perfect symmetry, no argument could be alleged against such
arrangement being the result of chance, but any deviation
from symmetry would raise such an argument (Arts. 30, 31, 32).
    I have now devoted a great deal of time and attention to
the consideration of this subject. I have profited too by the
kind criticisms of several friends, to whom I submitted the
argument. I do not think that my opinions are likely to
change; and other engagements now require all my attention.
 Should this paper call forth any controversial remarks, I hope
 I may be excused (for the present at least) from entering fur
ther into the discussion without the imputation of want of
courtesy. Silence, instead of implying consent, ought in such
a case to signify the reverse; for, should I be satisfied that
 I am wrong in any point, I should in that case feel it a
duty to acknowledge it.

        GENTLEMEN,                                Derby, April 9, 1850.
 Tº         following short description of a new electrical ma-.
        chine may not be uninteresting to some of your readers.
     The highly electric properties of gutta percha have been
 commented upon by Dr. Faraday; but I believe it is not
 generally known that this material affords the means of pro
 ducing in a very simple manner an amount of electricity as
 great as that of the common electrical machine.º. º.                           3
     There is a description of gutta percha sold which is thinner
 than common paper, about three feet wide, and in long lengths.
 If a sheet of this substance, of about four or five feet superficial.
 area, be laid on a surface or held against the wall of a room.
 and rubbed with the hand or a silk handkerchief, and then
 carefully removed by the extreme edges, and held suspended
 in the air, it will give off a brush-like spark of several inches

     A similar effect may be produced by causing the sheet of
 gutta percha to be passed once over one, or between two rub
 bing surfaces; but in order to obtain the best effect, certain
 conditions appear necessary, which I will here only describe,
as I have found them, without occupying space in your valu-º
able Journal to enter into the cause of the effects produced.

if it be brought toasmaller

electricity excited is not so great ; but a still greater effect is
produced if another rubber be applied outside the gutta percha
at d, and if the surface of ab and the cushion R be of silk
or horsehair, and the pressure and speed of rubbing mode

        Mr. W. H. Barlow on a new Electrical Machine.            429
that they might be employed in producing an electrical ma

a machine constructed                          Fig. 2

ties at an angle of about 20°. When the handle of the ma
chine is turned, causing the gutta percha band to pass at a
moderate velocity in the direction denoted by the arrow, elec
tricity is given off at P, about three or four inches below the
cushions; and if a conductor, be applied, as shown in the

     The quantity of electricity developed increases with the sur

small a band, it is evident that considerable power might be
obtained by a more extended application of this material.
     I observed that gutta percha may be excited both positively
and negatively.
    If a strip about two feet long and two inches wide be laid
on a surface and rubbed, the two extremities when suspended
in the air repel each other, and the electricity developed is
that termed “resinous.” But if the strip of gutta percha be
folded double and rubbed, the upper side exhibits “resinous,”
and the lower side “vitreous” electricity, and the two extre
mities attract each other.           -

     P.S. Since writing the above, John Westmoreland, one of
the workmen in the establishment of Mr. Davis, optician, at

430      Mr. W. Ferguson on the occurrence of Chalk Flints
Derby (where the apparatus above described was made), has
constructed a gutta percha electrical machine, similar in prin
ciple, but with several improvements.
   In this machine a thicker description of gutta percha band
is employed. The upper and lower rollers are of equal dia
meter; and the rubbers, which are brushes of bristles, four in
number, are placed outside the band and opposite to the axis
of each roller.
   A double conductor connected by a curved brass rod pass
ing over the top of the machine is applied, similar in form to
the conductor of the plate-glass machines; and there is an
ingenious tightening apparatus, to correct the expansion and
contraction of the gutta percha band.
   The machine is exceedingly handsome in appearance; and
the employment of the thicker gutta percha removes the diffi
culty experienced in the former apparatus from the band be
coming folded.
   The band is about four inches wide; and the electricity
given off appears to be of higher intensity, and, under favour
able states of the weather, nearly as much in quantity as that
of an ordinary plate-glass machine.
   The improvements above described are all due to John
Westmoreland; and this machine (which is beautifully finished,
and is, I believe, intended for the Exhibition of 1851) is the
result of his labours after the usual hours of work in Mr.
Davis's establishment.

LVI. Notice of the occurrence of Chalk Flints and Greensand
   Fossils in Aberdeenshire.     By WILLIAM FERGUson, Esq".
MANY years have            elapsed since it was first noticed that
         quantities of flints containing organic remains charac
teristic of the chalk, as well as certain organic remains be
longing to the greensand formation, existed in Aberdeenshire,
Dr. Knight, of Mareschal College, Aberdeen, was aware of
the fact, and through him it was communicated to Dr. Thomas
Thomson of Glasgow College nearly twenty years ago. Mr.
Christie of Banff published a notice upon the occurrence of
flints at Boyndie Bay, Banffshire, in the Edinburgh Philoso
phical Magazine for 1841; and a paper on the same subject,
of which the present is a condensed view, was read before the
Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Session 1848–1849. Since
                   * Communicated by the Author.

            and Greensand Fossils in Aberdeenshire.            431
then the attention of the British Association has been drawn
to them at their last meeting in Edinburgh by the Rev. J.
Longmuir of Aberdeen, who had previously, in 1847, published
a notice on them in the Witness newspaper. Still the know
ledge of these curious deposits is confined to a few; and it is
hoped the following short description of them will not be un
acceptable or uninteresting to English readers.
   On glancing at the geological map of Scotland, it will be
observed that the portion of Aberdeen and Banffshires cut off
by a line drawn from the mouth of the Ythan to that of the
Doveron, is, with the exception of a narrow band of old red
sandstone, represented by the colours denoting granite, gneiss,
mica-slate and quartz rock. These rocks come to the surface
everywhere, and yet superimposed on these, lie immense mul
titudes of chalk flints, and at one place at least a small patch
of greensand.
   Throughout the whole of this district, with the exception
of Mormond, which is 810 feet high, there are no hills. Still
the country is by no means level; and it presents to the eye
in the ever-recurring hillocks and deep gullies, together with
large accumulations of rolled gravel, ample evidence of widely
extended denudation.
   Running slightly to the south of west, there is a ridge of high
ground taking its rise nearly at Buchanness, and stretching
across the country continuously for eight or ten miles. At its
eastern extremity it branches out. One of the branches termi
nates south of Buchanness in the granitic mass of Stirling Hill;
the other ridge runs north of Buchanness, and may be said to
terminate in the granitic escarpment of the Black Hills. All
along the shore between these points, wherever the rocks admit
of a beach, quantities of water-worn flints are found mingled
with the other pebbles, evidently brought there by the waves.
They are also found, although sparingly, on the southern
ridge, or Stirling Hill. On the Black Hill and neighbouring
hill of Invernettie, the surface is almost covered with them.
This ridge, at the distance of about seven and a half miles
from the sea at Salthouse Head, attains an inland distance of
about five miles from the coast opposite Slains. The flints are
met with on the surface at several points along this line. The
ridge is bare and moorish, covered with peat and heather, and
this prevents the accurate tracing of the flints. At this point,
however, seven and a half miles along the line of the ridge,
and about five miles from the sea, opposite Slains, they have
been laid bare.
   They occur at the extreme verge of the parish of Old Deer,
and are principally seen upon the farm of Bogingarry, on the

  432      Mr. W. Ferguson on the occurrence of Chalk Flints
  estate of Kinmundy. The ridge of hill on which they occur
  here trends to the north, coming round again towards the
  west, so as to expose to the south a bay-like hollow. The
  hill is covered with moss and heather, part of which has been
  planted. The south face of the hill has, however, been under
  cultivation during the last twenty-five or thirty years. The
  flints are seen on the surface, commencing pretty far up on
  the east side of the hollow, and following at the same height
 the form of the bay, disappearing among the heather, which
 has not yet been removed on the extreme west. They are in
 great abundance, covering a space of some twelve to twenty
 yards in breadth.
     About 1830, in cutting a ditch to carry off the surface-water
 from the garden of the farmhouse of Bogingarry, the bed of
 flints was come upon, and found to be of considerable thickness.
 The ditch ran from south-west to north-east, traversing the
 flint bed, and a short cross one lay in the line of the bed.
     When I saw the ditch first, about 1839, it had become partly
 filled up and had a most singular appearance. It was crossed
 by the road to the house, and the water-way of the bridge
 was quite choked with rounded flints of all sizes. Above the
 bridge, the bottom of the ditch was quite covered with rounded
flints brought down by torrents. As you ascended the burn
you could see the nature of the ground. The layer of soil
was extremely thin, and below it the ditch was cut through a
stiff yellow clayey gravel, so hard as to be pierced with ex
treme difficulty. Until you reach the bed itself, very few
flints are to be seen among the clay. The top end of the
ditch and the cross one are in the bed. The flints lie closely
packed together, imbedded in the already mentioned clayey
matrix. They contain numerous organic remains.
    Near Peterhead there have been found considerable varieties
of the Echini family, occasionally entire, but more generally
only small portions of the impressions of these shells are found.
Single spines frequently occur, and are distinctly marked.
The Inoceramus, Pecten and Terebratula, are very abundant.
    Flints are also found on the surface, on the adjoining hill
of Skelmuir. South-westward they are found again on the
hill of Dudwick in the parish of Ellon. This seems to be
their southernmost limit. In some of the localities they are
shivered to atoms, retaining their sharp fracture; and this so
universally in these places, that an unbroken one is scarcely
to be seen.
    Mr. Christie of Banff, in the paper already referred to,
states that they occur at Boyndie Bay in that shire; and also
in a mass of diluvium covering the high grounds between

             and Greensand Fossils in Aberdeenshire.         433
Turriff and Delgaty Castle. The flints at Boyndie Bay are
found strewed along the shore, and contain traces of zoophytic
organic remains. Those at Delgaty are likewise characterized
by similar remains. The station at the latter place is ten
miles from the sea, and is the highest ground in the neigh
bourhood. The flints are found in the diluvium cresting the
hills.
   In my collection of fossils from Bogingarry and adjoining
localities, there are impressions of portions of spines, and also
casts of at least three varieties of the Echinus.      There are
also casts of Belemnites, Inoceramus, Terebratula, Pecten,
Plagiostoma, Turbinolia, Flustra, &c., together with other
remains not easily made out. From the remains in the flint,
existing for the most part as casts and impressions, it is diffi
cult, indeed it is almost impossible, to make out many of them
with sufficient certainty to name them. I have, however, met
with instances in which the shell is actually preserved.
    The greensand is found at Moreseat in the parish of Cruden.
This locality is on the ridge of high ground already mentioned
as running south-west from Buchanness. In the immediate
neighbourhood, the evidence of extensive denudation is very
marked. Attention was called to the deposit in question here
quite recently. The proprietor of the farm, Mr. Johnstone,
had built a new mill; and in making an excavation for the
water-wheel, several large and curious shells imbedded in a
fine-grained compact sandstone were turned up. The sand
stone itself, previously unknown in this locality, would have
been enough to attract notice—far more the shells. One of
these was the fragment of a cast of an Ammonite. The por
tion preserved was at least four inches in diameter.     The de
posit was about nine feet below the surface of the ground, and
yielded water freely. The wheel is now built in, and the
locality in consequence cannot be examined. Several hundred
cartloads of material were taken from this excavation, and
used to fill up inequalities in the surrounding fields. It is to
be regretted that this was not examined previous to being
deposited, as it is now beyond reach. About 400 yards to
the north-east of this point the shells were again met with, in
opening a ditch round a field newly reclaimed from moss. I
had this year (1850) an opportunity of examining it here. It
is from one to three feet below the surface, and is traceable in
the ditch one or two hundred yards. An excavation of about
seven feet in depth was made, and the section presented irre
gular layers of unctuous clay of a dark brown colour and soapy
feel; and so tough and adhesive, as to render it a work of
considerable labour to dig it out. Interstratified with this clay
were thin layers of a compact sandstone.          The layers of

434     Mr. W. Ferguson on the occurrence of Chalk Flints
sandstone were not continuous; they graduated into each
other, thinned out, disappeared and reappeared most confu
sedly. They were very much inclined, dipping towards the
south. The whole mass had much the appearance of having
been drifted; although from the nature of the material, and
the state of preservation in which the shells are found, it does
not appear as if it could have been transported far. The
sandstone is tough and soft when newly dug, but hardens on
exposure to air, and becomes light-coloured in drying. When
wet it presents a mottled appearance, the colouring being
greenish; when dry, this almost disappears. The exterior
surfaces are quite reddened with iron. Many of the remains
are casts, and are on the outer surfaces of the fragments of
sandstone as well as in the heart of the masses.     Of the re
mains themselves, flattened Spatangi are most abundant.
Several species of Ammonites and Belemnites, as also of Car
dium, Terebratula, Trochus, Solarium, Cerithium, &c., are
met with.     In a few rare instances the shells themselves are
preserved.
   The following theoretical remarks are added with much
diffidence, nearly as they were originally delivered to the
Glasgow Society.
   From our brief survey of the surrounding country, we saw
that the prevailing rocks are the crystalline and stratified-un
fossiliferous. Only in one instance does a limestone occur
with organics (an Ammonite)(?), which might consequently
belong to the secondary group. Old red sandstone occurs at
Aberdeen, and again (certainly) at Gamrie, but it has not been
positively seen at any point between, although it has been
supposed that it may nevertheless envelope the older rocks
along the coast beneath the sea-level. Oolite and Wealden
occur in the neighbourhood of Elgin. The distance between
these beds at Llanbride and the flints at Buchan cannot be
less than between fifty and sixty miles. Water-worn fossils of
the lias occur at Blackpots near Banff, but there they are
manifestly in a diluvial clay. The old red sandstone is the
newest rock that is known to occur over all Banffshire; con
sequently the whole of this county comes between the deposit
under consideration, and the newer formations of Morayshire.
   This greensand of Cruden is the only rock at all approach
ing, in the geological sequence, the chalk beds from which the
flint boulders must have been derived.         We are forced to
conclude concerning it, that if it is not in situ, it is at least
not far removed from it.                     -
   The question then arises, How came the flints and greensand
there, and whence?                     -
   Mr. Hugh Miller, cautioning the young geologist against

             and Greensand Fossils in Aberdeenshire.           435
concluding that because he finds a rock resting upon gneiss
it is therefore low in the geological scale, instances as an ex
ample of the error such a conclusion would lead to, the flints
and chalk fossils of Banff and Aberdeen lying immediately
over it in these counties, and adds, “it is probable that the
denuded members of the cretaceous group once rested upon
it there.” Prof. Jameson, in the Edinburgh Philosophical
Magazine, states the same opinion, adding, that it will pro
bably be found in some of the hollows of this part of Scotland.
   This is one theory, that the lower beds have been wanting
here, and the chalk of this bed has been removed by denuda
tion, leaving the flints resting on the granite. Opposed to
this theory is the fact, that the flints are invariably very much
water-worn. True, even according to it they would have pre
sented such an appearance, but not necessarily to such an ex
tent; and it seems that a denuding agency sufficiently power
ful to produce the rolled effect noted would have removed
them as well as the other beds, especially as they occur, not
in hollows, but almost always on the sides and near the sum
mits of hills. Mr. Nicol states his opinion thus:–“Probably
these recent secondary formations once existed here, or may
still be covered by the sea, and connected with the similar
beds in the Moray Frith. This opinion is confirmed by the
occurrence of lias, containing coal, at Hogenaes in the south
of Sweden, where it rests on gneiss and is covered by chalk.”
This leads on to another theory which has been suggested to
account for these flints; viz. that however such secondary beds
may have once existed here, these individual water-worn flints
owe their origin to a transporting agency which has brought
them from the chalk formations of the northern continent.
    The volcanic and tidal agencies (the latter modified by local
currents) seem to assume a direction between south-west and
north-east. All the mountain ranges and great formations of
our island assume in general that direction. The great moun
 tain range of Norway assumes the same. I am too unac
 quainted with Norwegian geology to be able skilfully to con
 nect it with Scottish. At Christiania there is a group belong
 ing partly to the lower and partly to the upper Silurian rocks.
 True chalk with flints has been clearly determined in some
 parts of Denmark. This Danish group may have been con
 tinued into Norway at one period, and afterwards removed by
 denudation, the same agency transporting the flint nodules to
 our shores.                                                 •
    It may bear against such a supposition of transportation,
 that the direction of the currents seem usually to have been from
 south-west to north-east,    º2 E' 2
                                       for this theory they require

436     Mr. W. Ferguson on the occurrence of Chalk Flints
to have been reversed. It may be suggested, Might not the
elevation of the great mountain ranges of the Continent have
been sufficient to cause a current from its shores capable of
exercising the transporting power required? The presump
tion is, however, against such a supposition.
    Standing on the ridge of the Hill of Kinmundy, and looking
towards the south and east, there is spread out before the eye
a wide expanse. Slightly to the north of eastward the ridge
is continuous to the sea at Buchanness; westward it undu
lates, receding northward, and again stretching out a promon
tory to the south. Beyond this there is a valley, and again
the hills rise, stretching away westward and northward, run
ning out in a series of high grounds by Dudwick towards
Turriff and Delgaty, and so onwards to the sea at Boyndie.
 Between this ridge and the sea, on the south and south-east,
there stretches out from the sort of bay described a breadth
of five or six miles of country, presenting inequalities of sur
face, but in the main level till it reaches the sea, with a coast
line elevated 180 to 200 feet above water-mark.          Over this
 valley calcareous sands occur, and near its centre is the green
sand formation. And standing, as I have said, on the hill
 ridge, and marking, as one cannot fail to mark, the band of
flint boulders that line near their highest and at an equal ele
vation the various bays and promontories, it requires no great
stretch of imagination to conceive of the waves of the German
 Ocean as having once rolled even hither, bearing with them,
and depositing on their innermost bounds, the rounded flints
that now mark their ancient shore.
    I have already stated, that the shores of the little bays near
 Peterhead present large quantities of the rounded flints.
 These may be either brought down by streams, or cast up from
 the sea, or both.   I have also inferred, from the condition of
 my specimens of organic remains from the Cruden greensand,
 that that formation, if not in situ, cannot at least be far re
 moved from its original position; not presenting evidence of
 being water-rolled, and not capable of undergoing, without
 destruction, that process.
    I wish to connect these two facts with an idea hinted at by
 Mr. Nicol, and additional grounds for which have been pointed
 out to me by Mr. Hugh Miller. Across the southern district
of England we have a certain sequence of geological forma
 tions, including in regular succession the Lias, Oolite and
 Wealden, succeeded by the Cretaceous. Across that portion of
 Scotland immediately to the north of the district now under
 consideration, we have part of the same sequence commencing
 with the lias. This formation at Cromarty, and at Brora in

            and Greensand Fossils in Aberdeenshire.         437
Sutherlandshire, is considerably to the west of the first ap
pearance of the same formation in England: but this results
naturally from what was before mentioned of the geological
formations running, not east and west, but north-east and
south-west; not right, but diagonally across the country. We
have thus lias at Cromarty, and a lower oolite near Elgin.
May it not be possible, that all we want to complete the re
maining members of the series is simply to be able to carry
out our section into the Moray Frith ?
   Such an hypothesis receives confirmation from the fact, that
in the neighbourhood of Elgin are beds containing Wealden
fossils, “which,” says Mr. Nicol, “we are led to suspect
are not original formations, but fragments of more extensive
beds, perhaps drifted to this place.” The diluvial clay con
taining lias fossils at Blackpots may also indicate a formation
beneath the waters of the bay. By referring to the geological
map of England, it will be seen that the greensand accom
panies the chalk lying on the west of it and on the east of the
lias, to the shore of the Channel. Our patch of it at Cruden
might form part of the termination of a similar stripe, un
less it, too, can be accounted for in the same way as the
Moray Wealdens, by supposing it a drifted fragment from the
north.
   May we then fairly infer, that at one period the space now
occupied by the Moray Frith contained a perfect sequence
of the secondary formations; that first the soft chalk strata
suffered denudation by the ordinary action of north-easterly
gales, currents and drift-ice, and that the roll of the German
Ocean piled up its debris in the shape of these water-worn
flint boulders along its successive ancient shores; and that the
Wealden and oolite of Elgin, and lias of Blackpots, followed
in the same course?
   That part of this theory applicable to the lias of Blackpots
Mr. Miller states thus, in his description of that deposit:—
“There had probably existed to the west or north-west of the
deposit, perhaps in the middle of the open bay formed by the
promontory on which it rests—for the small proportion of
other than liasic materials which it contains serves to show
that it could be derived from no great distance—an outlier of
the lower lias. The icebergs of the cold glacial period, pro
pelled along the submerged land by some arctic current, or
caught up by the gulf-stream, gradually grated it down, as a
mason's labourer grates down the surface of the sandstone
slab he is engaged in polishing; and the comminuted debris,
borne eastward by the current, was cast down here.”
    At Blackpots the lias fossils occur in clay containing few

4.38           On a Porismatic Property of two Conics.
other boulders. At Boyndie, further west, the flint boulders
cover the shore; and at Delgaty, ten miles inland, they occur
in great abundance, along with boulders of quartz rock, but
no fossils except their own. It would therefore appear, that
we owe the flint boulders and the lias boulders to different
periods; and as the chalk overlies the lias, it may be that its
denudation was completed, and its fossils thrown upon the
high grounds of the interior, previous to the formation of the
boulder clay containing the fossils of the lias. Although appa
rently not here, the boulder clay has in other places (as on
the banks of the Thorsa in Caithness) been found to contain
“fragments of chalk flints, and also a characteristic conglome
rate of the oolite,” as well as comminuted fragments of exist
ing shells. (H. Miller.) These facts seem also to favour this
hypothesis.
    The subject altogether is one involved in considerable dark
ness, and it is perhaps vain to attempt any generalization upon
it till the local geology has been far more accurately examined
and determined.
LVII. On a Porismatic Property of two Comics having with one
    another a contact of the Third Order. By J. J. SYLVESTER,
     M.A., F.I.S.*
     F two conics have with one another a contact of the third
       order, i. e. if they intersect in four consecutive points, it
will easily be seen that their characteristics referred to coor
dinate axes in the plane containing them must be of the rela
tive forms a “H-yz, k(y” + a” +ys) respectively, y characterizing
 their common tangent at the point of contactf.
     Hence if we take planes of reference in space, and call t
the characteristic of the plane of the conics, the equations to
any two conoids drawn through them respectively will be of
the relative forms
                            U=w”--yz + tu-0
                            V= y^+3* +yz+tv=0.

   + These relative or conjugate forms are taken from a table which I shall
publish in a future Number of this Magazine, exhibiting the conjugate
 characteristics in their simplest forms, correspondent to all the various
 species of contacts possible between lines and surfaces of the second degree.
This table is as important to the geometer as the fundamental trigono
 metrical formulae to the analyst, or the multiplication table to the arith
 metician; and it is surprising that no one has hitherto thought of con
 structing such.

 Using W to denote V–U, and (W) to denote what W be
comes when ey is substituted for t, we see that W and (W)
are of the respective forms y” +tw and y(); showing that the
former is the characteristic of a cone which will be cut by any
plane t—ey drawn through the line (t, y) in a pair of right
lines; or, in other words, that one of the cones containing the
intersection of the two variable conoids (V and U) will have
its vertex in the invariable line which is the common tangent
to the two fixed conics: this proves the theorem stated by me
hypothetically in a foot note in one of my papers in the last
Number of the Magazine. The steps of the geometrical proof
there hinted at are as follows.
   The four consecutive points in which the two conics inter
sect will be consecutive points in the curve of intersection of
the two variable conoids.     This curve lies in each of four
cones of the second degree. Every double tangent plane to
it passes through the vertex of one amongst these. The plane
containing four, i. e. two (consecutive) pairs of consecutive
points,is a double tangent plane, and will therefore pass through
a vertex; but four consecutive points of a curve of the fourth
order described upon a cone, and lying in one tangent plane
thereto, can only be conceived generally as disposed in the form
of an /, of which the belly part will point to the vertex; or,
in other words, at any point where two consecutive osculating
planes coincide so that the spherical curvature vanishes, the
linear curvature will also vanish, i. e. there will be a point of in
flexion at which, of course, the tangent line must pass through
the vertex of the cone. This is the assumption felt to be true,
but stated by me hypothetically in the paper referred to, be
cause a ready demonstration did not at the moment occur to
me. The legitimacy of this inference is now vindicated by
the above analytical demonstration.
   The methods of general and correlative coordinates and of
determinants combined possess a perfectly irresistible force (to
which I can only compare that of the steam-hammer in the
physical world) for bringing under the grasp of intuitive
perception the most complicated and refractory forms of geo
metrical truth.

LVIII. On the Rotation of a Rigid Body about a Fired Point.
              By J. J. SylvestER, M.A., F.R.S.*
   N the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal for
     March 1848, an article by Professor Stokes, of the Univer
sity of Cambridge, is ushered in with the words following:—
   “The most general instantaneoust motion of a rigid body
moveable in all directions about a fixed point consists in a
motion of rotation about an axis passing through that point.
This elementary proposition is sometimes assumed as self.
evident, and sometimes deduced as the result of an analytical
process. It ought hardly perhaps to be assumed, but it does
not seem desirable to refer to a long algebraical process for
the demonstration of a theorem so simple. Yet I am not
aware of a geometrical proof anywhere published which might
be referred to.”
   The learned and ingenious professor is indubitably right,
and might have trusted himself to assert less hesitatingly the
necessity of demonstrating this proposition, which possesses
none of the characters of a self-evident truth; but it is to be
regretted that he should have stated it in such a form as na
turally to lead the incautious reader to mistake the nature
and grounds of its existence, which consist in this fact—that
any kind of displacement of a body moveable about a fixed
axis, whether instantaneous and infinitesimal, or secular and
finite, is capable of being effected by a single rotation about a
single axis.
   The annexed simple proof of this capital law has the ad
vantage of affording a rule for compounding into one any two
(and therefore any number of) rotations given in direction,
magnitude and order of succession.                       -
   It will somewhat conduce to simplicity if we fix our atten
tion upon a spherical surface rigidly connected with the rota
ting body, and having its centre at the fixed point thereof.
When the positions of two points in this are given, the posi
tion of the body is completely determined.
   Now evidently two points A, B may be brought respectively
to A'B' (if AB = A'B') by two rotations; the first taking place
about a pole situated anywhere in the great circle bending at
right angles A A', the second about A', the position into which
it is brought by the first rotation. This view leads us to con
sider the effect of two rotations taking place successively about
two axes fixed in the rotating body. Or again, we may make
the plane A' B' revolve into the position AB round a pole

 On the Rotation of a Rigid Body about a Fialed Point. 441
taken at the node in which the two planes intersect, and then
the points A, B swing into their new positions A', B' by
means of a rotation about the pole of the great circle, of which
Al B forms a part. This mode of effecting the displacement
naturally suggests the consideration of the effect of rotations
taking place successively about two axes fixed in space.
   First, then, let us study the effect of the combination of a
rotation (a) having P for its pole, followed by another (8), of
which Q is the pole, P and Q being points in the surface of
the revolving sphere.
   In drawing the annexed fi-                             7°
gure, I have supposed that the
two rotations are of the same                                         P
kind, each tending, when a
spectator is standing with his "
head to the respective polesand
his feet to the centre, to make                                         R’
a point to his right-hand pass
in front of his face towards his
left-hand. Let now PQ revolve
through .    positively into the
                                     ;
position of PR, and through negatively into that of QR.
Then I say that the two impressed rotations a and 8 about P
and Q will be equivalent to a single rotation about R, equal
to twice the acute angle between QR, R.P.
   Let the first rotation about P bring Q to Q' and R to R';
it is clear that QPR, QPR, QPR' are all equal triangles.
Therefore R'Q'R=2PQR=8. Consequently the positive
rotation 8 about Q' (the new position of R) will carry R' back
again to R, its original position. Hence the actual motion
which results from the successive rotations combined being
consistent with R remaining at rest, must be equivalent to a
single rotation about R.
   To find its magnitude, let the second rotation carry P to
 P+; then the angular displacement PRP' (which is the re
quired rotation of the whole body) is equal to twice the acute
angle between Q'R, RP, which is the same as that between
QR, RP, as was to be shown.                Thus we see that the semi
rotations about three poles (considered as the angular points
of a spherical triangle), which, taken in order, would bring
the sphere back to its first undisturbed position, are equal to
the included angles at such poles respectively.
       * The reader is requested to fill in the point P' and join PR.

 442          Mr. J. J. Sylvester on the Rotation of a
    If in our figure the order of the rotations had been reversed,
 PQr, QPr would have been taken respectively equal to PQR,
 QPR, but in the opposite side of PQ, and r would have been
 the resultant pole, the resultant rotation remaining in amount
 the same as before.
   If either of the rotations had been negative, the resultant
pole would be found in QR produced, viz. at the intersection
of r() or rp with PQ.
   Calling the resultant rotation <U+017F>y, we have always
          sin #: sin g : sin %: : sin QR : sin PR : sin PQ.
When the component rotations are infinitesimal in amount,
 R and r will come together in QP; the order of succession
of the rotations will be indifferent, and we shall have
                        a.…. in “...in B. sing
                    a : 3: , ; ; sin; sin 2 : sing
                              :: sin QR : sin RP: sin PQ,
which gives the rule for the parallelogrammatic composition of
two simultaneously impressed rotations*.
   If, next, we consider the effect of rotations about two poles,
P and Q, fixed in space (supposing, as above, that they take
place first about P and then about Q), we must take PQr equal
to half the contrary of the rotation about P, and PQr to half the
direct rotation about Q (the angle being now taken positive
which was on the first supposition negative, and vice versä);
so that, retaining the original figure, the first rotation will
bring r to R, and the second carry R back to r, showing that
r is the resultant pole, and that P'rp, the resultant rotation,
will be double the acute angle between Qr, rB, as in the former
CaSe.
   To popular apprehension the important doctrine of uniaxial
rotation may be made intelligible by the following mode of
statement. Take a pocket-globe, open the case and roll about
the sphere within it in any manner whatever; then closing
the case, there will unavoidably remain two points on the ter
restrial surface touching the same two points on the celestial
surface as they were in apposition with before the sphere was
so turned about in its case.
   It is right to bear in mind that the whole of this doctrine is
comprised in, and convertible with, the following easy geome
trical proposition relative to arcs of great circles on any sphe
rical surface, including the plane as an extreme case.
  * Compare Mr. Airy's Tracts, art. “On Precession and Nutation.”
  t P' is not expressed in the figure given.

                 Rigid Body about a Fived Point.                        443
   “The arcs joining the extremities (each with each in either
order) of two other equal arcs, subtend equal angles at either
of the points of intersection of two great circles bisecting at
right angles the first-named connecting arcs%.”
   The spherico-triangular mode of compounding rotations
given in the above simple disquisition may easily be made the
parent of a whole brood of geometrical consequences, which,
however, I must leave to the ingenuity and care of those who
have a turn for this kind of invention.
    But I ought not to omit to invite attention to a remarkable
form, which may be imparted to the theorems above stated
for the composition of finite rotations, or rather to a theorem
which may be derived from them by an obvious process of
inference.
    Let P, Q, R... XZ be any number of points on a sphere
capable of moving about its centre, joined together by arcs of
great circles so as to form a spherical polygon. Imagine any
number of rotations to take place about these points in suc
cession as poles. It matters not which is considered the first
pole of rotation, but the order of the circulation must be sup
posed given, as, for instance, P, Q, R... XZ, or QR... XZP,
or R... XZPQ, &c. This will be one order; the reverse order
 would be PXZ ... RQ, or QPXZ ... R, &c.
    I shall suppose the circulation to be of the kind first above
 written. Now we may make two hypotheses:–
    1. That the poles are fixed in space.
    2. That they are fixed in the rotating body.
    In the first case, let the rotations about the given poles P, Q,
 R, S... XZ be double the amounts which would serve to
 transport PQ to QR, QR to RS... XZ to ZP respectively.
    In the second case, let the rotations be double the amounts
 which would carry PZ to ZX.... SR to RQ, RQ to QP
 respectively. Then, on either supposition, the sum of the
 combined rotations is zero; or, to use a more convenient and
 suggestive form of expression, if the poles of rotation form a
 closed spherical polygon whose angles are respectively equal
 to the semirotations about the poles, the resultant rotation is
 Zero.                            -
     This proposition is immediately derivable from the funda
 mental one relative to three poles, given above, by dividing
 the polygon into triangles by arcs, joining any one of the poles
   * This proposition will be seen to be immediately demonstrable, by the
 comparison of equal triangles, when viewed as the converse of this other.
“The arcs (or right lines) joining the correspondent extremities of the bases
 of two similar isosceles spherical (or plane) triangles having a common
vertex, are equal to each other.”                      -

 444             Prof. Chapman on the Identity of
 with all the rest, or (as pointed out to me by my eminent
friend Prof. W. Thomson) it becomes apparent as a particular
 case of a more general proposition, or representing the mo
 tion about the successive axes as effected by two equal pyra
mids having a commou vertex at the centre of motion, of
which the one is fixed in space, and the other is fixed in the
revolving body and rolls over the first, so that the correspond
ing  equal faces are successively brought into coincident appo
Slt1OI).

    P.S. To find the pole of rotation whereby PQ may be
 brought into the position P'Q', we may use the following sim
ple construction.
    Measure off from O the node of the great circles (or right
lines) containing PQ and P'Q', two distances in the proper
direction upon each (four distinct assumptions may be made),
say OR and OS equal to one another and to the difference
between OP and OP', then the pole of rotation required,
say E, is the centre of the circle described about ROS, and
the amount of rotation is the angle subtended by OR or OS
at E. The writer of this paper suggests that awis of dis
placement would be a convenient term for designating the line
whereby any finite change in the position of a body moveable
about a fixed centre may be brought about; a geometrical
theory of rotation leading to the investigation of a very curious
species of correlation, now opens upon the view, the general
object of which may be stated as follows:—
   “Given upon a sphere or plane any curve considered as the
locus of successive poles of instantaneous rotation, and the
ratio of the rotation about each pole to its distance from the
one that follows%, to construct the curve of the poles of dis
placement, and to determine the amount of rotation corre
sponding to each such pole.”
   The discussion of this question offers a fine field for the
exercise of geometrical taste and skill.

been clearly ascertained, owing to the minuteness of the cry
stals, and to the circumstance that usually both extremities of
the prisms are engaged in the sides of the little cavities in
which the substance occurs. A late examination of some speci
mens from Capo di Bove, in a lava apparently free from the
ordinary augite crystals, enabled me, however, to detect a
crystal of the accompanying form; the planes of which, though
extremely minute, were very brilliant, and sufficiently defined
to admit of measurement. This crystal was of the same golden
brown colour as the surrounding fibres, and in every way
similar to them in its general aspect, as well as in its comport
ment before the blowpipe, as afterwards tried. It belonged
to the monoclinic system, and was a combination of the mon
axial forms P, M and L; of the diaxial prismatic form D
and the diaxial pyramidal form E, or m E.; the
planes of the latter being mere lines, visible
from their brilliancy, but too small to reflect alº
distinct image.                                             -
    P on M gave 106° 18'; P on L, 90°; P on
D, 100° 34'; D on D, 87° 10'.              These values
sufficiently prove that the substance was an au
gite+.
    The measured crystal fused very readily be
fore the blowpipe into a shining bead of the same colour as
the unaltered mineral, and but very slightly attractable by the
magnet: several capillary crystals behaved exactly in the
same manner. With the usual blowpipe reagents I could not
obtain the least indications of copper; nor have I been able
to do so with any specimen of breislakite that I have yet ex
amined. The assertion, therefore, copied from one minera
logical work into another, that this substance contains oxide
of copper, is certainly incorrect. In borax the breislakite
dissolves rather slowly, and still more so in microcosmic salt,
the little fibres retaining their form and colour, in the latter
reagent, for a considerable time—a behaviour resembling that
of most varieties of augite and hornblende. The tints im
parted to the glasses are solely derived from iron. Silica is
also separated in the microcosmic salt bead; and with carbo
nate of soda, a faint reaction of manganese is obtained.
   The fibres are not apparently acted upon by boiling hydro
chloric acid. The supernatant liquid, diluted, and tested with
sulphuretted hydrogen, does not furnish a precipitate.
   * In conformity with the French crystallographers, I have considered the
planes P as basal, in the usual acceptation of the term as applied to mono
clinic forms. This view is supported not only by its simplicity, but by the
general symmetry of at least nine-tenths of the augite crystals.

446      Note on the employment of Right Rhomboidal Prisms.
    To analyse this mineral, or even to determine its specific
gravity, with any approach to accuracy would be next to im
possible, owing to the difficulty of separating a sufficient
quantity from the lava, nepheline, &c. with which it is asso
ciated.
LX. Note on the employment of Right Rhomboidal Prisms

    N the conventional position of the axes of monoclinic or
     oblique prismatic crystals, the three monaxial forms, id est,
such as cut but one axis, P, M and L, necessarily constitute
a rectangular prism with oblique base; P and L, and M and
L, being at right angles to each other, whilst the inclination
of P on M is variable. In oblique rhombic prisms the basal
plane P remains the same, M and L giving place to the di
axial form D ; and when P, M, L and D are in combination,
as in certain augite crystals, for example, an eight-sided prism
is produced, with an oblique base P. The accompanying
section (No. 1) through the secondary axes, exhibits the rela
tive positions of these forms#. Fig. 2 is a vertical section
through the principal axis and the orthodiagonal; fig. 8, a
vertical section through the clinodiagonal. In the latter,
therefore, the point of the orthodiagonal, or the position of a
side plane L, fronts the observer.

    This premised, it is evident that if we place an oblique
rectangular prism so that one of the planes L shall constitute
the base, a right rhomboidal prism will be produced—a form
frequently adopted by certain mineralogists to the exclusion
of the former solid.       Here, however, it is obvious that the
positions of the axes can no longer be the same as in the
oblique rhombic prisms; so that, in adopting this form, we
must also adopt two positions for the axes of monoclinic cry

GPNº. prejudice and even engineering incredulity, not
        many years ago, denied the possibility of vessels being
propelled, unless we had the two elements of air and water to
act against each other; and also affirmed, that turning the
wheels of railway vehicles by steam power could never give
them any useful impulse.
   Now the sea is kept in continued foam by the swift prows
of its tens of thousands of steam-boats; and the land, of almost
every nation, is begirt with its iron roads in every possible
direction; and monster-trains are every day conveying their
thousands at forty and fifty miles an hour. The incredulity
is forgotten; and the parties so forgetting it are quite as ready
to avail themselves of these wonderful and most useful prac
tical advantages, as if they had never disbelieved in their pos
sibility, or opposed their nascent progress. Such, however,
is the history of human invention: at every new step, first
discovered by science, and then attempted to be realized by
art, the same incredulity and the same opposition has to be
met; but after so many practical lessons on the determined
march of scientific engineering in the present age, it behoves us
to examine, with competent eyes, and to be more cautious, be
fore we reject projects that startle our present ideas of what is
practicable, especially when they involve, if possible, an enor
mous field of utility.
   The present announcement is of this class; and its theore
tical basis is all that is intended to be set forth in this com
munication.

 448             Mr. G. Walker on the Theory of a
   If the theory be sound, it will not be so in vain; and how
 ever difficult, and perhaps remote its application may be, yet
human ingenuity at length overcomes mere practical difficul
ties, and realizes the use of every great general principle in
 Nature, at their appointed time, to meet the extended wants
of advancing civilization.
   The ocean, bearing its heavy burdens from any one shore
to every other by wind and tide, and lately by steam, has
hitherto been the great means both of civilization and wealth;
 but the resistance of water to vessels increasing in the enor
mous ratio of the squares of their velocities, has placed a limit
to steam-boat speed, which can only be exceeded by an unre
 munerative expense of steam power: and even this is not by
any means the limit of the barrier that has to be overcome;
for every increase of speed in the vessel requires an equal in
crease of swiftness in the paddles to overtake it, which causes
the steam power expended to be in the ratio of the cubes of
the velocities of the vessel. Thus double the speed requires
eight times the power, and three times the speed requires
twenty-seven times the power. There is no principle in nature
yet known to modify this rapidly accumulating law of resistance,
but that of increasing the magnitude of our vessels to as great
an extent as their materials will safely permit; for the resist
ances will vary as the surfaces of the prows of the vessels, and
these are as the squares of any homologous dimensions;
whereas the engine power any vessel can carry is as its solid
contents, and these are as the cubes of such homologous parts:
hence if any vessel be double the size of another, its resistance
will be only fourfold greater at any given velocity, but its
floatage to carry engine power will be eightfold.
   We have here all the elements of steam-boat navigation as
it now stands; and it seems probable that from eighteen to
twenty miles per hour, at great cost, may be a tolerably ap
proximate limit of speed, under every advantage our know
ledge of engine power and ship-building materials can com
mand; and a most astonishing triumph of mechanical skill
over natural impediments it is to have attained to this speed.
   The law of resistance in water is the great obstacle that
causes this enormous consumption of power; and if it can be
shown that there exists in nature a mechanical principle ca
pable of reducing this expense to one-fortieth part of its pre
sent scale, its physical and moral value need scarcely be
pointed out; it would extend our railroad speed over the
ocean without the cost of its iron way, and this in every pos

munication between the distant races of men?            Let us not,
however, consider these advantages as yet within our grasp :
it will be quite sufficient if the demonstration here offered of
this new principle have no lurking fallacy within it: to all
appearance the result seems as undeniable as that of any
other mathematical demonstration when applied to mechanical
power.
   It has been ascertained, by the careful and satisfactory
experiments of the French Academy, that the resistance to
oblique surfaces moving through water by no means varies in
the duplicate ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence, as
has been theoretically supposed.
    Fifteen boxes were made, two feet wide, two feet deep, and
four feet long: one of them was a parallelopiped of these di
mensions; the others had prows of a wedge form, the angle
varying by 12° from 12° to 180°, so that the angle of inci
dence increased by 6° from one to another. When the prow
was at an angle of 12°, and the angle of incidence 6°, as shown
at Plate IV. fig. 3, the resistance was as 3.999 to 10.000 on the
base or front surface of the parallelopiped, say practically as
4 to 10.
   By the same authority, the resistance to one square foot,
French measure, moving with the velocity of 2:56 feet per
second, was very nearly 7.625 pounds French. The resist
ances increased very correctly as the squares of the velocities;
and reducing these to English measures, a square foot moving
perpendicular to itself in river water, receives one pound re
sistance when moving with a velocity of 1:01, say 1 foot, per
second.
    Let AB, fig. 1, be a plane moving perpendicular to itself in
water from A to H, and let the velocity be represented by the
line AH; the resistance to AB will be as ABx AH2.              If the
plane A B move towards E, parallel to itself, with a velocity
 Ah = AH, the resistance to its perpendicular section AH will
 be expressed by   #.       But experiment has proved that the
     -              .. 2        ".  .           -          -   2AH
 resistance to AB is   5 of that to its perpendicular AH, viz.

    If AB move to E with the velocity AE, the resistance will
 be   #;    x AE”; and the power required to overcome this
 resistance of AB towards H, as            º: x AE*.x AE is to

    Let the plane AB be ten feet long by one broad, and let
 the distance from A to H be one foot; then if it be depressed,

  so as to arrive at H in one second, according to the experi
  ments quoted, the resistance will be ten pounds.
     If it move in the direction AE, as before, and AH be one
  tenth part of radius, the resistance to the section AH will
  be one-tenth of that of AB in its motion towards H; and if
  AB move towards E, the resistance to it will be

                     10 × 10 x   5 T   5 =40;
 and therefore the power to move AB with the velocity AE
 will be 40 x 10=400; that is, forty times the power required
 to move AB to H.        Q. E. D.                            -
    It is not intended in the present communication to enter
 upon the various methods that have occurred for carrying out
 this principle of evading the direct resistance of water, by
 making the whole displacement of it perpendicular, or nearly
 so, to the line of the vessel's path; but to render the idea more
 palpable and distinct, conceive a succession of hollow floats
 connected together by hinges into an endless chain passing
 round drums at each end of a frame (see fig. 2), and the lower
 line floating on the water, and kept, by the nature of the joints,
 from bending upwards between the drums, aided, if necessary,
 by intermediate ones. If the drums are made to revolve by
 steam power or otherwise, new floats are laid down in front, and
 others are taken up behind in continued succession; and the
act is like that of a continuate railway over boats. Each float
 is placed in the water and taken out again without changing
its position horizontally; and this, not immediately under each
drum, but with the moderate velocity due to an inclined plane;
being kept above the water at each end like the prow and
stern of a gondola. To gain sufficient buoyancy, a much
longer line of floats, depressed by an intermediate succession
of drums, may be required; but such considerations form no
part of the present essay. It is necessary, however, to observe
that the floats have hitherto been only considered as respects
the resistance of their lower surface against the water as a
plane of certain dimensions moving with a given velocity:
these floats will, however, require considerable force to de
press them and displace their bulk of water; but being de
pressed and withdrawn by a slow action, very nearly all the
force absorbed by the immersion will be restored by their own
buoyant action in emerging; so that this small loss of power

need scarcely be taken into consideration as any set-off against
a principle promising a gain of forty to one.
   The following additional demonstration of this principle
having been submitted to Mr. Walker, he requested that it
may be added as corroborative of his views.
   If the French experiment of the wedge form, represented by
fig. 3, were made only one foot deep, by two feet wide at the
base, that half of the prow below the centre line would cor
rectly represent the plane AB, fig. 4; and if both were moved
horizontally with the velocity of ten feet per second, as from
AB to CD, the plane AB would just meet half the resistance
of the prow.
    Experiment has shown that the two square feet of base to
the prow would, if the prow were absent, at that velocity re
ceive 100 pounds resistance each, = 200 pounds; and that,
 with the prow, the resistance would be Tºths of this, or 80
pounds.      Thus one-half, or 40 pounds, would be the hori
zontal resistance of the plane AB, moving ten feet per second,
which is equivalent to 400 pounds moved one foot per second.
    As the resistance varies as the squares of the velocities, if
the plane AB were placed horizontally, as represented by AE,
and then depressed in one second to DB (being one foot), each
 of the ten square feet would only receive one pound of resist
 ance, and the whole would be ten pounds moved one foot per
 second, which is just one-fortieth part of the power required
 in the former case,      Q. E. D.

      LXII. On the Untenableness of the received Theory of
                Newton's Rings. By E. WILDE *.
 A     DESIRE to investigate the colours of thin plates more
        closely induced me to have an instrument prepared, by
 which I am enabled actually to measure the diameters of the
 coloured rings of Newton to the ten-thousandth part of an
 English inch, and to attain by estimation an accuracy of one
 hundred-thousandth of an inch ; the same instrument deter
 mines the approximation of the glasses to the millionth of an
 inch. It is therefore capable of a greater degree of exactness
 than even the spherometer of Biot. I will name it a gyrei
  dometer.
     Some years ago an instrument for the exhibition of New
 ton's rings was invented by Jericau in Sweden; it was named
 a gyreidoscope by its inventor. The instrument however
    * Translated from Poggendorff's * vol. lxxx. p. 407, July 1850.
                                  2 G 2

452           M. E. Wilde on the Untenableness of
could not be used for the purposes of measurement, and
hence I found myself compelled to resort to other principles
in the construction of my own.
   In the description which he has given of his gyreidoscope,
Jericau dissents from the theory of Newton's rings, which up
to the present time has been accepted; inasmuch as experi
ment has taught him, that, by pressing the glasses very
strongly together, the centre, instead of appearing dark, as
asserted by Newton, actually becomes bright. He endea
voured to explain the matter by referring it to the repeated
diffusion of colours within a circle.   I must however confess
that I am unable to attach any clear meaning to his explana
tion.
   Prompted, however, by this remark of Jericau's, I was in
duced to undertake a closer investigation of the subject as
soon as I found the gyreidometer in my possession. I have
not been able to corroborate the statement, that by pressing
the glasses very strongly together the centre becomes bright.
I have found that the first result of the pressure is a dark
central spot, which is formed at the summit of the convex
lens; but by increasing the compression and bringing the
glasses more closely into contact, the black spot expanded
into a circle with a bright centre; in the middle of this bright
patch a dark spot again appeared as the pressure was in
creased, and it thus continued changing according as the
length of the paths of the respective rays reflected at the upper
and lower limit of the layer of air differed from each other by
an odd or even number of semi-undulations, until finally a
constant dark central spot was obtained, which it was impos
sible to supersede even when the glasses were so forcibly
pressed, that the upper one, which was a quarter of an inch
in thickness, actually bent under the force. As the spot in
creased in size, the surrounding curves diverged more and
more from the circular form. By ordinary daylight, as might
be expected, the change from dark to bright, which accom
panied the approach of the glasses, could not be perceived;
a variety of colours exhibited themselves one after the other,
until, finally, upon very strong pressure, the dark central spot
was obtained. A small number only of rings were visible when
viewed with common light; but with homogeneous light the
field of view of the microscope appeared covered with many
hundred curves, alternately dark and bright.
   But although I find myself thus unable to coincide with
the assertion of Jericau, a careful examination of the rings of
Newton with the gyreidometer has furnished me with other
grounds of dissent from the generally received theory which

             the received Theory of Newton's Rings.             453
has been deduced from the theory of undulation by Young,
Fresnel, Poisson, Herschel, Airy, and others. My grounds
of dissent are as follow :-
   1. It is theoretically impossible that a reversion of the
aether-vibrations, reflected at the lower limit of the one glass
as compared with those reflected at the upper limit of the
other, can take place when there is no layer of air between
the glasses.
   2. If, in order to preserve the received theory, a layer of
air so thin that its depth is very small even in comparison
with the length of an undulation, be assumed to exist at the
point where the dark spot commences to show itself, this
could not account for the continuance of the spot after the
glasses have been pressed so strongly together that no air can
possibly exist between them. This assumption therefore does
not help us; the central spot cannot be referred to the inter
ference of the rays reflected at the respective limits of the
glasses, though this is the explanation which has heretofore
been accepted.
   3. In reflected daylight the central spot appears a deep
black. Its origin, therefore, even should we grant the exist
ence of an intermediate air-layer, can by no means be referred
to the principle of interference; for it is well known, that,
owing to the difference in the lengths of the respective undu
lations, the interference of rays compounded of all colours
must result in a tinting more or less vivid. Since therefore
the central spot cannot be referred to the existence of a thin
layer of air, nor for the reason first assigned be referred to
the principle of interference, we are driven to seek a different
explanation of the phaenomenon from that heretofore given.
   4. Because, with homogeneous light, if the distance of the
glasses from each other be equal to nought, and a reversion
of the vibrations consequently impossible, the phases of the
rays reflected from the two glasses at the point of contact
must correspond, and a dark spot cannot be the consequence.
   5. Because, in the case under consideration, the phaeno
mena of colour which are exhibited in all analogous cases,
among which may be reckoned the figures due to diffraction,
are entirely absent.
   From all these grounds it follows, that the middle of the ring
system, when the distance between the glasses is nought, cannot
appear dark in reflected light; but that, in direct opposition to
all assertions heretofore made, it ought to appear bright.
   The shortest proof for the so-called law of Young, I find in
 Fresnel's expression for the velocity of oscillation of a reflected
ray polarized in the plane of incidence, and of a reflected ray

454.          M. E. Wilde on the Untenableness of
polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence; the former
(that is, of the ray in which the oscillations are at right angles
to the plane of incidence and to the direction of the ray) has
the following value:—
                              sin (i-r)
                           Tsin (i+r]”         -   -   -  - - -  (1.)
and the latter (that is, of the ray in which the oscillations are
parallel to the plane of incidence and perpendicular to the
direction of the ray) the value *—
                             #}.                       .  . . .  (2.)
   At the upper limit of the layer of air, the angle of incidence i
is smaller than the angle of refraction r, the passage in this
case being from glass to air; the expression (1.) is therefore
positive. At the lower limit of the air-layer, on the contrary,
the angle i is greater than r, the passage in this case being
from air to glass; and the same expression is consequently
negative. In the same way the expression (2.) changes its
sign according as it refers to the one or the other limit of
the air-layer; at the upper limit it is negative, and at the
lower limit it is positive. A change of sign, however, in the
velocity of oscillation is always accompanied by a reversion of
the direction of oscillation. Hence, when a natural (unpo
larized) ray, which as regards intensity may be considered as
composed of the two polarized rays mentioned above, is re
flected at the lower boundary of the layer of air, a reversion
of the aether oscillations, as compared with their direction
after reflexion from the upper boundary, must take place,
which reversion, as regards the intensity of the reflected light,
has the same effect as if the difference of the paths traversed
by both rays was half an undulation (or in general an odd
number of semi-undulations) greater or less than it really is;
this however under the sole condition that a layer of air exists
between the two glasses. If therefore a difference of half an
undulation has been heretofore assumed at the point where no
air exists between the glasses, the said assumption has been
made in direct opposition to the theory of undulation.
   If, on account of the reversion of the oscillation, I assume
the difference of the paths traversed by the interfering homo
geneous rays half an undulation X (or an odd number of half
undulations) greater or less than it really is, then the sim
plest expression for the intensity of the reflected light I find
to be                                 d

of reflected light bear to each other the ratio v. 1: V3: W5...;
and those of the minima the ratio WO: V2 : V4.....                With
transmitted light, on the contrary, the ratios of the maxima
will be w/0: V2: V4....., and those of the minima w’1 :
 w/3: A/5.......
   This is the manner in which Newton first expressed the
law, and in the same manner it has heretofore been deduced
from the undulation theory. It is however so far from agree
ing with the same, that the law, to be rendered applicable to
the centre of the ring-system, would require entire reversion.
   The rings nearest the centre begin to lose their circular
shape, and to assume one more or less elliptical, immediately
before the appearance of the constant dark spot, and while
the centre is still bright. There can be no doubt that actual

456           M. E. Wilde on the Untenableness of
contact has taken place, and that the distance between the
glasses is already =0 when the shape of the rings has begun
thus to alter, inasmuch as this alteration manifestly intimates
an actual pressure of the glasses. Then, however, the first
bright ring must appear as the uninterrupted continuation of
the bright central patch, because the first dark ring is not
formed until for cos r=cos 0°= 1 the depth d of the layer of air
is   º, the difference of the paths of the interfering rays (taking
into account the journey forward and back through the air
layer And the reversion of the vibration) being at this place

     The measurements I have made with the gyreidometer, in
which were placed a plane glass and a convex glass of 360
inches Eng. radius, are my security against error here. When
using reflected light, the glasses were pressed together until

    These values however need a sensible correction, inasmuch
as the radii of the rings, on account of the refraction of the
upper plate, a quarter of an inch thick, appear smaller than
they really are at the upper limit of the air-layer. The mean
exponent of refraction necessary for the ascertaining of these
corrections, I obtained according to the method of Precht †,

 458          M. E. Wilde on the Untenableness of
 which values are so exact, that, when set down in the form of
 a proportion with the square roots found above, the product
 of the extremes agrees with the product of the means to at
 least four places of decimals. Thus, for example, for the first
 and third dark rings, the following proportion ought to hold
 good, 0.1077°: 0 1864* = 0.0l 159 : 0.03474 = 2 : 6 = 1 : 3,
 which it actually does, the product of the extremes agreeing
 with the product of the means to four places, viz. 0.0347.
    The laws deduced from the undulation theory for the reflected
light are thus confirmed by experiment, without its being neces
sary to press the glasses so strongly together as to cause the dark
central spot to exhibit itself; and this is the point which it was
my object to prove.
    Another consideration which supports the truth of my as
 sertion is, that by all analogous phaenomena of colour where,
 when homogeneous light is used, an alternation of dark and
 bright is observed, the middle being bright, the first minimum
occurs where the paths traversed by the interfering rays differ
by at least an entire undulation. Thus, for example, in the
alternation which occurs when light, after having passed
through a narrow opening, is received upon an opake screen,
the middle, where the difference of path is nothing, is always
bright, its intensity being = 1. The space however remains
also bright when the difference amounts to half an undulation,
its intensity at this point being 0.4053, and it is not until the
difference amounts to an entire undulation that the first mini
mum occurs”. The resemblance is closer still when the dif
fraction is caused by the rays passing through a small circular
opening, in which case the middle is also bright, and the first
dark ring occurs where the difference of the paths traversed
by the rays is 1-220Af. It is, on this account, impossible to
determine the difference of path corresponding to the first
maximum ring, which appears as a continuation of the bright
centre; this difference must be obtained from the expression
of intensity (3); and for the same reason I have been unable
to ascertain by measurement the radius of the first bright ring,
being obliged also to resort to the expression (3.) to obtain it.
Notwithstanding, however, that in all these related phaeno
mena, where the centre is bright, the first minimum does not
occur where the difference is half an undulation, still up to
the present time it has been assumed, in the case of trans
mitted light, that the centre of Newton's ring-system is bright,
and that the first dark ring nevertheless occurs where the
depth of the layer of air is one-fourth of an undulation, that
is to say, where the difference of paths amounts to half an un

             the received Theory of Newton’s Rings.          4.59
dulation, for in this case the vibrations are not reversed.   No
analogy therefore exists between the theory of Newton's rings
heretofore received, and that which explains other phaenomena
of a similar nature.
    The error is evidently due to the circumstance, that, trust
ing to the accuracy of Newton’s observations, the formula of
intensity (3.), which applies solely to the case where a rever
sion of the aether vibrations may be assumed, has been ex
tended to the case where the distance being 0, no reversion is
possible. It may be remarked, further, that the depth 0 has
never been introduced into the proportion, nor could it be so
introduced, as a fourth proportional infinitely great would be
the consequence. It is thus easy to conceive how, neglecting
to test the original observations of Newton, the same error
might be repeated through centuries.
    With regard, finally, to the origin of the central spot,
which by daylight appears black, but by homogeneous light,
on account of the dull background, does not appear darker
than the rings caused by interference, my opinion coincides
with that of Jericau, that the spot is caused by transmitted
light in the same manner as the spot upon a mirror when a
little of the metallic coating is removed from behind. The
  art from which the coating has been removed appears dark
in comparison with the surrounding bright reflecting surface.
I however agree with this notion, not as a probable conjecture,
but as an undeniable fact. The grounds of this assertion are
the following :-
   Let DEC represent a glass prism,                     c
O the place of the eye, and GH a
line parallel to the ends. A refrac
tion of red light is first possible at t
when the angle OtG is +49° 2', or
the angle of incidence at t=48° 58';
and a refraction of the violet in q
first occurs when the angle OqG
= 50° 7', or the angle of incidence
=39°53'. Let p be the place at
which the middle rays are refracted.
Between t and BE no ray will be broken at the base DB, and
hence in this portion a total reflexion will take place. Be
tween t and p, red, orange and yellow rays can pass through;
and, on account of their absence, the light reflected from this
portion will be diminished in intensity. Between p and q all
the other rays, blue and violet excepted, are allowed to pass;
here therefore the intensity of the reflected light will be stili
less, while in the vicinity of q, where the blue and violet have

460           M. E. Wilde on the Untenableness of
not yet found a passage, the bluish bow MN is observed, which
 Newton was the first to notice and explain. In the portion
 of the base between MN and AD, where all the rays are re
fracted, the reflected light is for this reason very dull.
    Having laid the basis DB of the prism upon the summit of
 a very flat convex lens, I pressed both glasses forcibly toge
 ther, and inclined the eye towards the base, so that I could
 see the place where the glasses touched between q and AD.
 Here were exhibited a considerable number of rings, such as
those observed in daylight with two very flat convex lenses;
a complete central spot of deep black was visible at the same
time. The eye being bent still lower while the glasses re
mained unaltered, I observed the place of contact between q
and p; the central spot appeared no longer black, but a most
vivid green. When the eye was inclined still more, colours
of the brightest yellow, orange, and at last red, were exhibited
successively, until finally, when the eye was sunk still lower,
so that the place of contact came into the vicinity of total re
flexion, the deep black spot again appeared complete as
before.
   This experiment is decisive.     It proves that the hue of the
central spot depends upon transmitted light, and for ever sets
aside the possibility of the assumption, that the origin of the
spot is to be sought in interference. The colours thus obtained
are perfectly homogeneous; and hence, if the idea of inter
ference could in the least be admitted, the central spot must
remain invariably black. This however is not the case. The
colours green, yellow, orange, which the central spot assumes,
are as vivid and pure as those obtained from the best flint
glass prisms, which is especially evident when the glasses are
laid upon black paper and the light prevented from falling
upon the lens itself. Of this I convinced myself by placing an
opake screen on that portion of the lens turned towards the
light which was uncovered by the prism, and thus holding
back those rays which could fall upon the base from below.
Had the lens a stronger convexity, the colours of the central
spot, as may be readily conceived, would not be sufficiently
separated.
   Although this experiment renders further proof of the cor
rectness of my assertion superfluous, I will nevertheless intro
duce a few others which have furnished me with the same
results.
   Upon the side of the prism turned towards the light, I laid
a piece of black paper, so that light could only be received
through the lens from below. The lens and prism being pressed
more forcibly together, the place of contact, when observed

           the received Theory of Newton's Rings.            461
through the side of the prism turned towards the room, ap
peared like an uninterrupted and very bright opening passing
through both glasses, while the surrounding portion of the
base of the prism was dull and dim. This experiment proves
the uninterrupted passage of the rays through the centre
where the light falls from above upon the uncovered side of
the prism.
   When two lenses placed together were laid upon white
paper, the hue of the central spot appeared less intense than
when black or merely dark-coloured paper was used, and the
spot was not at all visible except when the light was obliquely
reflected. At smaller angles of incidence it vanished totally,
and appeared as a white circle when I looked vertically down
upon the place of contact of the glasses, the ring-system being
visible at the same time.      If, however, the darkness of the
central spot was caused, as heretofore supposed, by inter
ference, by a self-destruction of the light, the spot must con
tinue dark, even when the glasses are laid upon a white ground,
 under all possible angles of incidence, and the light proceed
 ing upwards from the paper could not cause the place of con
tact to appear white, as it actually does.
   Having united the summits of two convex lenses with Ca
nadian balsam, I laid them on a black or dark-coloured sur
face, and observed, by all incidences of the rays, that the place
on which the balsam lay exhibited the same deep black as
 when two glasses are pressed together in daylight. When,
however, the lenses were laid upon white paper, the black, as
in the case of the pressed glasses, was less intense, and the
spot also disappeared when small angles of incidence were
used. Although the continuity of the glasses in this case was
only partially effected by the balsam, still every experiment
made with the lenses thus united pronounced decisively that
the darkness of the central spot is to be referred exclusively
to the free transmission of the light at the place of contact.
   In the first experiment, it is observed that in the neighbour
hood of total reflexion, on the base of the prism, the central
spot is not surrounded by rings. Rings cannot show them
selves, because at the place where they ought to appear no
rays are transmitted which after reflexion from the lens could
interfere with those reflected from the base. The central spot,
however, appears black, because as no air exists between the
glasses at the point of contact, no total reflexion is here pos
sible, the light being permitted to pass on. For were we to
assume the existence of a layer of air at the place of contact,
the light must undergo total reflexion at this point also, and
hence the central spot must appear as bright as the surround

 ing portion. Since, therefore, the presence of a layer of air
 cannot be here assumed, the darkness of the central spot—
 even setting aside the consideration that black can never result
 from the interference of heterogeneous rays—cannot arise
 from interference, because the latter without an air-layer is
 impossible.
    The fuller development of the views expressed in the fore
 going pages I reserve to a future memoir. In submitting my
 divergence from received opinions to the judgement of those
 who understand the subject, my sole object is to bring all
 optical action, no matter of what particular kind, into coin
 cidence with the theory of undulation; so that the harmony
 of our thoughts with the divine order of Nature, at least in
 this department of science, shall remain undisturbed.

        Forbes, published in your last Number. The Edin
 burgh reviewer, on whose proof of the method of least squares
 I was commenting, says that the most probable position of
 the wafer is the centre of gravity of the shot-marks; of course
 on the supposition that in this, as in all other cases, the pro

 certain constant base raised to the power —”.
    Now, admitting this supposition to be true, the centre of
 gravity is not the most probable position of the wafer. But,
 on the contrary, if the function mentioned at the close of my
 former communication, viz. 2Pe"rdr, expresses the proba
 bility of an error r, then the centre of gravity is the most pro

LXIV. On a Deduction of Ohm's Laws, in connerion with
      the Theory of Electro-statics. By G. KIRCHHoFF".
 IN the deduction of his laws of galvanic currents, Ohm set
      out with certain assumptions regarding electricity which
are not in conformity with those it has been necessary to make
in order to explain electro-static phaenomena; he assumes
that the electricity in a conductor is at rest when it is distri
buted throughout the latter in a state of uniform density.
Now although it must always appear desirable to determine
the laws to which electrical currents are subject, by conside
rations connected with the theory of electro-statics, this be
comes absolutely requisite to enable us to produce a satisfac
tory theory of experiments, in which both electricity in mo
tion and electricity at rest are concerned,—experiments simi
lar to those made by M. Kohlrausch upon the closed circuit
with the condenser and electrometer H. My present object is
to show how Ohm’s formulae may be deduced from the elec
tro-static laws of the mutual repulsion of electrical atoms, when
certain assumptions referring to questions in the theory of elec
tro-statics, which have remained perfectly open, are brought
to bear.
   When electricity is communicated to a conductor, it will
assume a state of equilibrium, when the forces exerted by the
free electricity upon an electric atom existing in any part of
the interior of a conductor mutually neutralize each other.
This occurs when the potential of the total amount of free
electricity in relation to a point within the conductor remains
constant. Theory shows us that this can only be the case
when the free electricity has become arranged in a particular
manner upon the surface of the conductor.
   When two conductors of different kinds, as a piece of
copper and a piece of zinc, which separately contained no free
electricity, are brought into contact with each other, one con
ductor becomes positively, whilst the other becomes negatively
electrical. The electricity excited at the point of contact
soon assumes a state of equilibrium; in it the potential of the
total amount of free electricity must necessarily remain con
stant with regard to all points of each of the two conductors:
hence it follows that free electricity cannot exist within the
conductor, and that it must be situated solely upon its surface;
one portion of the electricity will remain at the surface of
contact of the two conductors, whilst another covers its free
surface.

 464     M. G. Kirchhoff on a Deduction of Ohm's Laws,
   The potential of all the free electricity is constant with re
 gard to all parts of each of the conductors: its value, how
ever, will be different in the case of the first conductor from that
of the second; for theory teaches us, that if its value were the
same in both conductors, there should be no free electricity'
present, inasmuch as the sum of all the free electricity is = 0.
Now as regards the difference between the two values of the
potential in the two conductors, this might depend upon the
nature of the material of which the two conductors were com
posed, and their form. I shall assume that it is independent
of the latter, and is that magnitude which is known as the
tension of the two bodies. Let u denote the potential of the
entire amount of free electricity in regard to a point in the
first conductor, and u, the same in regard to a point of the
second conductor; both u and u2 must then be constant; if
then Ui, a denote the tension of the two bodies, we must have
                           ul-uz-U, 2.
   If we imagine several conductors, say three, so placed in
contact that the first conductor touches the second, and this
the third conductor, the electricity in them may always assume
a state of equilibrium. If we again denote the potential of
the total amount of free electricity in any point of the first
conductor by ul, for one in the second by us, and for one in
the third by us, and further the tension between one and two by
U1, 2, that between two and three by U2, s, it is essential to
the existence of a state of equilibrium that each of the three
magnitudes, u, u, and us be constant, and that the equations
                            ul-uz-U!, a
                            ug-us=U2, a
be satisfied. But if we assume that the conductors 1, 2 and
3 have been so placed in contact that each of them comes
into contact with the two others, electric equilibrium cannot
possibly always exist in them. Should equilibrium exist,
each of the magnitudes u1, t2, and us must be constant, and
the equations
               -            wi-ta- U1, 2
                            tly-tus= U.  3
                            us-ul-Us, 1
must be satisfied. These equations, on addition, produce
                     0=U1, 2+ Us, 3-- Us, 1 ;
thence the tensions of the three conductors must satisfy this

         in connevion with the Theory of Electro-statics.      465
condition to allow of the possibility of electric equilibrium;
the condition is satisfied when the three conductors belong to
the so-called tension series.
   We have next to examine what will occur when this con
dition is not satisfied. At a particular moment the distribu
tion of the free electricity in the system will be a certain one;
I leave it undetermined whether this free electricity exists only
at the surface of the conductor, or whether it has penetrated
into its interior. Let its potential in regard to any point of
one of the conductors be u; this u is not constant, but a func
tion of the coordinates of the point to which it relates; hence
the forces which are exerted by the free electricity upon
a particle of electricity existing at any spot within the con
ductor will not retain a state of equilibrium, but produce a
definite resultant. Let us imagine the existence of an element
of space, v, within the conductor, and let us denote the above
resultant for any point in v by R. If v contains no free elec
tricity, the neutral electric fluid contained in it becomes de
composed; the positive electricity will be moved in the direc
tion of R, the negative in the opposite direction; the quanti
ties of positive and negative electricity excited in the element
v, and also their velocities, must therefore be the same. I shall
assume that the quantity of either fluid, which is moved in a
unit of time through a section of v, perpendicular to the direc
tion of R, and the magnitude of which may be denoted by
dw, is =d w k R, in which k denotes the conducting power of
the substance. To determine what takes place when v contains
free electricity, I shall assume that no motion of the electric
fluids can occur in a conductor, except when equal quantities
of the two electricities pass in opposite directions through each
surface-element of it simultaneously. Hence it follows, even
when v contains free electricity, that as much positive electricity
passes in a unit of time through dwin the direction of R, as
negative electricity in the opposite direction. As regards the
quantity of the electricities flowing through dw, I assume that
it is again = dwkR.
   If to these assumptions, most of which have been already
put forth by Weber in his electrodynamic measurements, we
further assume that the difference in the values of the poten
tial of the total amount of free electricity in the case of two
points lying in immediate proximity to each other on the
proximal and distal sides of the surface of contact of two con
ductors remains the same, whether a current flows through
the conductor, or the electricity is at rest in them; we arrive,
on the supposition that the electric condition of the system
has become stationary, at the same equations for the po

   In fact, if we denote the normal of the element by dw, that

   The same expression is obtained for this quantity by Ohm's
method, if u be used to denote the electroscopic force*.
But we may conclude from this expression, without entering
into the signification of u, that when the condition of the
system has become stationary, u must satisfy the differential
equation
                       d°u    d’u      d’u

applies in the case of every point of the surfaces of contact of
two bodies.
   To these conditions, both as regards Ohm’s proposition
and those we have enumerated, must be added, that in the
case of every point of the same surface of contact, u-ui = the
tension of the two bodies. Thus the same equations are
obtained for the magnitude u by both propositions. As regards
the currents which are determined by the differential quotients
of these magnitudes, we consequently obtain the same results
from whichever we start.        But different results are obtained in
regard to the distribution of the free electricity in the circuit.
According to Ohm, the value of u at every part of the system
directly gives the density of the electricity, which is not the
case in the view we have developed, from which, on the
contrary, it follows that even in the closed circuit free elec

tricity can only exist at the surface of the conductor. Thus
as u within one of the conductors satisfies the equation
                        2               2
                       &      dy       dz
w must be a potential of masses which are situated externally
to this conductor. But u is a potential of all the free elec
tricity; hence no part can be situated in the interior of the
former conductor, nor in any part of the interior of any con
ductor.
   The considerations we have laid down hold good whatever
the number, the form, and the arrangement of the conductors
may be which are placed in contact; they also hold good in
that case in which one plate of a condenser is placed in con
tact with a point of a closed circuit, and hence afford the
theory of experiments similar to those of M. Kohlrausch.
The results which they yield agree perfectly with those of this
experiment.
   The considerations we have laid down are based upon the
electro-static law of the action of electric particles. Neither
Ampère's electro-dynamic phaenomena, nor the phaenomena
of induction, can be explained by this law. Weber has dis
covered a more general law, by which he has succeeded in
explaining these phaenomena; a law, in the expression of
which the relative velocity of the particles, whose action upon
each other is under consideration, is introduced, and which
passes into that of electro-statics, when this velocity disappears.
In bringing the various fields of the theory of electricity under
a single point of view, we must therefore aim at deducing the
laws of the currents in the closed circuit from Weber’s law.
This deduction appears to be difficult; still it is easy to prove,
à posteriori, that the idea regarding the currents, to which
the admission of the electro-static law has led, is also in confor
mity with Weber’s law, when a certain hypothesis is called in
aid, viz. that hypothesis, according to which, on calculating
the force which a separation of the two electricities produces
in the element of space v of one of the conductors, the elec
tricities in v must be regarded as at rest. There is nothing
opposed to this view, when we bear in mind, that the motion
of the electricity in one conductor only passes from molecule
to molecule; so that every particle of electricity finds a point
of rest in a molecule which it reaches. Adopting this view, it
may readily be granted that the quantity of electricity which
is transferred from one molecule to a neighbouring one is only
occasioned by the forces which are exerted upon the particles

particle, but not by the forces, which act upon it, whilst they
are passing to the following molecule. As regards Weber's
theory of induction, it is unimportant whether this assumption
is made or not.        If it be made, and the currents in the circuit
be regarded generally as in accordance with the view of the
electro-static law, it is a matter of indifference in regard to the
magnitude and the direction of the force which tends to sepa
rate the electricities in the element v, and therefore in regard to
the electro-motor force, as Weber calls it, whether we start
from the electro-static or Weber's law. The difference which
might possibly occur must therefore arise from the forces
exerted by the electricities flowing in the other parts of the
system; and these forces, according to what Weber has
pointed out, do not contribute to this electro-motive force, in
asmuch as the currents are constant, and convey equal quan
tities of both electricities with the same velocity in opposite
directions.                                                        ---

    The passage criticised was Analyt. Prior. 11.25, and is by Aris
 totle illustrated by this example. Elephant, horse, mule, &c., are long
lived; but elephant, horse, mule, &c. have noºgall-bladder.iº. If we
 suppose that the latter proposition may be converted and put in this
 form, “all animals which have no gall-bladder are as elephant, horse,
 mule, &c.,” we may draw the conclusion that all animals which have
 no gall-bladder are long-lived. This convertibility and generalization
 of the second proposition are the necessary conditions for translating
 induction into syllogism. And Aristotle really contemplated such a
 generalizing induction. He did not contemplate what has been
 called inductio per enumerationem simplicem, which is really no indue
 tion at all. This was shown to be so by reference to the case, often
 used as an example of induction, of the inference of Kepler's laws
 from the observation of the separate planets. It may be objected
 that the reasoning in such cases is inconclusive; and to this it is
 replied, that induction, as reasoning, is inconclusive. It is a source
 of truth different from reasoning; of first truths, the bases of rea
 sonings, as Aristotle has remarked.
     April 15.-On the Mathematical Exposition of some Doctrines of
  l'olitical Economy. By the Master of Trinity.                        *     --
     The object of this paper was to solve algebraically certain pro

                   Cambridge Philosophical Society.                  469
 blems which have been solved by Mr. J. S. Mill and others by
 means of numbers, taken as examples; the principles of these writers
"being taken for granted in the algebraical solution.” Mr. Mill has
 rightly observed, that instead of saying that prices are determined
 by the ratio of demand and supply, we ought to say that they are
 determined by the equation of demand and supply. This equation
 may be thus stated, Let p be the price, and q the quantity bought
 and sold at that price. When p becomes p', let q become q'; and p'
 being equal to p(1+n), let p"q'=pq(1 +mn); this is the equation
 of demand and supply. For different commodities, we have different
 values. There are such classes of commodities as these : (A) Con
 ventional necessaries, for which m- 1: of these the same quantity is
 bought whatever be the price. (B.) Articles of fired expenditure,
 for which m-0: on these the same sum is always expended, a
 smaller quantity being bought in proportion as they are dearer.     (C.)
 Common necessaries, in which m is between l and 0; in these, when
 the price falls, the consumption is, increased, but the money ex
 pended diminished. . (D.) Popular lururies, in which m is negative:
 in these, when the price falls, the consumption is so much increased
 that the money expended on them is increased also. For corn, the
                                       ;
  mean value of m seems to be about : on this supposition a failure
  of one-fourth in the supply would double the price. The quantity
  m measures the susceptibility of the price to change when the supply
  changes, and also the intensity of the demand.
     Another division of commodities is, according to the cost of pro
  duction.    These are (a) commodities of fixed and limited supply;
  (8) commodities of fixed cost; (y) commodities of increasing cost
  for increasing supply, as for instance corn in a given limited district.
  The equation of price for the last case was given.
     The like methods were applied to solve certain problems concern
  ing international trade, treated by Mr. Mill. If the relative value
  of two commodities, C and D, in England and Germany be different,
  there will be a saving in exporting each from where it is cheaper to
  where it is dearer; and the question is, at what point prices will
  settle. We must introduce here the principle of the uniformity of
  international prices; namely, that when the trade is established, the
  relative prices of C and D will be the same in the two countries:
  the principle of the equality of imports and exports in each country;
  and the equation of demand and supply already stated. By combining
  these principles, the problem of the resulting price is solved. But
  it is found that there is no solution possible (that is, no solution in
   which both countries gain by the trade), except the mutual demand
  for the interchange of commodities be nearly equal. This limitation
   of the solution is given by the algebraical method, and seems to have
   been overlooked by previous writers.
      The same methods were extended to a greater number of ex
   ported and imported commodities; and finally, it was remarked that
   these calculations are all founded on principles of equilibrium,
   whereas a state of equilibrium is never attained; and thus the theory

may be very imperfectly applicable, like the equilibrium theory of
the tides.
    Second Memoir on the Intrinsic Equation of Curves. By the
 Master of Trinity.
    The intrinsic equation of curves, according to which any curve is
 expressed by means of an equation between its length (s) and its
 angle of deflection (?), may be conveniently used for many purposes.
 When a curve is so represented, the portion of the length which
 comes after a cusp must necessarily be taken as negative.    This had
 appeared anomalous to some mathematicians, on the ground that a
 cusp is in all cases the limit of a loop. To clear up this point, the
 author adduces two cases. (1.) The curve of which the equation is
s= ap + b sin p, which is a looped curve when b is less than a, and
 a cusped curve otherwise. But in this curve it appears that a loop
 arises from the vanishing of two cusps, and of the intervening nega
tive portion of the arc. (2.) The case of the ordinary trochoid, which
is a looped curve when the describing point is exterior to the rolling
circle, and becomes a cusped curve (a cycloid) when the point is in
the circle. But in this case the length of the trochoid is equal to
the length of an elliptical arc, which, in the case of the cycloid,
coincides with the major axis, and becomes negative beyond the
vertex of the ellipse. Other equations were examined, which give
running pattern curves with cusps, cusped curves with infinite diver
ging spirals at the extremities, and sinuous curves with infinite con
verging spirals at the extremities; and certain integrals which oc
curred in the former memoir on this subject were discussed.

         THE FIRST IDEA OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                               Sidmouth, Nov. 12, 1850.
IN the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for May, I observe that
      Professor Maunoir claims for his friend Dr. Odier the first idea
of the electric telegraph.    I herewith send you a translation from a
German work by Schwenter, entitled Delicia Physico-Mathematica,
and published in 1636, from which it will appear that the crude idea
of the electric telegraph was entertained upwards of a century before
the period alluded to by Professor Maunoir. Indeed CErsted's grand
discovery was alone wanting to perfect the telegraph in 1636. The
idea, in fact, appears to have been entertained prior even to this
date, for Schwenter himself quotes from a previous author.
                      I am, Gentlemen,
                                     Respectfully yours,

to convey some information to the other, each must be provided with
a magnetic needle so strongly touched with the magnet, that it may
be able to move the other from Rome to Paris. Now suppose that
Johannes and Claudius had each a compass divided into an alphabet
according to the number of the letters, and always communicated
with each other at six o'clock in the evening; then (after the needle
had turned round 3} times from the sign which Claudius had given
to Johannes) if Claudius wished to say to Johannes, ‘Come to me,’
he might make his needle stand still, or move till it came to c, then
to 0, then to m, and so forth.     If now the needle of Johannes' com
pass moved at the same time to the same letters, he could easily
write down the words of Claudius and understand his meaning.
This is a pretty invention; but I do not believe a magnet of such
power could be found in the world.”

ON THE SULPHURIC AND NITRIC COMPOUNDS OF BENZIN AND
                 NAPHTHALIN.        BY M. A. LAURENT.
   The author states that the last memoir of M. Piria on sulpho
naphthalidamic acid induces him to publish the labours which he has
undertaken on the same subject, but employing different processes.
   He has considered nitrobenzide, anilin, nitronaphthalin, as de
rived by substitution from benzin and naphthalin, and that the
ought to possess greater or less analogy with them.                  -
   It is well known that by treating the greater number of them with
sulphuric acid, there are obtained sulphobenzidic, sulphanilic, sulpho
naphthalic, and nitrated sulphonaphthalic acids.
   These acids may also be obtained by other processes. Thus, by
treating sulphonaphthalic acid by nitric acid, nitrated sulphonaph
thalic acid is formed, SO3, C10 HT X.
   If this latter be put into contact with sulphuret of ammonium, sul
phonaphthalidamic acid is obtained, SO3, Clo Hº Ad. This may also
be obtained by means of naphthalidamic carbamide; it is to be gently
heated with concentrated sulphuric acid; carbonic acid is imme
diately disengaged, and the liquor, diluted with water, deposits sul
phonaphthalidamic acid. Thus:—
          2SO4 H2+C24 H16N2O=2SO3 C40 H9N + CO3 H2.
                      *—v-——'
                      carbamide.
   By prolonging the action of the nitric acid on the sulphonaph
thalic acid binitrated sulphonaphthalic acid is obtained, the ammo
niacal salt of which, crystallized in fine yellow needles, contains
SO3 Clo Hº X2+H9N. This salt, treated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
deposits sulphur, and a new nitrated acid is formed, which appears
to be nitrated sulphonaphthalidamic acid, SO3 C19Hº X Ad.
   Although nitrated naphthalin is unknown, M. Laurent is of opi
mion that this base is formed by treating binitrated naphthalin with

472          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
sulphuretted hydrogen, for in conducting this operation, he obtained
a carmine-red alkali, which fused by heat in close vessels.
   When benzin is successively treated with nitric acid, sulphuretted
hydrogen and sulphuric acid, sulphamilic acid is obtained; and it
may also be procured in the following manner:—boil sulphobenzidic
acid with nitric acid, and a new acid is obtained, the ammoniacal
salt of which consists of SO3 C6H5 X-- H3 N; it is therefore nitrated
sulphobenzidate of ammonia; by treating this with sulphuretted hy
drogen, sulphanilate of ammonia is formed.
    On pouring a little nitric acid into nitrated phtalate of ammonia, a
salt is deposited, which contains C8H8 XO4+ H8N +2Aq. By heat
ing this salt till it begins to fuse, it loses water, and is converted
into nitrated phtalimide, containing CS H4 XNO”.-Comptes Rendus,

     on THE DISTILLATION of MERCURY BY HIGH PRESSURE
                     STEAM.     B.Y. M. VIOLETTE.
   This new process for the distillation of mercury, consists in im
mersing the mass to be distilled in a current of the vapour of water,
heated from 350° to 400° Centigrade: the vapour acts at once as the
heating agent and mechanical agent; it first heats the metal so as to
produce distillation, and then drives before it and draws the mercu
rial vapour, the reproduction of which it facilitates; it hastens the
distillation, just as a hot current of air increases the evaporation of
water; the aqueous vapours, charged with mercurial vapour, are con
densed together in a common refrigeratory; the metal separates at
the bottom of the receiver, while the condensed water occupies the
upper part. It is curious to observe the liquid thread which flows
from the refrigeratory; two currents or threads are distinguishable,
an upper one which is water and below is the mercurial thread; there
is a continuous current of both. No bumping occurs, and the ope
ration goes on as quietly and as easily as the distillation of water.
    The apparatus employed by the author in these experiments, con
sists of, 1st, a cast iron cylindrical retort, receiving the vessel which
contains the mercury; 2ndly, an iron worm, which, being heated, the
vapour of water circulates in it, and being heated to a proper degree,
enters the retort, traverses it from one end to the other, the mercury
being immersed in it; it then escapes, with the mercurial vapour,
and both are condensed in a refrigeratory.                    -
   The author gives in a series of tables the results which he has
obtained by a series of experiments relating to the distillation of
mercury, both alone and amalgamated; he states the quantity of
vapour necessary, and the oeconomical advantages of the new process,
which he thus details:–           -
    1. Facility of the Operation.—Simple ebullition and the distilla
tion of water are substituted for the difficult and dangerous distilla
tion of mercury; in which there is more trouble in managing the
fire, more danger of breakage of the apparatus, more difficulty in re
moving the metal, more wear of the retort; whereas in the new

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              473
process the temperature is constant and fixed, and much lower than
the red heat usually employed.
   2. GEconomy of Operation.—One workman alone can manage an
apparatus charged with 1000 kilogrammes of amalgam; the new
process is adapted even to larger dimensions.
   3. OEconomy of Fuel is certain, and practice alone can state the
amount of it; no useless expenditure of fuel will occur, since the
heat employed will not be greater than required for the distillation
of the metal.
   4. OEconomy of Mercury.—The distillation of 100 kilogrammes of
silver amalgam occasions the loss of two kilogrammes of mercury.
There are produced and annually distilled six millions of amalgamated
silver; there is therefore a loss of 120,000 kilogrammes of mercury,
worth at least one million of francs, which loss the new process avoids.
    5. Public Health.-In the new process there is no loss of mercury;
 the mercurial vapour is condensed with the vapour of water; further,
in the common operation, mercurial vapour fills the whole of the ap
paratus, and when it is opened at the close of the operation, the
 vapour is diffused in the atmosphere, whereas in the new process the
 vapour has driven all metallic vapour from the apparatus, and there
is no danger in opening it. Thus the operation is complete, and the
employment of high pressure steam seems to have effected the long
sought solution of the problem, of perfectly preserving the workmen
from the mortal attacks of mercury in the numerous and important
uses in which this metal is distilled.—Comptes Rendus, Octobre 14,
 1850.
  ON THE PRESENCE OF SUCCINIC ACID IN THE HUMAN BODY.
                           BY M. W. HEINTZ,
   On examining the colourless liquid contained in hydatic cysts,
which are frequently developed in the liver, and sometimes even in
the muscles, the author discovered that this liquid contains appre
ciable quantities of succinate of soda.
   The liquid contained in the hydatic cysts, extracted from the liver
of a woman, was colourless; it contained the remains of hydatids,
which rendered the liquid turbid when it was shaken. Its density
was 1.0076.     It was alkaline, and contained mere traces of albumen.
Neither sulphuric acid nor phosphoric acid was detected in it, but
much chloride of sodium, and a little lime, potash and magnesia.
In order to extract from this liquor the organic substances which it
contained, M. Heintz evaporated it to dryness; during the eva
poration pellicles were formed, which were renewed on removal.
The residue of the evaporation, containing crystals of common
salt, was mixed with alcohol, which occasioned the separation of a
thick syrup; the alcoholic solution did not appear to contain urea,
creatin, or uric acid; when evaporated to a syrupy consistence, it at
first deposited crystals of common salt, and afterwards some feathery
crystals, which were purified by dissolving in a small quantity of

474.           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
water, and precipitation from it by concentrated alcohol. The
aqueous solution of these crystals, treated with hydrochloric acid,
deposited small crystals of an organic acid, slightly soluble in cold
water. On attentively examining these crystals, M. Heintz ascer
tained that they were identical with succinic acid; the experiments
first performed were merely qualitative, but they were afterwards
completed by the elementary analysis, of a small quantity certainly,
of these crystals. The form of the crystals was, moreover, that of an
oblique rhombic prism; and M. Heintz found, by very exact ad
measurement, that the angles of these crystals were equal to those
of pure succinic acid. These experiments sufficiently demonstrate
the interesting fact, announced by the author, relative to the exist
ence of succinic acid in the animal oeconomy.—Journ. de Pharm.
et de Chim., Septembre 1850.
 ON A NEw COMPOUND of sulphu R, CHLORINE AND OXYGEN.
                               BY M. MILLON.
   To prepare this, fill a bottle of the capacity of 4 to 5 litres with
moist chlorine, and introduce at first 20 to 30 grms. of chloride of
sulphur saturated with chlorine, and then 2 or 3 grims. of water; agi
tate the mixture, and surround the bottle with a freezing mixture of ice
and common salt during 4 or 5 hours. A great disengagement of
hydrochloric acid occurs; the bottle is to be again filled with moist
chlorine and replaced in the freezing mixture, and this is to be re
peated till the chloride of sulphur becomes a crystalline mass. These
crystals are destroyed with violent action by water, alcohol or diluted
acids. But if, after freeing them from the chloride of sulphur
which renders them impure, they are allowed to fall into a very dry
tube, the open end of which is closed by the lamp, these crystrals
in two or three months soften, and in eight months become an ex
tremely fluid liquid; it is an isomeric transformation which becomes
evident, not only by the change of its physical qualities, but also by
the alteration of its chemical properties. Thus the liquid is no longer,
as when in the crystallized state, decomposed by water, with violence,
alcohol or weaker acids; on the contrary, when poured into water it
is quietly deposited at the bottom of the vessel in the form of an oil,
which eventually changes completely into sulphuric and sulphurous
acids. This transformation is entirely in agreement with its ana
lysis, which leads to the composition of sulphur, chlorine and oxygen,

               PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF CODEIA.
                           BY DR. ANDERSON.
    This alkali was obtained, as usual, from the mother-liquor from
 which morphia had been precipitated by ammonia. As the codeia
forms only a sixteenth to a thirtieth of the morphia, it is of course
mixed in this fluid with a corresponding quantity of muriate of am
monia, which must be decomposed by potash in order to obtain it.
Much advantage is gained, however, by first evaporating the fluid to
crystallization, and expressing the crystals deposited, as in this way
the greater part of the muriate of ammonia, which is the more soluble
salt of the two, is left in solution; and by repeating the crystalliza
tion many times, it may be entirely removed, and crystals obtained
which are pure hydrochlorate of codeia. For the preparation of
codeia, however, it would be worse than useless to carry the process
thus far, as the solubility of hydrochlorate of codeia and ammonia
differs so little, that much of the former salt would be lost; but by
carrying it a certain length, the greater part of the sal-ammoniac
may be separated without any material loss of codeia, and the sub
sequent steps of the process much facilitated. The crystals so ob
tained being dissolved in boiling water, strong solution of caustic
potash is added in excess, when codeia is in part precipitated as an
oil, which by-and-by concretes into a solid mass, and is partly de
posited in crystals as the solution cools. By evaporating the fluid,
another crop of crystals is obtained; and finally, when the mother
liquor has been concentrated to a very small bulk, it becomes filled
on cooling with long silky needles of morphia, which has been re
tained in solution by the excess of potash. A certain quantity of
morphia appears always to remain in solution along with the codeia,
but its quantity seems to vary considerably. Its presence in this
solution has been observed before, and it has been stated that it
exists in the form of a double salt with codeia; Dr. Anderson states,
however, that this is not consistent with his experience; at least the
salt separated from the muriate of ammonia by successive crystalli
zations contained no morphia, but, as has been already stated, was
pure hydrochlorate of codeia.
   The crystals of codeia precipitated by potash in the manner de
scribed, are always more or less coloured.       They are purified by
solution in hydrochloric acid, boiling with animal charcoal, and re
precipitation with a slight excess of potash, and the precipitate ob
tained finally dissolved in aether to separate any morphia which may
adhere to it. For this purpose hydrous aether is best adapted; and
it ought to be free from alcohol, as if any be present, the aether eva
porates and a syrupy fluid is left behind, which refuses to crystallize.
When the aether is anhydrous, it dissolves the codeia with much
greater difficulty; and by evaporation small crystals are deposited,
which are anhydrous.

which agrees with the previous determination of Regnault. . . . . .
    Codeia crystallized from water or from hydrous aether is obtained
in crystals, often of considerable size, belonging to the right pris
matic system, and presenting a considerable number of modifications.
These crystals contain two equivalents, or 5:67 per cent. of water."
   Codeia is an extremely powerful base, rapidly restoring the blue
of reddened litmus, and precipitating oxides of lead, iron, cobalt,
nickel, and other metals from their solutions. It is precipitated by
potash from its salts, and is generally stated to be insoluble in that
alkali; but this is true only of very highly concentrated solutions,
as a considerable quantity of strong potash may be added to a satu
rated solution of codeia in water without producing precipitation;
and even when a large amount of potash is added, a certain quantity
of the base is still retained in solution.           Codeia is soluble in am
monia, but not more so than in water: 100 parts of a moderately                         º
strong solution of ammonia dissolved, at 60°, 1'46 part of codeia;
and according to Robiquet, 100 parts of water, at 59°, dissolve 1-26
parts. Contrary to what is usually stated, Dr. Anderson found that
codeia is precipitated from all its salts by ammonia; it does not,
however, fall immediately, but is slowly deposited in small transpa
rent crystals.-Trans. Royal Soc. Edinburgh, 1850,

  ON HYPOCHLOROUS ACID AND THE CHLORIDES OF SULPHURs
                          BY M. E. MILLON.                                         * -:
    The author states, that when an aqueous solution of chlorine is
kept in bottles not exposed to light, it is preserved without any ap
preciable change; but if this solution be exposed for some time to
the direct influence of the solar rays, peculiar reactions occur. Thus
chloride of lead is thereby converted into pure oxide, and the chlo
ride of manganese gives a black precipitate of peroxide; whereas
fresh solution of chlorine does not in any way modify these two
chlorides.                                                                        :  -
    In examining to what combination of chlorine this characteristic
oxidizement of the chlorides of lead and manganese belonged, M.
Millon found that it resided exclusively in the hypochlorous acid.
This acid, C10, may thus be recognized when contained in a solution
of chlorine, even in very small quantity; for these two reagents, and
especially that of manganese, are extremely sensible.
    This action of chlorine on water is evidently identical with that
 of chlorine on the greater number of hydrogenated substances; water
 is substituted for hydrogen; and if the phaenomenon is limited, it is

because the hydrochloric acid in its turn destroys the hypochlorous
acid, and regenerates chlorine: this arrangement will be seen by
reversing the two members of the equation,
                            2C14-HO-ClO-H HCl,
                            ClO-H-HC]=2C1-H HO.
     The hydrochlorie and hypochlorous acids can coexist only in the
presence of a large quantity of water; the author proved this by
direct experiment.
     M. Millon is of opinion, that the very simple molecular relation
existing between water and hypochlorous acid ought to be extended
to the chloride of sulphur, which belongs to this system of sulphu
retted hydrogen, of which chlorine has replaced the hydrogen, equi
valent for equivalent. It will be seen by this arrangement, that the
 most chlorinated chloride of sulphur will contain two equal equiva
lents of chlorine and of sulphur. Thus it will be in vain, as chemists
well know, to attempt to combine more than one equivalent of chlo
rine with one equivalent of sulphur; on the contrary, it is easy to
 combine several equivalents of sulphur with one equivalent of chlo
 rine. The polysulphurets of hydrogen then come under considera
tion, and the following symmetries result:—

    ON THE DISCOLORATION OF SILVER BY BOILED EGGS.                  BY
         tº         * * :          M, GOBLEY.
     It is observed by the author as a well known fact, that silver,
 when brought into contact with eggs which have been heated, is
 blackened; this discoloration is owing to sulphuret of silver. It is
 usually admitted that this sulphuret is formed by the action of the
  sulphuretted oils supposed to exist in the yolk of the egg; not having
  found, in this body anything of this nature, M. Gobley thought it
  would be interesting to examine into the cause of this phaenomenon.
... Yolk of egg at common temperatures and when gently heated,
  does not discolour silver, even by contact of several hours' duration.
º, Albumen as procured from the egg, does not tarnish silver, but
  when the temperature is raised, it gives it a brown tint, which is
  stronger as the heat is greater.
      The discoloration of the silver is then due to the sulphur con
  tained in the albumen, and not to that supposed to exist in the oil
  of the egg; but is the sulphuret formed under these circumstances,
  the result of the immediate action of the sulphur upon the silver, or
 by the application of heat do the sulphur and the alkali of the albu
  minous matter react upon each other, so as to form a substance which
  is afterwards decomposed by this metal?
º, The following experiments induced the author to adopt the second
  of these opinions:—
      1. Paper impregnated with lead, when exposed to the vapour dis
  engaged from the heated albumen, is not sensibly discoloured.

478            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   2. Coagulated white of egg, treated with dilute sulphuric acid,
disengages a gas which sensibly discolours lead paper.
   3. Coagulated white of egg, brought into contact with a solution
of acetate of lead, becomes of a light brownish tint.
   The yolk of egg, under the circumstances above described, does
not act upon the salts of lead.
   Thus the discoloration of silver, by the action of eggs which have
been heated, is owing to the reaction of the sulphuret, formed by the
combination of the sulphur of the albumen on the soda which it
contains.—Journ. de Chém. et de Pharm., Novembre 1850.
   ON A TEST FOR PROTEIN COMPOUNDS.             BY M. E. MILLON.
   The very acid solution which is obtained by dissolving mercury in
its weight of nitric acid containing 4% equivalents of water, is an
extremely sensible reagent for all albuminoid substances, and for a
considerable number of secondary products which are connected
with it.
   This nitromercurial solution communicates a red colour of consi
derable intensity to these several substances, and it is easy thus to
ascertain the presence of 1-10,000dth of albumen, and even a
smaller quantity.
   To give a direct idea of the delicacy of this reagent, and perhaps
of the advantage which may be taken of it in studying the organism
of vegetables, the author states that cotton, various kinds of starch,
and gum-arabic, when put into contact with it, assume a very di
stinct rose tint. Urimes are almost immediately coloured rose-red;
after the nitromercurial solution has been added to them, and the
mixture having been heated, the urea is destroyed.
   The albumen of the blood and of vegetables, fibrin, casein, gluten,
legumin, silk, wool, feathers, horn, the epidermis, gelatin, chondrin,
protein, crystallin, the cornea, &c., are rendered of a more or less
intense red colour by this solution.
   When protein becomes soluble by the prolonged action of alkaline
solutions, or by that of sulphuric acid, the same colour is always
produced, but no insoluble matter is obtained; the solution becomes
of a deep red colour, without yielding any precipitate.
   Xanthoproteic acid, the chlorites of protein, and the oxides of
protein derived from them, separate from the preceding products;
they are not at all coloured red. This reagent exhibits differences
which it is very interesting to examine. The author has already
ascertained, that, by the action of chlorine upon albumen till the gas
ceases to be absorbed, there are formed no less than three substances
very distinct from each other.
   The nitromercurial solution is prepared by adding to the metal an
equal weight of nitric acid, containing 4% equivalents of water; reac
tion takes place rapidly in the cold; when it has become moderate,
the solution is to be very gently heated till the metal is completely
dissolved; at this point there are to be added to one volume of the
mercurial solution two volumes of water.        After some hours the
liquid portion is to be decanted from the crystals of nitrate and ni
trite of mercury. This solution reacts in the cold on albuminoid

                       Meteorological Observations.                              479
substances; but the reaction is not complete below 60° to 70° Cent.;
it is even proper to boil the mixture. Long-continued contact of
excess of the reagent does not alter the red matter. The author
has kept for more than twelve months strongly reddened albumen
in contact with excess of the mercurial solution.
    It is to be observed that the reacting power does not reside either
in the proto- or pernitrate of mercury, nor even in a mixture of them.
It is requisite that the solution which contains these two salts should
have nitrous acid added to it; till this is done, no colour is produced.
Pure pernitrate of mercury, saturated with nitrous acid, reacts sen
sibly, but much less than the mixture of the proto- and persalts satu
rated with the same nitrous acid.            Thus the simplest method of pre
paring this solution consists in treating mercury with nitric acid in
the method already described.—Ann. de Chim, et de Phys., Août 1850.

LXVII. On Aloine, the Crystalline Cathartic Principle of Bar
   badoes Aloes. By John STENHouse, LL.D., F.R.S.L. & E.*
AB9T two months ago I received from my friend Mr.
       Thomas Smith, apothecary, Edinburgh, a quantity of a
brownish-yellow crystalline substance which he had obtained
from Barbadoes aloes. Mr. Smith's process consisted in pound
ing the previously dried aloes with a quantity of sand, so as to
prevent its agglutinating, macerating the mass repeatedly with
cold water, and then concentrating the liquors in vacuo to the
consistence of a syrup. On remaining at rest in a cool place for
two or three days, the concentrated extract became filled with
a mass of small granular crystals of a brownish-yellow colour.
This is the crude substance to which Mr. Smith has given the
name of aloine, and which appears to constitute the cathartic
principle of aloes. The brownish-yellow crystals obtained in
this way are contaminated with a greenish-brown substance,
which changes to brownish-black on exposure to the air, and
still more rapidly when it is boiled. In order to purify the
crystals of aloine, therefore, they must first be dried by pres
sure between folds of blotting-paper, and then repeatedly
crystallized out of hot water till they have only a pale sulphur
yellow colour. The aqueous solutions of aloine must on no
account be boiled, but simply heated to about 150°F., as at
212°F. aloine is rapidly oxidized and decomposed. By dis
solving the purified crystals of aloine in hot spirits of wine,
they are deposited, on the cooling of the solution, in small
prismatic needles arranged in stars. When these crystals
have a pale yellow colour, which does not change when they
are dried in the air, they may be regarded as pure aloine.
    Aloine is quite neutral to test-paper. Its taste is at first
sweetish, but soon becomes intensely bitter. Aloine is not
very soluble either in cold water or in cold spirits of wine;
but if the water or the spirits of wine are even slightly warmed,

482       Dr. Stenhouse on Aloine, the Cathartic Principle
the solubility of the aloine is exceedingly increased: the
 colour of these solutions is pale yellow. Aloine is also very
 readily dissolved by the carbonated and caustic fixed alkalies
 in the cold, forming a deep orange-yellow solution, which
 rapidly grows darker, owing to the oxidation which ensues.
 The effects of ammonia and its carbonate are precisely similar.
 When aloine is boiled either with alkalies or strong acids, it
 is rapidly changed into dark brown resins. A solution of
 bleaching-powder likewise gives aloine a deep orange colour,
 which soon changes to dark brown. Aloine produces no
precipitate in solutions either of corrosive sublimate, nitrate of
 silver, or neutral acetate of lead. It also yields no precipitate
 with a dilute solution of subacetate of lead; but in a concen
 trated solution it throws down a deep yellow precipitate, which
is pretty soluble in cold water, and is therefore difficult to
wash. This precipitate is by no means very stable; and when
it is exposed even for a short time to the air, it becomes brown.
    When powdered aloine is thrown, in small quantities at a
time, into cold fuming nitric acid, it dissolves without evolving
any nitrous fumes, and forms a brownish-red solution. On
adding a large quantity of sulphuric acid, a yellow precipitate
falls, which, when it is washed with water to remove all ad
hering acid and then dried, explodes when it is heated. It
plainly, therefore, contains combined nitric acid. I could not,
however, succeed in obtaining this compound in a crystalline
state, as when it was dissolved in spirits, it appeared to be
decomposed. When aloine is digested for some time with
strong nitric acid, much nitrous gas is evolved, and it is con
verted into chrysammic acid, but without the formation of any
nitropicric acid, as is always the case when crude aloes is sub
jected to a similar treatment. A quantity of aloine was boiled
with a mixture of chlorate of potash and muriatic acid. The
acid solution was evaporated to dryness, and digested with
strong spirits of wine. The greater portion of the spirits was
removed by distillation; and the remainder, when left to spon
taneous evaporation, yielded a syrup which could not be made
to crystallize. Not a trace of chloranil was produced.
    When aloine is destructively distilled, it yields a volatile oil
of a somewhat aromatic odour, and also a good deal of resinous
matter. When aloine is heated on platinum foil it melts, and
then catches fire, burning with a bright yellow flame, and
emitting much smoke. It leaves a somewhat difficultly com
bustible charcoal, which, when strongly heated, entirely dis
appears, not a trace of ashes being left.
   A quantity of aloine dried in vacuo was analysed with chro
mate of lead in the usual way.

   The aloine employed in these analyses was prepared at
three different times. These results give C*H* O'” as the
formula of anhydrous aloine, that dried in vacuo being a hy
drate with one equivalent of water.
   When the aloine was allowed to remain in the water-bath
for more than six hours, it continued slowly to lose weight,
apparently owing to its undergoing partial decomposition by
the formation of a brownish resin. The loss of weight gra
dually continued for a week or more, but became very rapid
when the aloine was heated to 802° F., when it melted, form
ing a dark brownish mass, which when cooled became as hard
and brittle as colophonium. It still, however, contained a
good deal of unaltered aloine, as I ascertained by crystallizing
it out with hot spirits and analysing it. Much of the aloine,
however, had been changed, most probably by oxidation, into
a dark brown uncrystallizable resin.

484.      Dr. Stenhouse on Aloine, the Cathartic Principle
cold aqueous solution of aloine, a bright yellow precipitate is
immediately produced, the amount of which increases on
standing, while at the same time the supernatant liquid becomes
very acid from containing free hydrobromic acid. The pre
cipitate, after it has been washed with cold water to remove
adhering acid, is dissolved in hot spirits of wine; and on the
cooling of the solution it is deposited in bright yellow needles
radiating from centres, which attach themselves to the bottom
and sides of the containing vessel.
   The crystals of brom-aloine are considerably broader than
those of aloine, and have a richer yellow colour and a higher
lustre. Brom-aloine is quite neutral to test-paper, is not so
soluble in either cold water or cold spirits of wine as aloine,
but dissolves very readily in hot spirits of wine.

   The brom-aloine employed in these analyses was prepared
at two different times. It is plain therefore from these results,
that this bromine compound is aloine, C*H*O", in which
3 equivs. of hydrogen are replaced by 3 equivs. of bromine.
 The formula of brom-aloine therefore is C84 H16O14 Brº.
   When a stream of chlorine gas was sent for a considerable
time through a cold aqueous solution of aloine, a deep yellow
precipitate was produced. It contained a great deal of com
bined chlorine; but as it could not be made to crystallize, it
was not subjected to analysis. In the present instance, and
in those of several other feeble organic principles, such as
orcine, chlorine appears to act somewhat too strongly, so that
the constitution of the substance is destroyed, and merely un
crystallizable resins are produced. Bromine, on the other
 hand, is much more gentle in its operations, and usually simply
 replaces a moderate amount of the hydrogen in the substance,
 so that, as in the case of orcine and aloine, crystalline com
pounds are produced.

                       of Barbadoes Aloes.                       485
   It has long been known to medical practitioners, that the
aqueous extract of aloes is by far the most active preparation
of that drug. The reason of this is now very plain, as the
concentrated extract of aloes obtained by exhausting aloes
with cold water consists chiefly of aloine, by much the larger
portion of the resin being left undissolved. Mr. Smith in
forms me, that, from a series of pretty extensive trials, from
2 to 4 grs. of aloine have been found more effective than from
10 to 15 grs. of ordinary aloes. Aloine is, I should think,
therefore likely ere long to supersede, at least to a consider
able extent, the administration of crude aloes.
    I endeavoured to obtain aloine by operating on considerable
quantities of Barbadoes, Cape and Socotrine aloes. These
were macerated in cold water, and the aqueous solutions ob
tained were concentrated to the state of thin extracts on the
water-bath. I was quite unsuccessful in every instance. The
impurities contained in the extracts in these different kinds of
aloes appear, when in contact with the oxygen of the air, to
act upon the aloine so as effectually to prevent it from crystal
lizing. Aloine can only therefore be obtained in a crystalline
state by concentrating the cold aqueous solution of aloes in
vacuo; though, after the aloine has once been crystallized,
and it is freed from the presence of those impurities which
appear to act so injuriously upon it, the aloine may be quite
readily crystallized out of its aqueous solutions in the open
all".
    Though aloine has as yet only been obtained from Barba
does aloes, I have scarcely any doubt that it also exists both
in Cape and Socotrine aloes. The amount of aloine in Cape
aloes is however, in all probability, much smaller than in
either of the other two species; for Cape aloes is well known
to be a much feebler cathartic, and to contain a mass of im
purities. In corroboration of this opinion, I would refer to
the fact already mentioned in a previous part of this paper,
viz. that when aloine is digested with nitric acid, it is con
 verted into Dr. Schunck's chrysammic acid. Now it has been
 satisfactorily ascertained that all the three species of aloes yield
 chrysammic acid, of which in fact they are the only known
sources. Cape aloes, as might have been expected, yields by
far the smallest amount of chrysammic acid, together with
much oxalic and some nitropicric acids. There appears there
 fore great reason to believe that all the three kinds of aloes
 contain aloine.
     Since the above was written, I have learned from Mr. Smith
 that he has not succeeded in obtaining crystallized aloine from
 either Cape or Socotrine aloes. Mr. Smith does not doubt

486        Mr. J. Bryce on Striated and Polished Rocks
that both of these species of aloes also contain aloine, though
 most probably contaminated with so much resin, or some
 other substances, as prevents it from crystallizing. What
 tends to confirm Mr. Smith in this opinion is the observation
 he has made, that when the crude crystals of aloine are allowed
 to remain in contact with the mother-liquor of the Barbadoes
 aloes, they disappear and become uncrystallizable. I have
 also observed a similar occurrence in the mother-liquors of
 tolerably pure aloine. These become always darker and
 darker; so that if we continue to dissolve new quantities of
 aloine in them, at length scarcely any of it crystallizes out, and
 the whole becomes changed into a dark-coloured magma.
    In the year 1846, M. E. Robiquet published an account of
 an examination he had made of Socotrine aloes. By treating
 the concentrated aqueous solution of this species of aloes with
 basic acetate of lead, he obtained a brownish yellow precipi
tate, which was collected on a filter and washed with hot
water. On decomposing this lead compound with sulphu
retted hydrogen and evaporating the solution to dryness, he
obtained an almost colourless varnish, consisting of a scaly
mass, which was not in the least degree crystalline. M. Ro
biquet subjected this substance, which he called aloetine, to
analysis, and obtained the following result:-
                                   per cent.
                            8 C = 27-7
                           14 H = 10-8
                           10 O = 61-5
                                    100°O
    It is plain therefore that M. E. Robiquet's aloetime, if it
really is a definite organic principle, which I very much
question, is certainly a very different substance from the
aloine which has formed the subject of the present notice.

LXVIII. On Striated and Polished Rocks and “Roches Mou
   tonnées” in the Lake District of Westmoreland.       By JAMEs
   BRyce, jun., M.A., F.G.S.*
                            [With a Plate.]
                          I. Introduction.
     HE lake district of Westmoreland and Cumberland has
       received a very large share of attention from geologists.
Its rock-formations have been fully and accurately described,
                   * Communicated by the Author.

                    and “Roches Moutonneés.”                    487
chiefly in several able memoirs by Professor Sedgwick; and
respecting the more striking erratic phaenomena, such as the
dispersion of the Shap granite, there has been much discus
sion. This subject, indeed, has elicited several papers of the
highest order of geological investigation from the pen of Mr.
Hopkins of Cambridge; but no detailed examination, that I
am aware of, has been made of the superficial formations gene
rally, with the view to determine, as respects the other rocks,
either the direction or the aera of the transport on the differ
ent sides of the central mountains.       Scratched rocks afford
evidence on this subject of a most satisfactory kind. Up till
this time, however, they have not been noticed in the lake
district. It is hoped, therefore, that the present communica
tion will prove not unacceptable to geologists, as a slight con
tribution towards a better understanding of the erratic phae
nomena of the lake mountains.
    The credit of this interesting discovery is due to Edward
Wakefield, Esq. of Birklands, near Kendal. Knowing that
in the cuttings of the Kendal and Windermere railway, as
well as in quarries adjoining, the surface of the rocks had
been laid bare in many places, Mr. Wakefield instituted a
careful search along the line in May last, and was so for
tunate as to discover two extremely well-marked examples
of scratched rocks. While on a visit in Kendal in July I
was shown these cases by Mr. Wakefield: in company with
him several others were afterwards noticed. I gave a short
account of these rocks to the Geological Section of the British
Association at the Edinburgh meeting in August, and propose
now to describe them in greater detail.
                  II. Markings at Jacob Wood.
    The best marked case occurs on the north-west side of
Jacob Wood, about one mile south of the Staveley station of
the Kendal and Windermere railway, about fifty yards from
the railway on the north-east side. It will be most conveni
ently visited by stopping at the Staveley station, and then pro
ceeding towards Kendal along the turnpike road. Here, on
the northern side of a gently rising, inconsiderable undulation
of the ground, near to many projecting rough slate rocks, the
scratched surfaces are seen. By the removal of a covering of
till, containing boulders, several feet in depth, a surface of rock
was laid bare extending 53 feet 3 inches from north-east to
south-west by 15 feet 9 inches in a direction perpendicular
to this.   It was uncovered about two years ago in making a
road into the adjoining fields; the rock was to have been re
moved, but it was found so difficult to work, from its great

488       Mr. J. Bryce on Striated and Polished Rocks
toughness and hardness, that the quarry was abandoned; and
to this circumstance we owe the preservation of perhaps the
most perfect specimen of striated rocks to be seen in the three
kingdoms. I have visited most of the localities in Scotland
where such rocks occur, but have met with nothing so perfect.
It is impossible by any drawing or description to convey an
adequate notion of the strikingly beautiful and perfect cha
racter of the striation, polishing, and rounding of the rocks
here exhibited. The accompanying Plate (Pl. II.) representing
a portion of the surface will assist. It is from a drawing most
kindly taken at my request by James Henry Gough, Esq. of
 Kendal, and transmitted for the illustration of my paper laid
before the Edinburgh meeting already referred to.
    The surface is traversed by four eminences of an elliptic
form, running in the direction of the breadth, smooth, rounded
and highly polished, and presenting exactly the character of
the most perfect specimens of the “roches moutonnées,” so
well-described and figured by Agassiz in his work on the
Alpine glaciers. These eminences, and the hollows between,
are thickly covered in every part by striae and grooves, the
great majority of which run in the direction of 10° W. of
magnetic north, or 34° W. of true north, taking the variation
at 24° W., which I am informed by Prof. Phillips of York, is
its present amount in this district. They thus point very nearly
in the direction of the opening of Kentmere, or more exactly
in the direction of Staveley Head, a hill of no great elevation
(1000 feet?) on the western side of the entrance to Kentmere.
    Most of the striae are very fine, being mere touches as by
a delicate graving-tool; others are traced with greater bold
ness; and the grooves are often of considerable width, as
from # inch to 1% inch, or perhaps more in a few cases. . A
great many of the striae are inclined to the prevailing direction
already given; but the angles seldom exceed a few degrees,
and by far the greater number deviate very little from the
direction above stated.      This direction is across the beds, or
at right angles to the stratification of the slate, which here
belongs to the division called the Lower Ludlow Rock by
Prof. Sedgwick. It is plain, indeed, that the striae have no
connexion with, or dependence on, the internal structure, or
the unequal wearing of component laminae having different
powers of resisting the causes of waste. From the very com
pact character of the Lower Ludlow Rock, in many places
it is often difficult to determine the position of the true beds.
“This can sometimes be done,” says Professor Sedgwick,
“by help of alternating bands of coarser materials wherein the
original bedding has not been obliterated by the slaty struc

                    and “Roches Moutonnées.”                         489
ture; a mass of slate between two such bands must have its
bedding parallel to them. . . . . In many cases we can ascertain
the lines of the true beds by an internal and secure test. The
planes of the slates are often marked by parallel stripes of
different colours. Among the finer green slates these stripes
are generally paler than the other parts of the rock; and as
they mark the original lines of sediment, they are therefore
parallel to the true bedding; indeed they generally mark the
passage from one bed to another. Sometimes these stripes
are seen on slaty laminae, cutting through pyritous bands with
shells and corals; and in such cases the stripes upon the
smooth surfaces of the slates are always parallel to the fossil
bands*.”
   Now, though in the case we are considering the bedding is
very obscure, we have for our guidance “the internal and
secure test” above mentiomed, the true direction of the beds
being marked by parallel stripes of different colours. These
facts are stated thus fully, because there are still some who
maintain that rock-striation is structural, or in the direction
of the beds, and has been produced by the unequal wearing
of the constituent laminae under the action of water, and is
not due to the passage of ice or boulders across the surface.
But it is unnecessary to enter into a discussion of views so
entirely opposed to established facts t.
                     III. At Birthwaite Station.
   The next example is seen at Birthwaite, the present ter
minus of the same railway, within the grounds belonging to
the station. Here the surface of the Lower Ludlow Rock has
been stripped of its covering of detritus to an extent of 45 feet
in a direction perpendicular to the striae, and of 15 feet in a
line with them. This surface is similarly divided into several
rounded, smooth, and polished bosses or eminences of an ellip
tic form, whose greater axis is in the direction of the striae, or
across the surface; and which, though less regular in form,
have the same “moutonnée" character as at Jacob Wood.
The prevailing direction of the striae and grooves is magnetic
N. and S., or about 24° W. of true N. Many, however, are
inclined to this direction at various angles. On the western
side the direction is chiefly N.W. and S.E., but in the middle
and on the eastern side they have the range above stated,

Lakes, one of the most interesting and valuable books of this class which
we have ever met with.

the Journal of the Geol. Soc., vol. ii.

 490        Mr. J. Bryce on Striated and Polished Rocks
 which is very nearly coincident with the direction of the upper
 part of Windermere and the Vale of Ambleside.           As in the
 former case, the striae and grooves run across the stratifi
 cation of the rock, which is very hard and tough. The strata
 are nearly on edge, and range about E.N.E. and W.S.W.
                     IV. At Birthwaite Church.
    The inclosures of the new church of Birthwaite, about a
 quarter of a mile further west on the road to Ambleside, afford
 another remarkable instance. Slate rocks having the same
 range and inclination here rise above the ground in many de
 tached knolls, the surfaces of which in most parts are tra
 versed by numerous striae and furrows running very nearly in
 the direction of the magnetic meridian, as in the instance last
 given. Some are, however, inclined to this direction, usually
 at small angles. A few only were noticed, running about
 N.E. and S.W. These markings are seen not only upon
 horizontal or slightly inclined surfaces, but are marked hori
 zontally even upon those which are vertical or slightly over
hanging. Beyond the inclosure, on the western side, the
 rocks are similarly marked.
    There is another series of peculiar markings in this locality
 apparently of posterior date and different origin. These are
 deeper, and have their edges less worn and rounded, while they
 are not so much discoloured by weathering as the rest of the
 rock; and thus they look like artificial furrows made by
an iron instrument passing, under great pressure, in parallel
lines across the surface. They are numerous and regular,
and constant in their direction, which is the same in general
as that of the other grooves and striae; they are horizontal
upon vertical surfaces; and hence, as well as from the height
of the rock above the surface of the ground, it is difficult to
conceive that they have been produced otherwise than by
natural causes. I visited the place in company with Edward
Wakefield, Esq. of Birklands, and John Elliot Howard, Esq.
of Tottenham, near London; and though we made a length
ened and careful examination of the phaenomena, we felt un
certain what conclusion to deduce, and were all of opinion
that, till further evidence was obtained, it would be unsafe to
ascribe the whole of these markings to the operation of natural
CauSeS.
                      V. Detached Markings.
   On the rising ground east of Birthwaite Church, a rocky
surface of small extent exhibits striae and grooves running in
the same direction, but less perfect than those already described.

                    and “Roches Moutonnées.”                          491
    Again, about half a mile west of Staveley, on the south side
 of the Ambleside road, upon the upper surface of a quarry
 which slopes to the north, very perfect furrows and striae are
 seen running about S.E., and the surface is rounded and
polished. A portion of an elliptic boss was noticed, showing
that before the rock was quarried so far, there had existed a
highly illustrative example of the “roche inoutonnée.” By
 the further removal of the superficial detritus, similar markings
will no doubt come into view.
                   VI. Theory of the Markings.
    Pursuing this inquiry in company with the gentlemen before
mentioned, the Ambleside and Grasmere vales were traversed
as far as the summit of Raise Gap; and the upper part of the
 valley running thence northwards as far as the head of Thirl
mere, with the whole western flank of Helvellyn, without
noticing further cases. Our examination was, however, rather
cursory; a closer investigation would probably have detected
additional examples. It is highly desirable that the valleys
descending to the N.E. and N.W., and opening towards Pen
rith and Cockermouth, should be carefully examined with
reference to the existence of such markings. Their discovery
in these valleys, in connexion with the facts stated in this
communication, would throw much light upon the history of
the superficial deposits of the lake district, and the nature of
the forces by which the great masses of transported materials
filling the outer valleys and the plains at the base of these
mountains were brought into their present situations. In a
series of most able papers, supported by mathematical rea
sonings and calculations, Mr. Hopkins has undertaken to
show that the lake mountains have been raised to their pre
sent height by many successive elevations of a paroxysmal
character; that these gave rise to great “waves of translation”
and diverging currents of enormous power; so great, for ex
ample, “that an elevation of 100 or 150 feet would produce a
current capable of transporting, for at least a short distance
and under favourable circumstances, a block of immense
weight,” and consequently lighter materials to great distances *.
During the periods of repose the action of the sea would
scoop out valleys near the centre of elevation, and hence the
great system of diverging valleys which run from the central
group. This operation would be determined in the first in
stance, and greatly facilitated in its progress by the prior ex

istence of those great faults, which are known to traverse most
of the valleys radiating from the central group; for example,
in Long Sleddale, Kentmere, the upper part of Windermere,
Coniston, the Duddon, Eskdale, Wastwater, Ennerdale, Mar
dale, &c. The materials thus loosened would be transported
from their parent beds, further and further at each successive
elevation of the land, and so might reach great distances, as
the hills of Derbyshire and the eastern wolds of Yorkshire.
During this period the striation and <U+017F>urrowing may have been
produced upon the surfaces exposed, below the sea-level, to
the wearing action of the drift; and it is worthy of note, that
the phaenomena now detailed respecting these confirm, so far
as they go, the theory we have been stating. The grooves
and striae have a diverging direction, those at Jacob Wood
having a more easterly bearing than those at Birthwaite;
while the valley of the Kent presents to us a succession of
ridges of sand and gravel of coincident direction with the
former, and containing fragments of rocks which must have
come from the north. The hill immediately adjoining Ken
dal, on which Kendal Castle stands, another hill south of
it, of the same form and dimensions, and many others in this
vale, might be cited as examples. It would be highly inter
esting to ascertain, by an examination of the kind before .
alluded to, whether this partial conformity is an isolated phae
nomenon, or is part of a great system of diverging striae,
marking the quaquaversal direction of the denuding and trans
porting forces.
    The phaenomena which we have described are such as
glaciers could have produced, and are actually giving rise
to in many places; and it is not denied that glaciers may have
once existed in the high central valleys. But their agency,
or that of icebergs, is quite insufficient, as has been shown by
Mr. Hopkins, “to account for the most important phaeno
mena of distant transport from the Cumbrian mountains;”
such, for example, as the dispersion of the Shap boulders;
and as two causes for the same effect are inadmissible, it seems
unnecessary to have recourse to the agency of ice at all, since
the diluvial theory, as above stated, is adequate to explain all
the appearances-—the deposition of the superficial detritus,
and the distant transport of boulders, as well as the scooping
out of the valleys, and the striation and grooving, the rounding
and polishing of exposed rocky surfaces.

LXIX. Analysis of the Theory of Equations. Second and Con
    cluding Part. By JAMES CockLE, Esq., M.A., Barrister
    at-Law. In a Letter to T. S. DAVIES, Esq., F.R.S. &c.”
      [The First Part will be found at pp. 351–367 of vol. xxxii. S. 3..]
                                                   2 Pump Court, Temple,
       MY DEAR SIR,                                    October 8, 1850.
 1.       ARIOUS considerations, which it is not necessary to
            detail, render it desirable that, in resuming and con
cluding the subject of a former letter of mine to you, I should
confine my remarks to rational equations. And I shall be
forgiven for reminding you, and those under whose notice
this letter may perhaps eventually come, of the existence in
print, not only of that former letter, but also of my Notes on
the Theory of Algebraic Equations, commenced in the forty
sixth volume of the Mechanics’ Magazine, and the Third and
Concluding Series of which is now in the course of publica
tion in that Journal.        I mention these Notes rather than other
papers of mine, because in them, as in this Analysis, I have
attempted, though from different points of view, to take some
thing like a general survey of the whole subject.
    2. All those equations, the discussion of which forms the
primary object of the Theory before us, involve at least one
general symbol—that of the unknown quantity—and are, con
sequently, algebraic in their form. But a little consideration
enables us to perceive that such equations may be advantage
ously separated into two great classes, the characteristics of
which are respectively furnished by an observation of the
nature of the coefficients of the unknown quantity. When any
one or more of the coefficients of a given equation is a letter,
or general symbol, the equation may be termed a literal,
symbolic, or algebraic equation. When all its coefficients are
numbers, it may be called a numerical or arithmetical equation.
These two classes then, (a) the literal, and (b) the numerical,
include all equations algebraic in their form.
    3. But, if we should carry our views further than the mere
form of the equation, and look beyond that to the object we
have in view in discussing it, we must admit a third and hy
brid class which partakes of the natures of the other two, being
literal in its form, but virtually numerical, inasmuch as all our
processes treat the literal coefficients, not as general symbols,
but as generalized numbers. For the sake of clear and accu
rate classification, I shall separate the class of literal equations
into two others, the algebraic, and the quasi-algebraic. In
      * Communicated by T. S. Davies, Esq., F.R.S.L. & E., F.S.A.

 494. Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
justification of the use of this last term, I may observe that
  Sir J. W. Lubbock has applied the term quasi-literal to cer
 tain astronomic developments (Theory of the Moon, Pre
 face to Part V., p. ix.).
     4. We thus have three great classes of equations,—(1) the
 algebraic, (2) the quasi-algebraic, and (3) the numeric. And
 this is no arbitrary classification, but one arising from the very
 nature of the subject; for, call these classes by what name we
 will, the results aimed at in the first are very different from
those anticipated in the second and third, which last, again,
have different aims and processes. The theory of algebraic
equations belongs exclusively to Symbolical Algebra, and
rigorous symbolical results are the only ones aimed at. In
the quasi-algebraic theory we investigate such general pro
cesses, and properties of equations, as shall be ancillary to the
operations of the numeric theory, and shall enable us to apply
the latter operations with certainty and effect.
    5. Adopting substantially the arrangement given in my
former letter, we shall have the whole Theory of Equations
comprised in seven departments, of which the algebraic theory
contains four;-viz. I. Elimination and Solution; II. Trans
formation; III. Multiplicity of Solutions; IV. Relations
between Coefficients and Roots, including the theory of Sym
metric Functions. In the quasi-algebraic theory are comprised
two departments, viz. V. The nature of the roots; VI. Their
limits. To the numeric theory appertains VII. The nume
rical values of the real roots and of the real quantities involved
both in the real and imaginary parts of the expressions for the
unreal roots.
    6. Hence, neither the quasi-algebraic nor the numeric
theory belong exclusively to Arithmetical Algebra. It is con
ceivable that an unreal root may be completely determined
by purely numerical processes; and, in fact, Dr. Rutherford
has, in his ‘Complete Solution of Numerical Equations,’ en
tered upon such a course of inquiry. To this I may add that
you yourself, in some notes printed with my former letter,
evidently regard the determination of the unreal roots as
coming within the scope of the numeric theory. In like man
ner, the quasi-algebraic theory contemplates the existence of
unreal roots, and seeks to ascertain their nature and limits.
As my purpose is, however, not to discuss the last-mentioned
theories, but to proceed to that of equations purely algebraic, I
must dismiss the subject—at least for the present. But, before
I do so, I cannot refrain from naming a most important addition
to the quasi-algebraic theory, in the shape of a tract on ‘The
Analysis of Numerical Equations,' which constitutes the First

   Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations. 495
Part of a projected series of papers “On the General Prin
ciples of Analysis’ by our friend Professor J. R. Young, late
of Belfast. This first Part is the only one that has as yet ap
peared. The obstacles to the further publication of the work
are stated on the cover of Part I., and will, I sincerely trust,
be speedily obviated by its more extended circulation among
mathematicians. It will richly repay perusal, and gives new
and efficient means of analysing an equation. In explanation
of the principle involved in it, I shall venture to say, that,
some two or three years ago, in the course of my Horae Alge
braica, I employed Mr. Gompertz's process for porismatizing
expressions, and I porismatized the surd factors of a quadratic
for the purpose of ascertaining whether in certain cases, the
roots of the given quadratic being known, the surd factors so
porismatized admitted of being made to vanish when the
natural and obvious signs were given to the radicals. [See
Mechanics’ Magazine, vols. xlvii. pp. 409, 410, and xlviii.
pp. 181–183.] By reversing this process, and changing its
object, Professor  %.       has been enabled, from the exami
nation of the porismatized surd factors of equations of all de
grees, to arrive at a knowledge of the nature and limits of the
unknown roots. This statement neither implies, nor is it in
tended to imply the slightest claim to Professor Young's re
searches.    I neither have, nor do I wish to be considered as
having, any. This appears to be the proper place for adding,
that some of the topics included in the algebraic theory—such
as elimination and transformation—enter likewise into the
other theories in certain cases. The numerical process of
solution is in fact, in certain cases, a series of transformations.
And in this, as in most other similar instances, we find one
department insensibly encroaching upon another. For ex
ample, it is difficult to refrain from considering the alge
braic solution of a cubic as it bears, both upon the nature, and
 upon the numerical evolution of the roots. Such considera
tions are the common ground upon which two or more de
 partments coalesce, but it will serve no purpose to allude
 further to them.
    7. A basis for the classification of algebraic equations is
 presented to us, either in the dimensions to which the unknown
 quantities enter into a given equation, or in the number of
 those unknowns, or in a combination of considerations derived
 from both sources. An equation of n dimensions is said to
 be of the nth degree. An equation between n unknowns is
 said to be of the nth order. | have now for some time adopted
 this word order in exclusive reference to the number of un
 knowns contained in an equation.         And I shall continue to

496 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
apply it rigidly in the same sense. Great practical conveni
ence will be found to result from this nomenclature; but I
will observe that, as equations of the first four degrees are
designated by the respective names of linear, quadratic, cubic,
and biquadratic equations, so I have proposed to give to equa
tions of the first four orders the respective titles of simple,
binary, tertiary, (or ternary,) and quaternary equations. This
will save much circumlocution, but it will be necessary to
banish the term simple as applied to equations of the first
degree. No inconvenience need attend the new application of
the term. The term “simple equation,’ as hitherto used, is a
mere synonym for “linear equation,’ while, as applied to equa
tions of the first degree, the latter term is far more appro
priate, on the ground of analogy with “quadratic,’ &c. Ana
logy would further justify us in using the abbreviations “n-ic
equation’ to denote an equation of the nth degree, and ‘m-ary
equation' to denote an equation of the mth order. The term
‘ m-ary n-ic’ would completely define any algebraic equation.
While upon this subject I may take the liberty of referring
you to my remarks on it at pp. 509, 510, 582, 3. of vol. xlv.
of the Mechanics' Magazine.
   8. But, of these appellations “degree’ and ‘order,’ which
is to be Genus, and which Species? It is important to make
a correct choice, for an improper selection would vitiate our
arrangement, and introduce confusion instead of method. My
answer to the above inquiry is, that degree is to be regarded
as Genus, and order as Species. And this arrangement will
not only be found to be, philosophically speaking, more ac
curate, but it is also more practically convenient, and, unques
tionably, more in conformity with the historic development
of the Theory of Equations. It was only by reducing its so
lution, to that of two simultaneous binary equations, that a
cubic was first solved.    In other words—if we use the word
complea in contradistinction to simple—the solution of a simple
cubic involved the solution of complex equations of degrees
virtually, if not formally, lower than a cubic. Hence, in what
follows, I shall carry, as far as may seem desirable, the dis
cussions of different orders of equations of a lower degree
before proceeding to those of equations of a higher degree.
The benefit of this, to a limited extent the ordinary course,
 will be seen as we proceed.
    9. Of simple linear equations little more need be said than
that their solution is effected by algebraic addition, subtrac
tion, multiplication and division, or one or more of those
 operations, all of which we may include in the common name
 reduction. Where several simultaneous complex linear equa

    Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.      497
tions are presented for solution, we proceed by elimination to
the formation of simple linear equations, each involving one
of the unknowns. In such equations each unknown admits
of one value only, and no elevation of degree is introduced by
elimination. If we have n linear relations among powers (or
roots) of n unknown quantities, then provided that the same
quantity is affected with the same power (or root) in each of the
relations, we may determine the values of the powers (or roots)
of each of the unknowns by linear elimination, and conse
quently the unknown itself may be determined by evolution
or involution. These two latter terms (which might be com
prehended under the common name volution) I should pro
pose to restrict to arithmetical or, at all events, to determined
quantities. And I should incline to appropriate the word
elevation to that operation which consists in affixing a positive
integral index to an undetermined quantity. It is needless to
say what is meant by the expansion of a quantity, so elevated,
but by contraction we may denote the passage from the deve
loped to the undeveloped form of the elevated quantity. By
depression we may signify the affixing a fractional index with
unity for its numerator and a positive integer for its denomi
nator. When the indices are the same as in the previous
cases but negative, we may term the respective operations ne
gative elevation or depression as the case may be. When the
index has for its numerator and denominator integers prime
to one another, the operation indicated consists, of course,
both of elevation and depression.
   10. It is only for the purpose of calling your attention to
its connexion with the above considerations respecting com
plex linear equations, and with the fact that, when a power is
known, the root may be considered as known, that I here
mention Varignon's solution of a quadratic. This solution
(see Phil. Mag. S. 2. vol. iv. pp. 314, 462, 463) is an appli
cation to quadratics of the indeterminate method employed in
the original solution of a cubic. But the ordinary solution
affords ample exercise for reflection, independently of its in
troducing us to the idea of multiple solutions, and the germ
of the theory of symmetric functions. It presents to us two
distinct methods; the one capable of being rendered perfectly
general, the other partially so. The process common to both
—that of adding and subtracting the same quantity to an ex
pression, and so changing its form and leaving its value un
altered—may be called the method of superposition. In the
case of a quadratic, the quantity superposed is (I speak of the
ordinary process) the square of half the coefficient of the first
power of the unknown. This superposition is followed by a
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. No. 253. Suppl. Vol. 37.             2 K

498     Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
eontraction, the contraction by depression, and, lastly, a simple
transposition furnishes us with the required roots.
    11. In the case of a quadratic the superposition is of the
simplest kind. A determined quantity is added and sub
tracted. But, if we suppose the quantity superposed to be
undetermined in its value, we give our analysis a greater range.
Under this new form I shall term it the subsidiary method, as,
in my ‘Notes’ above alluded to, I have previously done, in
allusion to the subsidiary quantity so introduced. The sub
sidiary method is not, however, limited to the use of one new
undetermined quantity. Simpson's solution of a biquadratic,
as given by Murphy at p. 54 of his Theory of Equations, is
an instance of a subsidiary process involving three undeter
mined quantities B, C, D, besides the unknown a. As there
employed, the quantity m appears to be used, rather to deter
mine the subsidiaries, than as a subsidiary in itself. But by an
alteration of the process, which I shall not dwell on, m might
either be dispensed with altogether, or be made a strictly sub
sidiary quantity, and, thus, the means of observing uniformity
of method. So, by a slight change of form, my solution of an
imperfect cubic (Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxii. pp. 502, 503) may
be presented as effected by a quadratic subsidiary function of
a and p. Again, Ferrari's solution of a biquadratic is a sub
sidiary one. And there is a certain form of equations of the
fifth degree (that which I proposed for solution in the Diary
for 1849) which admits of a subsidiary solution.
    12. The case, that I have just alluded to, is that in which
we superpose a subsidiary quantity or quantities foreign to the
expression in its primitive form. But suppose that we have
before us a quadratic function involving, in its original state,
m undetermined or unknown quantities besides determined or
known ones. Then, in general, by means of successive su
perpositions we may reduce the given quadratic function to
the form of a sum of m squares of linear functions of the un
knowns, together with the square of a known quantity. This
remark I shall bring to bear presently.
    13. But, before doing so, let us proceed to examine the
species of complex equations that belong to the genus qua
dratics. The first question that now presents itself is, Can
we solve two simultaneous binary quadratics by means of equa
tions of no higher degrees than quadratics? I call this the
first question, because it is sufficiently obvious that, if we are
required to solve n linear and one quadratic, all of the (n+1)th
order, or of some lower one, then no elevation of degree will be
introduced by elimination. Nor will such elevation be intro
duced by any number of linear equations in combination with

   Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations. 499
others. Hence we may always confine our attention to the
non-linear equations, and consider that as done which is always
possible, viz. the elimination of as many unknowns as there
are linear equations. But, to our question. In general, two
binary quadratics do not admit of solution by quadratics and
linears only; but such a system may be solved when either the
squares or the product of the unknowns appear in every term
involving the unknowns. It will shortly be seen that this par
ticular case introduces into the theory of equations a general
process of solution.
    14. We have now exhausted the subject of the determinate
solution of quadratics by means of quadratics, and are about
to enter on the exhaustless field of indeterminate quadratics,
that is to say, of systems of simultaneous quadratics whose
order is greater than the number of equations to be satisfied.
 For, true to a principle originally laid down, I shall discuss,
as far as practicable, the various species of quadratics before
going to the higher genera of equations. The first question,
of the indeterminate kind, that is presented to us is,—Whether
it be possible to solve two simultaneous tertiary quadratics
by means of quadratics and linears only? The answer is,-Yes,
by various processes, an outline of which I give below.
   (a.) They may be solved by a combination of superposition,
transformation, and the process used in solving two binary
quadratics free from the first power of the unknowns. Calling
this the homogeneous process, we may sketch our solution as
follows:–By successive superpositions (in the first of which
the superposed quantity involves two, in the second one, and
in the third none, of the unknowns) we may reduce one of the
given quadratics to the form of a sum of four squares, one of
which does not involve the unknowns.       Take the linear func
tions of the unknowns of which the squares are obtained by
these superpositions as new unknowns. Transform the second
of the given tertiary quadratics into another in which the new
unknowns shall be the only undetermined quantities. As
none of the old unknowns have yet been determined, so the
new system is as indeterminate as the original one. Now, de
termine one of the three new unknowns, in terms of the other
two, in such a manner as that neither of the three shall enter
linearly into the second quadratic. Then the two given ter
tiaries are reduced to two binaries of a form which, as we have
already seen, is completely solvible by quadratics. I term
this the method of homogeneous elimination, and I have given
its application to the solution of two tertiaries under a some
what different form (see Mechanics’ Magazine, vol. xlviii.
pp. 605, 606), by decomposing each unknown into the sum of
two new unknowns.
                              2 K 2

500 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
   (b.) If, after reducing one of the two given tertiaries to the
form of four squares as above suggested, we group them two
and two, and equate each group to zero; then, each group
being the sum or difference of two squares, is capable of being
decomposed into linear factors. Equate to zero one factor of
each group, then the tertiary so grouped vanishes. And, eli
minating, by means of the two vanishing factors, two of the
unknowns from the remaining tertiary, the latter becomes a
simple quadratic in the third unknown, which is then deter
mined; and afterwards the others are obtained by substitution
for the third in the vanishing factors, which are then treated
as ordinary binary linears. This is the method of vanishing
groups, of which I have given an “Account” in the Philoso
phical Magazine (S. 3, vol. xxxii. pp. 114-119), and to which,
as far as I had then developed it in print, you will find refer
ences in a note [f] to my fifth paper on the Transformation of
Algebraic Equations, at pp. 178, 179 of the third and conclu
ding volume of the Mathematician.
   (c.) Although Mr. G. B. Jerrard's method of vanishing co
efficients (as I have proposed to term it) be not directly appli
cable to the solution, in their explicit form, of three tertiary
quadratics by quadratics and linears only, yet, in all probabi
lity, it would not be difficult, by decomposing the unknowns,
or some of them, into the sums of others, to give the tertiaries
such a form as to admit of the application of Mr. Jerrard's
processes. Full information respecting Mr. Jerrard’s analysis
will be found in his “Mathematical Researches,’ and in Sir
W. R. Hamilton’s “Inquiry’ into the subject at pp. 295–
348 of the Sixth Report of the British Association. Mr. Jer
rard’s method of elimination differs from the ordinary one in
this, that from an expression he expels, successively, all the
powers of a quantity, which he wishes to remain undetermined
in value, by making the coefficient of each power vanish. This
he does by a powerful algebraic indeterminate analysis, quite
distinct from the analysis known by that name in the ordinary
treatises on algebra. Those who delight to trace the analo
gies which the different branches of all sciences suggest, may
derive satisfaction from comparing Mr. Jerrard's method with
that pursued in the strictly Diophantine Analysis, that given,
for instance, at pp. 306–343 of the fourth edition of Professor
J. R. Young's Algebra. Consider, by way of example, the
manner of rendering rational the cube root of a cubic function
of a. This rationalization, when possible, is effected by ob
taining an equation in ar, from which all powers of a, except
the first, are expelled.
   15. Of course we may readily solve two quaternary qua
dratics without equations higher than quadratics. For we

    Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations. 501
*may give an arbitrary value to one of the unknowns and
 then apply, to the resulting tertiaries, the processes just dis
 cussed. So, we may make the fourth unknown subservient to
 a simplification of those processes. If we employ the method
 of homogeneous elimination, we may (see Mec. Mag. vol.xlviii.
 p. 512) so use the fourth unknown as to avoid the superpo
 sitions and transformation prescribed in (a.). If we employ
 the method of vanishing groups, we may, by expelling the
 first power of one of the unknowns, avoid one of the super
 positions; or, by expelling the first power of all the unknowns
 simultaneously, we may abridge all the superpositions. In
 applying the method of vanishing coefficients we should also,
 most probably, materially shorten our operations. And, pos
 sibly, in all three methods an advantageous relation might be
 established between the two given complex quadratics. If we
 have given for solution two quadratics of the fifth order, Mr.
 Jerrard’s process becomes explicitly and immediately appli
cable. I would here add, that, by a combination of the method
of disposable multipliers with that of vanishing coefficients (to
which latter method the former may, in innumerable instances,
be made subservient), we may, as I have shown (Mech. Mag.
vol. xlix. p. 10), solve two tertiary quadratics without any de
composition whatever.
    16. And here, with another remark or two, I shall leave
the subject of the quadratic solution of complex quadratics.
You will understand, by the term “quadratic solution,” solu
tion without the occurrence of equations of a degree higher
than the second,      You will not, however, fail to remark that
the subject is inexhaustible, and that there are infinite num
bers of systems which admit of a quadratic solution. The
method of vanishing groups, for instance, enables us to obtain
quadratic solutions of m simultaneous quadratics of the
(2”— 1)th order. It must be borne in mind, that, in attempt
ing the application of the method of homogeneous elimination
to the quadratic solution of more than two complex quadratics,
we must, by the aid of superposition, disposable multipliers,
and a sufficient number of undetermined quantities, endeavour
to form a number of distinct systems, each system consisting
of two equations in each of which two unknowns are homo
geneously involved; the unknowns being different in each
system. Or we may combine, as circumstances may suggest
or require, the three different general methods considered in
the 14th article of this letter. Let me here add an important
remark connected with the method of vanishing groups.
When the squares of all the unknowns are absent from a
given complex quadratic, or when any square or squares

502 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
vanish at a critical stage of our superpositions, the general
method admits of modification. I have exhibited a particular,
but useful, case of such modification (I allude to the case of
tertiary functions) at page 547 of vol. xlvii. of the Mechanics’
Magazine. In the case where some or all the squares disap
pear from a tertiary quadratic function, Professor Hearn has
(Mathematician, vol. iii. p. 198) suggested a process which
may also be generalized and adopted in place of my modifi
cation.   On Professor Hearn's neat and able discussion of
surfaces of the second degree I have made short comments at
p. 249 of vol. iii. of the Mathematician, and also at pp. 44, 45
of the Supplement to that volume, with which (supplement) the
existence of the valuable periodical in question terminated.
   17. Having sufficiently discussed the quadratic solution, I
proceed to the biquadratic determination of complex quadra
tics, by which I mean such a determination of them as shall
render their solution possible, without having to satisfy any
simple equation of a degree higher than a biquadratic. Now
there is one system of three tertiary quadratics, the solution
of which is capable of being rendered dependent on that of
a simple biquadratic. I mean the case in which all the three
given equations are, what I shall call, pseudo-homogeneous, that
is to say, are free from the linear dimension of w. The system
of equations involved in “Colonel Silas Titus's Problem”
belongs to such a system. I have given a discussion, and
 some references relating to this problem, at pp. 34–36 of vol. 1.
of the Mechanics’ Magazine. The method by which I have
 solved three general pseudo-homogeneous quadratics (Mech.
 Mag., vol. xlviii. p. 512) is, in its principle, the same as that
 by which Frend solved Titus's problem. And Frend's me
thod is an ingenious and philosophical generalization of the
process employed in solving two pseudo-homogeneous binary
quadratics, unless indeed the latter is a particular case of
 Frend’s.   In the form in which I have exhibited the solution
of pseudo-homogeneous binary (See Mech. Mag., vol. xlviii.
p. 511) and tertiary quadratics, we avoid the introduction of
new unknowns.
   18. If we had three general quadratics of the fifth order,
we might effect their biquadratic determination by the method
of homogeneous elimination (Ibid. p. 606); but then we must
decompose each of the unknowns into the sum of two others.
The same determination may be effected, without any decom
position, by the method of vanishing groups. Thus, if, by
five superpositions, we reduce one of the quadratics to the form
of a sum of six squares, we may group these squares two and
two, make the three sums vanish, depress, and eliminate three

    Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.        503
 of the unknowns from the remaining two given quadratics,
 both of which may be solved by means of a biquadratic and a
 quadratic. And we may effect the biquadratic determination
 of three quadratics of the sixth order without any transforma
 tion or decomposition of the unknowns, but by the direct ap
 plication of the method of homogeneous elimination (Ibid.
 p. 512). By a combination of the method of disposable mul
 tipliers with that of Mr. Jerrard (similar to the combination
 alluded to in article 15 of this letter), three 5-ary quadratics
 admit of a biquadratic determination (Ibid. vol. xlix. pp. 10, 11).
    19. A system of four quadratics of the eighth order is ca
pable of biquadratic determination, by a combination of su
perposition, disposable multiplication, and the method of
vanishing coefficients. I have pointed out two methods of
 effecting this determination. [Ibid. vol. 1. pp. 33, 34. The
‘second solution’ of the last-mentioned page, however, re
quires the corrections which I subsequently gave at p. 106 of
the same volume.] This system of four 8-ary quadratics is also
capable of cubic determination (Ibid. p. 34, “Third Solution').
And here I leave the subject of the determination of complex
quadratics, throughout which you will have borne in mind the
distinction between a determination of equations, and that of
the variables which they contain. The terms “quadratic,’ &c.
prefixed to “determination,’ indicate the sense in which the
term determination is used; and it may, at some future time,
be desirable to give a still more precise system of nomencla
ture in reference to that term. By regarding their determi
nations we shall often be able to obtain an advantageous com
parison of problems. You will remark that, whenever a sy
stem of equations admits of a simple determination of less
than five dimensions, such a “determination’ amounts to a
solution of the system. In other words, when n is less than
5, a simple n-ic determination of the system gives us th
means of solving it.                                              ****
   20. Of simple cubics I shall say nothing. When complex
quadratics and a complex cubic are presented to us simulta
neously for solution, it will always be possible to solve them,
provided that the system would admit of quadratic solution, if
in place of the cubic we had a quadratic. For, if no elevation
of degree be introduced into a quadratic by elimination, then
none would be introduced were a cubic substituted for it.
Linear equations in fact introduce no elevation, whatever be
the degree of the equation in which the elimination takes
place. And I may here observe—once for all—that, when
ever a system of quadratics admits of a general quadratic so
lution, then we may substitute for one of the quadratics an

504     Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
equation of any degree that we please, and the system will
always admit of a determination of the degree of the equation
so substituted.
    21. Denoting, in conformity with a preceding nomencla
ture, by the term pseudo-homogeneous equation of the nth
degree, an equation in which the unknowns enter to the same
(n) dimensions in every term excepting the absolute (deter
mined or known) term, there are two cases, besides those
before enumerated, in which pseudo-homogeneous equations
admit of solution.    Those cases, like the others, are, where
the pseudo-homogeneous equations are two in number,
both of the same dimensions, and those dimensions less
 than 5; that is to say, where they are both cubics, or both
 biquadratics. All that we can say of pseudo-homogeneous
 equations of the fifth, or other higher degree, is, that they
 admit of a determination of the fifth or other respective de
 gree. I have noticed (Mech. Mag. vol. xlviii. pp. 538, 539)
 other properties of pseudo-homogeneous equations, not ne
 cessary to be now mentioned, and I have indicated (Ibid.
 pp. 606, 607) a process by which two general cubics, if they
 be of the ninth order, may be reduced to a system of binary
 pseudo-homogeneous cubics, And I have also intimated,
 what might be shown without much difficulty, that two com
 plex general biquadratics, if of an order sufficiently high, might
 be reduced to a pseudo-homogeneous binary system, and so
 resolved by means of simple biquadratics. If, in the discus
 sion of questions such as these, we wish to employ the method
 of homogeneous elimination in as pure a form as possible, we
 must, as I have already intimated, arrange our equations in
 systems of pairs of biquadratics or cubics, and pairs or triplets
 of quadratics, availing ourselves of the methods of disposable
 multipliers and of indeterminates to effect such arrangement,
 if indeed it be possible. The solution of two 9-ary cubics,
 alluded to above, is sketched out by means, not simply of the
 method of homogeneous elimination, but also of the methods
 : vanishing groups and vanishing coefficients, one or other of
 them.
     22. Upon the subject of simple biquadratics I shall address
 but few words to you, first observing that I have made some
 remarks upon the subject at pp. 105, 106 of vol. iii. of the
 Cambridge Mathematical Journal, where you will find the
 same extension given to the solution of Descartes that Simpson
 gave to that of Ferrari. I once thought that I had obtained
 formulae for the reduction of biquadratics to a binomial form
  (Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxviii. pp. 132, 133), but I subsequently
 (Ibid. 395) corrected my erroneous inference, the origin of

   Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations. 505
which I made clear in a second and somewhat more detailed
explanation (Ibid. vol. xxxii. pp. 51, 52, Art. II.). And I
have given some developments on the subject of the pp. 132,
183 (just cited) at pp. 32–34 of the Supplement to vol. iii. of
the Mathematician.
    23. Although invalid for effecting the transformation of
biquadratics to a binomial form, the investigations, referred to
in the last paragraph, enable us to transform the general equa
tion of the fifth degree to a trinomial form. [See Phil. Mag.
S. 3. vol. xxviii. pp. 132,133, 395, with the details and improve
ments comprised in article I. to III. of pp. 50–52 of vol. xxxii.]
And my trinomial transformation of the equation of the fifth
degree appears to possess two advantages over that of Mr.
Jerrard, whose genius first discovered the transformation in
question;–(1) we only employ three unknowns, and, (2), the
symmetric functions of the roots of the original equation, which
in Mr. Jerrard’s process (Researches, p. 77 et seq.) rise as
high as the thirtieth degree inclusive, in mine are only in
wolved as far as the twentieth.
    24. In the problem which we have just been considering,
 we see that the solution of the equation of the lower degree
 and higher order precedes, and renders possible, the trans
 formation of the higher degree and lower order, affording a
 confirmation of the accuracy of our system of classification.
 And this indeed would be, in all likelihood, much further
 confirmed had I space to do full justice to all the various
 questions discussed or suggested by Mr. Jerrard and Sir W.
 R. Hamilton. The necessity, however, of observing some
 limits prevents me at present from doing much more than
 refer to my own labours, with a deep appreciation of, and
 interest in, those of others. Hence I here only allude to my
 own attempted solution of the general equation of the fifth
 degree (see Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxvii. pp. 125, 126, 292,
 293, vol. xxviii. pp. 190, 191), the failure of which I after
 wards (Ib. vol. xxviii. p. 395) pointed out, and, subsequently
  (see par IV. pp. 52, 53, vol. xxxii.), more clearly explained.
     25. In Sir W. R. Hamilton's discussion (referred to above)
 of Mr. Jerrard’s process, certain limits are given within which
 the application of the method is confined. I have sought (see
  Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxix. pp. 181–183, vol. xxx. pp. 28–30)
 to give a similar limitation to the processes of the method of
 vanishing groups. But the results which I have arrived at
 are not altogether satisfactory, and I should wish that any
 judgement, formed on the subject, may be suspended until I
  shall have been enabled to give a complete discussion of the
  question, or, until some one, who may take a sufficient interest

506 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
in the theory of equations to be induced to follow up the in
vestigation, shall have prosecuted the subject, to such an ex
tent as to be enabled to pronounce a decisive opinion upon
the question of the limits of the last-named method.
   26. The subject of equations has, however, lately been re
garded with an apathy which is, to say the least, extremely
singular, when we consider its vast range, its importance, and
the interest which it undoubtedly possesses in itself. The
powers of that great indeterminate process, to the advance of
which the labours of Mr. Jerrard have given a fresh impetus,
remain as yet untried in practice, and its resources unfathomed
even by those who, from its exhaustless springs, might draw
the means of irrigating fields of science heretofore deemed
barren.    The indeterminate methods, when considered in re
ference to the theory of equations, strictly so called, have
either completely changed, or presented us with the means of
so changing, the whole face of the science. The indetermi
nate theory is, if I may use the expression, one of the Senses
of Algebra.
   27. But, even already, the mind has, presented to it, another
object than that of merely threading the endless pathways of
the indeterminate theory, and of glancing down its illimitable
vistas. The indeterminate methods must be compared with
one another as wholes, and their mutual relations thoroughly
investigated. Of the three general methods, which I have
here adverted to, I am disposed to think that the substantial
limits are the same. Thus, two simultaneous tertiary quadra
tics, which are immediately solvible by the method of vanishing
groups, may be rendered amenable to the other methods (of
vanishing coefficients, and of homogeneous elimination,) by
means of transformation or decomposition. Is the method of
vanishing groups then the simplest form of indeterminate pro
cess? Or is there an altogether different method, of which
the three named above are particular forms, to which they
(and all others that may be discovered) can be reduced, and
in which all others are included ? To answer this question,
definitely and satisfactorily, would be to do, for the indeter
minate theory, that which Lagrange did for the ordinary
theory of equations, when he showed the ultimate identity of
all the apparently isolated methods, then known, of solving
equations of the first four degrees, and the common basis upon
which they all rest.
   28. You will forgive me, if I suggest a route to this general
indeterminate method, and, to this end, coin a term, adlimi
nation, to express an operation by which a quantity is intro
duced into any system of equations. Adlimination and Elimi

   Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.        507
nation will be converse terms, denoting inverse operations.
Now, let us consider two general tertiary quadratics. Elimi
nate one unknown between them, and we have a binary bi
quadratic; and, if I mistake not, we may so determine one of
the unknowns, as to reduce this biquadratic to a simple bi
quadratic, of such a form as to be capable of solution by means
of quadratics only. Regard as known the process of adlimi
nation by which we pass, from the binary biquadratic, to the
system of two tertiary quadratics. So that, in point of fact,
if we had been asked,—What must be the order of two qua
dratics in order that they may admit of quadratic solution ?
—we might answer thus. Find the least number of indeter
minates by which the elevated equation (a biquadratic), which
is the result of ordinary elimination, may be depressed to a
quadratic; and to this add unity, and as many quantities as
may be necessary to form the original binary system by adli
mination. If it were required to find the order of two cubics
capable of cubic solution, I should proceed thus. Find how
 many indeterminates are required in order that an equation of
the ninth degree may be depressed to a cubic. To this num
 ber add unity and the quantities required for adlimination.
 Although you may find this paragraph at present somewhat
 vague, I do not think that it will eventually turn out to be
 meaningless. More on the subject I shall not say now.
    29. The apathy of which I have complained above is not
 limited to the present time. When, generalizing Descartes'
 method of representing curves, Pacent, John Bernouilli, and
 Clairaut had represented surfaces by an equation between
 three variables, and when, moreover, the general reduction
 of the equation of curves of the second degree had been
 effected, all the materials were at hand for effecting a trans
 formation which is among the most striking that Mr. Jerrard
 has presented to algebra—that of the equation of the fi<U+017F>th
 degree to a trinomial form. And, even now, this general
 reduction, as effected by vanishing groups, is the simplest way
 of performing the transformation in question. But the step
 was never taken until the transformation had been effected by
 other means. Had the general reduction of a tertiary qua
 dratic presented itself in its full force to earlier investigators,
 it would have given them a primá facie, but illusory, transfor
 mation of a biquadratic to a binomial form, and would have
 involved them in a fallacy that the algebra of that time might
 not readily have exposed. But, attention once drawn to the
 point, we might now have been surveying a richly cultivated
 garden, instead of what is almost a barren waste. And yet
 we must not complain that those mighty minds were idle,

 508 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
 although we may perhaps regret that this particular subject
 did not possess greater interest to them. . . . . . . . .”
    30. I do not intend to trouble you about the limits of trans
Jormation of equations. I shall only say that possibly, nay,
probably, the limits of the application of all indeterminate pro
 cesses are the same as those imposed by Sir W. R. Hamilton
 on Mr. Jerrard’s method.      But I must be allowed to add a
 word with respect to the failure of Mr. Jerrard’s solution of
 the equation of the fifth degree by means of indeterminates,
 and also with respect to the failure of my own solution. "It
 must not be thought that either of those solutions involve any
 error of principle. On the contrary, the principles involved in
both of them may be advantageously employed in the solution
 of many problems. The failures in question arise from the
 root of the general equation being, in both instances, pre
sented in the shape of a vanishing fraction. In both cases
the ball is well-directed, but it wants the impetus required to
carry it home; in neither is the arrow wrongly aimed, but it
shivers against an invisible barrier interposed between it and
its object.
    31. I may here remind you that, in the third and final vo
lume of the Mathematician, I have given three papers on the
Theory of Symmetric Functions. These papers are           º      de
voted to the application of Mr. Jerrard’s theory to the subject
of what I have (Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol.xxviii. p. 191, and elsewhere)
termed critical functions. In the third paper (Math., pp. 30,
31 of the Supplement to vol. iii.) I have accounted, d priori,
for the occurrence of these critical functions. It might per
haps be desirable to give a further discussion of what we may
call the semi-critical functions; that is to say, of functions into
which P enters to less dimensions than those of the function.
The occurrence of these critical and semi-critical functions
must be narrowly watched. Their occurrence will often in
troduce vanishing fractions into expressions where we should
little have anticipated their occurrence.        While upon the
subject of symmetric functions, I may add that I think there
is great weight in a remark at the conclusion of Mr. Steven
son’s treatise on equations (2nd edit.).       I have given a spe
cimen of such equations, as Mr. Stevenson probably had in
view when he penned the conclusion of that work, in the Phi
losophical Magazine (S. 3. vol. xxvii. p. 294).
   32. I still propose to adhere to the same use of the terms
direct and indirect, when applied to solutions of equations, as
that which I adopted in my former letter to you on the pre
sent subject. But I would notice that Euler's method is at
the same time a direct and an indirect one.          It is direct so

     Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations. 509
 far as its own processes are concerned, but, in the form in
 which it is usually exhibited, an assumption is made that we
 are acquainted with the roots of a cubic, and with the manner in
 which those roots enter into the coefficients.      I have some
 time since (see Phil. Mag. S. 3, vol. xxxii. pp. 421, 422)
 given one or two corrections and additions to my former letter;
 but I must here remark that Vandermonde should share with
 Lagrange the glory of the discovery of a general analysis of
 equations, and that to Lagrange is due a mode of representing
 the roots of equations, which some have attributed to the late
distinguished Murphy. Connected with, and presenting some
general resemblance to, the methods of Lagrange and Vander
monde, is my method of symmetric products respecting which
you will find full information in my “Notes on the Theory of
 Algebraic Equations.” . The connexion and resemblance con
sists in this; that the linear functions whose product, in my
method, is symmetric, are the same as those whose squares,
cubes, and higher powers have, in the methods of Lagrange
and Vandermonde, only one, two, &c., values respectively. "I
should wish those “Notes” to be read in connexion with this
letter.

   (33.) That, besides certain problems alluded to above, we
may have that of the cubic solution of three tertiary quadratics,
a solution which might become useful sometimes. That I
have given a curious example of the depression of a certain
form of equations, at pp. 45, 46 of the recently published
Supplementary number of the Mathematician; and that, with
respect to the solution of equations of the fifth degree, I have
at present nothing to add to the remarks which I made in the
Philosophical Magazine for December 1849 (S. 3. vol. xxxv.
pp. 436, 437). Similar obstacles to that presented by equa
tions of the fifth degree occur in other departments of know
ledge. In the theory of elliptic functions, for instance, inves
tigation was arrested by the     º           of making a sum of
two integrals fulfill certain conditions. But Abel obviated this
by employing a sum of more than two integrals. I do not
mean to say that the equation of the fifth degree is solvible,
but I must protest against its supposed     ...;         checking
all inquiry in that direction. Those equations are probably
destined yet to fill an important place in science.

   LXX. Some Remarks on the Theory of Thunder-storms.
                  By ReUBEN PHILLIPs, Esq.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
I    THINK it necessary to offer the following remarks on
      Mr. Peter Clare's theory of thunder-storms, page 334 of
your last Number.
   Passing over the confusion which exists in the use made of
the terms “quantity or intensity,” I would especially direct
attention to the following grave objections:—
   1. There are no experiments which show that steam can
absorb electricity, and render it latent in a manner analogous
to latent heat, or in any other way.
   2. No source is assigned whence the electricity is to come
to satisfy this capacity Tor electricity.
   3. The theory requires the production of positive electricity
without negative.
   Then with regard to the theory of rain, page 385, it is for
gotten that, in the interior of a cloud, each particle is simi
larly related to surrounding particles, and that consequently
they do not move each other in the way supposed. The truth
is, the whole electrical force of the cloud is thrown upon the
surface of the cloud, as was long ago pointed out by Dr.
Faraday”. From which it follows, that acrial condensations
must occur in the lines of electrical induction; but, judging
from the appearances of a thunder-storm, these condensations
are so small in amount as to be incapable of producing those
effects which Mr. Clare suggests, although sufficient, as has
been long supposed, to produce winds and move clouds.
 Mr. Clare also forgets that rain precedes the flash of lightning.
    Evaporation has sometimes been supposed to generate elec
tricity; but it having been found by Mr. Armstrong, a result
subsequently confirmed by Dr. Faraday, that by allowing the
steam to escape, as on removing the safety-valve from a boiler,
no electricity is obtained, it appears necessary to abandon the
idea, and to agree to consider, with M. Peltier, that the elec
tricity apparently produced by evaporation under certain cir
cumstances must be ascribed to other causes, such as the decre
pitation and projection of saline matter; and in experiments
where pure water only is used, to friction between the water
and other bodies, steam or particles of water carrying off one
species of electricity.
    The theory of atmospheric electricity which I have ven
                     * Phil. Mag. vol. xxii. p. 203.

      Mr. R. Phillips on the Theory of Thunder-storms,        511
tured to give does not rest on vague surmise or on doubtful
experiments, but on many clear and independent experiments,
which harmonize well together. [I allude here only to the
new modes of electrical excitement I have discovered, and not
now to the magnetism of steam.] The experiments I have
recorded appear to me undoubtedly to demonstrate, that
water, rubbing against either air or steam, becomes positive.
For instance, in the experiment with the fountain (107.), the
water passes from the jet, dashes against the metal, and be
comes reduced to a number of minute drops, and thus exposes
a large surface; much of the motion of the water is then soon
given up to the air through friction, and the drops are very
feebly charged with positive electricity in consequence. The
drops now come in contact with the sides of the tin pipe, and
running together exalt the electric tension so far that the
electricity becomes capable of being registered by the electro
meter.
    If we consider a mass of air and drops of water moving
with a uniform velocity in a straight line, it is immediately
seen that this motion cannot disturb the relative position of
any particle. Suppose now the motion of the air to be de
flected into a curve, and it is quite certain that curved cur
rents do exist in the atmosphere, then from the great difference
of specific gravity between air and water, the water would
continue to separate from the air in lines more or less ap
[...         the tangents of the curve along which the neigh
  ouring air is moving. Now if the condensation of vapour
continue to go on in the space inside the curve, the particles
so condensed would be whirled to, and accumulated on the

trified, and leaving the air through which they passed nega
 tive. We may suppose this process to go on, and the electric
 tension of the cloud consequently to rise until rain begins to
 fall. Now the drops falling from the superior portions of the
 cloud will increase in size in falling through it, and will there
 fore be larger on leaving the cloud than the drops formed at its
 inferior portions; these larger drops, in falling towards the
 earth, will therefore more or less overtake the smaller drops,
 or, in other words, when the rain falls the electrified particles
 become approximated.

 take this view of the case”. The account of these discharges
 is also especially interesting, as they seem to have been in
 many respects a near approach to an aurora. It is a pity no

IN the following pages is discussed, not the theory of waves
        under its most general form, but merely one of the sim
plest cases—the Wave of Translation or Wave of the First
Order. To determine from the general laws of fluids what
must be the effect of the protrusion of a solid into a given
body of water, and to give an equation which shall be an
expression of all possible cases of wave motion, would be un
doubtedly far more useful and far more satisfactory. But in
the absence of the capability of attaining so high an object, it
is hoped that, although far from perfect, the following investi
gation may not be wholly in vain. In order that the reader
may be in possession of those experimental results upon
which it is founded, the following passage is extracted from
 Mr. Scott Russell's first report on waves to the British Asso
ciation f.
     “This wave has been found to differ from every other
species of wave in the motion which is given to the individual
particles of the fluid through which the wave is propagated.
By the transit of the wave the particles of the fluid are raised
from their places, transferred forwards in the direction of the
motion of the wave, and permanently deposited at rest in a
new place at a considerable distance from their original posi
tion. There is no retrogradation, no oscillation; the motion is

all in the same direction, and the extent of the transference is
equal throughout the whole depth. Hence this wave may be
descriptively designated the Great Primary Wave of Trans
lation.     The motion of translation commences when the an
terior surface of the wave is vertically over a given series of
particles; it increases in velocity until the crest of the wave
has come to be vertically above them, and from this moment
the motion of translation is retarded, and the particles are left
in a condition of perfect rest at the instant when the posterior
surface of the wave has terminated its transit through the
vertical plane in which they lie. This phaenomenon has been
verified up to a depth of five feet.”

They are pressed downwards by a force PS=PR+ RS, there

In the column pg the pressure is upwards and =2pr.
    Therefore generally, calling the upward pressure negative
and the downward positive, the vertical pressure on any column
equals the weight of a column of the same section, the length
of which is twice the distance of its summit above the line CD.
    Hence at E there is no vertical pressure.

column of fluid, urged by a force varying as the distance of

   In order that the surface Dá may fall, the plate must move
horizontally from AB, the area of the column being constant;
and the movement of the top and bottom of the plate will be
the same, because the pressure on every part of it is the same.
Although the surface Dal falls, the particles at BC are, as
regards vertical motion, at rest; and the vertical movement
of any intermediate row of particles is proportional to its di
 stance from B.
   In the same manner the surface dC moves horizontally
whilst the surface DB is at rest, and the horizontal movement
of any intermediate row of particles is proportional to its di
stance from the line DB.
   Now the inertia of a column DB, the particles of which
have a motion varying from a given quantity y at the top to
nothing at the bottom, is one-third of that of a similar column

   Let af be a thin column taken anywhere in the still water.
The pressure on any particle is as its depth below the surface,
but being the same in all directions, the particle remains at
rest.   But at A, the exact commencement of the wave, we
have on one side of AG a column pg slightly higher, whilst
that on the other side has the same height; there is there
fore an unbalanced pressure in direction Aa. The immediate
effect on the column AG is to raise A ; for until the pressure
can be communicated through it to the water beyond, that
water is the same as if it were solid.  The column AG when
raised exerts a pressure in its turn upon the next one, and
causes it to rise in the same manner.     Thus the commence
ment of the wave travels forwards with a velocity which de
pends on the ease with which the pressure can be propagated.
This ease depends partly on the resistance to being raised
offered by the column itself, and partly on the forward move

Mr. A. J. Robertson on the Positive Wave of Translation. 517
ment which must take place in all the water behind, in order
that the pressure upon the column may be sustained. When
the column AG rises, it necessarily becomes thinner; whilst
pg, moving forwards to supply the place which would other
wise be left vacant, exerts a pressure on AG, it is itself pressed
by a higher column; and as it can move forward only so far
as the horizontal diminution of AG permits, it also rises—and
so with every column behind. The further it is from A, the
greater evidently must be its horizontal motion for a given
upward movement of column AG, because it must pass through
a space equal to the sum of all the compressions in front of it;
and this is true of any column between A and the crest E of
the wave.
    We have seen before, in the case of the water contained in
the vessel, that the accelerating force forwards at any point is
          -       dy                        -  - -  - -
proportional to dr —the tangent of the inclination of the sur
face at the point; also that there is an upward pressure, which
varies as the distance of the column below the line Q.N. At
the commencement A of the wave, the conditions have been
 shown to be the same for the instant as if the water were in a
 vessel of which the end is solid—the pressure is wholly up
 wards. As we recede from A, the motion forwards requires
 to be greater and greater; and the slope of the surface in
 creases as well, until about the point R it attains its maximum
 value. On the other hand, the upward pressure becomes less
 and less, until at the point R there is no vertical pressure at all.
 The forward motion then arises only from the compression of
 the columns, and is limited by it; but the rising of the columns
 in succession evidently produces that change in the position
 of the wave-form which gives the water the appearance of
 actual forward motion; and if the wave be divided into an
 exceedingly great number of vertical columns, each of these
 columns represents a stage that every one of the others either
 has passed through or has yet to pass through. Since either
 of the motions of a body urged by one force in a vertical, and
 by another in a horizontal direction, is independent of the
  other, the vertical motion of these columns will be the same,
 and may be examined as if they had no horizontal movement.
     It appears, then, that the column AG is urged upwards by
  a force proportional to k, and diminishing as the distance of
  its summit from QN diminishes, until at R it is nothing.         It
  in consequence acquires a certain velocity, by virtue of which
  it continues to rise and get thinner.    Now, however, there is
  a retarding force acting downwards, which, as it varies in the
   same proportion as the accelerating force does, destroys the

motion in equal space and time. When the surface rises to
 E it comes to rest. The downward force continuing to act,
becomes an accelerating force; at T the velocity is a maxi
mum; again it is retarded; and when the surface has sunk to
 B, it is again at rest. It is to be borne in mind, that whilst
the uppermost particles in this column have been moving
 through a vertical distance A to E, the lowest particles have
not been moving at all; and the intermediate particles have
had an intermediate movement, as in the case of the single
 column. Also taking the columns sufficiently small, the hori
zontal motion of the particles in each may be disregarded,
 their total effect being the horizontal movement of the whole
column.
    From equation (4.) we have seen that the time of rising
from A to E by a single column, urged by a force varying as
above, is proportional to           a + k . 3g is theabsolute force
                                    T3g       a-EK
on the column at a distance unity from QN. But the force
which urges the column of the wave cannot be the same as
this, as it is modified by the horizontal motion of the rest of
the columns. It must nevertheless vary in the same propor
tion.    Let the force be u, then
the value of c remains to be determined.
    Every column between the commencement and crest of the
wave is becoming continually narrower and higher; therefore,
although the inclination of the surface is greatest at R, the
forward motion is greatest at E. But at R the velocity of the
column upwards is at its maximum; the rate, therefore, at
which it shrinks is greatest. After the crest of the wave has
passed, the horizontal force becomes a retarding force, and
destroying the motion in the same time as it had communicated
it, the end of the wave finds the column at rest”. What,
then, is the quantity of this motion ?
   * The peculiarity of the wave of translation appears to be this—the
horizontal and vertical movements commence and end together. Suppose
that by some means a backward horizontal motion had been communicated
to the column AG, such that by the time the surface has risen to R it is
destroyed. Whilst the path of the particles in space is altered by this
supposition, the relation between the vertical and horizontal movements
remains the same. The shrinking of the columns would only be towards
R in place of towards A: at R the upward movement would still be a maxi
mum. The horizontal motion would then be reversed, acquire a maximum
at E, be destroyed at T, and reversed again. The motion being therefore
alternately backwards and forwards, the particles oscillate about a fixed

   Since the water in the channel remains at the same level as
before the passage of the wave, the volume of the generator is
contained in the swell of the water above the level of repose;
and calling the width of the channel unity, the number of
units in the area of the curve ARETB above AB equals the
number of units in the volume of the generator. The column
DH, at rest at the commencement of the wave, has been
moved forward by the time that D has risen to E, or when the
crest of the wave has come over the column DH, a certain di
stance DC, which is the sum of the contractions of all the
columns in front; and since the water formerly contained in
DAGH is now contained in ERAGS, DC=                        .
                      -            -    -               2V
   The total horizontal motion is therefore T.
   Both vertical and horizontal motions now described as the
result of existing forces, are precisely those observed by Mr.
Scott Russell in his experiments on the wave of translation.
   From the nature of the case, the motion of the wave must
be uniform. If then T be the half-period of the wave, and t
an intermediate time, the distance passed through in t is
                             x={(L1),
point; and, moreover, as the horizontal and vertical motions cross one
another, and the particles do not come to rest after the passage of one
wave, there must be a succession of waves. The following figures show
the difference between the motions on this supposition.

   When t=0 or =T,              % =0, or the tangent to the curve at
the ends and at the crest of the wave is horizontal; therefore
the curve at the ends is convex, and at the crest concave, to
the line of repose. Now g              %  would be the accelerating force
on the supposition of the whole of that force being expended
in producing forward motion. But the cause of both vertical
and horizontal motion is the slope of the surface, the amount
of which is expressed by           %;    and it follows that the definite
               #
integral of g. between the limits a =0 and w= L represents
the sum of all the forces producing forward motion, and of all
the forces producing vertical motion. Hence we obtain an
equation from which the value of the unknown quantity a

    There is no proof that c=1; but it is remarkable, that, if
it be true, then the half length of the wave =T(a + k), which
agrees very exactly with the observations of Mr. Scott Rus
sell, who has assigned from them a value L=Tra. The
velocity, however, is independent of the length, and con
sequently remains very nearly the same, although the wave
becomes lower and longert. Is not the degradation of the
wave the result of imperfect fluidity?
    The cause of the increase of velocity consequent upon an
increase of depth is evident; the volume of the generator 2V
being constant, the amount of horizontal movement of the
particles is inversely as the depth.
    The first five columns in the following table are copied
from Mr. Scott Russell’s Second Report on Wavesi.
    The column F gives the velocities calculated by the above
formula, and G gives the difference between observation and
theory.
   * The empirical formula given by Mr. Scott Russell is v- V(a+2k)g.
   t It is remarkable, that, if these principles be applied to oscillating waves,
as in the note, pp. 518, 519, where the middle line QN is the level of repose,
and where the particles having no positive motion of translation, the distance
travelled by the crest of the wave in the time T is only L, the velocity is
that acquired in   ºf     through half the simple depth of the water; or since
the length varies as the depth, the velocity is as the square root of the
length.

    Or, leaving out the two errors ’214 and 211, the average
would be 128. In the eighth example, the error might have
been attributed to the circumstance of the wave being higher;
but the error in the third example is as great, although the
height of the wave is only 29. The twelfth example, given
by Mr. Scott Russell, is evidently anomalous.
    From this comparison it appears that the average difference
between the velocity observed and that assigned by the for
mula is scarcely more, in the case of the small waves, than

1 inch per second on velocities varying from 1 foot 9, inches
to 4 feet 6 inches per second; and in the case of the large
waves, the error is l; inch per second. This discrepancy,
moreover, is on the right side; as viscidity and friction have
undoubtedly some influence, although slight, and will make
the actual velocity less than a theory which does not recognize
them can assign.                          ,
    In order to determine whether anything was due to vis
cidity, the author tried the following experiment:—In a
trough 2 feet 2 inches long by 1% inch wide, a wave was
generated, by pushing down at one end a block of wood,
2 inches long and of a width equal to that of the trough, first
in water, then in linseed oil. The distance, then, for the wave
to travel was 2 feet exactly. The quantities of water and oil
were measured in the same vessel, and therefore the depths
were the same, and all circumstances alike except the nature
of the fluid. In the water the undulation could be distinctly
perceived after the wave had travelled 128 feet, but in the oil
it was only just perceptible when it had travelled but 12 feet.
The time occupied by the wave in the water in passing over
the above distance was 1 minute; by the wave in the oil in
passing over 12 feet, fully 6 seconds. Taking it at 6 seconds,
                                                 &
# = 2 feet per second.          Water wave      * = 213         feet per
second.
    The height was, as nearly as could be ascertained, 1.65 inch,
which would give a velocity of 2:104 feet per second: much
dependence, however, could not be placed on this measure
ment.

    its agency in the tremendous explosion of July 1845, in New
     York. By Robert HARE, M.D., Emeritus Professor of
     Chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, and Associate
    of the Smithsonian Institution*.

            more or less devastated, there has been none, it is

  mysterious than those of the great fire which took place in the
  city of New York, on the 19th of July, 1845.
      2. The destruction of 230 houses, containing merchandise
  amounting in value probably to 2,000,000 of dollars, made
  the calamity in question highly deplorable as a cause of pe
  cuniary loss and embarrassment; while the characteristics
  which gave to it an unprecedented rapidity of extension were
  of a nature to excite an enduring interest as well as tempo
  rary consternation.
      3. A series of detonations, successively increasing in loud
  ness, were followed by a final explosion, of which, agreeably
  to an affidavit, the report resembled a “loud clap of thunder.”
  This tore into pieces the building within which it took place,
 threw down seven houses in the vicinity, and drove in the
 fronts of the houses on the opposite side of the street, at the
 distance of 87 feet. The whole of the space within which
 these tremendous effects took place, was filled with a dazzling
 flame, and various masses, intensely ignited and vividly lumi
 nous, were projected aloft as if expelled from a volcano, so
 as, on alighting, to spread the conflagration far and wide.
 Shipping anchored in the Hudson River, probably at the
 distance of more than a quarter of a mile, were greatly en
 dangered by these deflagrating missiles.
     4. So violent was the atmospheric concussion, that people
 were prostrated by the consequent blast, when too remote to
 be injured by the flames or flying fragments. Some persons
 were wounded or killed, but so small was the number, in
 comparison with that of the multitude which might have been
 mutilated or destroyed, that there was more gratulation for
the escape of the many, than sorrow over the few who actually
perished. This comparative immunity was due to the warn
ing given by the detonations, which, as already mentioned,
preceded that by which the mischief was effected.
    5. The natural inference arising from the detonations thus
alluded to, was, that gunpowder had been stored in parcels
of various amounts on the different floors of the store, the
smaller portions above, the larger below, and that the deto
nations were the consequence of the successive ignition of the
parcels thus situated. The cry of gunpowder was raised on
the occurrence of the first explosion, and caused the retreat
of almost everybody near the quarter whence it proceeded.
Hence, before the final catastrophe, the streets about the store
were entirely vacated, so that scarcely any person was injured
besides those in the houses opposite to the conflagration.
    6. Notwithstanding the reasonableness of the belief at first
created as to the agency of gunpowder, there was the most

           Dr. R. Hare on the Eaplosiveness of Nitre.                   527
conclusive evidence, so far as the oaths of worthy and well
informed witnesses could avail, that no gunpowder was con
tained in the building within which the explosions occurred.
Of course, the real cause of the disaster became a subject of
perplexing consideration for chemists in general, and espe
cially for those adepts in chemistry, to whom the Corporation
of the city concerned applied for an elucidation of the my
Stery.
   g It was fully established        by the statements of the highly
respectable proprietors, and that of their storehouse clerk,
that there were in the store more than 300,000 pounds of
nitre, secured in double gunny bags, containing 180 pounds
of nitre each, in piles alternating with heaps of combustible
merchandise; yet as, agreeably to ordinary experience, such
combustibles deflagrate when ignited with nitre, without ex
ploding, this did not remove the unfavourable impressions
unjustly created respecting the occupants of the store. The
stowing of any large quantity of gunpowder adequate to the
effects produced, had been culpably imprudent and illegal;
and coupled with a most solemn denial on their part, would
have involved them in the baseness of falsehood, if not the
guilt of perjury.                               -
   8. To everybody the elucidation of the mystery was desi
rable, since, without a correct knowledge of the causes, the
proper means of guarding against a recurrence of such explo
sions could not be devised. It was interesting to men of
science to have it ascertained wherefore their efforts to pro
duce an explosion by similar ingredients were unsuccessful*.
To the occupants of the store it was important, since they
were liable, not only to ill opinion and legal prosecution as
above stated, but likewise to a deprivation of their claims for
insurance, Fortunately for them, in opposition to the opi
nions and experimental inferences of several chemists who
were consulted, tending to extend or confirm the idea, that
gunpowder, illegally and most culpably stored, must have been
the cause of the catastrophe, the opinions of Silliman and
Hayes, and other eminent chemists, were called forth, tending
to sanction the inference that the result might be due to the
reaction of nitre with contiguous merchandise.
   * With means furnished by the Councils, five eminent chemists made
several experiments upon a large scale, in order to ascertain the effect of
igniting mitre with such combustibles as were associated with it in the store
of Messrs. Crocker and Warren; yet in no instance could they produce
detonating reaction. The activity of the combustion never surpassed that
degree of rapidity and consequent violence which may be designated by the
 word deflagration.

     9. I owe it to my friend, Augustus A. Hayes, to state,
  that I might have adopted the more general impression, had
 it not been for his inferences and experiments made with the
 view of accounting for the explosion of a vessel, loaded with
 nitre, while lying at anchor in the harbour of Boston. It was
 ascertained by this able chemist, that when, by an experiment
 made in his laboratory, between 100 and 200 pounds of nitre,
 intensely heated in a crucible, were suddenly sprinkled with
 water, an explosion ensued”.
    * The subjoined quotation from the Boston Daily Advertiser, will serve
 to show the point to which Mr. Hayes had attained in elucidating the
 mysterious explosions, produced by incandescent nitre, when my efforts
 to afford a further elucidation commenced.
                                     Roxbury Laboratory, 28th July, 1845.
    Dear Sir, Your note of yesterday, in relation to the explosive action of
 saltpetre, has this moment come to hand. I most cheerfully comply with
your request in placing before you the facts connected with the subject of
the action of saltpetre on substances usually called combustible.
    Saltpetre, or the nitrate of potash or soda, alone, does not burn or ex
plode by heat, however intense. It parts with one of its constituents, oxygen,
by heat, and it is to the combination of its oxygen with other bodies that it
owes its power of burning with them. Wood and other fibrous substances
do not burn with saltpetre until they have become partially charred; they
then produce deflagration, or burn with sparks. A large quantity of salt
petre, enclosed in gunny bags, as it is usually stored, after fire was commu
nicated to it, would burn with the bags, emitting much smoke and sparks,
precisely as paper which has imbibed saltpetre would. It would not be
consumed; only the small quantity required to burn with the bags would
be changed. If an addition of burning wood or charcoal were made to the
extent of one-fifth the weight of the saltpetre, an intense and continued
deflagration would result, and all the saltpetre would be changed. No er
plosion would follow from applying fire to mixtures of charcoal, or wood and
saltpetre; the rapid combustiou called deflagration would be produced, but,
unlike explosion, time would be required for the mutual actions; and
where the quantities were large, many hours would be necessary before
they would cease. The recent destruction of life and property in New
York, the loss of a homeward-bound Indiaman and her cargo, by a similar
cause, have created an anxiety which has led to many inquiries respecting
the origin of the explosions attending the burning of saltpetre. I need not
remind you of a case which occurred at Central Wharf, about ten years
since, when the Hartford Packet was destroyed. The testimony obtained
in the last instance led me to make some experiments on the effects pro
duced by dropping water on a burning mixture of saltpetre and charcoal.
It was ascertained that a very small weight of water, relatively to the salt
petre, caused explosions, which might be made successive, so long as the
materials remained. The quantities of the substances acting being in
creased to between 100 and 200 pounds, the addition of water, in the form
of spray, caused an explosion which destroyed the vessel, and shook all the
buildings in the vicinity. The temperature of a burning mixture of salt
  etre and charcoal, at the points of contact, is superior to that of “white
|. ” iron, and the form is that of a bubbling fluid. Water falling on the

             Dr. R. Hare on the Explosiveness of Nitre.                   529
    This statement of Hayes caused me to recollect, that upon
 one occasion a mischievous explosion had occurred in my
 laboratory, when a fissure taking place in an iron alembic
 holding about twenty pounds of fused nitre, on hoisting the
 alembic off the fire, a jet of the liquefied salt fell accidentally
 upon some water in a tub, which was unfortunately too near.
 It also brought to mind that potassium, when thrown upon
 the surface of water, is, by combustion with the oxygen of
 that liquid, converted into a fused globule of red-hot oxide,
 which, in the act of combining with water, detonates violently.
 This detonation struck me as being clearly owing to a sort of
 double reaction, in which, while one portion of water, by
 uniting with the oxide of potassium, converts it into hydrate
 of potash, another portion, uniting with the heat, flies off ex
 plosively as steam.
    10. In a letter to Hayes, immediately after his explanation
appeared, I stated these facts and inferences; and moreover,
 I endeavoured to illustrate the subject by referring to the ex
 plosion so frequently produced by blacksmiths, through the
 forcible contact with moisture, of incandescent iron struck by
 a hammer. It has been ascertained that globules of oxide of
iron, as they fall in a state of fusion from a wire ignited in
 oxygen, do not at first produce any commotion in water.
 This arises from the generation of a protecting atmosphere of
 rarefied aqueous vapour, which renders contact with the liquid
 water impossible. Widely different would be the result, were
the liquid suddenly forced into contact with the globule by a
blow from a hammer, as above mentioned. Analogous causes
operate when globules of the most volatile liquids or solids are
retained for a time in the cavity of an incandescent metallic
mass is instantly converted into steam, having the elastic force of that used
in steam-guns; exceeding gunpowder in destructive energy. The red-hot
particles, dispersed by the sudden action, pass over considerable spaces,
and the appearance of flame is produced.
   In cases where water falls on highly heated polished surfaces, such as
melted glass, copper, or silver, steam is formed rapidly, but silently; the
water does not touch the hot surface. The spreading of a film or crust
over the polished surface instantly alters its relation to water, and causes
steam to form with explosive violence, attended by a loud report.
   I do not hesitate in expressing my belief, that the disastrous effects pro
duced in New York were caused by water or other fluid falling on salt
petre, while burning with the bags investing it. The facts which I have
stated may have interest or importance in connection with attempts made
to extinguish fire in buildings containing saltpetre. The danger of throw
ing water on the fire is manifest, while the loss to the owner of the salt
petre would doubtless be greater from water than from fire.
                                            Respectfully,

ladle, meanwhile evaporating much more slowly than if the
temperature were less.     In any one of these instances an ex
plosion would follow from a contact being coerced between
the heated surface and the liquid. When a hammer is em
ployed as above described, mechanical force produces that
contact, which, in the explosive union of incandescent oxide
of potassium with water, is caused by intense chemical affinity.
   11. The explosion produced by Hayes, as above mentioned,
and that which took place in my laboratory, as well as the
explosive reaction of oxide of potassium with water, gave a
practical confirmation to the inference, that the meeting of
water with the base of incandescent nitre could cause tre
mendous results. Subsequently, in the winter of 1845–46, I
found that when nitre, by the flame of a hydro-oxygen blow
pipe supplied with atmospheric air and oxygen, is heated to
incandescence, and then quickly submerged in water previouly
situated beneath the containing ladle, a sharp explosion en
sues.    I found, nevertheless, that when thrown, under like
circumstances, upon molasses or sugar, the effects were those
of deflagration rather than explosion. Yet, latterly, I have
fallen upon contrivances, by which pulverized sugar and nitre
may be made to explode. The first expedient which suc
ceeded, was that of pouring melted sugar upon the face of a
hammer, so as to make a disc of commensurate size.        Such a
disc, if it should not adhere, is easily made to do so by slightly
moistening the face of the hammer. Some nitre was put into
a thin shallow platina capsule, situated over a small anvil,
near one of its edges, so that the bottom of the capsule might
be reached obliquely by a hydro-atmospheric blowpipe flame.
Under these circumstances, the nitre having been heated until
its potash began to be volatilized, was struck with the sugar
faced hammer. A smart detonation was the consequence.
This experiment may fail sometimes from the blow not being
properly given; from the nitre not being sufficiently hot; or
the capsule being ill-situated. The explosion of fulminating
mercury by a hammer fails sometimes, from the blow not
being so given as to produce a due degree of parallelism be
tween the surfaces.
   12. Another method of producing explosive reaction is as
follows:—Nitre and sugar being coarsely powdered, let discs
of paper about 3 inches in width be prepared. Place one of
the discs upon an anvil, and cover it with a stratum of sugar.
Then cover the sugar with a stratum of nitre, placing over
this another of the discs.     Heat a flat iron bar, wider than
the discs, to a welding heat, and quickly withdrawing it from
the fire, and holding it above the paper, strike it down thereon

with a sledge. An explosion will ensue, with a very loud re
port. Of course the operator's face should be protected by
a mask, his hands and legs by a leathern or woollen apron
and gloves. The operation may be performed by one person,
but more advantageously by two, as it is difficult for one to
hold the iron in the position most suitable for bringing the
surfaces together with the requisite degree of parallelism.
     13. In a letter in reply to one from Mr. Durant, of New
York, respecting the explosions which are the principal ob
jects of these communications, I adverted to the superiority
of the affinity which exists between water and oxide of potas
sium over that which exists between nitric acid and the same
base", as a reason why the presence of the elements of water,
    * It may be well here to advert to the fact, that one of our young
countrymen, Tilghman, has, without any hint from me, not only perceived
the property of water on which I have insisted, but likewise has had the
sagacity to suggest its application to various useful processes. These have
all been founded on that superior affinity of water for certain bases, on
which, in my letter to Hayes, I had insisted as affording the rationale of the
explosion of nitre either with this liquid, or with any substance containing
 its elements.
    From the preceding suggestions, and some experiments, of which an
account will be subjoined, it appears that the explosive violence of a mix
 ture of nitre with substances containing carbon in union with hydrogen, or
 with hydrogen and oxygen, so as to be competent to convert the base into
 a hydrate or carbonate, is dependent on the force with which they may be
 held or brought together in a state of ignition, being sufficient to permit of
 that increase of temperature which is necessary to explosive reaction.
    Probably at the temperature thus alluded to, the ingredients are all in a
 condition analogous to that of a very dense explosive gaseous mixture. It
 is well known that such mixtures detonate with a velocity apparently not
 less than that of an electrical discharge. A single electrical spark, a particle
 of platina sponge, even a sunbeam, may cause an explosion so instantaneous,
 that it is the collapse only that can be observed. The dilatation which
 precedes the collapse escapes scrutiny. However large the volume, igni
 tion in any one part seems to affect the whole at once.
     I infer, then, that when nitre and certain compounds of carbon with
  hydrogen and oxygen reach a temperature at which the whole mixture, if
  not restrained mechanically, would take the aëriform state by a sudden
 revolution in the electro-chemical polarities, that detonating combination
  ensues, to which, when ignited, various gaseous mixtures are liable. A few
  cubic inches of olefiant gas, with twice the bulk of oxygen, included in
  soap-bubbles and inflamed, will produce a report equal to that of a musket.
  The accidental explosion of a half-gallon of a similar mixture created a
  thundering noise like a field-piece, so as to alarm the whole neighbourhood
  within a furlong of my laboratory.
     Aware of the influence of confinement in augmenting the force of reac
  tion between nitre and combustibles, the distinguished chemists above
  mentioned (as having been called upon by the Corporation of New York
  to investigate the phaenomena under consideration) treated the absence
  of this condition as a reason for discrediting the idea that the reaction of
  nitre with combustibles could account for them. But agreeably to the
                                                               2 M 2

 532         Dr. R. Hare on the Eaplosiveness of Nitre.
 or of hydrogen in union with carbon, should, on ignition with
 nitre, give rise to explosive reaction. Obviously, the conse
  quence of the displacement of nitric acid by water must be,
 that the gaseous constituents of the acid, incapable of remain
 ing in combination without a base, would escape, either as
 nitrogen, nitric oxide, or oxygen gas, or, carbon being pre
 sent, partially, as carbonic oxide, or carbonic acid.
     14. Gum, sugar, starch, and lignin, consist of carbon in
 union with the elements of water, being virtually hydrates of
 carbon. Oils, resins, or bitumens, consist of carbon and hy
 drogen, with but little oxygen. Of course either, when
 heated with nitre, can supply water to the base of this salt,
 with, if not without, assistance from its oxygen, which consti
 tutes nearly half of the matter in nitre. Such substances
 may, therefore, under favourable circumstances, perform the
 part performed by sulphur in gunpowder, which I conceive
 to be that of seizing the potassium and liberating the acid, so
 as to enable its oxygen to react freely with the carbon and the
 resulting sulphide of potassium. Considerations analogous
 to those advanced respecting the agency of the elements of
 water in exploding with nitrates, will apply with respect to
 those of carbonic acid; since carbonated alkalies, no less than
 the hydrated, being indecomposable per se by heat, carbon as
 well as hydrogen must, by uniting with one portion of the
 oxygen of the nitric acid and taking hold of the base, expel
all the nitrogen with the rest of the oxygen.
    15. Having submitted the preceding facts and considera
tions, my explanation of the stupendous explosion which forms
the topic of this communication is as follows:–
    Of the enormous quantity of nitre which the store held,
more than 56,000 pounds were on the first floor, about
 180,000 pounds on the second floor, and about 100,000 on
the third floor. The weight of combustible merchandise was
about 700,000 pounds. As it was alleged by some of the
witnesses examined that the iron window shutters of an upper
story became red-hot by the conflagration of an adjoining
house, it is probable that fire was communicated to some of
the gunny bags holding the nitre, or some other combustibles,
which, as stated in evidence, were piled against the shutters.
As soon, however, as a single bag became ignited, the nitre
facts, I propose to show that there must have been a mechanical force in
operation sufficient to bring the matter into a state analogous to that
which enables fulminating combinations, or explosive mixtures of gas, to
detonate either from ignition, from exposure to an electric spark, or, in
some instances, from a blow or catalysis; in other words, from some in
fluence like that exercised by platina sponge.

           Dr. R. Hare on the Explosiveness of Nitre.       533
with which the inner bag must have been imbued, would give
the greatest deflagrating intensity to the consequent combus
tion; while the interstices between the bags, like those be
tween grains of gunpowder, would enable the flame to pervade
the whole heap of bags. As nitre fuses at a low red heat,
very soon a great quantity, in a state of lique<U+017F>action, must
have run down upon the wooden floor, which would imme
diately burst into an intense state of reaction with the oxygen
of the salt. To this combustion the merchandise adjoining
would add fuel, causing a still more extensive liquefaction of
the nitre. The deflagrating mass thus created, on burning
its way through the floor, or falling through the scuttles,
which were all open agreeably to the evidence, must have re
ceived an enormous reinforcement from the subjacent nitre or
combustible merchandise. On the giving way of each floor
in succession, the conflagration must have received a rein
forcement of deflagrating fuel, so as to have grown rapidly
with its growth, and strengthened with its strength. Under
these circumstances, the whole of the nitre, becoming liquefied,
must have found its way to the cellar. Meanwhile the mer
chandise and the charcoal of the wood-work must have been
conglomerated by the fusibility of the sugar, shell-lac and bi
tumen, aided by the molasses, and formed thus an antagonistic
mass of more than half a million of pounds in weight, defla
grating intensely with the nitre.       But whenever, by these
means, a portion of the deflagrating congeries attained the
fulminating temperature, a detonation must have ensued,
causing a temporary lifting of the combustible mass; only,
 however, to be followed by a more active collision, resulting
from the subsequent falling back of the conglomerated com
 bustible mass upon the melted nitre. After every such colli
 sion, the combustible congeries must have been blown up to
 a height augmenting with the temperature, the force of the
 fall, and extent of reciprocal penetration. The force of the
 fall would, of course, be as the height. Hence the twelve or
 thirteen successive detonations indicate as many explosive
 collisions; while the successive augmentation of the loudness
 of the reports indicates a proportionable growth of their vio
 lence, arising from successively greater elevation and descent.
     16. If I am right in supposing that in fulminating power
 the intensely heated nitre and the combustible merchandise
 were for equal weights equivalent to gunpowder, if only a
 sixth of the 300,000 pounds of nitre held in the store was
 engaged in the final explosion, it would be equivalent to
 60,000 pounds of gunpowder.
     17. No better way of estimating the force with which the

534       Dr. R. Hare on the Explosiveness of Nitre.
nitre and combustibles were brought into collision for the last
time, at which the finishing explosion took place, has oc
curred, than that of comparing it with the blow by which
nitre and sugar were exploded, as above mentioned, in one
of my experiments.
   The weight of the combustible matter contained within the
store was 700,000 pounds. The store was 90 feet deep by
24 wide. Supposing the horizontal area of the sledge, as ap
plied, to have been 3 × 3=9 square inches, it seems that for
every equivalent horizontal area within the store, there must
have been twenty-two pounds, or about three times the weight
of the sledge. Hence, in descending from a height of 20 or
30 feet, which there was ample room for it to reach, the com
bustible congeries may have attained a much greater velocity
than could be imparted to the sledge, and may consequently
have produced a much more forcible impact. At the same
time, this must have caused an intimate penetration and in
tensity of compression, which by a dead weight it is almost
impossible to create.
   This explanation, so far as it rests upon the assumption
that the combustibles were made to dance upon the surface
of the melted nitre, is supported by the fact, that any combus
tible mass, when thrown upon the surface of incandescent
nitre, will undergo a dancing motion, so as sometimes to leap
out of a deep pot within which the experiment may be made.
   18. The phaenomena are not irreconcilable with the idea
that some of the earlier explosions arose from the falling of the
liquid nitre upon the combustibles before all the floors gave
way; but it should be recollected that nitre fuses at a low red
heat, and at a cherry-red gives out oxygen gas. The pre
sence of this gas, as well as the deflagration resulting from
contact with the liquid nitre, must have caused the floors to
be oxidized with a rapidity far exceeding that which takes
place during ordinary conflagrations*, To the causes of
quick destruction thus suggested, must be added the mecha
nical force of the explosions directly at war with the per
sistence of the floors. That, prior to the last explosion, the
nitre must have been collected in the cellar, may be assumed
from the fact, that the temperature being inevitably far above
its fusing-point, the salt must have been all liquefied, and oc
cupying the lowest accessible cavity, on account of its supe
rior specific gravity. This assumption is moreover justified
by the circumstance that the force of the explosion appears to
have been especially exerted upon the parietes of the cellar,
             * See Note to paragraph 9, pages 528, 529.

            Dr. R. Hare on the Explosiveness of Nitre.         535
the walls and surrounding earth having given way in a man
ner which created astonishment.
    19. In order to amplify the practical basis upon which the
preceding inferences had been founded, I made some experi
ments on the combustion of gunpowder in an exhausted
receiver, so as to secure the gaseous products evolved. A
cylindrical glass receiver, such as is usually employed as a
candle-shade, was ground upon a lap-wheel, so as to fit air
tight between two discs of sheet brass. The disc for closing
the upper opening of the receiver was furnished with two
cocks severally, for communicating with an air-pump and ba
rometer gauge. The disc for closing the lower opening of
the receiver, so as to form the bottom of the space included,
was furnished with an arch of platinum wire soldered to two
stouter brass wires, of which one was soldered to the disc, the
other secured and insulated in passing through it by a collet
of leather, compressed about it by an appropriate screw.
These preparations being made, a portion of gunpowder,
weighing about twenty-five grains, was so supported on a tray,
as to include the middle portion of the platinum wire. The
receiver being put into its place, so as to be duly supported
by the lower disc and covered by the other, the air was with
drawn, as far as practicable, with a good air-pump. In the
next place, the wire was ignited to incandescence. To my
surprise, the gunpowder only smoked at first, and did not
flash until a perceptible interval had elapsed. When this
result ensued, it appeared to be owing to the radiant heat, as
the early volatilization of a portion of sulphur had driven the
granules away from the wire, so that it did not touch any of
 them. Subsequently, on allowing the air to enter, and re
 moving the receiver, it appeared that the gunpowder was only
 partially burned. Thus it became evident that in this way a
 complete combustion could not be effected. The feebleness
 of the flash in vacuo shows how much confinement is essential
 to give energy to the explosion of this powerful agent; and its
 not being forthwith ignited by an incandescent wire, demon
 strates, that, as in the case of the apparent quiescence of a glo
 bule of volatile matter in an intensely heated cavity, a capa
 bility of volatilization delays this process, by preventing the
 contiguity requisite to a communication of heat.
    20. This leads to a discrimination which has not, to the
 best of my knowledge, been made heretofore. I allude to the
 difference existing between fulminating combinations and ful
 minating mixtures. As an example of the latter, we have
 gunpowder and other pulverulent mixtures consisting par
 tially of nitre, or chlorate of potash, while, as an exemplifica

536       Dr. R. Hare on the Eaplosiveness of Nitre.
tion of the former, we may advert to aurum or argentum ful
minans, or to the fulminates of mercury or silver; also to the
chloride or iodide of nitrogen, or perchloric aether. Com
pounds of the last-mentioned kind, without confinement, break
the vessel on which they are exploded. They cannot be used
in gunnery, because the force in their immediate vicinity, in
proportion to its durability, is too great, so that they burst
the chamber before the ball moves an available distance.
The elements in these combinations are in a state of intense
chemical union, and can only leave that state for another, by
which gases and vapours are produced with an instantaneous
and almost irresistible expansibility. They require no con
finement, because already confined by their reciprocal affini
ties. In gunpowder and analogous mixtures, the ingredients
exist without any forcible coherence, so that an incipient re
action causes a tendency to move apart, which prevents the
reaction from extending itself when there is no confinement.
This was strikingly shown by attempting to burn in vacuo a
small cylinder of consolidated gunpowder, made by intense
pressure within a metallic tube by a steel piston. This cylin
der, about a half-inch in diameter and an inch in length, was
placed in contact with a platinum wire within an exhausted
receiver. The wire being ignited, a feeble combustion en
sued. Subsequent examination showed that the cylinder was
only about half deflagrated, the unburnt portion remaining
unchanged. It had been extinguished spontaneously, after
being completely ignited at the end in contact with the incan
descent wire.
   21. This was, no doubt, in consequence of the process
being effected in a rarefied medium. In order to compare
these observations with those which might be made by com
bustion in pleno, I made a larger cylinder of gunpowder, 2
inches in diameter and 2 inches in height, by similar means,
and set fire to it by an iron rod ignited at one end. This I
caused to touch the top of the cylinder while standing upright
at the bottom of a cast-iron pot about 4 inches in diameter,
and a foot in depth. The combustion very much resembled
that of a rocket, commencing feebly, however, yet terminating
with a deflagration so rapid as to be almost explosive. The
augmentation of intensity I ascribe to the increased resist
ance from reaction with the gas evolved, which pressed upon
the cylinder with a force like that which elevates a rocket.
   22. Finding that, in vacuo, a perfect combustion could not
be accomplished by the means above mentioned, I resorted
to an arrangement through which a cylinder of consoli
dated gunpowder might be so supported by a rod sliding in

          Dr. R. Hare on the Eaplosiveness of Nitre.        537
a stuffing-box as to be pushed upwards against a wire ignited
by a galvanic battery within an exhausted receiver. When,
by these means, the ignition of gunpowder was attempted, it
was not very readily accomplished. The part touching the
wire appeared to burn feebly; nevertheless, by turning the
rod so as to cause the cylinder to revolve, and consequently
to be assailed at various points, combustion was induced and
gradually extended, and at last completed satisfactorily.
    23. The receiver employed was held between two metallic
plates, one forming the bottom, the other the cap. Through
the middle of the bottom the sliding rod was introduced, so
 as to be in the axis of the cavity. It was secured by two
stuffing-boxes, the object of the outer one being to enable the
 rod to pass through the orifice of a vessel of oil, employed to
prevent the possibility of air entering through that next the
cavity. The juncture of the cap with the receiver was covered
 by cold water, which served to prevent leakage, and keep
 down the temperature. This was ascertained by a thermo
 meter within the receiver, yet accessible to inspection. The
 cavity, thus secured against leakage, held 240 cubic inches;
 the contents being indicated by a column of mercury in a
 barometer tube situated before a scale graduated into 480
 parts. Of course, the whole contents being 240 cubic inches,
 as above stated, each graduation represented half a cubic
 inch.
     24. The igniting wire was soldered to the ends of brass
 rods, of which one was soldered to the cap, the other secured
 by collets of leather, so as to pass through the cap without
 metallic contact. Consequently, connexion being made be
 tween this insulated rod and one pole of a battery, while the
 other pole had a metallic communication with the cap, the
  wire might at any moment be made the medium of a circuit
 competent for its intense ignition.
     25. The upper end of the sliding rod supported a little
 disc of sheet copper, and a little below that disc was sup
 ported, in like manner, a larger disc of the same material
  perforated like a colander.
     26. Upon the upper disc, the consolidated gunpowder being
  supported with all the above-mentioned arrangements, the
  receiver was replaced.
     27. The air was withdrawn until the mercury in the gauge
  tube attained nearly the height of the column within an ad
 joining Torricellian tube, or that of a neighbouring barometer.
  The height was recorded, likewise the temperature indicated
  by the thermometer. The fall of the barometrical column of
  mercury in the gauge-tube, resulting from the operation, was
  not estimated until the mercury in the thermometer was in

538        Dr. R. Hare on the Explosiveness of Nitre.
statu quo. The difference in degrees caused in the height of
the barometric column, divided by two, gave the number of
cubic inches of gaseous matter evolved. This difference was
of course set down.
   28. In the next place, the temperature being carefully ob
served and recorded, about 2 cubic inches of a strong solu
tion of caustic potash were added. The consequent absorption,
as it declined in rapidity, was assisted by an agitation conse
quent to moving up and down the rod, and the perforated
disc attached to it. When no more absorption could be ob
served to take place, judging by the quiescence of the mercu
rial column in the gauge, and when the temperature had re
turned to the starting-point from which it had been disturbed
by the heat generated through the reaction between the alkali
and carbonic acid, the height of the column was again re
corded, and the difference of degrees, divided by two, was
estimated to give the number of cubic inches of carbonic acid
generated. Allowance was made for the mechanical effect of
the bulk of the alkaline liquid in lowering the mercurial
column founded on actual measurement of the effect of a like
quantity of water; the mercury being brought to the same
height in the gauge-tube, in an experiment made for the pur
pose with atmospheric air.
   29. Three samples of Dupont's powder were obtained from
the United States Arsenal, severally designated cannon,
musket, and rifle powder. Of each, 75 grains were pressed
into an indurated cylindrical mass, as above described, and
successively burned in the exhausted receiver.
   The following are the results:—
   Cannon powder, gas evolved . . . 55 cubic inches.
            ---       ... absorbed . . 23;           ---

    ... absorbed    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  25       ---
   30. As the gas left after the removal of the carbonic acid
had all the negative characteristics of nitrogen, it may be
concluded from the results above given, that the gaseous pro
ducts of deflagrated gunpowder consist of nearly equal volumes
of carbonic acid and nitrogen.
   31. I was naturally led to compare the results of the defla
gration of gun-cotton with those of gunpowder. Accordingly,
I exposed a tuft of gun-cotton, weighing 25 grains, in the

          Dr. R. Hare on the Eaplosiveness of Nitre.        539
exhausted receiver in a similar way. I found a retardation in
the activity of the combustion arising, as in the case of gun
powder, from the absence of mechanical confinement, dimi
nution of atmospheric pressure tending to lessen the contiguity
indispensable to intense chemical reaction.
   32. The deflagration of the tuft being effected, it caused an
evolution of gas equal to 19% cubic inches.
   83. In order to concentrate the combustible ingredients,
resort was had to the apparatus employed in the case of gun
powder, by which means 25 grains of the cotton could be
condensed into a cylinder of about half an inch in width, and
of a like length.
   34. Two specimens of gun-cotton, of the manufacture of
Lennig, of 54 grains each, prepared and ignited as above de
scribed, gave an evolution equal to 126} cubic inches.
   35. As 75 grains of gunpowder gave only 55 cubic inches
of gas at most, it appears that equal weights being employed,
gun-cotton causes a gaseous evolution more than three times
as great as gunpowder.
   36. As 75 grains of gunpowder produce, taking the largest
amount in the above table, only 55 cubic inches of gas, it
follows, that to produce an effect equal to 54 grains of gun
cotton, 172} grains of gunpowder would be requisite.
   37. The gunpowder evolved little more than seven-tenths
of a cubic inch per grain, while the gun-cotton evolved more
than two cubic inches per grain.
   88. The gas arising from the gun-cotton did not admit of
an examination so simple as that given out by gunpowder.
   39. By the introduction of 100 cubic inches of oxygen gas,
it appeared from the consequent red fumes, and absorption by
water, that about 35 cubic inches of nitric oxide had been
formed: by the introduction of caustic potash, about 25 cubic
inches of carbonic acid were indicated. One-third of the resi
dual gas being exploded with oxygen, appeared to consist of
three volumes of hydrogen to four of carbon vapour. The
washings gave indications of cyanogen.
   40. The coexistence of nitric oxide, carburetted hydrogen
and cyanogen, in the products, justifies the idea, that were the
heat greater, the expansive effect would be augmented by the
 transfer of the two atoms of oxygen in the oxide, to the hy
 drogen and carbon, producing augmentation of temperature,
carbonic acid and aqueous vapour. In order to bring the
explosive power of gun-cotton to its maximum, I infer that
immense resistance would be necessary, thus concentrating
and expediting the reaction.
   41. The residue of the explosion of gunpowder appears,
from a qualitative analysis, to consist of sulphocyanide and

 540       Dr. R. Hare on the Eaplosiveness of Nitre.
sulphide of potassium, with carbonate and sulphate of potash.
The two latter are by much the more abundant products.
 Probably sulphur is the primary and most energetic ingre
dient, as when in excess it is, per se, known to be capable of
completely decomposing potash at a moderate heat, while
carbon can only partially effect an analogous change at the
highest heat of a furnace. Faraday has recently alleged, that
the production of the flame of sulphide of potassium is an
important agent in the explosive ignition of gunpowder. It
is likely that from the reaction of oxygen with sulphur and
potassium, a temperature results sufficiently high for the com
bustion of the charcoal with oxygen, and of nitrogen with
sulphur and carbon, whence ensues carbonic acid and sulpho
cyanogen, in union with potassium in the one case, and with
potash in the other.
   42. I have already distinguished the explosion of mixtures
like gunpowder from fulminating combinations, of which the
constituents, being held together by intense chemical affinity,
require no mechanical confinement nor impact to bring or
keep them sufficiently near each other for reciprocal reaction.
There is, however, another distinction to be made.       The ex
plosion of vessels by high steam is altogether the effect of heat
and confinement. The resulting violence, when the vessel
bursts, is directly as its strength; so that, knowing how many
pounds per square inch the vessel was capable of bearing, we
know the explosive force to have been exactly equal thereto.
But the strength of the containing vessel, in the case of gun
powder, may be very far short of that generated by the gun
powder ignited within it. When held together until the tem
perature is attained which is requisite for the play of affinities
into which the ingredients are disposed to enter, a sudden
evolution of heat and gaseous matter takes place, producing a
diruptive force far beyond the retaining power of the vessel.
   43. Although gun-cotton is a chemical combination con
sisting of nitric acid and lignin, yet it does not explode, when
unconfined, with a violence approaching to that of other ful
minating combinations above mentioned. This may be attri
buted to the fact that neither the elements of nitric acid, nor
those of lignin, are held together by a strong affinity, and
consequently the forces which resist explosion are but feeble.
                             Summary.
   It is an old and well-accredited maxim in chemistry, to
which there are but few exceptions, that fluidity is requisite
to chemical reaction. The fluid state, of which the necessity
is thus asserted, is with few exceptions attained only through
water, or heat, or both.      In truth, however, when it is con

          Dr. R. Hare on the Explosiveness of Nitre.                   541
sidered that without heat there could be no fluidity, heat may
be viewed as the sole solvent. As respects the induction of
the state requisite to chemical reaction, we may consider the
solution in which water is the ostensible agent, or igneous
fusion in which it is absent, as the only means of bringing
the atoms of solids into the state requisite for chemical reac
tion, through which decompositions and recompositions are
effected.                                              -
   It is well known that the affinities which prevail among the
same set of bodies when liquefied by aqueous solution, may
be the opposite of those which they exert when indebted to
heat solely for liquefaction. Thus there is scarcely any acid
which will not displace silicic or boric acid from alkaline
bases when in aqueous solution; yet when salts, consisting in
part of the most energetic acids, are fused with silicic or boric
acid, decomposition ensues in consequence of the union of the
acids last-mentioned, with the bases ignited with them.
    The sulphates, carbonates, or hydrates of potash, soda,
and of some other bases, are per se indecomposable at any heat
at which their bases cannot be volatilized; yet the nitrates of
the same bases are decomposed at the temperature of incan
descence. It follows, that if a nitrate be exposed to igneous
fusion with any substance consisting more or less of hydrogen,
 carbon, or sulphur, the oxygen of the nitrate will, by form
 ing water with the hydrogen, carbonic acid with the carbon,
 or sulphuric acid with the sulphur, cause the nitrate to be
 replaced by a hydrate, a carbonate, or sulphate”.
    But as in every atom of nitrate there are, independently of
 the base, 5 atoms of oxygen, and since to convert hydrogen
 into water requires 1 atom, to convert carbon into carbonic
 acid requires 2 atoms, and to effect an analogous change in
 sulphur requires 3 atoms, it follows, that for every atom of
 hydrogen there will be 4 atoms of oxygen liberated, for every
 atom of carbon 3 atoms, and for every atom of sulphur 2
 atoms. Each atom of oxygen is to the weight of nitrate of
 potash as 8 to 102; hence there will be           jº               nearly
 32 per cent., by carbon nearly 24 per cent., by sulphur 16
 per cent. of oxygen evolved to act upon the excess of the con
 tiguous combustible matter. Meanwhile it must be recollected
 that in gum, sugar, starch, and lignin (or fibre of wood, cotton,
 or linen), both hydrogen and oxygen exist in due propor
   * The power of decomposing incandescent nitre by aqueous vapour,
 which was inferred by me to exist in 1845, has since been fully verified by
 the employment of this vapour by an American chemist, Tilghman, to effect
 the decomposition of compounds containing potash, or other alkaline bases
 capable of forming hydrates, per se, indecomposable by heat. (See Note,
 pages 531, 532.)

tion to generate water; and besides these compounds formed
with oxygen, we have nitrogen to aid*, which is more incoer
cible than water or carbonic acid. Since at the heat produced
by the combustion of hydrogen or carbon, with pure oxygen,
iron, the most tenacious of all the materials at our command,
is perfectly fusible, it is evident that by mechanism we cannot
restrain the expansive force of the gaseous products producible
as above represented. I believe I may say, that water has
never been confined under a white heat.               Yet the expansive
force of liquid carbonic acid is at the freezing-point of water
36 times as great as the pressure of this liquid at its boiling
point. It has already been observed, that nitrogen in ex
pansive violence must go beyond carbonic acid. It follows,
that excepting the blow of a hammer, or the force created by
gravitation in falling bodies, we have no means by which we
can enable nitre, in the state of incandescent igneous fluidity,
to come into close contact, even for an instant, with masses of
combustible matter, like those which it was made to encounter
in the store of Messrs. Crocker and Warren.
    It is to be presumed that it has been the want of this force
which has caused efforts to produce explosions between nitre
and combustibles to fail; and it is to the presence of this
force, where the fall of enormous masses of agglutinated com
bustible matter upon incandescent liquefied nitre may be
reiterated, that I ascribe the destructive explosions, which,
under such circumstances, have been so prolific of impoverish
ment, mutilation, and death.

     PREPARATION OF ATROPIA BY MEANS OF CHLOROFORM.
                            BY M. RABOURDIN,
THE following is the process proposed by the author above named:
      —Take fresh belladonna as soon as it begins to flower; bruise it
in a marble mortar and press out the juice, which is to be heated to
80° or 90° centigrade to coagulate the albumen. When the juice thus
clarified is cold, add to every litre 4 grammes of caustic potash and
30 grammes of chloroform; shake the whole for a minute, and let
it stand. In half an hour, the chloroform holding atropia is depo
sited, having the appearance of a greenish oil; the supernatant
liquor is poured off, and replaced by a little water; this is afterwards
poured off, and the washing is to be continued till the water comes
away limpid. The chloroform solution is them to be put into a
small tubulated retort, and distilled on a water-bath until all the
chloroform has passed into the receiver. The residue in the retort is
to be treated with a little water, acidified with sulphuric acid, which
dissolves the atropia, and leaves a green resinoid matter; the filtered

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               543
solution is colourless.   To have the atropia pure, it is only requisite
to pour into the acid solution a slight excess of solution of carbonate
of potash, and to dissolve the precipitate in rectified alcohol. This
solution yields, by spontaneous evaporation, fine groups of acicular
crystals of atropia.
   In the absence of the fresh plant, the officinal extract, which has
been well prepared, may be substituted for it : 30 grammes of ex
tract of belladonna, prepared from the purified juice of the plant, were
dissolved in 100 grammes of distilled water; to the filtered solution
were added 2 grammes of caustic potash and 15 grammes of chloro
form. After agitating the mixture for a minute and setting it aside
for half an hour, the chloroform containing atropia was deposited,
the supernatant liquor was decanted and replaced by water, which
was three times renewed; the chloroformic solution weighed 11
grammes, so that 4 grammes of chloroform were lost during the
manipulation. This solution exposed to the air rapidly evaporated,
leaving a crystalline greenish mass consisting almost entirely of
atropia; this, treated with dilute sulphuric acid, and precipitated by
carbonate of potash, gave a precipitate weighing 16 centigrammes.
It was totally soluble in rectified alcohol, and yielded by sponta
neous evaporation fine needles of atropia.
   The author of this mode of operating with belladonna is of opi
nion that it is susceptible of generalization, and of application to
many other substances containing organic alkalies; if it does not
prove an oeconomical method of preparing these products, it will
serve, at any rate, in some cases, as a ready means of estimating the
value of certain commercial products.
   In a future communication the author proposes to give a process
for estimating quickly and commercially the alkalies of cinchonas,
by acting on very small quantities of them; and will also show that
by means of chloroform, traces of iodine may be ascertained more
advantageously than by starch.—Comptes Rendus, Octobre 14, 1850.
 ON THE COMPOSITION OF CIERTAIN NATURAL ORGANIC BASES,
                         BY M. A. DE PLANTA.
   It is remarked by the author, that the researches of a great num
ber of chemists have of late years given great impulse to the study
of the composition of the vegetable alkalies. In this so cultivated a
field there remain, however, some gaps to be filled, and this M. de
Planta has, therefore, endeavoured to effect with respect to atropia,
daturina and aconitina.
   Atropia.-This was prepared by M. Merck of Darmstadt; it had
the form of very fine needles, which were unalterable by exposure
to the air, and heavier than water. At common temperatures, 1 part
of atropia requires about 300 parts of water for solution. Alcohol
dissolves it in all proportions; aether less readily.
   At 90° centigrade, atropia melts into a colourless transparent
liquid, and becomes on cooling a brittle mass, in which, after long
continued fusion, crystals are often observable grouped in stars. At
140° it is partly volatilized, but the greater portion is decomposed.

     The aqueous solution of atropia possesses strong alkaline reaction;
 it combines with alkalies [acids PJ to form neutral uncrystallizable
 salts.   Evaporated in vacuo, these salts become of the consistence
 of syrups; they dissolve very readily in water and in alcohol, less so
 in aether. The hydrochlorate of atropia acts with reagents in the
 following manner:-Potash, ammonia and carbonate of potash, added
 to very concentrated solutions of this salt, give pulverulent precipi
 tates readily soluble in excess of the reagent. Carbonate of am
 monia, bicarbonate of soda, and phosphate of soda, do not give pre
 cipitates. Chloride of gold gives a crystalline precipitate of a yellow
 colour, which is but slightly soluble in hydrochloric acid. Chloride
 of platina forms a pulverulent precipitate, which readily aggluti
 nºtes into a resinous mass, dissolving in hydrochloric acid. The
 bichloride of mercury precipitates only very concentrated solutions
 of hydrochlorate of atropia. The double iodide of mercury and po
 tassium forms a white thick precipitate, which agglutinates strongly
on the addition of hydrochloric acid. The iodide of potassium and
 sulphocyanide of potassium give no precipitate. Tincture of iodine
precipitates the hydrochlorate of atropia of a brown colour; iodic
acid does not colour it; neither infusion nor tincture of galls yields a
precipitate till hydrochloric acid is added.         -
    Picric acid occasions a sulphur-yellow precipitate, and nitric acid
does not dissolve it.
    M. Planta analysed uncombined atropia and the double chloride
of atropia and gold. His analyses indicate the composition as
C*H*NO", HCl-HAuCl’; the composition of uncombined atropia
is consequently expressed by C*H*NO". This formula was checked
by an experiment, by which the author determined the quantity of
hydrochloric acid gas absorbed by a given weight of atropia. He
found that 100 parts of atropia absorbed 13.85 parts of hydrochloric
gas, which agrees very well with the equivalent deduced from the
salt of gold. M. Planta also ascertained the quantity of sulphuric
acid exactly necessary to saturate a given quantity of atropia. The
equivalent calculated by this last experiment agreed equally well
with the theoretical equivalent.
   Daturina.-This was extracted in 1833 by MM. Geiger and Hesse
from the Datura stramonium ; it has the form of small brilliant needles
aggregated in tufts; it is colourless, unalterable in the air, and
heavier than water.                                                     -
   M. Planta has observed, that in its combination of properties, and
also in its composition, this alkali is similar to atropia. The double
chloride of daturina and gold may be obtained under the form of a
crystalline mass, of a fine golden-yellow colour.                       -
   Its composition is expressed by the formula C*H*NO", HCl

   Aconitina. –The discovery of this base is also due to MM. Geiger
and Hesse, who obtained it in 1833 from the Aconitum napellus.
Previously to examining the properties and composition of this base,
M. Planta purified the commercial article by the following process :

after dissolving it in aether, he evaporated the aethereal solution ; the
syrupy residue was redissolved in absolute alcohol, and the solution
was gradually poured into cold water, with continual shaking.
There was thus obtained a dense flocculent precipitate, which was
pressed between folds of paper and dried in vacuo.
    Aconitina thus prepared has the form of a powder, which is colour
less and inodorous, and completely unalterable in the air. Heated on
a strip of platina, it readily melts, takes fire and leaves a coaly resi
due, which easily incinerates. It is impossible to volatilize it par
tially, like atropia; it is heavier than water, and is very slightly soluble
in it. It dissolves very readily in alcohol, and less so in aether.
    It fuses at 80°, and on cooling becomes a vitreous, transparent
mass. At 120° it begins to become brown.
    It has a strong alkaline reaction, and saturates acids perfectly.
Its salts are uncrystallizable. Hydrochlorate of aconitina reacts as
follows:–Potash, ammonia and carbonate of potash, form a white
flocculent precipitate of aconitina, slightly soluble in excess of the
reagent. Carbonate of ammonia, bicarbonate of soda, and phosphate
of soda give no precipitate. Chloride of gold gives a thick precipi
tate of a whitish yellow colour, slightly soluble in hydrochloric acid.
With the chloride of mercury and the sulphocyanide of potassium,
white cheesy precipitates are obtained, and with tincture of iodine a
kermes-coloured precipitate. Tincture of galls and gallic acid pre
cipitated aconitina after the addition of a drop of hydrochloric acid.
Picric acid forms a dense precipitate of a sulphur-yellow colour.
    The author's analyses indicate as the formula of aconitina C"H"
NO"; the double hydrochlorate of aconitina and gold contains
C* Hº NO14, HCl·H Au Cl3+ H2 O’.
    M. Planta found that 0:2970 gr. of this alkali absorbed at 100°,
0.0460 of hydrochloric gas, which corresponds to 31:41 of hydro
chloric acid in 100 parts of the hydrochlorate represented by the
formula C*H* NO”, 2HC1.—Journ. de Chim. Méd., Octobre 1850.
        MAGNETIC AND DIAMAGNETIC CONDITION OF GASES.
                                                             Nov. 29, 1850.
    The Bakerian Lecture was delivered yesterday by Prof. Faraday
to a crowded audience.         At this late period of the month we can
only glance at the highly interesting investigations laid before the
Royal Society, reserving a fuller motice for our next Number.
    One of the conclusions arrived at by the author was, that the
motions of magnetic and diamagnetic bodies in each other do
not appear to resemble those of attraction or repulsion of the ordi
nary kind, but to be of a differential action, dependent perhaps upon
the manner in which the lines of magnetic force were affected in
passing from one to the other during their course from pole to pole,
 the differential action being in ordinary cases between the body
experimented with and the medium surrounding it and the poles.
 A method of showing this action with the gases is described, in
 which delicate soap-bubbles are made to contain a given gas, and
then, when held in the magnetic field, approach, or are driven further
 off, according as they contain gases, magnetic or diamagnetic, in
relation to air. Oxygen passes inwards or tends towards the mag
 netic axis, confirming the results formerly described by the author.
     Perceiving that if two like bubbles were set on opposite sides

   of a magnetic core or keeper cut into the shape of an hour
   glass, they would compensate each other, both for their own dia
   magnetic matter and for the air which they would displace; and
    that only the contents of the bulbs would be virtually in a differ
    ential relation to each other, the author passed from bubbles of
    soapy water to others of glass; and then constructed a differential
    torsion balance to which these could be attached, of the following
    nature:–A horizontal lever was suspended by cocoon silk, and at
    right angles to the end of one arm was attached a horizontal cross
    bar, on which, at about 1% inch apart, and equidistant from the
    horizontal lever, were suspended the glass bubbles; and then the
    whole being adjusted so that one bubble should be on one side of
    the iron core and the other on the other side, any difference in their
    tendency to set inwards or outwards from the axial line causes them to
    take up their places of rest at different distances from the magnetic
    axis; and the power necessary to bring them to an equidistant position
   becomes a measure of their relative magnetic or diamagnetic force.
       In the first place, different gases were tried against each other, and
   when oxygen was one of them it went inwards, driving every other
   outwards. The other gases, when compared together, gave nearly
   equal results, and require a more delicate and finished balance to
   measure and determine the amount of their respective forces.
       The author now conceived that he had attained to the long-sought
-  power of examining gaseous bodies in relation to the effects of heat
   and the effects of expansion separately; and proceeded to an investi- .
   gation of the latter point. For this purpose he prepared glass bubbles
   containing a full atmosphere, or half an atmosphere, or any other
   proportion of a given gas; having thus the power of diluting it
   without the addition of any other body. The effect was most stri
   king. When nitrogen and oxygen bubbles were put into the balance,
   each at one atmosphere, the oxygen drove the nitrogen out power
   fully. When the oxygen bubble was replaced by other bubbles
   containing oxygen, the tendency inwards of the oxygen was less
   powerful; and when what may be called an oxygen vacuum (being
   a bulb filled with oxygen, exhausted, and then hermetically sealed)
   was put up, it simply balanced the nitrogen bubble. Oxygen at
   half an atmosphere was less magnetic than that at one atmosphere,
   but more magnetic than other oxygen at one-third of an atmosphere;
   and that at one-third surpassed the vacuum. In fact, the bubble with
   its contents was more magnetic in proportion to the oxygen it con
   tained. On the other hand, nitrogen showed no difference of this
   kind; whether a bubble contained that gas more or less condensed, its
   power was the same. Other gases (excepting olefiant and cyanogen)
  seemed in this first rough apparatus to be in the same condition.
      Hence the author decides upon the place for zero, and concludes
  that simple space presents that case. When matter is added to
  space it carries its own property with it there, adding either magnetic
  or diamagnetic force to the space so occupied in proportion to the
  quantity of matter employed; and now thinking that the point of
  zero is well determined, he concludes to use the word magnetic as a
  general term, and distinguish the two classes of magnetic bodies into
  paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances.
