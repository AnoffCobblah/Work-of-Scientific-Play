     malleable.   By -WILLIAM HyDE Wollaston, M.D. F.R.S.
•
     &c.”
         from long experience, I probably am better acquainted
  AŠ.with    the treatment of platina, so as to render it perfectly
  malleable, than any other member of this Society,             I  will en
  deavour to describe, as briefly as is consistent with perspi
  cuity, the processes which       I put in practice for this purpose,
  during a series of years, without seeing any occasion to wish
  for further improvement.
      The usual means of giving chemical purity to this metal, by
  solution in aqua regia and precipitation with sal ammoniac,
  are known to every chemist; but            I  doubt whether sufficient
  care is usually taken to avoid dissolving the iridium contained
  in the ore, by due dilution of the solvent. In an account which
  I  gave in the Philosophical Transactions for 1804, of a new
  metal, rhodium, contained in crude platina,           I have mentioned
  this precaution, but omitted to state to what degree the acids
  should be diluted.      I now therefore recommend, that to every
  measure of the     strongest     muriatic acid employed, there be
  added an     equal  measure of water; and moreover, that the
  nitric acid used be what is called “single aquafortis;” as well
  for the sake of obtaining a purer result, as of oeconomy in the
  purchase of nitric acid.
      With regard to the proportions in which the acids are to
  be used,   I  may say, in round numbers, that muriatic acid,
  equivalent to 150 marble, together with nitric acid equivalent
           * From  the Philosophical  Transactions for 1829, Part I.

2                              Dr. Wollaston                 on a Method
to 40 marble, will take 100 of crude platina; but in order to
avoid waste of acid, and also to render the solution purer, there
should be in the menstruum a redundance of 20 per cent at
least of the ore. The acids should be allowed to digest three
or four days, with a heat which ought gradually to be raised.
The solution, being then poured off, should be suffered to
stand until a quantity of fine pulverulent ore of iridium, sus
pended in the liquid, has completely subsided; and should
then be mixed with 41 parts of sal ammoniac, dissolved in
about five times their weight of water. The first precipitate,
which will thus be obtained, will weigh about 165 parts, and
will yield about 66 parts of pure platina.
   As the mother-liquor will still contain about 11 parts of
platina, these, with some of the other metals yet held in solu
tion, are to be recovered, by precipitation from the liquor with
clean bars of iron, and the precipitate is to be redissolved in
a proportionate quantity of aqua regia, similar in                  composi                   its
tion  to that above directed          be used but  to     this  case,  before    in

8       Dr. Wollaston on a Method of rendering Platina malleable.
to be finally purified by cupellation, in an open       crucible, with
borax and a little nitre. The sulphuret is then         to be roasted,
at a low red heat, on a flat brick, and pressed,       when reduced
to a pasty consistence, into a square or oblong         and perfectly
flat cake.     It is again to be roasted very patiently, at a low
red heat, until it becomes spongy on the surface. During this
process, sulphur flies off in the state of sulphurous acid, espe
cially at those moments when the heat is allowed occasionally
to subside. The ingot is then to be cooled; and when quite
cold, is to be tapped with a light hammer, in order to condense
and beat down the spongy excrescences on               surface. The               its
alternate roastings and tappings (or gentle hammerings) re

18        Mr. R. W. Fox's          Remarks on           Mineral Veins, &c.
the commonly smooth surfaces of their containing sides, or
“walls,” and the rarity of stalactitical forms in them, equally
forbid the idea of the contents of veins having once flowed
down their sides or exuded from them.               Nor are there any
                    I
instances that am aware of, of even the smallest veins, how
ever great their inclination, exhibiting extensive open fissures,
in consequence of the upper part being closed up or choked
by depositions from above.
    It may be remarked, that the contents of veins are not ar
ranged according to their specific gravity, the metalliferous ores
being commonly found in detached masses, sometimes near the
surface only, and at other times at considerable depths, or they
are dispersed in the veins at various depths. Frequently, ores of
different kinds, which would combine immediately if in fusion,
are found in contact, but in entirely distinct masses.              Many
of these combinations would be instantly decomposed by a
great degree of heat; and clay, which is so prevalent in veins,
cannot be supposed to have an igneous origin.
    Thus I think it may be asked, if the theories which have                                     |
been advanced on this subject be calculated to remove some
 difficulties, do they not substitute greater in their stead?
    The curious arrangement of veins, and the geological struc
 ture of the earth, seem to me to afford ample evidence of de
 sign; and I cannot but believe that the operations of Nature
 under the surface, as well as above                        it,
                                                   are intimately con
 nected, and that they equally derive their origin from Divine
 wisdom and creative power.
     It
      is   a very remarkable fact, that veins are           considerable
                                                                   in  a
 degree, either coincident with,             right angles
                                                  or   at       the mag     to
 netic meridian.
     In  Cornwall and Devon, copper and tin veins are instances
of    the latter; and those             of
                                   clay, quartz, &c.                   of

 are known     to exist    their immediate neighbourhood.

  Wales, and    in some parts also            of

information extends; and I believe the fact of some other me
tallic ores being arranged at right angles to the former, is not
peculiar to Cornwall.
   In the latter district the E. and W. veins are usually inter
sected and broken by the cross veins; and instead of being
continued in straight lines, the parts are more or less widely
separated.     And as the cross veins commonly consist of clay
or  quartz, or of both together, the insulation seems almost
complete as it respects water and electricity. The clay being
found to dam up the water effectually even in the immediate
neighbourhood of deep excavations; and the quartz, which is
an imperfect conductor of electricity, appears to me to be ren

    The great veins or dykes of porphyry, or Elvan courses as
the miners term them, may also be connected with electrical
action. . They are nearly in an E. and W. direction, and are
not affected by the veins which cross them.
 -   Ineed not say that the above is a very summary and im
perfect statement of some of the phaenomena of veins; and Ican
not but believe, that a more minute investigation and complete
classification of facts than has yet been attempted, relative to
this important branch of geology, would be interesting to the
 philosopher, and perhaps valuable to the miner. This object
might,          I
            think, be best attained by scientific individuals, or so
 cieties, employing a suitable person who would devote his
 time and attention to the subject. He might also try various
 experiments, especially, with the magnetic needle, near the
junction of different rocks, and in the vicinity of veins having
 different directions, to ascertain if the variation or the mag
 netic intensity is affected thereby.
     With the view of making some experiments hereon, when
I   can find sufficient leisure for the purpose, I have had some
 magnetic needles prepared with one polarity only in action;
 the other being neutralized, or nearly so, by altering the centre
 of suspension to within the neutralized pole itself, and extend
 ing it with brass as a counterpoise to the acting pole”.
     Ifit should prove that veins differently circumstanced have
 different effects on these needles; may it not tend to explain
 the cause of the periodical variation of the compass, if we sup
 pose electrical action to vary in       relative intensity    differits                              at
 ent   periods      time?   And
                             of   may  not electricity, the intensity
of    which varies       continually   sothe atmosphere, affect the

     This, however, gives an appearance that is not inelegant;
and the outer edge being orna
mented with crockets and leaves
and with a finial at the highest
point, and the concave surface
being painted in imitation of a
groined oak canopy, the effect
of the whole is pleasing to the
eye.   A curtain is suspended
from the lower edge of the ca
nopy for about 18 inches on each side; the object of this is to
intercept the sound which would pass beneath the sounding
board, and might create a confusion behind: but to press it into
the service as proposed hereafter is of course to be preferred.
   By means of this erection the volume of sound is increased
in a very considerable ratio, and is thrown powerfully, as well
as distinctly, to the most distant parts of the church; so that
whereas formerly the difficulty of hearing an intelligible sound
was very great, now that difficulty is effectually removed.
   The preacher was scarcely audible even in the pews near
                                     all

facilitate the study of zoology.

                        of the Genera of Bat.                            35
     In a late visit to the College of Surgeons, I was much struck
at   observing  the small size of the wing of the Foetuses of Ple
ropi, compared with these parts in the adult animal; and on
 continuing the examination       I found that the same difference of
 development appeared to take place in the other genera of bats.
     These differences in the relative development of the fore
and hind extremities appear to have escaped the observa
 tions of Temminck and other modern writers on this family
of animals; it is of the more importance, as several of the
writers on this subject have been induced to place great re
liance on the proportions of these parts compared with the
size of the body in their specific descriptions.      Indeed, in the
last part of the Linnaean Transactions, the Rev. Mr. Jenyns,
who is certainly a very acute observer, and who has paid
great attention to the bats of this country, has been induced
to describe a bat as a distinct species, which only differs in
the relative measurement of these parts, under the name of
Plecotus brevimanus; and which from the examination of a
 specimen in the collection of the Zoological Society, named
by the author,    I   am induced to think is only the very young
 state of Vespertilio auritus, as I had named the specimen when
I   was assisting in making the catalogue of the Mammalia and
 Reptiles of that collection.
    I  shall give a description of the young state of Pteropus”,
 as I  have been enabled to see three specimens, in different
 stages, of an apparently undescribed species, which were dis
 covered in the late expedition under Captain Beechy, which
I   refrain from describing, as Mr. Lane, the naturalist of the
 expedition, informed me that he intended soon to describe it
in another journal.                                -
     The Foetus of the   Pteropus  (cut from the body of the mother)
 has a large head, and small arms: and wings with a large
longly clawed thumb. The hind legs and claws are also very
large and perfectly formed. These peculiarities are easily ac
counted for when the habits of the young bat are considered;
for in the young state they do not require the use of their
 wings, but rest attached to the sides of their mother, and for
 the purpose of holding themselves on, they are provided with
large and well-clawed thumbs and feet, allowing the wings to
gradually develope themselves.
     In a visit which I lately paid to Haslar Hospital, at Ports
mouth, for the purpose of examining the Mollusca brought
home, and so well described by the collector, the surgeon
of the expedition, I was fortunate enough to discover a very
             Pteropus pselaphon, Lay, Zool. Jour, vol.

38            Mr. Murchison   on the Bituminous Schist and
the upper limits of the schist where the furnaces are now esta
blished. The few fragments however which I collected have
enabled Mons. Valenciennes, the able coadjutor of Baron Cu
vier in his new work on Fishes, to give the following account
of them.                                                                     -
     “There appear to be at       least four species of fish among
these  specimens;    of which three are particularly distinguished,
by having quadrangular scales without articulating points, and
ranged in sinuous and oblique rows, thus resembling the
Esor osseus of Linnaeus (Lepisosteus of Lacepède): but the
fragments marked No. 1. and 2.* show that this species was
of a form essentially different from the Esor osseus, in having
a forked tail. The anal fin is placed behind and <U+017F>near the
caudal, whilst a number of bony spines, at least eight in one
of the specimens, appear in front of the articulated rays. The
absence of vertebral fins prevents my deciding positively upon
the order.                               -
   “In No. 3. the scales of the tail resemble those of the fossil
fish of the Kiipfer schiefer of Mansfeldt and Eisleben; with this
distinction, that they do not advance so far into the tail fin.
   “No. 4. differs from those above described in the larger
size of its scales.
   “ No. 5. differs entirely from the three species described, in
the form and much smaller size of the scales.          The existence
of dorsal, pectoral, and ventral fins, places this fish in the order
Abdominales.       The head and tail are wanting, but the scales
of the  belly  form a toothed keel, and thus leave no doubt that
it belongs   to the genus Clupea.”                                     -
   In the form of their scales and in their general character,
these fish of Seefeld have a strong resemblance to several of
the genera and species found in the various deposits subordi
nate to the new red sandstone and magnesian limestone; whilst
they differ altogether from the Dapedium of the lias, or any
family of fish as yet discovered         in,   or
                                             above the oolitic series.

Sedgwick and myself", with which it further coincides in con
taining no animal remains, except fish; and as copper ore is
extracted from this same chain of dolomite a few miles to the
west,   I am on that account still more inclined to refer this
schistose deposit to some one of the formations between the
new and old red sandstone, so remarkable for their abundance
of Ichthyolites and their metalliferous character, among
which the Thuringian copper slate, the magnesian limestone
of England, and the Caithness schist, constitute prominent
groups of different ages. Chemical analysis of the schist kindly
undertaken by Mr.              fººd.indicates, that it contains a much
larger proportion of ammonia than has ever been obtained
from any quality of coal, however bituminous; and although
no positive conclusions can be drawn from this circumstance,
still, when the vast number of the fossil fish is considered, a
strong suspicion may be entertained that the destruction of
such animal matter may have cooperated in the bituminiza
tion of the stone.     The schist in                  its
                                               upper portion passes into

lour of animals depends materially on the same agency, as is proved by
the striking difference of colour existing between the animals of thefrigid
and torrid zone.—Dr. Thomson's System, vol. i. p. 20; then being
substituted for in that case.
    Have not certain bodies the property of absorbing the rays of light,
of retaining  them for some time, and of again evolving them un
changed, and unaccompanied by sensible heat 3
    Yes. . Thus in an experiment of Du Fay, a diamond exposed to the
sun and immediately covered with black wax, shone in the dark, on
removing the wax, at the expiration of several months. Bodies gifted
with this property are called solar phosphori. Such are Canton's,
Baldwin's, and the Bolognian phosphori. To the same class belong
several natural bodies, which retain light, and give it out unchanged.
Thus the sea is occasionally when agitated, a natural solar phos
phorus; putrid fish have a similar property, and the glow-worm be
longs to the same class.”
   Now this question and answer are in the very perfection of pecu
lation; except the slight transposition of a few words, required by an
omission, the whole of both is taken from and forms a part of one
paragraph of vol. i. p. 160, of Dr. Henry's Chemistry, beginning
“Certain bodies have,” &c. and after the words “sensible heat,”
omitting “yes.” In the answer the same paragraph is continued.
    This answer concludes the text of Dr. Graham's chapter on Light;
and it will be observed that we have traced about five-sixths of the whole
to the various authors from whom they have been literally taken.
Such is the case with the text; and similar practices have been pur
sued with the notes of this chapter.       In some instances indeed, but
evidently that what has been pilfered may pass for his own, Dr.
 Graham has actually added the names of the authors to whom he is
indebted; but the proportion is not great: for of the matter of the
notes, 52 parts are pilfered, 32 borrowed, and 16 we will generously
divide between the author and undiscovered sources.
    After these displays of our author's acts of appropriation, the reader
may perhaps doubt whether his volume really contains any one state
 ment which Dr. Graham can fairly claim as his own. We have how
ever, as we think, discovered some portions of the work, which if they
be not original, we are quite sure the real authors will never claim;
and these very remarkable exceptions to the Doctor's general method
of proceeding occur under the head of Specific Gravity.
    In page 7 of the Catechism we have the following question and
answer  :-
    “How do you ascertain the specific gravity of fluids?
    There are several methods by which it may be ascertained; but the
best is performed by what is called a gravity bottle, which is a glass
bottle with a slender neck, furnished with a ground conical stopper.
 A gravity bottle, called a “ thousand grain bottle,” from            its
                                                                  contain

 instrument for determining this point with great facility. The thousand
 grain bottle    sold together with       weight, which

This instrument consequently             does not require the aid of any com
putation, but is simply filled with the fluid to be examined, and placed
in one scale of the balance, while                  counterpoise              its

heavier than water, the bottle will preponderate, and weights must be

    Now we will grant that this             the true specific gravity
                                                                is               the fluid                                  of

 of in

fact being that only 261 grains should                   put into the scale with the
bottle, which would indeed give 0.739                    the specific gravity         as be

    Dr. Graham then proceeds thus:--" Had                       (the thousand grain                it

   Dr. Graham is nearly as great an adept in the art of puffing, as
in the practices of spoliation, borrowing, and blundering: he has, it
seems, published three other books; and in an advertisement pre
fixed to the Chemical Catechism we have the opinions of various
critics respecting the works in question; in due time we expect to
find the same persons giving similar judgments of the Chemical Cate
chism. We shall undoubtedly hear, to copy the phrases of Dr. Gra

circumstances, it was found that the volume of the gas was un
altered, and that a similar quantity of oxygen gas had been abs
tracted, but that a much smaller quantity of carbonic acid had
been formed than in the last experiment, the remaining portion
being made up by azotic gas which had been given out from the
lungs of the bird, and the volume of which was just equal to that
of the oxygen absorbed. The bird was somewhat disturbed during
the experiment, but recovered immediately and perfectly on being
released from its confinement.
   In the fourth experiment, in which a pigeon was made to respire
a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen with a small proportion of azote
(the oxygen being in the same proportion as in common air), it
was found that there was no loss of oxygen; but that a quantity of
hydrogen disappeared, and was replaced by an equal volume of
azote. The authors observe, that birds have a quicker circulation
of blood than other animals; and also, that they are more sen
sible to the stimulating effects of oxygen.
   May      7–A paper was read, entitled “Experimental Examina
tion of the Electric and Chemical Theories of Galvanism;” by
William Ritchie, A.M. F.R.S.
  After showing that the theory of galvanism originally proposed
by Volta, and generally termed the electric theory, is still the uni
versally received doctrine among continental philosophers, the au
thor adduces several experiments proving the fallacy of the princi
ples on which that theory is founded. He points out the inconclu
siveness of the reasoning by which it has been inferred, that dissi
 milar metals, by being simply placed in contact with one another,
 are instantly thrown into opposite electric states: for in              the ex           all

would appear, however, that with the same pairs of metallic
discs, the direction of the electric current is determined by the
nature of the acid employed: thus nitrous acid, acting upon
zinc, copper, or iron, gives rise to a current in a direction oppo
site to the current which is produced by the sulphuric, nitric, or
muriatic acids. Variations in the temperature of the metals will also
occasion diversities in the results, not hitherto satisfactorily ex
plained on any theory.          From one experiment the author is led to
infer, that an acid is capable of combining with a pure metal, with
out the latter being previously reduced to the state of an oxide.

   2d.—An inferior system of yellow and green calcareous sandstone,
blue marl, and compact limestone; the higher portions of which
offer a few shells analogous to those of the Bourdeaux basin; while
the lowest beds are distinguished by a vast variety of organic remains,
more than one half of which seem to be identical with the species
                                                                                -
found in the Calcaire grossier and London clay.
   A nummulite limestone forms the base of the above series, and is
shown to be conformable to the scaglia, or rock containing ammo
nites, belemnites, and flints (the equivalent of the chalk), which rising
into the Alps, passes into a dolomitic limestone charged with casts of
fossils of the oolitic series.     No rocks of igneous origin interfere, in
this district, with the above order of superposition; but they are largely
developed to the west of the Brenta, where they cut through the re
gular deposits.      In illustration of the above, two transverse sections'
from S. to N. are then detailed.
    1st.—From Asolo to Possagno, exhibiting the youngest group or
conglomerate rising to the height of from 700 to 800 feet above the
Adriatic, and dipping S.S.E. at angles increasing from 25° to 40°.
    The dip and direction are the same in the succeeding strata of marl
 and limestone, for the space of five miles, and near Possagno they
range conformably to the scaglia; with which, however, the lowest
members of the tertiary series are there not seen in contact, owing to
a denudation in the Val d'Urgana.
    2d.—From Bassano to Campese in the Canal di Brenta. This
section, owing to the much higher inclination of the beds, exhibits                           all
the above members            the tertiary and secondary series
                                 of                                    the shortin
space   of two miles. At Sarzon the marls               the Calcaire grossier
                                                                 of

                        to                              by

considerable    height.    The  scaglia  passes  conformably    into   dolomitica
limestone, with remains          the oolitic series which forms the principal

    A letter dated March     14,  1829,  from Dr. Prout to Professor Buck
land, was read, stating that since the last meeting he had made an
analysis of the bezoar stones from Lvine Regis and Westbury on
Severn, and found the composition of all of them to be very similar,
viz.: phosphate of lime and carbonate of lime, together with minute
variable proportions of iron, sulphur, and carbonaceous matter.          The
relative proportions of the principal ingredients appear to differ some
what in different specimens, and even in different parts of the same
specimen: hence no formal analysis has been attempted; but the
phosphate of lime may perhaps be estimated to constitute from about
one-half to three-fourths of the whole mass.
    Dr. Prout conceives this composition to prove that the basis of
these bezoar stones is bone; and that Professor Buckland's opinion
that they are of fecal origin, or of the nature of Album Graecum, offers
 a very satisfactory explanation of their occurrence, and accounts at
once for their chemical composition, their external form, and their
 mechanical structure.
    A paper “On the Bituminous Schist and Fossil Fish of Seefeld in
 the Tyrol,” by Roderick Impey Murchison, Esq. Sec. G.S., F.R.S.,
 &c., was read”.         -
    The bituminous schist of Seefeld is subordinate to a vast formation
 of dolomite, forming a lofty mountain chain which separates the Tyrol
 from Bavaria, in which it occupies a thickness of several hundred
 feet.   This slaty rock is quarried solely for the bitumen it contains,
 which is extracted by subjecting the schist, when broken up and placed
 in crucibles, to an intense heat during ten or twelve hours. The
 only animal remains observed were fossil fish; and amongst these
 M. Valenciennes has discovered at least four species, three of which
 are distinguished by quadrangular scales without articulating points,
 thus resembling the Esox osseus (Lepisosteus Lacépède), but differing
 essentially from that genus in having a forked tail, as also in the po
 sition and structure of the fins; whilst another specimen is distinctly re
 ferred by him to the genus Clupea. With these ichthyolites were founda
 few vegetables, one of which has some resemblance to a Lycopodium.
     As the general characters of the fish approach to those of the Kup
of ferSchiefer    Germany,

He further   speculates on the probability of the destruction of so many
fish  having  materially cooperated in the bituminization of the schist,
because this rock, on distillation, gives                         in off

canic focus burst out within the area of the lacustrine deposits, it is
stated that limestone and marls occur near Murat at the foot of the
Eastern watershed of the highest ranges of the Cantal, where beds
extensively quarried for lime, and containing several species of Lim
neus, Planorbis, Bulinus terebra, &c. with gyrogonites and plants,
are overlaid by a prodigious accumulation of volcanic products. The
fresh-water strata at this locality (La Vissiere) are unaltered in their
character, but exhibit many faults.
   The organic remains found in different parts of the Cantal, prove
that this lacustrine formation, although geographically separated from,
is geologically of the same age with that of the Limagne d'Auvergne,
and corresponds as a whole to the different divisions of the fresh-water
strata of Paris, and those of Hordwell Cliff and the Isle of Wight in
England.     It is more difficult to obtain an accurate knowledge of all
the strata in the Cantal, than in the contiguous regions of Mont Dor,
Clermont, &c. For in the last-mentioned districts, the volcanoes had
issue amidst the primary rocks, their lava currents only reaching to
the outskirts of the lacustrine formations; whereas those of the Cantal
burst out in the very centre of these tertiary deposits, and either
buried them or produced changes of the relative levels of the country,
so as to occasion much abrasion of the original strata by the frequent
shifting of the direction of the waters.
   In conclusion, a comparison is instituted between the lower members
of the lacustrine deposits of the Cantal, and those of the Limagne
d'Auvergne and of the Puy en Velay.
   A paper by Dr. Buckland was read, stating that he has ascertained
that the bony rings of the suckers of cuttle-fish are frequently mixt
with the scales of various fish, and the bones of fish, and of small Ich
thyosauri in the bezoar-shaped feces from the lias at Lyme Regis.
These rings and scales have passed undigested through the intestines
of the Ichthyosauri. Dr. Prout has also found that the black varieties
of these bezoars owe their colour to matter of the same nature with the
fossil ink bags in the lias; hence it appears that the Ichthyosauri fed
largely upon the sepiae of those ancient seas.
   The author has also ascertained, by the assistance of Mr. Miller
and Dr. Prout, that the small black rounded bodies of various shapes,
and having a polished surface, which occur mixt with bones in the
lowest strata of the lias on the banks of the Severn, near Bristol, are
also of faecal origin:—they appear to be co-extensive with this bone
bed, and occur at many and distant localities.                He has also re
ceived from Mr. Miller similar small black faecal balls from a calca
reous bed nearly at the bottom of the carboniferous limestone at
Bristol; this bed abounds with teeth of sharks, and bones, and teeth
and spines of other fishes: until they can be referred to their respective
animals, the author proposes the name of Nigrum Graecum for            all these
black varieties  of fossil faeces. They may have been derived from small
reptiles or  from fish, and    in the case    ofthe lias bone bed, from the
molluscousinhabitants     of  fossil nautiliand ammonites, and belemnites.
In    collection at Lyme    Regis  there is    fossil fish from the lias, which
                                           its a

 name of Sauro-copros to the so-called bezoar stones of the lias at
 Lyme Regis, which are derived from the Ichthyosauri; and the name
 of Hyaino-copros to the Album Græcum of the fossil hyaena.

than valleys of more complicated origin, in the formation of which
the elevation and dislocation of the strata have co-operated.
    He first offers some introductory remarks on the opposite theories
of the fluvialist and diluvialist, the former ascribing such denudations
exclusively to the operation of the streams actually existing, or rather
to the drainage of the atmospherical waters falling on the districts,
which it is supposed have become thus deeply furrowed by the gra
dual erosion of these waters, continued through a long and indefinite
series of ages; the latter contending that such a cause is totally                                                  in

    He proceeds to distinguish several different geological epochs, at
which it is probable that currents must have taken place calculated
to excavate and modify the existing surface.              I. In the ocean, be

tures of denudation presented by the Cotteswold chain are pointed

they are contrasted with the state of repose which has evidently pre
vailed in the same districts from the period to which our earliest
historical monuments ascend.              In the most exposed situations, and
those which appear to have suffered most from the action of the de
nuding causes, earth works of British and Roman antiquity are fre
quently found, attesting by their perfect preservation that the form
of the surface has remained unaltered since the time of their con
struction. The drainage of the atmospherical waters has here produced
no sensible effect for more than fifteen centuries: it is inferred,
therefore, that to assign to this cause the excavation of the adjoining
valleys, 600 or 700 feet deep, is to ascribe to it an agency for which
we have no evidence ; the evidence, indeed, as far as it can be ex

broken into several detached groups.
    Among these, some insulated summits are capped                          patches         by              of
gravel, partly derived from transition rocks, partly from the chalk

flection of the river, as a straighter course appears open to it by
White Waltham to Bray: this line was surveyed for a canal by
Mr. Brindley, and appears to be level to White Waltham, and thence
to fall 47 feet to Mankey island, near Bray; so that a dam of a few
feet across the river below Sunning at the mouth of the Loddon,
would turn the waters into this channel. The author conceives the
most natural mode of explaining this deflection of the river, is by
the supposition that a higher range of tertiary strata once extended
from the ridges of Bagshot-heath in this direction; forming a bar to
the progress of the stream in this line.
   V. The plains of London are covered with enormous accumulations
of water-worn debris, chiefly of chalk-flints, and often abounding in
fossil remains of elephants, hippopotami, &c.; the gravel is not
confined to the low grounds, but caps the highest summits of the
district; e.g. Highgate on the north, and Shooter's Hill on the south
of the river. To explain this distribution of this gravel by the ope
ration of the actual rivers, the author observes that it is necessary,
first, to suppose that an uniform plane originally existed from the
summit of Highgate to the Hertfordshire chalk downs, and from the
top of Shooter's Hill to those of Kent; on the surface of which the
rivers once flowed. 2ndly, That these rivers have subsequently washed
away     allthat immense mass                            of
                                       materials which would          requisite                be
thus    toreconstruct the   surface;   and  3rdly,   That  having  worn down
that surface into nearly                     its
                                present form, the rivers perpetually shifted
their channels                so
                             distribute the gravel equally over the whole

ham.     He became Tancred fellow a            Caius College, Cambridge,
shortly after taking his degree, and continued             reside there till             to
1789. He then removed               London for the improvement
                                              to                           his                                    of
medical knowledge, and continued the practice            physic till the end        of
of 1800, when               an
                    accession                 of
                                    fortune determined him       relinquish                         to
a profession           he
                   never  liked,   and devote himself    wholly      science.                            to
It    from this period that we are

solicitous to promote whatever seemed likely to prove of practical
utility, and render the longitude easy of measurement and calcula
tion.    Any well-grounded project for the improvement of chrono
meters was sure to find in him a firm supporter.       The system of
determining differences of longitude by sets of itinerant chronome
ters, as practised by Dr. Tiarks and Captains Foster and King, was
warmly advocated and effectually supported by him.
   Dr. Wollaston was many years a Vice-President of the Royal So
ciety, and for a short time filled the chair of that illustrious body
in 1820. He became a member of this Society in November 1828,
under circumstances of which the irregularity could only be justified
by the urgency of the case, and the impossibility of being drawn                         its
into precedent
        a          future.  Dr.Wollaston was proposed
                            in                           the June                                in
meeting, and his certificate having hung till the following Novem

         ought, according        our rules,to   have been balloted for
                                                                    to                                         at

 on the day already   named;   which was done, and received the unani

     Apaper was then read from James Prinsep, Esq., assay-master
 onof
   the mint     Benares, containing the observation
                      at                                   solar eclipse                of   a

struction.   Mr.    observed the transits of the limbs of the sun and

   The next paper read consisted of Observations made at the Calton
Hill Observatory, Edinburgh, (lat. 55° 57' 20" N.; long. 12m 44"
west of Greenwich):—1st, Of transits of the moon and moon-cul
minating stars, in 1828, by Mr. Thomas Henderson; 2d, Of occul
tations of stars by the moon, by Mr. John Adie. The longitude
of Edinburgh west of Greenwich, computed by Mr. Henderson,
from eleven corresponding observations of the first limb and three
of the second limb, is 12" 40°55.
   A paper was also read, containing the places of Encke's comet,
as reduced from thirty observations made by Mr. Dunlop, between
 October 26 and December 25, 1828, at Sir Thomas Brisbane's Ob
servatory, Makerstoun, Roxburghshire.
    There was, lastly, read a paper “On preserving the pivots of
astronomical instruments;” by Lieutenant Peter Lecount, R.N. As
the pivots of astronomical instruments are generally of steel, work
ing in brass sockets, and are of necessity kept oiled, it would seem
that when the        oil
                     becomes acid the galvanic arrangement       formed,          is
and the steel  pivot     decomposed
                            is         and not the brass. Mr.       there          L.
fore recommends that the pivots and sockets should              the same    be   of
metal, or,     this        be
                        inconvenient, that the pivots should      cleaned         be
and fresh   oil if
                applied  before acidity occurs, especially    the transit    in
 instrument.

  A    paper was also read, “On observing the eclipses          Jupiter's        of
 satellites atsea;” by Lieutenant Peter Lecount, R.N.
    The next paper read contained astronomical observations made
at  the Observatory         the Imperial University
                                 of                      Wilna,   of  Pro              by
 fessor Slawinski,     the year 1828.

  Eaton deduces the theory just stated; repeating it in the Geological
  Survey, as cited by Dr. Bigsby.          But surely the foregoing are insuf
  ficient data for such a theory. The water-limestone is doubtless                                                    in
  timately pervaded with chloride of sodium, which the moisture of the
  atmosphere, acting upon an exposed specimen, and the water of the
  springs, acting upon the rock in situ, extracts and dissolves.                Adopt
 ing this view of the subject, we should expect to discover in the brines
  a portion of carbonate of lime, derived from the limestone; and ac
 cordingly Mr. Chilton found that earthy salt, sometimes in consider

     Perhaps the form in which the salt has formerly existed in this case,
  as indicated by the cavities, may be regarded as throwing some light
 on the history of the new-red-sandstone. The presence of the hop
 pers, and especially their occurrence in greater numbers than the com
 plete cubes, if we may be permitted to reason analogically from the
 artificial crystallization of salt by the evaporation of brine or of sea
 water, indicates the existence of an elevated temperature, during the
 formation of the including strata and the deposition of their mineral
 contents. In the manufacture of salt in Cheshire, it is observed, that
 the hoppers are formed by the rapid evaporation of the saturated
 brine at a temperature of from 160° to 170°, Fahr.; and that the
 distinctness and perfection with which cubic crystals are produced, is
 in the inverse ratio of the temperature applied and the consequent
 rapidity of the evaporation; salt made at 130° or 140° first approach
ing to the distinct cubic form, and that made at 100° or 110° being
 in large and nearly cubical crystals*. The hoppers, indeed, appear to
 result, exclusively, from the evaporation of solutions of salt at a high
 temperature.
    May not these facts, therefore, notwithstanding Dr. Holland
 (Trans. Geol. Soc. vol. i. p. 60.) has thought proper to exclude the
 agency of heat from the formation of the deposits of salt, be consi
 dered as corroborative of the opinion that the new-red-sandstone con
 sists of the debris of the older rocks, which, partially in a state of
 minute division, and preserved, either wholly or in part, in a humid
 state, by the waters of a primaeval ocean, have been as it were torre
fied by the agency of heat acting from below           The peroxidated form
 of so large a proportion of the iron which it contains, and the evident
 injection from below at some distant period, in a state of igneous
 fluidity (or, to speak with caution, in a state similar to that of fresh
 erupted lava) of the masses of porphyritic trap with which it is often
 intersected, are also circumstances which tend to strengthen this opi
 Inlon.
    Another fact observed in the manufacture of salt may perhaps be
 regarded    as tending further to elucidate this subject.       Although, as
just remarked, the hoppers appear to result, exclusively, from the eva
 poration of solutions of salt at a high temperature, yet they are not
 formed when the brine is at the boiling point. At that heat, as may
 be observed in the process of making stoved or lump-salt in Cheshire,
 and in those by which salt is chiefly made in Scotland and at Lyming
 ton, small flaky crystals only are deposited, merely approaching in
 form to an irregular pyramid with a square baset.            The occurrence
 of the hoppers, therefore, in the saliferous rock, indicates that the
 heat to which the solution that deposited the crystals was exposed,
                                 º:
 is “mixed with salt in small patches and cubes.” If water were to perco
 late slowly through this bed, the salt would be dissolved, and cubic and
 other cavities left in the marl, if of a texture sufficiently compact, which
 would then present a similar                to the beds described above.

was insufficient to maintain the temperature of ebullition in that so
lution. And this is just what we might have expected to find, on
account of the following circumstances.       The heat, as the geological
associations and    history of the new-red-sandstone would appear to
show, could have been but partially applied; the quantity of earthy
matter mingled with the solution of salt must have interfered greatly
with the free transmission of heat through the widely and unequally dif
fused immense heterogeneous magma formed by the whole; and the
evaporation of the solution must at the same time have been in a great
degree promoted and accelerated by the extensive surfaces presented
by the earthy matter. The maintenance, therefore, or even the pro
duction, perhaps, of so high a temperature as 226°, which is the boil
 ing point of saturated brine, until, at least, the whole or nearly the
 whole of the water had been evaporated, must be regarded, under                                                              all

It is probable that Mr. Featherstonhaugh has been led into this error
by the contiguity to each other of the new- and old-red-sandstones
in the county of Monmouth. This circumstance also seems to cast a
doubt on Mr. F.'s opinion, as expressed in the same paper, that none
of the beds which are in England higher in the series of formations
than the coal-measures, are to be found in North America, north of
40° N. Lat. A minute comparison of the North-American rocks, as
described, respectively, by Prof. Eaton, Dr. Bigsby, and Mr. Fea
therstonhaugh, would probably remove much of the obscurity in
which this subject is at present enveloped.              E. W. B.

   General Observations.—The general character of this month has been fine
and very dry, for the whole quantity of rain does not amount to one-third
of an inch in depth, and the amount of evaporation is comparatively great.
The two or three hoar frosts at the beginning were not found so injurious:
as the heavy blight that accompanied the N.E.gale at the end of the
                                                                                  monºut

           Meteorological Observations                    for May   1829.            79
 but upon the whole, more genial weather for the formation and rapid growth
of  the fruits and vegetation in general, which have still a promising appear
ance, has not occurred since May 1822.          The grasses generally, which
looked so well at the beginning of the month, shot up suddenly, and were
in seed too prematurely from the want of moisture; consequently the hay,
the making of which has partially commenced in this neighbourhood, will
not perhaps amount to an average crop.
   Two parhelia appeared from 4 till 6 P.M. on the 4th instant; their co
lours were peculiarly bright, and each exhibited a white train from the
sun about 15 degrees long, which terminated evanescently: they appeared
to be formed in an almost imperceptible vapour that preceded the coming
up of clouds from the S.W. Two other parhelia of a similar appearance,
and distant from each other 45% degrees, were observed from 4 P.M. tili
sunset on the 20th.
     Inthe evening of the 14th a large lunar halo appeared, whose vaporous
edge was   full three degrees broad, and tolerably well defined for nearly an
 hour, when it began to wane. Several flashes of lightning emanated from
 the clouds in the northern horizon in the evening of the 15th, after a warm
 sunny day: and an unusually thick fog came on at 5 P.M. on the 16th,
and continued throughout the night with a strong gaseous smell.
    On the 24th a moist S.W. wind was crossed at noon by a cold brisk gale
from the North, and their union immediately produced a desirable shower
 of rain, after a dry period of seventeen days. This change was succeeded
by a very dry gale from the North-east till the 30th; and although the
27th and 28th were very fine sunny days, with but few clouds, yet the sun
shine was remarkably turbid in colour, which may have been caused by
small dust raised by the powerful land gale, and mixing with the vapour
arising from the earth. The aridity of the air near the earth was re
markable for absorbing aqueous vapour from the 24th to the 30th ; as
during the six days, under somewhat more than a mean pressure of the
atmosphere, with a mean temperature of 63° where the water was exposed,
the mean dew-point about 53", and strong gales from the N. and N.E.,
the quantity that actually evaporated from a cubic foot of water (allowing
it to contain 437,272 grains) was one-eighth part of the whole, or 63 grains
per minute from        its
                      surface, which    one-seventh more than calculations
                                           is
 on  the theory      evaporation afford under, similar circumstances, taking
                      of
into consideration the form     the area, and the greatest force
                                 of                                the gales.
                                                                        of
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are five parhelia, four solar and three lunar halos,
lightning once, and seven gales      wind,of   days  or which they have pre

      MIDST      the variety of researches which have been pur
       sued  respecting   the different forms and modes of excita
 tion and action of electricity, it is surprising to me that the
electricity of living animals has not been more an object of at
tention, both on account of                        its
                                      physiological importance, and

82                    Sir Humphry Davy's Account of
Naples, in May 1815, two small torpedos alive, I passed the
shocks through the interrupted circuit made by silver wire
through water, without being able to perceive the slightest
decomposition of that fluid; and                         I
                                             repeated the same experi
ments at Mola di Gaeta, with an apparatus in which the smallest
possible surface of silver was exposed, and in which good con
ductors, such as solutions of potassa and sulphuric acid, were
made to connect the circuit; but with the same negative re
sults.
    Having obtained a larger torpedo at Rimini in June in the
same year, I repeated the experiments, using                    the precau   all
tions   I could imagine, with like results; and                         at

     Itserves likewise to correct the index error if determined by
terrestrial objects.             If
                           we understand by index error always
that  quantity   which is to be subtracted from every angle read
off, in order to obtain the correct value, an assumption by which
the arc of excess is to be considered as negative, and then
draw the triangle between the two mirrors and the object, and
call the distance of the object from the small mirror d, the                         di
stance of the two mirrors f, the angle read off at the coinci
dence of the two images cº,and the true index error co, we have
this equation: tang              (co   – c.) =      #####:                and therefore,
co   =c +          +    sin   26 —     #    sin 4   3.        The   angle 3 is likewise
requisite if it is thought worth while to ascertain the point to
which the angle measured really belongs.         In the case of a
positive reading, the rays of light will intersect in the prolon
gation of the line of collimation, taken in the direction from
the small mirror to the telescope.     If we call the distance of
the point of intersection from the small mirror, assumed as po
sitive in this direction g, and if we denote the angle read off
                                                               fºy,
uncorrected by the error of the index by s, we shall have
 g =        f_*#  sin (s— co-H 2 g)
                                        = <U+017F>cos 284

                                                                    sin   23
                                                                                whence
object provided fand co could be ascertained with sufficient
accuracy.
   Lastly, the angle 3 is of use when the sextant is to be em
ployed as a heliotrope.      If the second object c (fig. 1.) were
the  sun,  the object which lies in the direction O B would re
ceive the reflected rays of the sun.                      If
                                             the object A is to re
ceive them, the pole P is to be moved forward in the order of
the divisions by the quantity 3, or, as on the sextant the double
angles are read off, the index must be advanced 23.            The
operations are therefore as follows: Place the plane of the sex
tant into the plane of the object which is to receive the rays
of the sun by reflexion and the sun, measure the angle as
usual, and advance the index 2 3 beyond the division read off
without changing the plane of the instrument.
   It is clear that a stand is indispensably necessary for this
operation. As long as any part of the sun's disk illuminates the
intersection of the cross wires, for which the angle 3 has been
determined, the object will receive light; this time will amount
to about two minutes. The measurement of the angle           there             is,
                                                                                 i.

ments which he had devised were finished.       Trials made at a
distance of nine (4.1% English) miles, in which the sun was seen
directly, succeeded perfectly; and even trials made at a distance
of fourteen (64% English) miles under the most unfavourable
circumstances, the sun being seen by reflexion immediately
upon rising, gave a satisfactory result.

“Illustrations of British Entomology,” enables us to make some useful addi

serable deficiency of Treitschke’s generic characters of Hadena, by copying
those given by Stephens at p. 179 of the second volume of his “Haustellata.”

       in general of gay colours, sometimes with pale reticulations, and mostly
      with a pale undulated striga, in which is usually a conspicuous angu
       lation, resembling the letter W, near the posterior margin; stigmata
       distinct; posterior wings with an obscure emargination towards the
       costae: larva naked, generally of lively colour: pupa subterranean.”—
       EUPLEXIA, Steph.
    Of the fourth species of Treitschke's fifty-sixth genus, Phlogophora luci

 name of Euplexia, to which he assigns the following characters.

—For Treitschke's three remaining species, viz. Praecor, of his Fam. B.,
and Porphyrea, and Piniperda, Fam. C., Stephens has adopted as many
distinct genera, ACTEBIA, ScotoPHILA, and AchATIA, with the following

    Rough-legged Buzzard (Buteo Lagopus).-A very fine spe
cimen of this rare Buzzard was killed in the neighbourhood
of Bewcastle the latter end of February, where another was
seen.    This is only the second instance of this species having
been    captured    in this part of the county: the other was shot
near Wreay in November 1824.
    Cinereous Shrike (Lanius excubitor).-For the last five or
six years the Cinereous Shrike has visited this neighbourhood
pretty regularly, scarcely a winter passing without one or more
having been either   -     seen or obtained.          Its arrival, however, is

apparently very irregular, as it has occurred during the above
period in almost every month from October to April.               On the
eleventh of April 1828, I saw one near Stainton; and on the
seventh of March it was observed close to Brugh-by-Sands,
and pursued nearly the whole day, but without success.
    Bohemian Chatterer (Bombycilla garrula).—Several spe
cimens of this beautiful species were killed in the month of
January, two of which were brought to me. It would appear
that these birds feed greedily upon the fruit of the wild briar
Rosa canina), as well as upon the berries of the mountain ash
(Sorbus aucuparia), the thorn (Crataegus oxyacantha), &c. The
stomach of one was completely filled with these berries (R. ca
nina), and             I
                 was somewhat surprised to find that several had
been swallowed quite whole, although very large.               The other
had been also feeding upon the same fruit, although killed after
an interval of several days and in a different part of the county.
Both these birds proved to be males; yet one had but five,
and the other only four waxen appendages attached to the se
condary quills of each wing. Temminck, and indeed almost
all   writers          on
                  ornithology, state that the number            these ap                  of

doubtful criterion, and will                              all

proved to be males. On the fourteenth of February 1787, Mr.
 Harrison of Penrith sent me another, which was killed near
 Temple-Sowerby.           On each wing were seven appendages,
 much larger than in the former.            Five of the quill feathers,
 and one of the secondaries in each wing (as was the case of
 the female sent by Mr. Story), were tipped with yellow: the
appendages were much larger than in the four preceding speci
mens, and the four nearest the body were the largest: this bird
was a male.        On the twenty-second of March, in the same
year, I received another, which was killed at Ravensworth, and
sent to me by Sir Henry Liddell, bart.; on the right wing
there were eight, on the left seven appendages, which were
large. The two extreme ones, viz. the nearest and furthest
from the body, were the smallest. The second, third, fourth,
and fifth from the body were the largest: six of the wing
feathers were tipped with yellow.            In this bird          the tail     all
feathers had also horny appendages                  at
                                                the ends                in of

which however were much smaller than those                    the wings.
The    person    by whom      itwas sent   neglected       deliver to  for             it

putrid that could not, after the most accurate examination,
            I
ascertain whether was male               or
                                       female.    The red appendages
and   yellow    tips  on it
                          the wings           do
                                          therefore not depend upon

    Snow Bunting.—Simall flocks of Snow Buntings, I believe,
 annually resort to the salt marshes below Rock Cliff. During
the remarkably fine mild weather in November and December
 last, I saw them repeatedly there; but as the major part are
 usually young birds, they are seldom recognized.               I have little
 doubt they arrived much earlier than is stated in the above
table.
    Mountain Finch.-Whether this bird ever breeds in the
 hilly districts in this county I have not been able to ascertain;
 yet  I  think there cannot be the least doubt that a few occa
 sionally remain during the summer.                     observed one on I
 the 27th of    April,  near    Nunery;    and the late ingenious Mr.
Bewick states that he has seen them on the Cumberland hills
in the month of August.

 the new-red-sandstone formation which surrounds the Mendip Hills.
 Their prevailing colours are various shades of gray; their internal
 structure resembles that of the bird's-eye agate, presenting alternate
 bands of chalcedony, jasper, and hornstone, disposed in irregular and
 concentric curves: some specimens from Worle and Clevedon are of
 the nature of fine jasper-agates, and of a bright red colour.
    A shallow pit, from which the agates are extracted at Sandford,
 piesents the following section.

    The author adduces a parallel example of beds and nodules of jas
per and jasper-agate in the mountains of dolomite, near Palermo,
in a formation of the same age with the new-red-sandstone of the
 Mendip Hills.        He also gives examples of agates formed in cavities
of chert of the green-sand formation, near Lyme Regis, and in
 cavities of silicified wood and silicified corals and shells. The most
beautiful specimens of the two former are from the tertiary strata of
Antigua. Shells converted into chalcedony, and containing agates in
their cavities, occur near Exeter, in the whet stone-pits of the green
sand formation, at Black Down Hill; and shells, entirely converted to
red jasper, in sand of the same formation, occur at Little Haldon Hill.

    The oldest and fundamental rock of this district is a highly                            in
clined and contorted secondary limestone, containing Belemnites,
Gryphites and Terebratulae; on which is unconformably deposited a
vast fresh-water formation, the relations of which are shown in a
section from N.E. to S.W.-The escarpment of white marl and lime
stone, N.E. of the town of Aix, is first described in a descending
series.    The upper beds, consisting of white calcareous marls and
marlstone, calcareo-siliceous millstone and resinous flint, contain
the Potamides Lamarckii, Bulinus terebra and B. pygmaeus, with a
new species of Cyclas named C. gibbosa; and the subjacent strata
run out into a terrace, beneath which gypsum is extensively worked.
Of these beds (minutely detailed), some are peculiarly character
ized by their abundance of fossil fish; and others by a profusion
of plants, amongst which, Mr. Lindley has recognised Flabellaria

  there is no insect among them that might not be found in a moist
  wood. The antennae, tarsi, and other parts by which the characters
  would be best distinguished, are often wanting; yet enough cha
  racters frequently remain even then to distinguish the genus. The
  sculpture, and even some degree of colouring, are preserved in several
  specimens. The wings of some beetles are extended beyond the
  elytra, showing that when they perished, they were flying, or attempt
  ing to escape by flight.
    A collection of fossil vegetables, from the Northumberland and Dur
  ham coal-field, was exhibited at this meeting, and presented to the
 Society by William Hutton, Esq., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,         F.G.S.;
 with a catalogue describing the plants, according to the systems of
 M. Ad. Brongniart and Mr. Artis. The collection consisted of spe
 cimens    of Calamites, Sagenaria, Filicites, Myriophyllites, Asterio
 phyllites and Sphaenophyllites.

    August 4,   1828.-The Minister of the Interior sent the ordon
 nance of the King, by which the Academy was authorized to accept
 the legacy of the fine library left by the late M. Gallois-M. Richard
 Vaux, of Toul, sent a memoir on nervous action.—M. Guilbert an
 nounced his discovery of an instrument, by the assistance of which
 the size of stones contained in the bladder might be ascertained—M.
 Bussy deposited a sealed packet.
    A commission consisting of MM. Vauquelin, Thenard, the Duke of
 Ragusa, Cordier, and Beudant, made the report desired by the         Mi
 nister of War, respecting M. Longchamp's theory of nitrification. This
report, which was very long, was terminated by the following conclu
 sions, which were adopted by the Academy.
    1st. As to the theoretical part, we find that M. Longchamp has ex
pressed an idea long since announced, namely, that nitric acid is formed
 without the assistance of animal matter; but the facts which he has cited
are not sufficient to establish it with certainty. We find also that the
assertion which he has made, that nitric acid is formed entirely by the
elements of the atmosphere, is not correct; for it has been demon
strated that animal matter has great influence on this formation.
    2dly. With respect to oeconomical considerations, we see nothing
in the opinions of M. Longchamp which gives us any hope of obtain
ing nitre at a cheaper rate, even supposing it to be produced in the
manner which he imagines. If new experiments are to be made, it
ought to be done under less favourable circumstances, that is to say,
without the assistance of those materials which are acknowledged to
possess great influence, and without which we do find nitrates formed
in our establishments. We are of opinion that theoretical considera
tions only would induce a repetition of the experiments proposed by
M. Longchamp. It would certainly be a curious fact in science, to
find that nitric acid is formed under the circumstances indicated by
this chemist,

        DECEASE OF DR. YOUNG AND SIR HUMPHRY DAVY.
IT    is our melancholy duty to record the loss of two of our most
    distinguished cultivators of science, Dr.Thomas Young, and Sir
Humphry Davy: Dr. Young died in London on May 10th, and Sir
H. Davy, at Geneva, on May 29th. The most important of the
discoveries and contributions to science of both, have been from
time to time recorded or inserted in the Philosophical Magazine;
and we have commenced the present Number with the last produc
tion of Sir H. Davy, A paper on the Electricity of the Torpedo.

    M. Pleischel recommends that a piece of paper be imbibed three
times in succession with a solution of muriate of platina, and then
burnt. The residue is the platina, he says, in             its
                                                   best state for effect

   The bromide of iron was decomposed by hydrate of lime; the
liquor was filtered when the precipitate was become brick red.
   Bromide of calcium is very deliquescent, fuses into a whitish mass,
and gives out a peculiar smell which has some resemblance to that
of bromine, a small quantity of it appearing to suffer decompo
sition.  This bromide crystallizes in acicular crystals, which are
very soluble in water and alcohol;                  its
                                        taste resembles that     chlo                      of

          The bromide of barium when dissolved, serves for preparing by
     double decomposition   the bromides of magnesium  and zinc, by em
     ploying the sulphates of these bases.
                                BROMIDE OF POTASSIUM.
         This is prepared by decomposing protobromide of iron with car
     bonate of potash; when the saturation is perfect, the mixture is to
     be heated in the air to facilitate the peroxidation of the iron; the
     solution is to be filtered and evaporated, and by one or two crystal
     lizations the pure bromide is obtained.
        This salt crystallizes very well in cubes; it has a slightly saline
     taste, is slightly alterable by exposure to moisture, is soluble in
     alcohol, is decomposed by sulphuric acid, like the bromides of cal
     cium and barium, and fuses without decomposing.       When decom
     posed by sulphuric acid and heat, a portion of sulphate of potash
     was obtained, which showed it to be composed of

heat, yielded a substance which was crystalline on the inner surface,
and of a yellowish white colour; it was partly soluble in water, and
contained some insoluble protobromide.       It may also be prepared
by heating equal quantities of bromine and mercury under water.
The mixture becomes pasty, and by evaporating the fluid, silky
needles of perbromide are formed. Or the evaporation may be con
tinued to dryness, and the residue sublimed; when purified by sub
limation, it has the form of very fine silky needles, which are very
soluble, have a penetrating smell and are very volatile.    It is pre

       ATOMIC CONSTITUTION         OF CYAN IDE OF MERCURY.
   Mr.     J.
            F. W. Johnston, M.A., who supposed he had disco
vered that clorine is evolved, when carbonate of manganese is treated
with diluted sulphuric acid, has published a memoir in Dr. Brewster's
Journal for the last month, the object of which is to “determine by
experiment the atomic constitution” of cyanide of mercury.
   Mr. Johnston admits that the constituents of the compound in
question have been “correctly made out;" and if this be the case,
we would inquire whether experiment can go further? To us it
appears, that when the analysis of a compound has been performed,
theory is to determine                 its
                             atomic constitution.    Thus, Dr. Henry

         ANALYSIS OF PLATINA ORES.-BY BERZELIUS.
  Platina ore from Nischne Tagilsk in the Uralian mountains.—This
ore is of a dark gray colour, and contains many magnetic grains,
some of which possess poles, and the larger are capable of raising
small pieces of steel wire. The magnetic and non-magnetic grains
were separately analysed, and the results showed that they are essen
tially and constantly different.                                Non Magnetic. Magnetic.

  With   respect to the mineral springs in Windsor Forest, it is stated
that Captain  F. Forbes of Winkfield-place, Windsor Forest, discovered
them some time ago on his estate: one, the analysis of which is stated
under A, in the immediate neighbourhood of his mansion; the other,
mentioned under B, at some distance.        Both these mineral springs,
belonging to the magnesio-saline class, have since been used by a

great number of patients; and the good effects which have been ob
served from their use have induced Captain Forbes to build a pump

                      ON SODI UM : BY M. SERULLAS,
    If potassium   is put on a mercury bath, the fragments remain for
some time     motionless;    they afterwards, during amalgamation, begin
a  movement,     which  gradually  increases and becomes very rapid. This
movement       depends   upon   the absorption and decomposition of the
moisture of the      atmosphere    by the metal, from which results the
evolution of    hydrogen,   which occasions the movement; when potas
sium is    placed   in contact with mercury under a receiver containing
dry air, the amalgamation goes on quietly.
   If on the other hand a particle of sodium be quickly thrown upon
mercury, it is violently projected out of the bath, occasioning a slight
explosion, accompanied with heat and light.              MM. Gay Lussac and
Thenard have       already   observed that     during   the amalgamation of
sodium, heat and light were given out.             It is also well known that
potassium burns in contact with water, while sodium decomposes it
without combustion.
   Thus the distinguishing characters of sodium and potassium are,
that the first combines with mercury with heat and light, and the
other merely with heat; that sodium decomposes water without
burning, and that potassium under similar circumstances occasions
vivid light. It will be observed that in these two cases, each metal
possesses opposite properties.       The last-mentioned effect is owing to
the greater heat occasioned by potassium, which even reaches incan
descence, while with sodium the heat is not sufficient to occasion
inflammation. The proof of this will be found in the following
experiment, by which sodium may be made to burn by the contact of
water.
   Make a moderately strong mucilage of gum-arabic, and the sodium
when thrown upon it readily inflames. The fragments are retained by
the density of the liquid, and fixed to a point, and then become suffi
ciently hot to ignite, and run over the surface of the liquid in the
same manner as potassium. The flame is yellowish instead of blue
ish, as with potassium. This effect cannot be produced upon water
or a moistened body, which by               nature abstracts the heat pro

portion of 1 to 7; but the complicated species, in the same divisions,
are in the reverse ratio nearly of 17 to 1.
    On comparing the proportions which the classes of shells under
each division bear to each other, differences equally remarkable are
observable.    Thus the univalves in the first division are to the com
plex species as 1 to 4; in the second, as 1 to 14rd only; and in the
third, as 32 to 1.
   The ancient formations are characterized by complicated shells, the
middle series by bivalves, and the upper by simple univalves.
    Mr. Taylor next illustrates from the Tables, Mr. Dillwyn's remarks
on the distribution of carnivorous and herbivorous Trachelipodes. He
shows that, in the English formations, the Zoophages comprise 22
genera, and 171 species. They may be considered as appertaining
to, if not as wholly characteristic of the tertiary formations; and
many of the genera are continued in our present seas. Of the Phyl
liphages, 22 genera and 168 species are distributed through the se
condary and tertiary formations.
   When the members of each of these classes are arranged according
to the three geological divisions already mentioned, we find that the
turbinated univalves of the older strata or rocks belong almost en
tirely to the herbivorous family, 12 genera having originated there,
which have been perpetuated through                        all

   In the aggregates thus exhibited, there is an apparent want of con
formity in the relative proportions of each class. This wholly arises
from the extinct genera of the ancient strata; for, on making the
comparison between the recent series and those of the latest group
of deposits, no such difference will be perceived. On the contrary, a
considerable agreement between the proportions of existing species
and the several classes of fossil shells in the tertiary beds prevails;
the average increase of numbers being about sevenfold.
   If we follow the investigation further, we may observe that the fossil
multilocular and complicated Testacea, which characterize the oldest
formations, and decidedly preponderate in that end of the series, form
one-fifth part of the entire catalogue; but, amongst the recent shells,
this class constitutes less than a fortieth part, and
                                                   -  in the tertiary series
only a fiftieth part.

  Gentlemen,
  Not having seen any thing lately on the variation of the mariner's
compass, and having just perused the private log of a gentleman
recently returned from India,                   I
                                have extracted a few observations,

   In the outward passage, it appears that the variation diminished

it satisfactorily.  Mr.  Holland, who has for some time closely ap
plied himself      microscopic researches, has found that the motion
                        to
continues equally vivid, when the liquid containing the molecules

is covered with a thin piece of talc: he was induced to try this ex
periment in order to ascertain whether the motion might not be the
result of external causes acting upon the surface of the fluid. On
the 29th of June last, he carried the experiment further, by sealing
hermetically the whole circumference of the talc, in order to pre
vent evaporation, which (although ten days have elapsed) has not
taken place; and yet there is not the slightest alteration either in
the molecules or their motion, and (should the sealing be perfect)
most probably none will occur: this experiment proves that eva
poration is not the cause of the motion.
    Mr. Cary, optician, 181 Strand, has the specimen in his posses
 sion, ready for exhibition to those who may feel an interest on the
 subject,    Mr. Holland used No. 2 of the deep power sold by Mr.
 Cary, the sidereal focus of which is the 1-30th of an inch, with a
 linear magnifying power of 300: this power developes the phaeno
 mena connected with these molecules in a most satisfactory manner.

           Note:-The accuracy and judicious arrangement of the instru
      ments used, which are very essential to the purposes of meteorology,
      the able hands in which they are intrusted to register the observa.
      tions, and the opportunities that will be afforded the observer in so
      eligible a situation, to ascertain the effects of heat or cold, wind,
      rain, and drought, on the various fruits and vegetation, will ulti
      mately be found beneficial to the Horticultural Society, by the ex
      perience they will gain year after year in providing as much as pos
      sible for the preservation of those things against the vicissitudes of
      a very changeable climate.

                Meteorological Observations                                for June            1829.                    1.59
 On the 13th a solar and a lunar halo appeared, and set with the sun and
moon which they circumscribed.        In the evening of the 16th, after another
dry and dusty period of twenty-two days, very refreshing showers of rain
came on by means of a change of wind to the S.W.; they were followed
almost every day to the end of the month by gentle rain, and a tolerably
uniform temperature.                    -
   On the 20th and     29th, lightning   and thunder occurred by the inoscula
tion of two currents of wind ; and solar halos again presented themselves
in beds of cirrostratus on the 23rd, 24th, 26th and 30th, and were followed
by rain, mostly in the nights. The mean temperature of the atmosphere this
month is nearly half a degree under the mean of June for many years past.
   It would be difficult to describe with any degree of accuracy the richness
and beauty of the colours that appeared in the clouds, and in the water
about the shore here at sunrise and sunset in the early part of the month :
the same gradation of colours which the condensed aqueous vapours and
falling dews passed through at these times, was successively painted on the
water beneath them, as yellow, orange, red, lake, light blue, &c.
   The red light is remarkable for         frequency        its
                                                        the clouds; and     passin                                 in
                                                                                     it of

                               it                         any other, and makes
the strongest impression        the retina   onthe eye;   forces  ofway through                     its

while the shallow water about the shores             some distance     tothe offing,                     in

          twelve months ago I printed an account of Mi
ABOUT

the Particles contained in the Pollen of Plants; and on the
general Existence of active Molecules in Organic and Inor

   In the present Supplement to that account, my objects are,
to explain and modify a few of       statements,      its
                                                      advert                      to                   to

                             to

      cules, a supposition which, though professedly conjectural,
     I   regret having so much insisted on, especially as it may seem
      connected with the opinion of the absolute identity of the
      Molecules, from whatever source derived.                     -
          On this latter     subject,   the   only  two points  that      endea                   I
      voured to ascertain, were their size and figure: and                                                 al
      though          I
                     was, upon the whole, inclined to think that in
      these respects the Molecules were similar from whatever sub
      stances obtained, yet the evidence then adduced in support of
      the supposition was far from satisfactory; and
      that    I
              am still less satisfied now that
                                                                    j.may add,

      been absolutely established, it did not necessarily follow, nor

                                  their other properties and functions.
     I     have    remarked,    that certain substances, namely, sulphur,
      resin, and wax, did not yield active particles, which, how
      ever, proceeded merely from defective manipulation; for                                              I
      have since readily obtained them from              these bodies:  all   the                     at

     I have formerly
                   stated my belief that these motions of the
particles neither arose from currents in the fluid containing
them, nor depended on that intestine motion which may be
supposed to accompany      evaporation.      its

guishes these moving organic globules from real Animalcules,

with when printed the account of my Observations, the au
thor gives an account of the very remarkable motions of the
spicula which form the silvery part of the choroid coat of the
eyes   of fishes.
    These spicula were examined with a simple microscope, and
as opake objects, a strong light being thrown upon the drop
of water in which they were suspended. The appearances are
minutely described, and very ingenious reasoning employed
to show that, to account for the motions, the least improbable
conjecture is to suppose the spicula animated.
    As these bodies were seen by reflected and not by trans
mitted light, a very correct idea of their actual motions could
hardly be obtained; and with the low magnifying powers
necessarily employed with the instrument and in the man
net described, the more minute nearly spherical particles or
active Molecules which, when higher powers were used,                                       I
have always found in abundance along with the spicula, en
tirely escaped observation.
     Dr. Drummond's researches were strictly limited to the
spicula of the eyes and scales of fishes; and as he does not
appear to have suspected that particles having analogous mo
 tions might exist in other organized bodies, and far less in
 inorganic matter,             I
                         consider myself anticipated by this acute
observer only to the same extent as by Gleichen, and in a
much less degree than by Muller, whose statements have been
already alluded            to.
     All the observers now mentioned have confined themselves
to   the examination             of
                          the particles      organic bodies.

           composing a scale of equivalents, now in course of publi
                         extensive, and designed to be more practical,

  weight of mercury, which fancied Dr. Thomson had doubled;
  and of oxalic acid in crystals, wherein Dr. Prout having found
  but three atoms of water, while Dr. Thomson had found four,
  the latter suggested the probability of more than one variety
  existing. Being accustomed to meet with two varieties of these
                        º
  crystals, one firm and transparent prisms, the other acicular,
  friable, and with the aspect of quadroxalate of potash; and
  happening to possess some of each, I thought they might verify
  this suggestion.
       1st–18 grains of the friable crystals were dissolved in dis
  tilled water, and                  mixed with a solution of 36 grains
  of   dry   transparent   crystals  of carbonate of soda. The mix
  ture, boiled to drive off the carbonic acid, reddened litmus
  paper; and required for neutralization 5-15 grains of carbo
  nate of soda.       A minute portion more gave signs of alkali.
      2nd.—9 grains of the same acid were neutralized with am
  monia, and 6.25 grains of carbonate of lime, in clean rhombic
  crystals, were placed in a test tube with a little distilled water,
  adding muriatic acid, three drops at a time, until with the aid
  of heat it was dissolved, when it was washed out into the seg
  ment of a Florence flask and slowly evaporated to dryness.
                                                                 Being

  Being redissolved in distilled water, it was poured into the
  oxalate of ammonia, and thoroughly mixed. When the                                                   li
  quid had become clear, a drop of it in a watch-glass became
 turbid with muriate of lime. 0-89 grains of carbonate of lime,
 treated as above, and gradually added, rendered the liquid
 insensible to either muriate of lime or oxalic acid. A very small
 additional portion of muriate made it answer to the latter.
     3rd.—7% grains of the same acid, treated as above, with
 64 grains carbonate of lime, the liquid was not affected by
 either the acid or the muriate. A portion of it was poured off,
 gently evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in a few drops
 of distilled water. Oxalic acid was added to                  intervals,       it,   at

it would go,     a method by which definite proportions were not
likely to be attained. It is to be remarked, however, that the
nitric and sulphuric solutions thus made are decomposed by
water into   “sub-" and “bi-” salts: that red oxide is produced
by the decomposition of sulphuric acid; and that silver and
mercury yield analogous compounds by the action of nitric
acid and alcohol, in which the former metal is in the state of
protoxide, the latter of red oxide. These facts lead to the in
ference, that red oxide is the oxide of 1 atom of each ingre
dient; that the “super” sulphate and “super” nitrate are de
ficient in acid; and the “bi-” salts compounds of one atom
acid and one oxide. The property of reddening vegetable
blues belongs to the salts of copper and some others, as well
as to these.
    The following experiments were conducted upon the sup
position, that 17 represents the atom of corrosive sublimate,
consisting of         Mercury............ 12:5
                      Chlorine............ 4:5
     1st.—The “bi-” sulphate is familiar to chemists, but I was
disposed to obtain it by double decomposition.        Solutions be
ing made in distilled water of 17 grains corrosive sublimate,
and 15; grains crystallized sulphate of copper, were mixed hot
and set to crystallize.       Solutions also of 17 grains sublimate
and 20+    grains   crystallized sulphate of soda were mixed, and
gradually evaporated at about 200°. In both the muriate
of mercury crystallized out, in the latter contrary to my ex
pectation; and as no other unexceptionable method occurred
to me, and the salt was already known, this experiment was
 abandoned.                                               -
     2nd.—Solutions of 17 grains corrosive sublimate and 21.5
 grains crystallized nitrate of silver were mixed hot and well
 shaken together; the chloride of silver fell rapidly, and the clear
liquor reddened litmus paper. Alternately evaporated and set
 aside, it refused to crystallize till reduced to dryness.
     3rd.—Solutions of 17 grains sublimate and 23; crystallized
 acetate of lead were mixed warm.         Muriate of lead subsided,
 and the clear   liquor  smelt stronger of acetic acid, but did not
 affect test paper much more than the solution of acetate of
 lead. Two of these mixtures were made: the first (a) evapo
 rated at about 200°, and occasionally set aside; the other (b)
 left to spontaneous evaporation in the warm air over the sand
 bath. (a) when reduced to about a drachm began to deposit
 nacreous follicules, striated as if fibrous; and the liquid dried
 away in the course of the night, leaving slender rhombic prisms.
  (b) began to crystallize whilst more than a drachm remained,
 and was removed to -a cold place, where some opaque white
                                                             crystals

                        of Oralic Acid and of Mercury.                                 169
crystals were deposited. Being afterwards reduced on a water
bath, and set aside to dry away, it left prisms like the second
crop of (a). None of these crystals were deliquescent.            Those
produced by spontaneous evaporation readily dissolved quite
clear in a small quantity of warm distilled water, and gave the
characteristic orange-yellow with solution of potash. The
prisms and follicules dissolved still more freely in their own
weight of cold water; but left a white sediment, which was
quickly taken up by a drop of acetic acid. The latter crystals
retain their acid with greatenergy, giving, whether imperfectly
dissolved alone, or perfectly by the aid of acetic acid, a white
precipitate with solution of potash, unless concentrated; in
which case the characteristic yellow appears.           These acetates
remain for further examination.
    4th-Solutions of 17 grains sublimate and 18 dry clear
crystals of carbonate of soda were mixed cold, and a similar
mixture afterwards made, boiling hot. Dull brick-red preci
pitates fell, without effervescence, the liquor retaining a slight
similartinge.       Poured off and set to evaporate, brick-red cry
stalline scales continued to form on the surface till reduced to
dryness; and a minute portion redissolved with the muriate
of soda, from which               I
                              did not succeed in completely sepa
rating   it.

is perfectly consistent with the theory of volumes, and much
more consonant with my experiments, than that recommended
by the celebrated author of that admirable theory.
   The late Professor Dana ingeniously reconciled Gay-Lus
sac’s statement, with the theory of volumes, by suggesting that
one half-volume of oxygen may take one volume of the nitric
oxide, and another half-volume of oxygen two volumes.
   & vol. oxygen takes 1 vol. oxide, and forms nitrous acid.
                                              a-
                        2 — oxide,and forms hypo-nitrous acid.
                                     Deficit due to oxygen gas
as 1          to        3.    This result is evidently dependent
upon the contingencies which may prevent nitrous acid from
being the predominant product.        I have accordingly found it
precarious in at least 100 experiments, accurately made with
the sliding-rod eudiometer, of which an engraving and de
scription will be found in the Philosophical Magazine, vol. lxvii.

   When there is a copious supply of the gas to be examined,
the barometer-gauge eudiometer may be used advantageously;
as much larger quantities of gas may be exploded in it than
could be exploded in the same time in the sliding-rod eudio
meter.
   In order to render the process with the barometer-gauge
eudiometer safe, the quantity introduced in the first instance
should be as small as can be ignited. Afterwards successive
portions may be introduced and exploded until the receiver
be nearly full of the residual gas.   That this operation may
be still more secure,                I
                         propose to employ, as a receiver, an
iron bottle (such as are used to hold mercury) surmounted by
a very stout glass tube, in which the platina wire may be                                                          si

Analysis of a Gaseous Mirture in which Bihydroguret of Car
  bon, Carbonic Oride, and either Hydrogen or Azote, or both
  the latter, are intermingled.
  When, as in the case under consideration in the preceding
article, there is no azote present, the gas which remains after
the action of the lime-water may be considered as oxygen;
but if azote be present, the residual gas must be analysed
in order to ascertain the quantity of oxygen which remains
unconsumed.
   This is easily accomplished by propelling the residual gas
into the receptacle for carbonic acid R, fig. 1, and substitu
ting a self-regulating reservoir of hydrogen for the bell-glass.
Then having filled the gauge and pipes with the pure hydro
gen, by the manipulation already described in the case of oxy
gen, the residual gas may be drawn into the receiver, exploded,
and the resulting deficit ascertained; to one-third of which
the oxygen is equivalent.
   Instead of resorting to the method just mentioned, the re
sidual gas, after being included in the receptacle, may be trans
ferred to the pneumatic cistern, and analysed by the aqueous
sliding-rod eudiometer.
  If   we subtract from the weight of the “residual gas,” the
weight of the oxygen found in                     it,

Method of ascertaining the Proportions of Bihydroguret of Car
  bon and Carbonic Ovide in a Mirture of those Gases, provided
  no other inflammable Gas be present.  By FRANKLIN BAcHE,
* M.D., &c. &c. &c.
     Iwill here subjoin an excellent method of ascertaining the
proportions of bihydroguret of carbon and carbonic                 in
a mixture of those gases, which has been ingeniously and cor
rectly suggested by my friend Dr. Bache.
    “The proportion of carbonic oxide in a mixture of this gas
and bihydroguret of carbon, may be calculated from the quan
tity of oxygen consumed by them when exploded, in the fol
lowing manner.
     “If we suppose a gas to be        bihydroguret   all  carbon,                             of               it
will consume twice      volume  its oxygen:      of the other hand,         if,     on
it   be   all
          carbonic oxide,    will require half
                                       it          volume for com               its
plete combustion.         must be evident, therefore, that
                                It                              mix                                     a
ture      of
          these gases  will consume volume           oxygen,
                                                        a      inter                of
mediate between half the volume and twice the volume of the
mixture; and that whatever may           the volume      the oxygen
                                                            be                             of

                    it       constant  aproportion     the carbonic                       to
oxide present.
   “Reasoning from the analysis            the pure bihydroguret,
                                                            of
which requires twice                  its
                            volume for complete combustion,
must       apparent that the introduction
           be                                   the least portion          of                                   of it
earbonic oxide will    necessarily   diminish the quantity       the                                    of
oxygen consumed. Now           will                    be
                                        found that this diminution
                                            it
of  the quantity           of
                     the oxygen required, bears        the carbonic                       to
oxide present the constant ratio                        of
                                                    Hence we have3     to   2.
this proportion:—
               “As   3
                         is
                         to     2,
So   is   the deficit      of   oxygen above alluded                                to,   to   the carbonic
oxide present.

Then                 *   2
                              =      volume      of   carbonic oxide present.
And       as   carbonic oxide contains half                      its   volume             of   oxygen, then
                2   M- O                                               -                                    -

ated.” This, however, is clearly the essential characteristic
laid down in the law, since a Negro “produces by certain
laws of generation others like himself,” and yet is not very
generally accounted to be a distinct species.       But I ought to
recollect, that in spite of Mr. Wilberforce, you have your
doubts on this particular point: that in fact it still remains
with you “the most difficult problem of all.”
   You lay down as a “first principle of arrangement,” that
“in Botany the characters of a Genus should be taken from the
parts of fructification, and in Zoology from such parts as are
indicative of structure and habits.”       Having myself, as you
know, dabbled a little in Zoology, and being pleased with the
sight of a really new definition,                       I
                                         am anxious to learn what
other  zoological  parts  remain,  in order that I may avoid them.
   To clear  up  the  fog  in which our poor brains are enveloped
when we attempt to distinguish a species from a genus, you
next inform us that “there is the same difference between a
genus and a species as instruments of reasoning, as between a
                                                                                                        º
definition and a proposition in geometry.”          Now the differ
ence between the latter                 is,
                                 that the proposition requires de
monstration, and the definition not.        must therefore suppose

                                               is                     a

 but at the same time it is rather surprising that the recognized
 organ of the Linnean Society should publicly, in the Trans
 actions of that learned body, state that the above “different
gradations are gratuitous assumptions with which Nature has
 nothing to do;” and that pursuing this doctrine, he should ob
ject, not merely to those who would “attempt to express with
 more accuracy larger generalizations than they would do by
 employing a generic term,” but also bestow censure on those
 “who think it advisable to break up the old genera into new
 ones.” In short, we must remain stationary, according to you,
 with neither greater nor less groupes of species than the ge
 nera of Linnaeus and Sir James Smith.                All other assem
 blages of approximations, and approximations of assemblages,
 “are rather predicated than proved;” and in future we are only
 to be permitted by you “to point them out by mere signs, such
 as are used in printing,” by asterisks, forsooth, and obelisks, or
 a casual dagger. Such is the perfect vehicle which in future is

* You say “division and separation is the end of the Artifi

possibly be in the right.        But then you proceed as follows:–
“To establish     agreements      is the end of the Natural System.”
Now that    you  who    kindly  offer to “prevent young Naturalists
from being prematurely embarrassed in this difficult subject,”
should thus express yourself, surprises me not a little; for                                                       I

     for “attempting fresh combinations at every stage,” and the
     former praised “as his object is chiefly synthesis.”                am the         I
     more    sorry  for   my  ignorance     of the botanical difference be
     tween combination and synthesis, not merely because                   have             I
     myself the highest opinion of Mr. Brown's science, but because
    I  of course must feel interest in any eulogy of our friend by
     those who, as Botanists, must be bestable to judge of his merits.
          Ihave already hinted, that your distinction between the
     natural and an artificial system, making the latter a descending
    series, and the former an ascending one, could have only been
    maintained by you from love of paradox; but as you return
    to this distinction, and may therefore possibly believe it cor
    rect, I shall explain myself more fully.              Both kinds of system
    afford    ascending     and   descending      series.   It is clear, for                    in
    stance, that the Linnean sexual system in Botany was in the
    first case founded as much on the examination of individuals
    as if it had been the natural system.              In studying, therefore,
    any system, whether natural or artificial, we must always begin
    with individuals, and look upwards, discovering first the spe
    cies, next the genus, and so on.             It is true, indeed, that the
    genus may have been a more comprehensive groupe with early
    Naturalists than with modern; but however this may be, the
    above is the general process of investigation.              Nay, it so hap
    pens, that this system of combining has hitherto been pursued
    principally in various artificial systems, although the searchers
    after the natural system have no reluctance to apply the know
    ledge of natural groupes, that happens sometimes to be thus
    acquired, to their own more particular object. In the same
    way the natural system is not essentially an ascending series,
    for it is equally true, whether it ascends or descends; being
    equally the plan of the Deity, however we may please to study
    it, whether              by
                        analysis      synthesis.

their being subdivided; and lastly, that so far from your power

further combination, or even in a greater degree, inasmuch as

 210                 Mr. W. S. MacLeay's Examination of
 of unknown things?      Not surely that He did not understand
 the relations subsisting between the things He created.  And
 as to the Naturalists not understanding them, this only proves
 that we have not yet attained the knowledge of the natural
 system, and much less that of many of them.    “We are con
  stantly approximating to the truth, but never reaching it.”
 At     the same time it must be allowed, we are sometimes too
  apt to forget that the real object of the Naturalist ought to be
  to come as near the truth as possible, and that this is not to
  be done by “abstract reasoning,” so much as by observing
  and arranging facts.
      We next have a rather novel proposition started; to wit,
  that “the mammiferous animals are arranged with more ease,
  according to a natural system, (again as if there were more
  than one,) in consequence of their number being comparatively
  small, and their forms strongly marked.”                   That          other           is,   in
  words, the more widely the species are asunder, and the more
  distant they are         form, the more easily are they combined:
 just, perhaps,               a in
                             as
                            chain      more connected

                      links that are     wanting                  !
      In  order      prove that you have not confined your studies
      the vegetable kingdom, you afterwards infer that the series
 of to M. Cuvier          the Régne Animal,

    indeed, except that happen to have followed in the wake of
    such idiots as Fabricius and Latreille, and have subdivided
    Scarabaeus, that any one of your observations personally af
    fects me; and        I
                       can never forget that you have always, in the
    most honourable way, been a friend to the free expression of
    opinion, and have of late most warmly patronized Zoology.
    Yet as every law-giver must, in these days, expect to have the
    goodness of his laws examined before they are adopted, and
    as it is the duty of every lover of truth to sift them well before
    he allows them to pass current, I have judged that you would
    not be displeased if I, although from a very remote quarter,
    should return them to you for a little amendment.        You know
    that the days of demigods and despotism in science have for
    ever gone by, and that by publishing your “principles,” you
    stipulated for criticism.                                   -
       Your object may possibly be to clear the way for the re
    ception of a system of your own; for               I
                                                  observe that you find
    fault both with the Linnean and Jussieuan schools of Botany,
    although you appear to prefer the former.                 I
                                                         observe, also,
    that no    system  of  Zoology  hitherto  propounded,   meets with
    your approbation.       You have, therefore, with just confidence
    taken a wide range for your “first principles of arrangement,”
    and    Iassure you        I
                           shall be glad to hear that your talents are
    employed in the application of them to observed facts. You
    must indeed be aware that such an application of your prin
    ciples will tend more to give them weight in the eyes of Na
    turalists than your most abstract reasoning or profound meta
    physics; however to slight these last may argue the height of
    folly.   It really, however, appears to me high time now to
     let every one have his own way          Natural History; and

XXX.       Note on the Differences, either Original or consequent

                smaller variations in the mineralogical struc
  ture of the secondary stratified rocks have been long ac
knowledged and pointed out by many geologists. The greater
or less development of a limestone or sandstone formation, the
want of certain beds in a given series, the alteration of rocks
within short distances from masses or veins of trap, &c., have
for some time been remarked, and the greater or less import
ance that should be attached to these circumstances, upon the
whole, fairly appreciated: but the greater changes, such as
the substitution of dark compact limestones and sandstones
for the green-sand of England and the North of France, though
long since noticed by M. Alex. Brongniart; the transforma
tion of the whole oolite system into compact dark-coloured
limestones resembling those commonly called transition; the
occasional change of             all
                              the limestones, from the chalk          those                 to
    the red sandstone formation inclusive, into dolomite, more
or inless crystalline according        circumstances, with other dif

 cause either original or from disturbance, into hard dark and
 compact limestones, resembling those commonly called transi
 tion, sometimes mixed with gypsum and dolomite; in fact, in
 mineralogical structure very different from the same formation
 in England and the North of France, where it has suffered little
 disturbance beyond the fractures called faults.
    M. Von Buch's letter on the Dolomite of the Tyrol, is dated
 1822, and his account of the Southern Tyrol, 1823.                In these
 memoirs he states his opinion, that the dolomite mountains of
 that country, so remarkable for their forms and their frequent
 crystalline character, are probably the limestones of the country
 altered by the intrusion of the black or augite porphyry among
 them, which he supposes converted the compact limestone into
a very crystalline rock, highly charged with magnesia.                    It
would be here out of place to enter into a detail of the facts
he has brought forward:         I shall content myself with a reference
to the map and sections, which will at least show the shattered
and broken state of this part of the Alps. This Tyrolese
limestone, though commonly referred to the Jura limestone, has
not yet been well determined; but certainly a part at least of
their continuation towards the lakes of Como, &c. is of that
epoch. Those of the Tyrol are gray and shelly, and they
may represent in part the chalk or green-sand series.
    In 1825, M. Von Buch visited the lakes of Orta, Maggiore
and Lugano, for the purpose of more particularly examining
the porphyries in those districts. The result was a note on
the phaenomena presented by the relative position of the do
lomite, limestone, and porphyries of the Lago di Lugano, which
appeared first,     I believe, in a German Journal, and afterwards
in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for February 1827. In
this he took occasion to insist on the analogy observable in
the phaenomena of this district and those of the Tyrol, point
ing out the dolomite mountain of San Salvador as an excellent
example of the truth of his theory.—The following is his de
scription.
    After mentioning the red conglomerate of San Martino, con
racteristic.  We may take as an example the nummulite rocks of the Alps.
These, when examined partially, have been, and no doubt will be by many
observers, considered as tertiary; but if they are examined on the large
scale, and their connection with other districts carefully examined, we can
scarcely refuse to consider them as referable to the green-sand series.

“These beds dip rapidly at 70° to the S. and form a promon

nutes  walk,   the dip of the beds diminishing to 60°. It is then
covered by a compact smoke-gray limestone, in beds about a
foot thick.    These dip as the beds on which they rest, and
have the same inclination on the side of the mountain; but in
their prolongation towards the lake, the dip continually dimi
nishes, until at       its
                       level       scarcely 20°. The beds,

218            Mr. De la Beche   on the Differences
belemnites, ammonites, and other shells, among which are
Ammonites Bucklandi, sometimes of very large size, A. hete
rophyllus, &c.
   A short distance south of Bellano, the general mass of lime
stones and dolomite is separated from the gneiss and mica-slate
of  the northern part of the lake of Como by conglomerates
and sandstones, the former of which closely resemble the Rothe
Todte Liegende. It contains pieces of gneiss, mica slate, &c.
as also pieces of the red quartziferous porphyry that appears
on the lake of Lugano: the paste or cement often exhibits im
                                     i.
perfect felspar crystals; and the whole, in fact, strongly re
minds one of the Exeter red conglomerate, or Rothe Todte
Liegende. This rock traverses the           to the north of a little
place named La Gaeta; the line thus separating the gneiss and
mica slates from the dolomite and limestone, gives that of the
general direction of the two latter; and it might be supposed
that the limestones and dolomite on each side would corre
spond, as do the gneiss and mica slates on the N.: this, how
ever, is not the case; for if from Bellano we follow the eastern
shores of the lake of Como back to Bellaggio, we have a very
different section from that obtained by passing along from La
Gaeta to the same place by the western coast. To the red con
glomerate near Bellano succeeds dolomite for a short distance,
and afterwards compact gray limestones to Varenna, near which
are the celebrated black marble quarries: hence to the Fiume
del Latto there is a continuation of the same limestones, in
thinner beds, with schist containing anthracite, crowned near
the cavern (out of which rushes the river high up the side of
the mountain at the latter place) by dolomite, gradually de
scending to the level of the lake opposite Bellaggio. This section
is then principally of gray compact limestone; while the whole
of the section on the other side is dolomite, if we except the
mass of gypsum included in it at Nobiallo, and a few beds of
gray limestone south of Menaggio; there is therefore no cor
respondence between them, notwithstanding the general direc
tion of the rocks as shown by the red conglomerates, gneiss,
and mica slates, which do correspond.
   The limestones and dolomite, when stratification can be seen
in the latter, are highly disturbed and contorted; and igneous
rocks which seem to have caused these appearances have pierced
through them at the lake of Lugano.
   If there be more limestones than one on the lake of Como,
it is difficult to trace them; lias at least forms a part, quite
different, mineralogically, from what it appears in England:
probably a considerable portion of these limestones may even
tually be found to represent the oolite formation generally.
                                  -                                Il

           observable    in the Secondary Stratifted Rocks.              219
    In a note on the geological position of the fossil plants and
 belemnites found at Petit Coeur near Moutiérs on the Taren
 taise”, published in 1828, M. Elie de Beaumont observes, that
 the system of beds described by M. Brochant in his memoir
 on the Tarentaise, and which in many places contains consi
 derable masses of granular limestone and micaceous quartz
 rock, as well as large masses of gypsum, belongs to the oolite
formation.      He founds this opinion on the circumstance, that
the most ancient secondary rocks of that country, in which no
fossils have been found that have not been also discovered in
the lower part of the oolite system, can be traced to the en
virons of Digne and Sisteron (department of the Basses Alpes),
where they afford a great abundance of those fossils supposed
to be characteristic of the lias.
    In a notice on the geological position of the fossil plants and
graphite found at the Col du Chardonett (department of the
Hautes Alpes), published in 1828, the same gentleman re
marks, that as the traveller quitting the Bourg d’Oisans (Pied
mont) approaches the continuous range of primitive masses
that extend from Monte Rosa towards the mountains on the
west of Coni, he perceives that the secondary rocks gradually
lose their original character, though certain distinguishing
marks may still be traced, thus resembling a half-burnt piece
of wood in which the ligneous fibres may be traced far beyond
the part that remains wood, into that converted into charcoal.
    The quartz rocks of these countries appear to M. Elie de
Beaumont to be an alteration of the anthracite sandstones, the
variegated green and reddish schists that accompany them, a
change from the schistose clay, and the gypsum a substitution
for the limestone.                                          -
     He has also remarked the original difference that exists
between these secondary rocks of the interior of the Alps, and
the same formations of other countries; and thence concludes
that very little importance should be attached to the difference
of mineralogical structure which exists between the beds above
noticed, and that of the lower portions of the oolite formation,
occurring undisturbed in other parts of Europe, of which these
Alpine rocks appear to him the enlarged prolongation.
   Without entering into the subject of           all
                                                the changes which
M. Elie  de  Beaumont considers         he
                                       can trace even    the range

of  the Alps itself,   it  enough for my present purpose that
fossils characteristic     the lias are found

             After   having    examined the environs of Nice in the win
         ter of 1827–1828, I presented an account of the geology of
         that neighbourhood to the Geological Society, which it ap
         pears by their Proceedings was read in November last. In it
         I  described the two great secondary formations that occur near
         Nice: first, a marly arenaceous limestone, which, though un
         like the green-sand mineralogically, is nevertheless the equiva
         lent of that formation, and contains its characteristic fossils;
         and secondly, a rock which, though it contains both crystal
         line dolomite and gypsum, I referred to the Jura limestone, in
         consequence of                         its

That dolomite is not characteristic of formations,                                 even      sup
posing it an unchanged rock, we have now abundant proof, as
is stated by Dr. Buckland and others; but know of no more            I
striking examples than are to be found in the neighbouring
department of the War, where M. Elie de Beaumont has found
dolomite in the tertiary rocks (fresh-water limestone), dolo
mite in the green-sand, dolomite in the oolite formation, and
dolomite in the muschelkalk; and all these rocks are there well
characterized, which is so far fortunate, as it prevents mistake.
 From the numerous observations that have been lately made,
it would appear that the theory of the peculiarly dolomitic
character of the limestones of the red sandstone formation,
 though useful in England, the North of France, and Germany,
would lead to great error in the South of France, the Alps,
 and many parts of Italy, where so many formations above these
 rocks are charged with dolomite, and       frequent accompaniits
 ment, gypsum.                                                                                      -

3. Variegated Beds.-Greenish-blue and reddish argillo-cal
       careous rocks, more or less schistose, the calcareous mat
       ter being often very small.                     •
4. Brown Sandstone.—Principally siliceous, though some of
       it does contain calcareous matter; is sometimes mica
       ceous; occurs in thick, thin, and schistose beds; has
       sometimes been called greywacke; is one of the ma
-      cignos of the Italians.
 5.  Gray  Siliceo-calcareous Schist and Sandstone.—For the most
      part contains mica; may be considered as a mixture of
       calcareous, siliceous, and argillaceous matter, in which
       sometimes one predominates, sometimes the other; when
       the calcareous predominates there is a gray compact lime
       stone.   The whole is much traversed by veins of calca
       reous spar, and even, though rarely, by veins of quartz.
       Contains a large fusus at Vernazza.
    Such is the section afforded by these mountains, No. 1. being
the upper most rock, and No. 5, the lowest. To give, however, a
clearer idea of this series, it should be stated, that it is covered,
as may be seen near La Spezia, by a micaceous siliceo-cal
careous sandstone, the general colour of which is either brown
or gray; it is mixed with schist, and even argillaceous shale.
 This is another of the rocks named macigno by the Italians.
 The mica is sometimes wanting.
    It is not my intention here to enter into a detailed account
of the environs of La Spezia, which requires the necessary
plans and sections, and is moreover intended for another place;
 but it remains for me to show that at least a part of the above
 section may belong to the oolite formation, and this is done by
 the ammonites, which are of those species found in the lower
 parts of that series: indeed, as far as our knowledge respecting
organic remains extends, the presence of the belemnites alone
 would seem to show that the limestones, notwithstanding their
 perfect mineralogical resemblance to what has been termed
 transition limestones, are of the date of the lias, or some more
 modern rock; for as yet we have no well authenticated instance
 of belemnites having been discovered beneath      it.   The change
                                                                  1Il

 in the oolite formation would therefore appear to be as great
 here as in the Alps, and probably the cause that has effected
 the one produced the other.

     North Cliff. By the Rev. W.M. V. VERNoN, F.R.S. F.G.S.

I WAS   keeper
              informed on the 30th of July by Mr. Phillips, the
               of the Yorkshire Museum, that he had received
from a scientific friend:# intelligence of a discovery of fossil
bones in a marl-pit near North Cliff, accompanied by such a
description of the situation in which they were found as ren
dered the subject worthy of the closest investigation. They
were stated by the writer, who had examined the spot with
great accuracy of observation, to be the bones of elephant,
rhinoceros, deer, ox, horse, &c., and to have lain under dilu
vial chalk gravel, at a depth of from 15 to 20 feet, in a marl
indented by the gravel in such a manner as to appear to have
been deposited before                       it,
                               and containing both land and fresh
water  shells,  Helix and   Pupa,  Lymnaea, Planorbis and Cyclas;

 5. Commencement of a blacker marl.
     The lower part of the excavation         was now concealed by
water; but the black marl had been dug ten feet deeper: and in
this the farmer, by whose intelligence the bones were preserved,
 informed us the greater part of them were found. The horns
of the ox and the jaws of the Felis lay near the bottom of the
excavation; the horn of the stag, the thigh-bone of the ele
phant, and one of the leg-bones of the rhinoceros, lay low in
the upper marl: they occupied a space of about twenty yards
in length and eight in width. The pit has been worked two
years, and a single bone had been noticed in 1828; the rest
were dug out during the present summer.
     On examining the black marl which lay in heaps upon the
ground, we found it full of shells, and of remains of decayed
plants too indistinct to be made out. Many specimens of the
shells were collected, and consigned to Mr. Phillips for inves
tigation.    He found them to include land, marsh, and fresh
water    species;  but the Lymnaea and Planorbis were most
abundant, and of every size from the most minute to the full
                                                                  grown

        shell. It is not the first time that similar bones                                      have
  een found with similar shells, but it is perhaps the first time
that the shells have been minutely examined by so competent
an observer. Mr. Phillips, after comparing the shells col
lected by Mr. Dikes and by ourselves, with the recent types,
states, that the twelve species discovered in the marl agree in
every respect, even in their accidental variations, with the same
species now existing in Yorkshire.
   This fact has great weight in resolving the question whether
the remains of elephant, rhinoceros, and lion, found in these
regions under circumstances which leave no doubt that the
creatures lived here, are proofs of a change of climate having
taken place. There is much force in M. Cuvier's argument
to the contrary, drawn from the comparative anatomy of the
animals themselves.       We find together a fossil elephant and
a fossil glutton;  the latter belonging to a genus which now                                        in
habits a cold   country,   the former to one which lives in a hot
climate; but the fossil elephant differs in            anatomy from    its
the living elephant more than the fossil glutton differs from
the living glutton:          more probable then that that parti
                            it   is
cular   species    elephant
                  of          was adapted          cold climate, than

that the glutton was fitted for        hot one.

   still stronger which may               be
                                    derived from the circumstance

number      ofmolluscous species absolutely the same              those                   as
which now inhabit our country, and              have coexisted also,
                                                        of to
we may justly infer, with        number

which those species feed. The coexistence,           may       said, re              be

account for the manner         which the shells and bones are here
                                  in
intermingled, upon any other supposition; and must                   re                        be
membered that this          not

derived; and when we reflect upon the low level of this coun
try, not more than ten or twelve feet above the sea at high

has of late years been deepened to drain the land, as having
been quite adequate to have deposited the marl, to have kept
the pond, in which the Planorbes have lived, replenished with
water, and to have washed into it the land shells and the

    rounded pebbles of quartz, which are also found in the sand

Lion.—Upper jaw, a fragment containing the two great
   molar teeth.     Lower jaw, broken on both sides near the
   articulations:   length  from the canine to the last molar tooth
   inclusive, 0.14; height below the last molar, 0.05: canine
   tooth 0-11 long. 1 Rib, broken.        1 Radius, broken, head
   of 0.05 x 0.35. 1 Femur, head of           3 Metacarpal bones,
   O'15, 0.14, and 0.12 long. Several other bones supposed
   to belong to this animal, but broken and not identified.
   The bones are in general well preserved, heavy, and seem
to have lost very little of their substance, particularly those
which were embedded in the lower marl. One bone shows
marks of corrosion by running water, and some of them have
been recently broken by the labourers at the pit; they are
mostly of large dimensions. The elephant's teeth indicate an
animal of nine or ten years of age. The teeth of the rhino
ceros are little worn by use. The astragalus and the calca
neum of the ox correspond in size with the largest from Kirk
dale in the Museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society.
The horn exceeds in diameter those in the same Museum, but
agrees with one given by Cuvier, as does the measure of the
occipital condyles. The teeth of the lion are of the largest
size, and extremely sharp. The feet bones exceed in magni
tude those found at Kirkdale (which       I consider as belonging
                                            -

 powerful animal, the head of the radius being 4th longer than
 that of a recent lion in the York Museum.

XXXII.      Queries respecting   Mr. Hall's original Discovery of
       Achromatic Telescopes.     By A CoRRESPONDENT.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
                                                                    -
      Gentlemen,
 I HAVE       for several years observed in the chronological
    table of the original construction of astronomical instru
ments, published in the valuable French Almanac, entitled
“Annuaire présente au Roi par le Bureau des Longitudes,”
that the first achromatic telescope is stated to have been con
structed by Mr. Hall in 1750; and the publication of the dis
covery of achromatic telescopes by Mr. Dollond is dated
eight years subsequently, or in 1758.-As few of our English
writers on optics have ever mentioned the name of Hall, his
merit, as the original inventor of the achromatic telescope, is
almost unknown in the country where the discovery was first
made.     The discovery is indeed faintly alluded to in a note
by Dr. Young in his Lectures; and a reference is made to the
Philosophical Magazine for November 1798, where I find a
more ample account of Mr. Hall's telescopes; but the infor
mation is still confined to a note, and very brief: it becomes,
however, extremely valuable from the testimony of the late
Mr. Ramsden, that it contains a true statement    -
                                                         of the facts
relating to the discovery.
   The attention of astronomers is at present directed to the
improvements lately made by opticians on the continent in
achromatic object-glasses, which are now constructed in a
perfect manner, with apertures far exceeding any that have
been made from English glass, and which will probably su
persede entirely the use of large reflecting telescopes.         The
mirrors of the latter, beside their liability to tarnish, have their
figure injured by their own weight when they exceed two feet
in diameter.             -
   It will doubtless be acceptable to many of your readers to
republish the few but decisive facts at present known respect
ing Mr. Hall's important discovery, to which I shall subjoin
some queries; the answers to which would gratify the astro
nomers of this country, and tend to render justice to a gentle
man whose merits have been unaccountably neglected. “The
inventor was Chester More Hall, Esq. of More Hall, in Essex.”
It appears from his papers, that he commenced his labours in
the year 1729; and after many experiments, he had the good
 º
fortune to find two sorts of glass which had the requisite pro
perties for dispersing the rays of light in contrary directions
        formed into lenses, in order to show objects'         colour
 eSS.
   N.  S. Vol. 6. No. 33. Sept. 1829.          2  H         “ About

234 Queries respecting the Discovery of Achromatic Telescopes.
  “   About 1733 he completed several achromatic object
glasses (though he did not give them that name), which bore
an aperture of 2% inches, though the focal length did not
exceed 20 inches; one of which is now in the possession of
the Rev. Mr. Smith of Charlotte-street, Rathbone Place.
This glass has been examined by several gentlemen of emi
nence and scientific abilities, and found to possess the pro
perties of the present achromatic glasses. ,             -
    “Mr. Hall used to      employ  working   opticians  to grind his
lenses; at the same time he furnished them with the radii
of surfaces, not only to correct the different refrangibility of
the rays, but also the aberration arising from the spherical
figures of lenses.      Old Mr. Bass, who at that time lived in
Bridewell    precinct,   was one of these working opticians, from
whom Mr. Hall’s invention seems to have been obtained.
    “In the trial at Westminster Hall about the patent for
making achromatic telescopes, Mr. Hall was allowed to be
the inventor; but Lord Mansfield observed that ‘it was not
the person who locked up his invention in his scrutoire that
ought to profit by a patent for such invention, but he who
brought it forth for the benefit of the public.” This might per
haps be said with some degree of justice, as Mr. Hall was a
gentleman of property, and did not look to any pecuniary ad
vantage at the time from his discovery.        That Mr. Ayscough,
optician on Ludgate Hill, was in possession of one of Mr. Hall's
ºpe
p  uted.”
             in 1754, is a fact which at this time will not be dis
    The note, of which the substance is here given from the

there stated   to   be  taken from the Gentleman's Magazine for
 October 1790; but        derives particular interest from Mr.
                         it                                          Til
loch's   information,  that the celebrated optician Mr. Ramsden
confirmed the truth of the statement.
    Are any   of   Mr. Hall's achromatic telescopes now         inex

   Is   any correct information now         to   be
                                                obtained respecting
 the  performance   of  Mr. Hall's  telescopes        2
    Are any   of   Mr. Hall's papers containing the principles
of  his discovery extant?

in   Westminster Hall, respecting the original discovery              of
 achromatic telescopes        2
  Is    any thing further known respecting the philosophical
labours or the life of Mr. Hall         ?

XXXIII.        On the Discovery of Iodine and Bromine in certain
    Salt  Springs  and Mineral Waters in England. By CHARLEs
    DAUBENY, M.D. Professor of Chemistry in the University
    of Oxford.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
DR;       DAUBENY,         professor of Chemistry at Oxford, will
       feel obliged  to the editors of the Philosophical Magazine
and    Annals,  to announce among the other scientific notices in
the next Number of their periodical, the discovery which he
has made of iodine and bromine in several salt springs and
mineral waters of this country.
    He has obtained the latter principle in a separate state from
one of the Cheshire brine springs, and has fully satisfied him
self of the existence of the former in two or three; but as he
has not yet had time to ascertain the proportions in which
they occur, must content himself, for the present, with this
 simple announcement of the fact.
    He has found iodine not only in more than one of the
 Cheshire salt springs, but likewise in several waters con
 taining purgative salts, such as those of Cheltenham, Lea
 mington, Gloucester, and Tewkesbury; whilst bromine is of
 still more frequent occurrence, and is perhaps entirely absent
 from none of the English springs which contain much com
 mon salt, except that of Droitwich in Worcestershire,                al
 though the proportion in which it exists seems to vary consi
 derably.
    Oxford, August 3, 1829.
     P.S. The discovery in question was first announced at a
 meeting of a scientific society in this place on Friday, May 1.

saline compound is obtained, which gives aspartic acid, when decom
posed by sulphuretted hydrogen; the properties of this acid are the
following: The aqueous solution deposits a fine crystalline brilliant

   Aspartate of quina is very soluble in water; that of cinchonia cry
stallizes very readily in fine prismatic needles, while the aspartate of
morphia yields a gummy mass, in the middle of which, numerous small
brilliant crystals are readily distinguishable.                      .
   All the soluble aspartates are obtainable directly, or by treating the

has been the subject of general remark. Our correspondent Dr. For

made a corresponding remark abroad.         The crops, and particularly
the garden productions and flowers, have been nearly a fortnight later

good average crop. The barley is much improved by the rains, and pro

                            [With  a Plate.]
Two         opinions have been entertained by geologists, as to
  * the causes that have excavated valleys: some contending
that they have been produced by the rivers that now run in
 them, aided by the bursting of lakes and meteoric agents; while
 others consider that the greater proportion of such valleys
 have been formed by what has been called diluvial action, and
 by other causes operating at the bottom of ancient seas.          It
 appears to me that these two rival theories may be reconciled
 with the facts presented by nature, and that both are, to a
 certain extent, correct. It would,        I think, be almost impos
 sible to deny that rivers, more particularly those discharged
 from the many lakes that probably once existed, have cut
 deeply into the land, and have formed gulleys, ravines, and
 gorges: but again, it seems utterly at variance with the rela
 tions of cause and effect, to suppose that valleys, properly so
 called, could have been formed either by the discharge of        la
  custrine waters, or by the rivers that now run, or could  -
                                                                ever
                                -
  have run, in them.
     In the discussion of this subject, we should consider only
  such valleys as, by the correspondence of horizontal or nearly
  horizontal strata on their opposite sides, show that the strata
  were once continuous, and that their continuity has been de
  stroyed by the removal of theintermediate portions;—of course,
  the very numerous valleys formed by rents and contortions,
  and such as have been termed valleys of elevation and depres
  sion, as well as those of original formation, do not enter into
  our present consideration.

 242         Mr. De la Beche   on the Excavation   of Valleys.
   It seems to me that aqueous excavations are of two kinds:
 1. Those produced by vast and violent causes not now in ac
tion; and, 2. Those resulting from the continuous and gradual
operation of lakes, rivers, and other agents that have been
termed meteoric : the latter series of causes operating upon
valleys that most frequently owe their prior existence to the
former series, and both offering very distinct appearances.
Excavations of the second kind, or those produced by actual
streams, present cliffs, gorges, and ravines; while the first are
marked by grand and extensively rounded outlines, and by
valleys of a breadth and magnitude which would seem only
referable to a voluminous mass of moving waters.
   I shall endeavour to illustrate my opinions by the following
examples.
            I.—Valleys of Excavation in Dorset and Devon.
   Valleys of the first class, which have been usually termed
valleys     of denudation, are very common in districts where
rocks are not far removed from an horizontal position; these,
to take examples from our own country, are very abundant
in Dorsetshire and the east of Devon. In these valleys, the
former continuity of the strata on either side is most apparent,
 and neither elevations nor depressions could have caused them:
 they are exclusively due to the excavation of the materials
 by which their sides were connected. The question then arises,
 what has excavated them? At the bottoms of each of these
 valleys we find a small stream, the natural drain of the land.
 Could these streams have cut out such valleys as they now flow
 through?      If there be any true relation between cause and
 effect, they could not. Fig. 1. (Plate II.) represents a general
 section of the valleys of Lyme Regis and Charmouth.         The
summits of the hills are chiefly composed, as has already been
noticed by Professor Buckland, of angular flint and chert, the
remains of the former superincumbent strata of chalk and
green-sand, that have been partially dissolved in place.      Be
neath this is green-sand, with an unequal upper surface, re
sulting from the causes that produced the gravel; still lower is
the lias in which the spacious valleys of Lyme and Charmouth
have been principally scooped out: in the bottom of each val
ley is a little stream, which   I have necessarily represented in
the section on a scale much too large.     If I had confined my
self strictly to proportions, it would have been invisible; yet
to such insignificant streamlets, and the rain-waters which
acted in conjunction with them, the advocates        for
                                                      the excava
tion   of valleys   by
                     actual causes would refer the whole. The
most remarkable      ofthese valleys isthat of the Char    Char

many miles, in length. The actual force of this stream, even
with every assistance from floods and rains, has not accom
plished more than a cut varying from four to fifteen feet deep,
bounded by perpendicular walls: these walls composed for the
most part, not of the lias strata that have been widely exca
vated, but of flint and chert gravel, and drifted materials such
                                                                  all

cavities that pervade the white limestone of Jamaica.          One
great valley is remarkable; it is situated between the Carpen
ter and Santa Cruz mountains, and is excavated in a white
limestone interstratified with a red sandstone.        It continues
inland some miles from the sea at     Alligator   Pond Bay. The
bottom is in   general an arid  plain  or savanna,  here and there
studded with insulated masses of rock bounded by broken cliffs;
these rocks are covered with vegetation, and resemble, in this
respect, oases in a desert.    They consist of white limestone in
nearly horizontal beds, varying from four to ten feet in thick
ness, and seem to be the remains of continuous strata, which
 have been nearly destroyed by some great force, but certainly
not by that of the waters that now run in the valleys; for there
 is neither river nor rivulet throughout                      its

 examples in Jamaica.            The district named St. Thomas in the

 sides by hills which would form the banks of a lake, were
 not the waters let out by the gorge through which the Rio
  Cobre flows. Luidas Vale, in the same                      is a district sur

      On some Properties of Curves of the Second Order.
    By J. W. LUBBock, Esq. F.R.S. & L.S.*
NONE of the properties of the conic sections are more ele
      gant than those which belong to the inscribed hexagon;
 and it is to be regretted that they do not find a place in ele
 mentary works on this subject. M. Brianchon has treated this
 question at some length in the 4th volume of the Journal de
l’Ecole Polytechnique, and also in the Correspondance de l’Ecole
                                                                                                     a he

KXXVII.      On the supposed Identity       of    Whitebait and Shad.
:            By WILLIAM YARRELL, Esq. F.L.S.*
     HAT     the diminutive fishes called Whitebait are the youn
      of the Shad (Clupea alosa) is    a point so long considere
to be   settled,      I     I
                 that fear shall be thought guilty of a crime
little short of treason in Natural History by declaring for an
opposite opinion; but having devoted considerable time and
attention to this subject during the present season,         shall     I
proceed to detail the facts, historical as well as anatomical,
of which this investigation has placed me in possession, and
which have led me to adopt a conclusion at variance with all
the English authors on this point.
    Mr. Pennant in his British Zoology gives the Whitebait a
place as an appendage to the Bleak (Cyprinus alburnus), rather,
as he remarks, “than form a distinct article of a fish which it
it impossible to class with certainty.”
    The editor of the edition published in 1812 says, “Mr. Pen
nant was either deceived in the specimens sent him as White
bait, or the branchiostegous rays were injured; since he counted
only three (genus Cyprinus) instead of eight (genus Clupea) of
these rays, which number they certainly possess.”
    Dr. Shaw in his General Zoology follows Pennant, and de
scribes the Whitebait as a species of the Carp or Cyprinus
genus,
                  -
    Dr. Turton in his British Fauna, attached to his description
of the Bleak, Cyprinus alburnus, has the following observation:
“The Whitebait which has hitherto been considered as a va
riety of this fish, appears by the judicious and accurate inves
tigation of the author of the Natural History of British Fishes,
to be merely the young fry of the Clupea alosa or Shad.”
   Mr. Donovan, in his Natural History of British Fishes, treats
this subject at some length, and considers that his examination
affords incontrovertible evidence that
                                   -
                                        the Whitebait is really
the fry of the common Shad.
   Dr. Fleming, in his recently published History of British
Animals, follows Mr. Donovan in considering the Whitebait
as the fry of the Shad.
   To place this subject, upon which such different opinions
have been entertained, in a clear point of view, it may be pro
per to commence with a short account of the habits of each of
these two fishes.
    All English writers agree that the Shads enter our rivers in
the month of May, for the purpose of depositing their spawn,
and, this object accomplished, they return to sea by the end of
July. They appear during these three months in the greatest

                                                                    abundance

254.                    Mr. Yarrell on               the supposed Identity
abundance in the Thames, from the first point of land beyond
Greenwich, opposite the Isle of Dogs, to the distance of a mile
below, and immense quantities are taken every year. Formerly,
great quantities of Shads were caught by fishermen at that part
of the Thames opposite the present Penitentiary, but the state
of the water has driven the fish higher up the stream, and the
fishing for them at this point has been almost abandoned.
   Very considerable numbers of Shads were also taken in
former seasons as high up the river as Hammersmith, but the
deterioration which the quality of the water has suffered from
various causes, has rendered the fishing for Shads in this part
of the river an employment scarcely worth following: the
quantity of fishes obtained in a season twenty years ago, com
pared with the produce of the present year, would be in the-
proportion of an hundred to one.
   By various acts of Parliament", the conservation of the river
Thames from Staines Bridge downwards, and of the waters of
the Medway, is vested in the Lord Mayor and his Court for
the time being, who, with the addition of certain other officers,
make and enforce the execution of their own bye-laws for the
preservation of the fishery. Their 23rd rule and order is as
follows: “Shads shall be only taken from the 10th day of
May
-      to the 30th of June in every year.”                              -

I  was constantly supplied with Shads twice in every week du
ring the whole, and even somewhat beyond the time they are
allowed to be taken; and without going into a detail of weekly
observations, it will be sufficient for the purpose to state, that
not a single male or female Shad, examined during the months
of May or June, had cast               milt         its         or
                                                 eggs, and this fact                                  it   is

of July still retained their roes, but two others subjected the                                      to
same test          on

    It    the
         is    opinion       the offishermen,   who have the best    op
portunities for observation, that these adult fishes, having per
formed the office for which they visit the fresh water, take the
centre    ofthe current and return         sea. From their weak state,

    From the observations made               Mr. Donovan    by his History         in
N.   S.   Vol.      6.    No. 34. Oct. 1829.                                 2L                              of

258          Mr. Yarrell   on the supposed Identity
of British Fishes, it would  be inferred, that the Shads visiting
the Thames in the months of May and June, and appearing in
immense quantities, heavy in roe, about Greenwich and Black
wall, there deposit their ova, which on vivification become the
well-known Whitebait. It seems not to be generally known
that the Whitebait, though often caught as high up the river
as Blackwall, are as frequently taken as -low down the river as
Erith.
  The situation they are found in by the fishermen depends
entirely on the state of the water. Always occupying a station
which affords a mixture of the water of the sea and river, they
are a salt-water fish rather than otherwise, coming upwards
with the first part of every flood-tide, swimming always near
the surface, avoiding the strong current, preferring the slack
water at the sides of the stream that they may not be carried
too far up, and returning towards the sea with the first of the
ebb-tide.
    The net used by the fishermen for the taking of Whitebait
is illegal on more accounts than one; the mode of fishing,
which is against the stream, is also illegal; the fish float with
the tide, and only about two hours of each ebb and flow can
be employed to advantage.      The fish are most plentiful when
the weather is  warm,   and can only be taken during day-light.
It  would probably be difficult to ascertain the fact, but I have
reason to believe that the ova which produce these swarms are
deposited in shallow water on the flat shores about and below
Gravesend, as I have almost uniformly received the smallest
Whitebait from the lower part of the river.
    The evidence printed in the Report from the commissioners
appointed to inquire into the state of the supply of water to
this city, contains a sentence in point on this subject, commu
nicated by Mr. Goldham, the clerk of the fish-market at       Bil
lingsgate, a gentleman who has made fish and fisheries his
particular study.
    “Whitebait are certainly obtained in greater abundance
than formerly, by poachers (viz. fishermen who have been
thrown out of their former employ) using unlawful nets: it
should however be observed, that Whitebait are taken at par
ticular times of the tide; as they are a salt-water fish, and
come and retire with the water, which is partially salt; on this
account they are never known above Blackwall.”            See Re
port, page 72.
    From the train of circumstances here detailed, it will be ob
vious that I consider the Whitebait as distinct from the Shad.
I  have now before me, preserved in a weak mixture of alcohol
and distilled water, both young and old Shads, and nearly one

XXXVIII.          On a Property possessed in common by the Primi

        HE idea expounded by Lagrange, of regarding the suc
      cessive differential coefficients of a function of one variable,
as similar functions derived from each other, according to a
given law, materially changes the aspect of the fluxional cal
culus.    His confined notation, however, which is almost a
return to the inconvenient method of Newton, prevents the
advantages of his system from being generally appreciated, and
divests it of that perspicuity which ought always to be the
characteristic of algebraic notation. The elegance of his me
thods, as well as their great power, interested me in procuring
a more convenient notation,-one which might enable me to
pass from one primary to another without being distracted by
the confusion which arises from his varied accents.
   In denoting a derived function it is evidently necessary to
indicate both the number of times the derivation has been re
peated, and the quantity which, in these operations, has been
regarded as the independent or primary variable. Of the three
notations which have been employed, that of Leibnitz alone
serves both of these purposes; but from            complexity,     well       its                        as

      Ivory, Esq. M.A. F.R.S. &c.”
       I am preparing a treatise on the Theory of the Figure
         S
      of the Earth, I had resolved to take no notice of the ob
jections advanced against the physical conditions I had found
necessary    for the equilibrium of a planet supposed fluid and
homogeneous: the observations in the Bulletin have induced
me to depart a little from the resolution I had adopted.
     Ishall use the symbols C and A to denote, respectively, the
whole mass of the planet, and any interior portion bounded
by a continuous surface.         We shall succeed best in throwing
light on this subject if we begin with estimating the forces that
act upon a molecule of the fluid in the surface of A.                 shall                            I
demonstrate that, when            that      all
                                            implied       the hypothesis
                                                           is                   in
of   the problem        taken into account, there are three distinct
                             is
forces which act      upon   every such molecule; whereas, accord
ing      Clairaut's theory, there are only two
         to                                              the same forces        of
in  action, the third being omitted. But,             may       observed,  it            of be

mentioned; for the force neglected cannot possibly                                                     be      in

rived from the surface of the planet by the same determinate
construction, it only remains to find the figure that will re
concile them with the forces that prevail in the interior of the
fluid.   It will be found that the condition,       0, is indis            R/-
pensably required; which limits the figure of equilibrium to
the elliptical spheroid.
   Whenever the resultant of the forces R and R" is perpen
dicular to the surface of A, that surface will be one of equa
ble pressure. Now there are two ways in which this may
happen: each force may be separately perpendicular to the
surface, as when A is similar to the planet and similarly po
sited about the centre of gravity, which requires the condi
tion R* = 0; or the resultant may be perpendicular to the

 278       Notice   of the Arrival of Twenty-four           Summer   Birds
  have yet been able to ascertain, only to the locality where it
  is evidently upon the increase.               -                        -
     In this situation the males generally arrive about the mid
  dle of April, the females not until ten or fifteen days after
  wards: they commence midification early in May, and the
    oung are excluded about the first or second week in June.
  We have hitherto invariably found their nests in the hole of
  a tree, sometimes at a considerable height, occasionally near
  the surface of the ground, and for two successive years in the
  stump of a felled tree, . In texture and formation the nest is
  very similar to those of the Greater Pettychaps, Blackcap, and
  Whitethroat, being only slightly put together, composed al
  most entirely of small fibrous roots and dried grass, always
 lined with a little hair, and generally a few decayed leaves on
  the outer side, but entirely without moss. Their eggs vary
 in number: we have found their nests with five, six, and now
 and then with seven: their colour a pale green, and so greatly
 resemble the eggs of the Redstart, that it is frequently very
 difficult to distinguish them unless contrasted together: they
 are, however, far from being so elegantly made, of a rounder
 form, and rather less, weighing from 23 to 80 grains.
     The males soon after their arrival, should the weather be at
 all  favourable, will frequently      sitfor     aconsiderable time             on
 the decayed branch         of
                             a tree, constantly repeating their short,
 little varied, although far from unpleasing song, every now
 and then interrupted            by

 passing insect.      Their alarm-note not   is    very unlike the word
 chuck, which they commonly repeat two                  or
                                                       three times when
approached, and which readily leads              their detection. The

manners and habits           the Pied Flycatcher have considerable
                            of
 affinity    to
              those    ofthe Redstart: they arrive about the same
 time, associate together, and often build           the same holes, for
                                                       in
which    they  will sometimes contend. On one occasion we found
a   dead female Redstart         in
                                 the nest    of   Pied Flycatcher con
                                                  a
taining two eggs; and        atanother time, when both these species
had nests within       a few inches    of each other, upon the Red
start’s  being  removed,   the female Redstart took forcible posses
sion    ofthe Flycatcher's nest, incubated the eggs, and brought
up the young.                                                -               -

taken from the nest on the 21st         of last June, and should we

    Grasshopper Warbler.—The Grasshopper Warbler has been
more abundant with us this year than usual; so much so, that
we have been able to procure four specimens, and could have
obtained more without much difficulty.                These consisted of
three males and one female: the plumage of the former nearly
coincided with each other; but the female was entirely desti

    280 Notice of the          Arrival of some      Summer    Birds of Passage.
    Yorkshire, Westmorland, Cumberland, and some parts of
    Scotland.  Dr. Latham, it is true, in the last edition of his
    General History of Birds, has given some account of the nest
    of this   species,the time and period of their incubation, and
    the numbers of their eggs, but does not describe them under
    these circumstances.     We trust the following description, al
    though now written upwards of forty-four years ago, will not
    be altogether uninteresting to our ornithological readers.
       “Some time last summer a nest of the Dottrel was found on
    Skiddaw; the old one was killed and the eggs brought away,
    which were three or four in number.               I
                                            saw three of them; they
    are somewhat   larger than a magpie's egg, the ground is a dirty
    clay colour marked with large irregular black spots.        Fe
    bruary 14, 1785*.”
       Common Tern.—This species does not visit Solway Frith in
    any great numbers, and for some years past has been much
    less numerous than usual. It is there called by the fishermen
    and others, Jerky, Pickman, &c. The Lesser Tern (S. mi
    nuta) rarely visits the Frith, and Allonby is the nearest place
    we have lately received it from.
       The spring of the present year was one of the most backward
    that has occurred in this neighbourhood for very many years.
       During the whole of April and the beginning of May the
    thermometer was frequently below the freezing point, the sur
    rounding mountains more or less covered with snow, and the
    weather in general gloomy, wet, and extremely cold.
        It was not until the 6th of May that the white-thorn (Cra
    taegus oxyacantha) in the hedges began to exhibit any very evi
    dent symptoms of verdure, and the woods were almost entirely
    destitute of their foliage for some time after; in short, the win
    ter might be said to have been protracted, with little or no ex
    aggeration, until nearly the middle of May.
       We have been led to make these remarks, from               being    its
    generally admitted that the early       late appearance
                                                or             the sumof

          My dear Sir,                          -                  Birmingham,        Sept. 1, 1829.

  letter
                     subscribe to the opinion expressed in your
                to me, that“the temperate discussion of scientific
subjects rarely fails to advance the interests of science;” and
I  trust we shall also eventually agree that our correspondence
respecting the oxides of manganese, will form no exception to
the observation.
                                       I
    In the first place, am anxious to explain my reasons for
having doubted the accuracy of your analysis of the Ihlefeld
manganite. Some time after had given you a specimen of       I
the Warwickshire ore of manganese, you informed me by let
ter that it was manganite.        Regarding this as a private com
munication, and more especially as I found that your analysis
differed from mine,                I
                           did not feel at liberty to publish         'al                           it,
though did not hesitate
          I                     adopt some  to   the statements which       of
it contained,          the specific gravity and hardness
                         as   to                                 the mi                        of
neral      question.
          in
    Admitting, nevertheless, the correctness              your opinion,               of
that the Warwick oxide was similar            the Ihlefeld ore, which  to
you had previously analysed and published               account      and           an               of,
finding from repeated experiments, that the former was not
deutoxide       you had stated the latter
                    as                              be,    could hardly      to       I
avoid the inference that    you  had mistaken the nature          both.                        of
I     have now, however, great pleasure           admitting the accu        in

my experiments upon the Warwick ore, had committed any                      I
error in ascertaining the quantity of water, as you seem to think
probable from the nature of my apparatus, this near agreement
 with you as to the proportion yielded by the Ihlefeld manga
 lite, will,            I

               Mr. Bevan           on Measuring the Force                   of Pressure.               285:
pressure, in small spaces, with considerable accuracy,       take.                                 I
the opportunity of offering it to the public through your use
ful publication.
      If
      we take a leaden bullet of any determinate diameter, and
expose it to pressure between plates of harder metal, made
to approach each other in a parallel position, the bullet will
be compressed or flattened on two opposite sides in an equal
degree; provided-the lead is pure, the degree of compression
will indicate the amount of pressure. With a graduated press
of the lever kind, it will be easy to form a scale of pressure
corresponding to the different degrees of compression, until
the ball is reduced to a flat circular plate, of about one-fifth
of an inch in thickness; and it will be found that an ordinary
bullet of about five-eighths of an inch diameter will require a
pressure of near 4000 pounds to effect this degree of flattening.
Suppose, therefore, we wish to measure an actual pressure sup
posed to be nearly twenty tons, we have only occasion to place
ten or twelve of these balls at a proper distance asunder, so as
not to be in contact when expanded, and then to measure by
good callipers, or other suitable means, the compression of
each ball, either by     thickness    its
                                       diameter, and afterwards
                                                             or
add into one sum the    particular   pressure due     each ball,                      to
from the scale first made                          by
                                  using the lever press before
mentioned.                                        -
      By this mode         I       have ascertained the amount                        of   friction      of
an  iron screw press, with rectangular threads,                                                be

three-fourths          to
                four-fifths the power applied; of the actual
pressure has not exceeded four    five tons, when the calcuor
lated pressure,        there had been
                           if                            no
                                                friction, would have been
twenty tons.
   The larger the ball, the greater will                               be
                                                       the pressure neces

         Gentlemen,
HEREN     DER I send you an improved botanical account
   of the genus Kalanchöe of Adanson, to which I have
added one new species from the Royal Gardens of Kew. It
is a very beautiful plant, with deep yellow flowers, and was
sent thither last year from the East Indies by my friend
Dr. Wallich, who is now actually engaged in a very mag
nificent work on Indian plants, in which will be figured                                        all
the more useful and conspicuous species           that interesting     of
country; and towards which the public            large, and more       at
especially the botanists                 of
                                Europe, look forward with the
highest and most eager expectations.

        descriptions    this genus and
                                 of                           its
                                           proper species hereto

                    myself     others,    have re-modelled, and
                                         or

IT     has been remarked by the late Dr. Young, that
   as both the medical and meteorological sciences become founded
                                                                                “in proportion
on a firmer basis, it cannot be doubted that their beneficial effects
will be more and more experienced, as well in the preservation of
health as in the treatment and cure of diseases.”
   The work before us must be regarded as one of the most important
efforts which have as yet been made toward the verification of this
assertion of the philosopher, whose death has so recently deprived
 our country of one of               its
                             brightest ornaments.

to the course to be pursued, and the season at which the journey
is to be taken, has therefore been very frequently experienced by
the patient or his family; and the physician consulted on the
occasion must almost as often have felt that the difficulty was
 transferred rather than removed by the reference to him.—The
reason is obvious.           Few even of our most travelled physicians
have themselves visited a sufficient number of the places usually
resorted to by invalids, or remained at them for a sufficient length
 of time, to enable them to form correct opinions of their com
 parative merits.
     Those who have not travelled, must of course derive their in
 formation on the subject from occasional opportunities of convers
 ing with those who have, and from the incidental, necessarily                                         in
 complete, and often prejudiced remarks scattered through the pages
 of almost innumerable tourists.
     The medical character of particular places, with reference to
  the single point of temperature alone, is under the influence of so
 many causes, that it is notorious that very imperfect notions can
 be formed from the mere consideration of latitude.                     Many tra
 vellers have been careful to note the             height   of the thermometer
 and barometer at different places during the period of their stay;
 but such records, though by no means to be despised, cannot give
  an idea of the thermometric range which forms a most important
  feature in the medical characters of climate.                  A pretty good,
  but somewhat        empirical   mode of     judging     of the character of a
  spot, with respect to climate, consists in the examination of                                        its
  Flora; but there                      so

  from them alone.
     In  the work before us, Dr. Clark has endeavoured first                 point           to
  out the physical characters                     of
                                        the climate       the different places

   The treatise is divided into two parts. In the first part the author
describes the peculiarities of climate in most of the situations
which are likely to be resorted to by British invalids for the benefit
of their health. He commences by a few remarks respecting the
climate of London and          vicinity, and the accidental causes
                                                    its                                                                                by

at first nervous, and then followed by intestinal inflammation.   One
phaenomenon especially remarkable, was the production of an enor

an organic secretion, for the fatty poisoning matters did not contain
any ammonia whatever—Ibid. June 1829.
                BROMIDE OF CARBON, BY M. SERULLAs.
  To form this compound, two parts of bromine are to be added to
one part of periodide of carbon, and just enough solution of potash
is to be added to cause the iodine, set free, to disappear; the liquid
bromide of carbon which will appear at the bottom of the solution, is
to be separated by a funnel or otherwise, but without washing with
water, and allowed to stand until it has become quite clear; during
this time a quantity of iodate of potash, in crystals, will rise to the
surface; the clear fluid beneath is to be withdrawn, and put into a
weak solution of potash, for the purpose of decomposing a little prot
iodide of carbon formed at the same time; a little bromide is also
decomposed, but that which remains is soon left in a pure state.               -
   This bromide very much resembles the protiodide of carbon; they
are both heavier than water, have at first the same appearance under
its  surface, the same ethereal and penetrating odour and sweet taste;
both are liquid, and when washed with solution             potash      remove   of                    to
the impurities, both are colourless.
                                                                                           at at of
   The differences between the bromide and the iodide              carbon are
as  follows: the first becomes solid, hard, and crystalline,        32°Fahr.,
and remains solid                  up
                               43°; the latter remains fluid
                                        to                          the lowest
temperatures. The first when heated               spirit flame, gives red va

pours, the latter violet vapours; neither burns with flame; but the
fluid hydrocarburet            of
                          bromine does burn with flame.        Neither       the                            of
two appears         act upon water, but
                    to                      little alkali added, causes their

            AMMONITES IN CALCEDoNY,                              FROM HAYTOR         2
   We have received from Mr. Shirley Woolmer, of Exeter, two com
munications respecting the occurrence of ammonites in calcedony
from Haytor.     In one specimen, bearing also crystals of quartz
and haytorite (some of the latter of a crimson hue), and “red blis
tered manganese” is stated to be “a yellow ammonite of one-fourth
of an inch in diameter, with three circumvolutions ;” also “six am
monites of two circumvolutions, three of which are very discernible
with a glass; the others are rather obliterated.” Besides these, in a
small round cell is “a black ammonite, with two circumvolutions.”
Mr. Woolmer observes, that “the external character is that of the
Cornu Ammonis, with evident whirls and ridges; similar ones were
discovered by Harenberg in Germany, hardly perceptible except with
a glass; they are very abundant in many specimens I have of Haytor
calcedony. I extracted several of them, but they were so brittle
that they crumbled to pieces on my attempting to try an experiment
upon them : the nearest approach to them is in the 3rd volume of
Parkinson's Organic Remains, plate           fig. 26, 27, 28.  xi.
                                                               These
figures are more distinct, but                 of
                                  the same character.”

   When these acids were mixed, the bottle which contained the
mixture was sprinkled with fine cubic golden yellow-coloured cry
stals  in twelve hours; some          the crystals were hopper-shaped, like
                                           of

and nitrate of silver gave an abundant precipitate in the solution ;
they appeared to be entirely muriate of ammonia. The yellow cry
stals obtained in the first experiment became colourless when heated,
and the colour was probably owing to an excess of hydrocyanic acid :
no gas was evolved when the acids were mixed.
   Sulphuric acid added to the hydrocyanic gave no crystals until the
mixture was heated; by this operation an inflammable gas, pro
bably carburetted hydrogen, was plentifully evolved; the mixture
remained colourless, and on cooling solidified into a colourless cry

by brisk winds, less injury has been sustained by the crops than would
otherwise have occurred.
   The short summer we have had may be properly referred to the first part
of June, and the latter part of July; but we only felt the glow of summer
on two or three days of the former month, and the thermometer in the
shade has only once reached summer heat; viz. on the 3rd of June.
   The gales from the S.W. and W. on the 18th, 19th, 22nd, 23rd, and
27th instant, were scarcely ever felt stronger in this latitude; they were
probably an extension of those tremendous hurricanes that are felt so
powerfully at sea in the West Indies at this season of the year, but blew
with the temperature of a boreas in this country in April. From this un
genial state of the weather the barley is not yet ripe in many places; and
some of the wheat on low and moist lands has no doubt been damaged
before it was housed; yet as the price is falling in the markets, it cannot
have been much injured.
                                                                            -            -
   Considerable atmospherical changes have been indicated throughout the
month, by the sudden elevations and depressions of the mercury in the
barometer; an instrument whose workings, by means of the mutable pres
sure of the atmosphere, may have been consulted with advantage by agri
culturists in so changeable a period.                                 -

THE  problem        determining the deviation of a body from

talents         of
               the greatest mathematicians. Emerson                 this                         in
country, and Laplace          France, have successively considered
                                         in
it,  and given solutions;–the former           his Algebra, problem  in
 198; the latter                in
                      the Bulletin des   Sciences,  No. 75.
    The solutions are obtained          the supposition  on  the earth                      of
being      sphere, which may

    Hence the difference of the effects of centrifugal force in
 the case of the earth being a spheroid instead of a sphere is
 very small. The effect of the centrifugal force at the equator
 being about gºs of that of gravity, it decreases on approach
ing the poles upon the whole, though the direction becomes
 most favourable at 45° for thowing a body towards the poles,
thus making it deviate slightly from a due east course.

     Ifthe heavy body fall an English mile or 5280 feet in the
latitude of London, A will be 289 feet only, and sin A x cos a
 = 0.4872; whence
   d = 2.89 x 0.4872 x 0.0035 = 0.0049 or 0.005 nearly, and
D=    W 8.3521+0.000025 = 2.8900045. Consequently dº has
almost no effect to increase D, while the direction must like
wise be nearly due east, and therefore both these corrections
may in every case be omitted.

Wings not, or scarcely at all, deflexed when at rest; the            in
  ferior with a prominent angle at the posterior margin; the
  underside generally ornamented with lively colours.-Larva,
  with the body tubercular, tapering towards the head, which
  is prominent, rather broad, and depressed.—Pupa follicu
  lated, not subterranean; generally changes in a slight web
  attached to the leaves of plants.
Obs. The preceding long list of synonyms shows sufficiently
  the concurrent opinions of many authors as to the neces
  sity of breaking down this genus into several new ones; and
   M. Treitschke himself seems to admit their accuracy, since
  he has adopted no less than five families or subdivisions to
   receive the species, according to the form of the wings,
   their markings, &c. demonstrating how inefficient, even in
   his own estimation, are the very meagre characters which
   (as above) he has prefixed to the genus.
FAM. A. — Fore wings horizontally extended,—hind wings
   rounded.
FAM. B.-Fore wings extended, hind wings angular.
FAM. C.—All the wings indented.
FAM. D.—Crescent-shaped       markings or maculae on the disc

   wings particularly strong.

  which they have been established; and as we are now en
  tering on the PHALENIDAE, (PHALENITEs, Latr.) we shall
  also in this place insert the characters of that tribe, as given
  in the beautiful and eminently useful work begun by the
  late M. Godart, and, since his death, continued with                                         in

  chel.                   PHALAENIDAE.                            -
This tribe was originally composed of the true Phalaenae, or
  Geometrae, and those species which M. Latreille has since
  separated from them under Laspeyre's genus Platypteryx :
  the following characters apply therefore solely to the
  former.
Wings entire, or without fissures, generally of a slighter tex
 ture, and larger in proportion to the body than those of the
 BoMBYCIDAE      or NoctuiDAE, horizontally extended, or
 scarcely deflexed, when at rest; no orbicular or reniform
 spots (the usual distinguishing markings of the Noctuidae)
 on the upper wings; the lower wings very little folded at
 the internal margin when hid by the upper.—Antennae se
 taceous, sometimes simple" in both sexes, sometimes pecti
 nated or ciliated, in the males.—Lower palpi always cover
  ing the upper, in form pretty constant, often very velvety,
  and very little, or not at                 all
                                  porrected beyond the head.—
  Marillae more    frequently  membranous than horny,          the                    in

Both Treitschke and Duponchel divide the four species of
  which this genus consists into two groups: the first having
  the wings angular (Fam. A. Treitsch.); the second rounded
  (Fam. B. Treitsch.)—Duponchel      states that M. Latreille
  formed this genus, under the name of Metrocampe, two
  years before M. Treitschke gave it that of Ellopia. He

   1.—INVERY observer of occultations must be aware how
              desirable or even necessary it is to know approxi
 mately the times of disappearance and reappearance of a star,
 as also the place on the moon's disk where the lattertakes
                                                                  place;
 in order that the attention may not be weakened by being too
 long on the stretch, or diverted by the uncertainty of the place.
 To me, at least, it has always been necessary to calculate be
 forehand the occultation which I intended to observe, for my
 place of observation.                         I
                             do not find anywhere an explanation of
 the most convenient method of conducting this calculation;

least some           them,-decide, that the portions

which form aether, are altogether independent                  those which               of
produce sulphovinic acid; but the following facts prove                   my                             in

stilled until 117 grains had passed over, consisting of water,
alcohol, and a portion of aether. The residue in the retort
had not undergone any charring effect; and being diluted,
was precipitated by the acetate of lead: the quantity of sul
phate of lead obtained, amounted to 804 grains, indicating
an increase in the quantity of sulphuric acid equivalent to 188
grains of sulphate of lead.                                       -  -
T. 6. A similar mixture of alcohol and           sulphuric   acid,  made
at the time and in the same proportions as the two former,
was then distilled until two hundred grains had been received,
the greater part of which was aether; the uncharred residual
matter in the retort being then diluted, was precipitated by
acetate of lead as before; 986 grains of sulphate of lead were
obtained. This contained nearly two-thirds of the sulphuric
acid first added, and the increase by distillation had been
much more than one-half of that which existed before the ap
plication of heat: so that during the distillation, and simul
taneously with the formation of aether, a quantity of sulpho
vinic acid had been re-converted into sulphuric acid, and the
latter appeared to increase in quantity in proportion to the in
crease of aether in the distilled products.
   7. A similar mixture of alcohol and acid, made at the same
time and in the same proportions as the three former, was then
distilled until two hundred grains had passed over. Two
hundred grains of water were added to the contents of the re
tort; 160 grains were distilled off; a second addition of two
hundred grains of water was made, and the distillation con
tinued: a further addition of five hundred grains of water was
made, and the operation continued until as much product had
been separated as equalled the water added;—the object was
to separate      all
                  the aether and alcohol possible, for the purpose
of  ascertaining                                             sulphovinic

acid into sulphuric could                  be
                                    carried.   No smell       sulphurous
acid was   produced     during   the  operation,  nor did   any charring
of  the contents       of
                       the retort  occur;    when precipitated       ace         by
tate    of
         lead, 1480 grains           sulphate
                                           of              of
                                                    lead were obtained.
This    isvery little short     the 1500 given

 quantity of unaltered acid and alcohol; for in such a mixture
 three-fifths (4) of the sulphuric acid would be converted into
sulphovinic acid by combination with the hydro-carbon of less
than one-third of the alcohol employed.             I next proceeded to
ascertain, whether, when no alcohol was present, aether would
be produced.        A quantity of the sulphovinate of potash was
therefore prepared.          The composition of this salt has been
given in the paper in the Philosophical Transactions before
referred to, and one hundred parts contain 28:84 of potash.
 Five hundred grains were mixed with 150 grains of sulphuric
 acid, being nearly the equivalent of the potash in the salt, and
then heat applied. The experiment therefore may be consi
 dered as the distillation of sulphovinic acid mixed with sul
 phate of potash, which it may be presumed remained inert
during the process, and also with the water of the acid and of
the salt. The proportion of water, it is found, has an import
ant influence; but in the present experiment about a drachm
of fluid distilled over, and left a blackened and acid salt in the
retort, having the smell of sulphurous acid. A few grains of
carbonate of potash being added to the distilled product, abs
tracted a little water: the clear decanted liquor was then mixed
with a little dry muriate of lime, and by agitation separated
into two portions; the upper one being decanted, amounted
to nearly half a drachm, and was found to be pure aether.
This result proves that aether may be formed from a sulpho
vinate or sulphovinic acid when no alcohol is present.
   9. An experiment similar to the last in the nature and pro
portions of the substances used, was made, except that the
sulphovinate was dissolved in            own weight

aether was formed;  but nearly the whole of the original-al
cohol and sulphuric acid were recovered. It may be a ques
tion whether the production of alcohol and aether in those and
similar experiments is altogether determined by the proportion
of water present, or whether the difference of temperature
consequent upon               its
                       variation may not have           effect.                   an

     [For the following narrative of a visit to our country by a
learned German naturalist in 1824, containing the opinions
which he was led to form of some of our Scientific Institutions
and men of science, we are indebted to the 1st Number of a
new and interesting work, The Botanical Miscellany of Pro
fessor Hooker. The narrative was published in the Botanische
2eitung for 1825, and is the substance of a letter, addressed
from London by Dr. Schultes, a Professor of Landshut in
Bohemia, to the celebrated naturalist Count Sternberg.

  which were useless except as paper for specimens, we were
  required nevertheless to pay a tax amounting to thirty florins;
   and this merely because they were in the form of books.
  Much playful argument and some serious remonstrance were
  employed on this occasion; and we at length prevailed on the
  ignorant officer, who could not even read the titles of these
  works, to allow them to remain in his hands, (where they
  would probably be useless except to curl his old red wig withal,)
  by means of which arrangement we escaped the heavy impost,
  but were compelled to take our plants, one by one, out of
  these folios, and to purchase, at a high price, fresh paper in
  Ipswich; thus losing both time and money by the bad inter
  pretation of a worse law. May this our unlucky experience
  serve as a warning for such botanists as shall hereafter travel
  in England, not to dry the plants which they may collect on
  their journey in old books with brass clasps. . .
     We passed up the river Orwell with the tide, to the little
  dull town of Ipswich; admiring in our way the beautiful banks
  which skirted this stream, and which seemed to form one
 grand park.      What particularly struck us here was the deep
 full verdure of the meadows, and the almost black green of
 the trees, shrubs and plants, which grew in the hedges.            We
 have frequently heard censures passed, and even made them
 ourselves, on the intense colours of the figures of plants in the
 Flora Londinensis, and English Botany; but we now plainly
 perceived that our complaint was unfounded, the prevailing
 hue of the vegetation being even of a deeper tone than it is
 represented in those plates. Except Ulex europaeus, Genista
 anglica, and a species of Rubus, (which, though called by                            all

 and kindness which are peculiar to great and well-educated
 men; and which in this truly noble person are heightened by
 such charms of gentleness and affability, as cannot fail to at
 tract to him most forcibly even such individuals as have but
 once enjoyed the privilege of his society. The books of                                   Lin
 naeus, with their margins full of notes in the handwriting of
 the immortal Swede; many valuable MSS. of his, not yet
 published; the Linnaean Herbarium, in the same order and
 even occupying the very cases which had contained it at Upsal,
 (little as the old-fashioned form of these cabinets corresponds
 with the elegant arrangement of Smith's museum); the col
 lection of insects, shells and minerals, which had belonged to
 this second creator of Nature;—all these are arranged and
 preserved by Sir James with a scrupulous care which almost
 borders on a kind of religious veneration. The relics of                                  Mo
 hammed are not enshrined with more devotion in the Kaaba
 at Mecca, than are the collections of Linnaeus in the house of
 Sir J. E. Smith at Norwich. Whilst we bless the Providence
 that has placed these treasures of the Northern Prophet in the
 hands of such a Caliph, from whom (as Sir James, alas ! has no
family) they will pass into the possession of some valued friend
or person who knows how to appreciate and feel their high
 value, and who will respect them as national property,+we, of
the continent, must ever lament that they have fallen to the lot
 of the “toto disjunctos orbe Britannos,” as it                    is,

such herbarium were by the proprietor allowed to be com
pared by an able botanist with that of Linnaeus; we should
then have in that country a faithful copy of the Linnaean Her
barium, which would enable us, in doubtful cases, to deter
mine with precision what it was that the great Swedish natu
ralist had meant by any given species. Without such a com
parison of the larger collections with each other; for example,
that of Berlin with that of Paris, and one or other of these
with the Banksian or Lambertian herbaria, no degree of
certainty can be expected; and from the increase of extensive
private unverified collections, the science must labour under
a heavy disadvantage in the consequent accumulation of sy
nonyms.      If Sieber had identified the plants gathered by him
in Crete and Egypt with many of those previously collected by
Sibthorpe and Desfontaines, much doubt would have been re
moved; and if the late travellers in Brazil, Prince Nieuwied,
 Auguste St. Hilaire, Martius, and Pohl, had compared their
treasures before describing them, many useless synonyms would
never have existed. To travel from one herbarium to another,
and to carry about, in the memory only, the characteristics of
doubtful species, may well be found an almost impracticable
task; and the confusion to which such an attempt is apt to
give rise may be seen exemplified in one of our latest large bo
tanical works. To decide upon plants which we have not seen,
and only know from an erroneous diagnosis or imperfect de
scription, is like a blind man judging of colours:    “Ilfaut voir
dit l’aveugle.”
   Besides the Linnaean herbarium, Sir J. E. Smith has a large
collection of plants of his own formation, which is especially
rich in the productions of New Holland and Nepaul.            The
worthy Professor Wallich at Calcutta, whose health has lately
suffered from an Indian climate, has greatly contributed to
*
wards the latter. The Linnaean specimens, as well as Sir
James's private herbarium, are very well preserved; and after
the old plan, which is now seldom followed on the continent,
they are fastened down on a folio sheet of paper, and washed
over with a solution of corrosive sublimate. Sir James has
also under his care the plants of Sibthorpe, to aid him in the
              of his Flora Graeca, which is now -
                                                     nearly com
 pleted.
     Among the papers of Linnaeus, their present possessor found
 a number of copies of two pamphlets by this illustrious man,
which do not appear to have been ever published. One of
 them bears the title of “C. Linnaei Observationes in Regnum
  Lapidum,” and contains a view of the mineral kingdom, so far
 as it was known at the time of      being printed:
                                   its
                                   -              -  the other is

intitled: “Orbis eruditi Judicium de Caroli Linnaei, M.D.
Scriptis.” Both fill a complete sheet of letter-press. Sir James
was so kind as to give a copy of each to my son and myself,
 with his own signature affixed. The latter of these pamph
lets, sine loco et anno, like the first, appears to be a defence of
this illustrious man extorted from him by some of his envious
and prejudiced contemporaries. But what redounds as much
to the honour as it must have done to the peace of the cau
tious and amiable Linnaeus,                                is,

   The present Professor of Botany at Cambridge, Mr. Thomas
Martyn, having been for many years prevented from lecturing
by illness, confided his office of Professor, in so far as it was
the foundation of Walker, to the most eminent botanist in Eng
land, the President of the Linnaean Society, Sir J. E. Smith.
Most of the members of the University were well pleased with
this choice, inasmuch as it advanced the celebrity of the high
 school at Cambridge.          In compliance with the desire of Mar
 tyn, Smith sacrificed his leisure, went to Cambridge, and there
 proposed to renew the lectures on botany, which for many
 years had been discontinued. But the Pro-rector of this Uni
 versity, Mr. Monk, formally laid an interdict on the Knight
 and President of the Linfibean Society, Sir J. E. Smith, pro

and prettily situated city, and proceeded by way of Newmarket
to                   The coach, like all those which carry the mail
in England, went at too rapid a rate, and the day closed too
early, to allow of our making many observations on the Flora
of the somewhat barren country which lies between Norwich
and Newmarket. We only noticed, from the road, some beau
tiful country seats, and a plantation of Pinus sylvestris, which,
like the other tribes of fir, is a rarity on the plains of England,
not being a native of this country.                               -

can be known by a Catalogue, is already known on the con

here to meet       my   late friend Dr. E. D.     Clarke,    Professor of
 Mineralogy, who once spent an evening with me at Landshut,
on his return from Egypt, and had invited me in return to see
him and his garden at Cambridge.            He knew not that he was
asking me to come and see his effigy, when he gave me the
invitation;–the marble bust which the University has placed
to his honour in the library, is               all

 1600l. Bradley, the earliest botanist who paid exclusive at
 tention to  the succulent plants, was the first Professor          Botany of
at   Cambridge, whom the celebrated Sherard recommended                               to

 as Sir J. E. Smith says, “from 1734 till 1761, when R. Walker
 raised it from a deep slumber. The Professor of Botany had
 neither salary nor student.” Walker provided both; and aided
  Martyn, who transferred his office to his son Thomas Martyn,
 then twenty-six years of age. The latter has been for the last
 three years prevented from lecturing by age and infirmity;
 and in 1818 he transferred his situation, (inasmuch as it re
 lated to Walker's foundation,) to Sir James E. Smith,        But
 Monk, by interdict and proscription, prevented this worthy
 man from performing the duties of the Professorship; and the
 University of Cambridge appears to feel as little as it would
 have done a hundred years ago, that it has for the last six years
 been deprived of instruction in one of the most beautiful and
 useful of sciences.    The care of the garden is committed to
 Mr.   Biggs,  whom we did not find at home. The stoves are
well built, and they may have been hitherto large enough; but
 the progress of the science will soon cause their size to be  in
 sufficient, as they extend only to 216 feet. A building was
 erected some years ago, for the lecture-rooms of the Professors
 of Botany, Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Mechanics. The          Al
pine plants, among which are some rare species from the Scotch
 Highlands, are very properly cultivated in small pots, and
 placed during winter under glass. The assistant-gardener, who
 conducted me through the grounds, was not able to tell me
the annual expenditure of the institution. The work-people      -
 receive two shillings a day.
    The Library of the University contains many rare works;
 but little attention seems to be paid to Natural History: and
 even the collection of Minerals is not considerable, when com
pared with many of our mineral cabinets in Bavaria.
    Our stay in London was extremely short; and we were an
xious to take advantage of one of those clear days which are
so uncommon in England, in order to visit Oxford, which is
 only about fifty-eight miles distant from the metropolis. We
 performed this distance in less than six hours, though at some
 risk of breaking our necks. Sir J. E. Smith had been so obli
 ging as to give us a letter to his friend Dr.Williams, Professor
of Botany and Librarian to the Radcliffe Library at the Uni
versity of Oxford; and through the politeness of this highly
estimable person we obtained a view of the treasures of na
tural history in Oxford, and also of the Radcliffe library and
 hospital.
    The botanical garden at this University is the oldestin Eng
land, having been founded by Henry Lord d'Anvers Earl of
Danby, in 1622, when the first stone was laid of a wall four
teen feet high which still exists, and which it took eleven years
                                                               to

                 Cultivation of Botany in England.            359
to build, at an expense of 5000l. The erection of the gate by
Neklaus Stone, for which Inigo Jones furnished the design,
cost 500l. On either side of the entrance to the garden stands
a statue; one of king Charles the First, and the other of his
son Charles the Second: these were purchased with the amount
of a fine, laid on the celebrated antiquarian Anthony à Wood,
as a punishment for a satire which this good old man had ven
tured to publish in the first edition of the Athenae Oromienses,
against the Earl of Clarendon.      This garden had originally
been the burial-place of the Jews, who lived in great numbers
at Oxford, till the noted banishment and destruction of these
state creditors in the reign of Edward the First, 1290.    It was
afterwards enlarged, and at present includes five acres. This
addition of ground was however but a trifling improvement,
and the danger of inundation to which it is exposed both in
winter and summer still exists. The water frequently stands
knee-deep above the plants; and as the lower parts of the gar
den cannot be sufficiently raised without an immense expense,
these portions are left quite uncultivated. The active gar
dener, who is a Scotchman named Baxter, devotes his atten
tion chiefly to the Cryptogamia; partly from mortification at
finding it impossible to make the garden such as he could
wish.     He is preparing a Flora Cryptogamica of the environs
of Oxford; and he showed us the first number of this work,
containing specimens very neatly laid out, to which we must    in
vite the attention of our countrymen in Germany. Mr. Baxter
also cultivates with zeal the English Willows, having a living
individual of almost every species, in a proper Salicetum. To
 the Grasses, likewise, he gives much attention; and, from the
 experience of several years, he is enabled to decide that Agro
 stis verticillata, vulgaris, decumbens, fasciculata (Curt.), and
 stolonifera, are distinct species; which, when subjected to the
 same culture for a great length of time, still continue to pre
 serve their characteristic marks. This industrious man,—with
 the assistance of three persons, each of whom receives two
 shillings per day,+cultivates between four and five thousand
 species of plants in the wretched houses of this garden, though
 in fact there is only one stove, properly so called, and this is
 much too small. Those which grow in the open air are, like
 the plants of Cambridge, arranged agreeably to the Linnaean
 method, and separated into the indigenous and foreign kinds;
 and both of these are again divided into annual, biennial, and
 perennial, by which the study of the allied species becomes dif
 ficult. They are partly cultivated in beds, partly in separate
  squares; without any view to -the effect which this must na
 turally offer to the eye.               . .      -

ford garden, and which deserves to be also known in Germany.
Linnaeus presented himself at Oxford to Dillenius and Sherard,
being then a very young man, and his system having as yet
made but little noise in the world of science.              The latter re
ceived him with      cordiality;   ; but Dillenius was     very  cool, and
said to  Sherard,     “This is the     young   fellow who is    putting                                all
botanists and botany into confusion.”              Linnaeus did not un
derstand the English language,           which this remark was made,

 by Dillenius       his German accent), the Latin epithet confusio.

He was silent: Sherard and Dillenius walked                  and down            up                    in
the garden with their new acquaintance, and stopped                    wall                 by   a
overgrown with Antirrhinum (Linaria) Cymbalaria;                      plant                  a
upon which they were desirous            have the opinion

as  much doubt had existed respecting                              it.
                                                       Linnaeus removed
these difficulties with his natural perspicuity.          The gentlemen
again pointed           second, and third plant,

uncertain; and again the Swede explained the dubious points
with perfect ease. Dillenius was surprised; and Sherard ob
served     tohim that        could perceive “no confusion

150l. a year for the librarian, and 100l. annually to purchase
new books, and as much more to defray the expense of need
ful repairs. This income would be quite inadequate to cover
the cost of procuring yearly the requisite new publications;
but this desirable object has been attained by an arrangement
with the Bodleian library.       To the latter institution every
author in England is by law compelled to send a copy of his
book; and the Bodleian has agreed to cede to the Radcliffian
library     all

great number             of
                   ferns, we met with nothing more interesting
than what usually occurs with us. At Henley we took stage                                            a

   To become properly acquainted with the botanists and state
of botany       London would require half

are preserved,  are made of the wood of Flindersia australis.
The rich library of this establishment contains many valuable
works, which are wanting to the great universities, academies,
and national collections of the continent. The hall in which
the meetings of the Society are held, struck us as being a far
finer apartment than the House of Commons; and we even
thought this latter very inferior to the House of Commons at
Munich, which is only used every third year; while again the
Hall of Assembly of the Academy at Munich is a mere lum
ber-room compared with that of the Linnaean Society. The
busts of Linnaeus and Banks, and of our countryman Trew,
and the portraits of Solander and Pulteney, ornament this ele
gant apartment. All that we were, unfortunately, able to see
of Sir J. Banks's herbarium and library was from the win
dows of the Linnaean Society's house; for Sir Robert Brown
was gone to Naples, and had taken with him the key of the
Banksian collection *. We were more successful at Count
Lambert's, though with the disappointment of not finding at
home this venerable sage of seventy years, who has made such
sacrifices to botany.   He was at his country-seat of Boyton
in Wiltshire, some eighty miles, we were told, distant from
the capital.    Mr. Don, however, had the key to Lambert's
sanctum; and his goodness afforded us a view of           botanical         its
treasures, accumulated from all parts       the world.  ofThe col

THE  name of Laplace has been heard in every part of the
  world where the sciences are honoured; but his memory
could not receive a more worthy homage than the unanimous
tribute of the admiration and sorrow of that illustrious body
who shared in his labours and in his glory.            He consecrated
his life to the  study  of the  grandest   objects  which can occupy
the human mind.
    The wonders of the heavens,—the lofty questions of
natural philosophy,        the ingenious and profound combina
tions of mathematical analysis,                     -all
                                            the laws of the universe
have been presented to his thoughts during more than sixty
years, and his efforts have been crowned with immortal dis
coveries.
    From the time of his first studies it was remarked that he
possessed a prodigious memory:                              all
                                              the occupations       the                       of

    It was about the same time that Laplace began that long
career which was destined to become so illustrious.
    He waited upon D'Alembert, preceded by numerous re
commendations, which might have been considered as very
powerful.      But his attempts were vain, for he was not even
introduced.       He then addressed to him whose suffrage he
solicited a very remarkable letter on the general principles of
mechanics, of which M. Laplace has frequently quoted to me
different fragments.       It was impossible that a geometer like
D'Alembert could fail to be struck with the singular profound
ness of this composition.         On the same day #. invited the
author of the letter, and thus addressed him:—“You see,
Sir, that        I
               hold recommendations as of very little value;—
you have no occasion for them.             You have made yourself
better known     ;-this   is sufficient for me: You are entitled to
my support.”       In a few days he succeeded in getting Laplace
nominated Professor of Mathematics in the Military School
of Paris. From that moment, devoted wholly to the science
 which he had chosen, he gave to                      all
                                            his labours      fixed direc a

372             Baron Fourier's Historical Eloge of the
Lagrange, and Laplace.     I confine myself at present to the
mere mention of the great geometers  whom the sciences have
lost, and whose researches had for their common object the
perfection of physical astronomy.
    In order to give a just idea of their works, it would be ne—
cessary to compare them; but the limits of a discourse like this
oblige me to reserve a part of this discussion for the collection
of our Memoirs.
    Next to Euler, Lagrange contributed most to the founda
tion of mathematical analysis. In the writings of these two
great geometers it has become a distinct science, the only one
of the mathematical theories of which we can say that it is
completely and rigorously demonstrated. Among                           these                     all
theories,      alone
               it          sufficient for
                               is                            its
                                                own purposes, while                                             it
illustrates        all
                 the rest; and                 necessary
                                                  it   is    so  them, that             to
without      its
              aid they must have remained very imperfect.
    Lagrange was destined               invent andto        extend         theto                      all
sciences of calculation.         In whatever condition fortune had
placed him, whether prince               peasant, or    would have been  he
a  great geometer. This                 he
                                  would have become necessarily and
without any effort—which cannot                  said even    be   the most              of
celebrated individuals who have excelled                this science.    in
    If Lagrange had been the contemporary                 Archimedes and      of
 Conon,        would have divided with them the glory
               he                                                        their                     of

 the foundation of astronomy, but he has added to this science
 capital discoveries of his own which had escaped                       his pre                   all
 decessors.     He has     resolved,    either    by  his own methods                                           or
 by  those     of
               which Euler and Lagrange had pointed out the
 principles, questions the most important, and certainly the
 most difficult of all those which had been considered before
 his time. His perseverance triumphed over every obstacle.
 When his first efforts were not successful, he renewed them
 under the most ingenious and diversified forms.
   In   the motions                of

those which relate to the stability of great phaenomena;        for
no object is more worthy of the meditation of philosophers.
Hence it follows that those causes, either accidental or con
stant, which disturb the equilibrium of the ocean, are subject
to limits which cannot be passed.     The specific gravity of the
sea being much less than that of the solid globe, it follows
that the oscillations of the ocean are always comprehended
between very narrow limits; which would not have happened
if the fluid spread over the globe had been much heavier.
Nature in general keeps in reserve conservative forces which
are always present, and act the instant the disturbance com
mences, and with a force increasing with the necessity of call
ing in their assistance.    This preservative power is found in
every part of the universe. The form of the great planetary
orbits, and their inclinations, vary in the course of ages, but
these changes have their limits.      The principal dimensions
 subsist, and this immense assemblage of celestial bodies oscil
 lates round a mean condition of the system, towards which it
 is always drawn back.      Every thing is arranged for order,
 perpetuity, and harmony.

  Mr. Chairman,—The improvements in the management of mines,

them; have, like                   all

as those difficulties presented themselves in that district                                        at a very
early period.
   Mining, as long as deposits of ore are found in veins at shallow
 depths, and in masses more or less rich, is comparatively easy to
conduct, and the profits would appear to depend as much upon
 chance as upon any systematic plan of operations.                 The know
ledge it required need not be very extensive, and was often
thought to be rather of an empirical than of a more liberal cha
 racter; experience had, however, been acquired by many, and
 was used, as it always must be, with an advantage to the whole
community.        As the ores within reach were exhausted, and the
impediments to following them presented themselves, with which
you are        all
                well acquainted, new acts and more enlarged means
became     requisite;    the expense               of

very became much greater, and the profit that was likely                    re                          to
sult was often determined                   by
                                     the oeconomy used           every part           in                       of
the process. Eighty years ago the mines                 Cornwall were under

     Mining, then, in Cornwall became not so much a matter of
chance as of systematized experience and careful management;
still, however, attended by those uncertainties to which it is pro
verbially liable, which defy the greatest experience and baffle the
soundest judgement in many instances.
     It is no reproach to a country not to adopt new methods before
 they are wanted, as it is also wise to consider and follow them
when circumstances render them applicable.                Most have discovered
 certain practices suited to their own case, and it is absurd to under
 value or discard any thing for the sake of novelty; but we may
 safely take advantage of the experience of others, and no man's
 knowledge extends so far that he may not profit by inquiry and
 observation; and this is perhaps more especially true as to mining:
 What was commenced long ago has been much accelerated and
 systematized in the last 20 years; many abuses have been corrected,
 and public opinion has exerted                 its
                                             influence        this      well

 other things. The improvements that have thus been introduced
                     to be
 may perhaps          divided into two classes, technical and moral: the
 first applying        the direction       the works and the apparatus by

are well established, and admitted in most well conducted mines, and
evinced by the lower rate of wages and greater comparative comfort
 of the labourer. Another improvement of our times may be es
 teemed the mode of purchase and supply of the various stores and
materials which mines require.             Formerly, agents were dealers in
those    articles,  and their emolument was made more to depend on
 the  quantity    of goods they sold, than on their attention to the true
interests of their employers.          The very persons who ought to limit
consumption were thus encouraged to promote                       and       usefulit,             all

and our deep mines must have lain unwrought; and as we must have
depended on foreigners for a supply of some of our metals, so our
manufacture must have dwindled and passed to other countries. A
valuable branch of national industry must have passed from us, and
an industrious and hardy race of workmen must have turned their
labour to other employment, or must have found a subsistence on
other shores. We are struggling now, it is most true, with difficul
ties that threatened the existence of many most important under
takings; and I would ask, what is likely to carry us through these
trying times, if it cannot be done by a well-arranged system of Oeco
nomy.      I would ask, how many mines could exist under such cir
cumstances, if it were not for the aid that this oeconomy can give
 them. A more general diffusion of capital and skill may, it is true,
have conduced to cause a greater production, and therefore for a
time a depression of prices; but as the very depression must en
 courage demand, and will at the same time diminish supply, it may
 be fairly expected that the one will accommodate itself to the other,
so as to leave a fair remuneration in the end, and this may, probably,
 be hastened, if a prudent limitation of produce were attended to,
and which a just oeconomy and well-arranged system may render
 practicable.         I
                    venture to think also, that some progress has been
made in a more equitable adjustment of what may be called the rent
of mines called royalty dues, duty, and so on, in different districts.
Formerly, it was general to fix the same proportion for                    mines,                   all
not distinguishing the circumstances under which mines yielded
their produce. These circumstances differ indeed much more                                                       in
some countries than others, and therefore greater uniformity may

    CoMBUSTIBILITY                 OF CARBON INCREASED                             BY PLATINA AND
                                                   copper.
   The following experiment is due to Waehler:—Rasped        cork is to
 be heated in close vessels with ammonio-muriate of platina, or
 verdigris, when a charcoal will be obtained, which, though it will not
 inflame spontaneously, does so if slightly heated, and then continues
 to burn of itself. The charcoal obtained from cork without these
 additions, does not inflame at so low a temperature, nor continue to
 burn in small masses, if once inflamed and left to itself.
    This effect is analogous to that discovered by Doebereiner, as be
 longing to platina; but as regards copper, a more curious one of the
 same nature is shown very easily by a common green wax taper.
 These tapers are coloured with verdigris, and when burnt, the copper
 of the verdigris is reduced for a time on the wick. If such a taper
 be lighted, and the flame then blown out, leaving the wick glowing,
 combustion of the wax will still proceed, slowly indeed, but for hours
 and days together, until the whole of the wax is burnt, or until the
 combustion has reached some part where it is extinguished by the con
 tact of neighbouring bodies. This does not happen with white tapers,
 and hence they are safer for ordinary uses.—Royal Institute Journal,

bottom of a small glass tube, after having rolled it up, that it may
occupy less space.    When heated the mercury is volatilized and
condenses in the   upper part of the tube, the end of which has been
previously drawn out by the lamp. No such effect is produced if the
whitening has been occasioned by tin.
    M. Orfila concludes, from the above and some other experiments,
that the small apparatus invented by Mr. Smithson cannot be de
pended upon for the detection of small quantities of mercury, unless
metallic mercury be separated from the gold by distillation, as above
mentioned; because solutions which contain no mercury, but merely
a little acid or common salt, produce appearances similar to those
effected by mercury.    M. Orfila nevertheless admits that the appa
ratus may be advantageously used, and will detect very minute quan
tities of mercury, by first treating the whitened gold with muriatic
acid and then subjecting it to distillation.
             ON PHOSPHORIC ACID.-BY M. GAY-LUSSAC.
    M. Englehart has observed that phosphoric acid recently fused and
dissolved in water precipitates albumen; a property which it did not
previously possess, and which it loses after having been kept for some
time in solution. Lately Mr. Clark has discovered that phosphate of
soda exposed to a red heat, acquired new properties. It becomes
less soluble, contains less water of crystallization, changes in form,
and precipitates nitrate of silver white, whilst before calcination it
precipitates it yellow.
    These two observations by M. Englehart and Mr. Clark appear
to possess some analogy; I have made some experiments to verify
                                                                       -
my suspicions.
    I took some liquid phosphoric acid which had been during a long
time in my laboratory, and having ascertained that it did not preci
pitate albumen, I saturated a part of it with carbonate of soda ; the
phosphate which I obtained precipitated nitrate of silver of a yellow
                                                                   -
colour.
    Another portion of the same acid, calcined, and then saturated
with soda, precipitated nitrate of silver white. Lastly, calcined phos
phate of soda was decomposed by acetate of lead, and the phosphate
of lead obtained was decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen. The
phosphoric acid separated precipitated albumen, and combined with
soda it precipitated nitrate of silver white.
    It results from these observations, that the remarkable change of
 properties, observed by Mr. Clark in the calcined phosphate of soda,
 is derived from the same cause which produces the same effect with
 phosphoric acid in similar circumstances. What proves it still further
 is,                     of                        ammonia, made with
                                                   of of
      that phosphate      soda and phosphate
 calcined phosphoric acid, precipitate nitrate     silver white, and that
 common phosphate          potash acquires the same property
                          of                                         by

 tion.   It    remarkable that the modification which phosphoric acid
              is
 undergoes         by
                   heat    much more permanent when
                          is                                      combined

inion  of athe cause    these phaenomena appears

naturally faint by reflection.   The apparent width of the interior iris at                                             its

LXII.   On the Plans, Arrangements and Methods, proposed
   and used by Mr. F. R. Hassler, with a view to an accurate
   Survey of the Coast of the United States. By the Chevalier
   F. W. Bessel, Professor in the University of Königsberg".
  N    1807, Mr. Hassler, then in Philadelphia, was requested,
     on the part of the Government of the United States, to fur
nish a plan for the survey of the whole coast of that country.
This was done in a letter to Mr. Gallatin, which proves great
insight into the nature of such operations. It is evident from
it, that the survey was       have been    work  to great extent,  a                 of
and such       should satisfy the requisites both
                  as                                  geography                            of
and    ofnavigation.
      In
       consequence      this plan, Mr. Hassler went
                                   of                   England                             to

     But Mr. Hassler describes his arrangements and methods
in a paper which has also been printed, as an extract from the
Philosophical Transactions of Philadelphia, which contains so
many new views in relation to instruments, that I believe I shall
make an agreeable communication to the readers of this jour.
mal by an extract from this paper, which has probably not be
come very extensively known (in Germany)".          Mr. Hassler
appears by it as a man who would rather think for himself
than imitate others, and whose arrangements, therefore, al
ways bear an independent character.
   It is to be lamented that circumstances should have oc
curred which hindered the complete execution of the work.
To judge from the contents of the publication, not only com
plete success in reaching the intended object would have been
obtained, but also many other useful results #.
   According to Mr. Hassler’s plan, two observatories were to
be established, one in Washington, and one in New Orleans f:
these were calculated not only for the purposes of the survey,
but also to subserve the general objects of astronomy. Of
the observatory for Washington, the whole plan is given, which
appears to me very appropriate; it recommends itself by a
minute attention to all that can secure the accuracy of the

404     Prof. Bessel's Remarks on                        Mr. Hassler's plan for an
dolite of two feet, not constructed for repetition, appears to me
to possess a peculiarly good construction.               From a hexagonal
centre-piece emanate six horizontal conical arms, whose bases
are three inches, and ends one inch and a half in diameter.
Upon these arms the two-feet horizontal circle is made fast;
three of these cones are longer; these contain at their ends the
screw-work for the stands by which the instrument rests upon
three vertical cones of brass, fastened to the wooden stand of
the instrument; between this and the six horizontal conical
arms there is room for the verification telescope, which has
precisely the arrangement of a transit, and hangs in                         Ys,           its
which are fastened underneath                    two  opposite
                                                             to   radii.   This
telescope has                no

free from eccentricity, from any error arising from the incli
nation of the circle towards the axis, or from any inequality
in the supports of the axis, the readings being besides made
upon twelve different parts of the division. This two-feet theo
dolite is very properly considered as the main instrument for
the survey.     For the other observations, repeating circles of
eighteen inches, repeating theodolites of twelve inches, and re
peating reflecting circles of ten inches diameter, smaller theo
dolites, needles, plane-tables, &c. are provided. To the most
of these instruments Mr. Hassler has given a peculiar con
struction, but it would be too long, and perhaps without figures
not sufficiently intelligible, to give a description of them here.
    As signals Mr. Hassler employed truncated cones of block
tin, about nineteen inches high, seventeen inches diameter at
bottom and fourteen at top; these were erected upon poles
eight feet high, and rendered the best services.       At a distance
of about forty (English) miles they appeared as a luminous
point, when the sun stood so that the rays of it were reflected
towards the observer, which lasted during a sufficient length
of time. At shorter distances the light was so strong, that a
dark glass was often required for the observation. Here the
same principle is made use of which in Mr. Gauss's heliotrope
 produces such a decided effect; but the advantages of the
different arrangements are very unequal, because the cones of
 Mr. Hassler do not constantly reflect an image of the sun to
the observer, while the heliotrope is constantly kept in the
proper position to produce this effect. If the angle of the cone
 is represented by 2 m, then the cosine of half the azimuthal
 angle, when light shall be reflected to the observer, must be
 equal to the sine of half the sun's altitude divided by the sine
 of m. This would take place only during a moment if the
 sun had no diameter, and generally speaking, one signal would
 be invisible, when the other is visible; but as m is only a small
 angle, in the cones used by Mr. Hassler it is only 4° 38', and
 as from the altitude of the sun, on account of the magnitude of
 its disk, two limits may  be   assumed which are        32' distance
                                                         at
 from each other, the azimuthal distance corresponding             to
                                                                  the
 altitudesof   the sun, which admit     of   a reflection     the ob
                                                              to
  server in   a direction nearly horizontal, has        considerable
                                                         a
 magnitude within these limits. Yet        it can have rarely hap
 pened, that both the signals needed for the measurement           of    an
  angle, could have shown                          anequally well re
                             be it at
                                 the same time
 flected  image   ofthe   sun;     seems therefore that the use          of
  these signals might rather       recommended       particular cases
                                                    in
  than generally.    However,    Mr. Hassler   says, that even with
                                                                        Out

out the direct light of the sun, they also rendered good ser
vice, and were visible at great distances”.
   Mr. Hassler has also communicated his methods for the
comparison of the standard measures of length, and the re
sults of their application; we gain by this a new comparison
of the French and English measures, which shall quote more                    I
in particular.    There were three meters present.       One of
iron, which was one of those made by the committee of weights
and measures in Paris 1799, and distributed as authentic
among the foreign deputies; the two others, the one brass, the
other iron, were Lenoir's, but not compared directly with the
original, they therefore were not considered as principal in the
results of comparison. These meters were compared with a
scale of Troughton, of eighty-two inches in length, divided
upon silver to tenths of inches, to which is added a microme
tric apparatus to take off measures from the scale. Instead of
the usual method in comparing a meter d bouts with one d
traits, to place butting pieces with lines drawn near to the end
of them, the distances of which are measured by the micro
scopes when these pieces are laid together, Mr. Hassler em
ployed the end planes themselves; for that purpose he con
structed the butting pieces exactly of the same thickness as
the meters, and obtained, by the close juxtaposition of both,
a line, which presented itself like a division line of the scale.
By means of several experiments (reduced to 32° Fahr. and
adopting the expansion of the iron and the brass, as Mr. Hass
ler determined it by his own experiments, namely between the
point of melting                 ice
                      and the boiling heat    water;)                    of

      The two other copies of meters give less (0.001 inch); but these
were compared both with the scale of Troughton in Ame
rica and that which this artist himself uses in London, and
had upon both very nearly the same length; whence it may
be concluded, that both English scales agreed very nearly.

The extremities of the remaining two were well defined, the
 lines connecting them being also parallel to the horizon.
    The distance from the point of contact of b c and d e to that of
Jºg and h i was about 20°. The radius of the circle b c about 10°.
    The air was rather damp, and the barometer also was                                              in
 constant, varying with great rapidity.

 Castle (one of the    highest   of the Dublin mountains) to the ele
 vation of about 1200 feet above the sea, and 1000 above the
 bottom of a deep valley situated at           base.        its        A

 gloomy twilight        Ientered.         was sinking slowly down the

 vice versä, showing that it was inverted.             When the hole was

 When it was very oblong, and the pin                       perpendicularly

420       Mr. Bevan's Experiments                        on the Modulus                of Torsion.
   To supply this defect, and to furnish the practical engineer
and mechanic with useful data, and with rules for their appli
cation, is the object of the present communication, consisting
of a copious table of the results of my experiments, made at
various times, and upon substances of considerable variety of
dimensions within the ordinary limits of practice.
   It is proper to observe, that the various specimens of wood
upon which my experiments were made, were sound and dry,
except it is otherwise expressed or described, and were in ge
neral free from                all
                      large knots.
   Considerable care was used         obtain correct dimensions of

          near     could  as  wrought       the ordinary means, and

repeated         on

most satisfactory results; viz. from nine           ninety inches

adopted, and as a cylindrical spindle or shaft of ¥th more in

i. e. for a numerator, the square of the radius of the wheel or
leverage multiplied into the length, and this product by the
weight in pounds: and for a divisor, multiply the fourth power
of the side of the square prism by the tabular modulus of tor
sion: divide the former by the latter, and the quotient will be
the deflection or quantity of twisting in inches and decimals
when measured at the end of the radius r. As an example,

     The trial number (as it is technically called), or the rule by
 which the prizes at Greenwich are distributed, is ascertained
 “by taking the difference of the greater and lesser monthly
 “rates of each chronometer, multiplying that difference by 2,
 “ and adding thereto the mean of the monthly extreme varia
 “tions:” and that trial number which, by this process, comes
 out the least, is entitled to the highest prize”.         shall not stop             I

 of the reasoning on which it is founded, as              propriety and            its

scientific principles; such as the cultivation of fruits and ve
getables,   both forced and in the open air; and of flowers,
whether abroad or under glass.           No less than thirty-three
acres of land are destined to the accomplishment of the neces
sary experiments, surrounded by a lofty wall, and again walled
off into partitions.    By this plan, however, the Society appears
to have   intentionally  sacrificed the picturesque. About forty
workmen are kept in this Vineyard of the Lord, who are un
der the superintendence of a very able gardener, Mr. Munro.
At present there are five stoves, two of them built after the
newest plan, with convex windows, which are found to be
highly advantageous.       A very large house is to be erected next
year, and heated by steam.        We of Germany must long want
a great   advantage    which the English possess in their stoves;
namely, the very slender iron frame-work in which the panes
of glass are inclosed, thus uniting durability with the advan
tage of admitting the greatest quantity of light.         The price of
these iron frames in     England,    where  every   thing  is six times
as expensive as with us in Bavaria, amounts to no more than
what we should pay for a frame of wood that would not last
above a year. The Horticultural stoves contain many valuable
plants from China and Sierra Leone; brought by Mr. Don's
brother, who had resided there for some time.            So fine a col
lection of Roses exists no where else; the celebrated Mr. Sa
bine, who is secretary to the Society, having been engaged in
studying this tribe for almost thirty years. They are arranged
in large squares; one might almost say, in small groves of roses,
native and foreign, single and double. On comparing this
garden with those of the ancient universities of Cambridge and
Oxford, one cannot for a moment hesitate in declaring the
superior influence that this must have in benefiting the coun
try; although it has only been formed within these few years,
by the joint exertions of a few private individuals.        The friend
of mankind     contemplates  with  pleasure how much more a well
directed Society of spirited men can effect in ten or twelve
years, with the small sum of about 60,000 florins, raised among
themselves, than has been performed by the two great learned
bodies of the kingdom, with their millions.         Whoever doubts
the influence which the Horticultural Society has produced on
the nation, or who thinks that our ideas of         itsvalue are over
rated, we would advise him                       oftheir sittings, and

  beheld finer    peaches,    nectarines, plums, melons, grapes and
  pine-apples, than we saw here. We had been much disap

severely from the late frosts.                            I

equally wants in the Chelsea Garden. Among the Succulents,
particularly the Aloes, are many that were in the possession
of Miller. Banks has also left here a memento of his youth,
in the invention of an experiment that will outlive him, much
as its success was doubted at first.             Mr. Anderson confirms

    We also visited the garden of the cheerful Haworth, at
 Queen's Elms, near Chelsea, who indefatigably and exclusively
 studies the Succulent Plants, and possesses many extremely
 rare ones.    More than 200 Aloes, 360 Mesembryanthema,
 and 90  Crassulae,   are in his collection. Mr. Haworth seems a
 very communicative and kind-hearted little man: he has the
 happiness already of being a grandfather, though in the prime
 of his age. We had wished to see the respectable Mr. Salis
 bury's garden; but were told that he had sold                and was                               it,

the same privilege of travelling as his own youth had received;
—a Mr. MacGray having been sent as a botanist, in that ves
sel which carried home the remains of the king of the Sand
wich Islands, to the South Seas; and another, Mr. Douglas,
being gone, in a similar capacity, to the Columbia River. A
Mr. Frost, also, has visited America. From Menzies, too, we
learned that Brodie, lieutenant of the county of Nairn and
member of parliament, has lately died.                                   -

436                   Prof. Schultes on the            }
of England, where    the winters are never so severe as to check.
vegetation for any long period, nor the summers so scorching
as to burn up the tender roots; while the frequent fogs and
constantly damp state of the atmosphere morning and evening
are highly favourable to verdure. Were the lawns in our countr
to be mown so often and so close, they would infallibly be soon
burnt up. The opulent Englishman is so partial to a garden,
that if his house should chance to have a northern exposure
where not a ray of sun can reach, he will yet plant it with
evergreen shrubs, as the Iler; and with such flowers as are
found capable of enduring such an aspect.         It is the general
taste that prevails for plants, to which the number of nursery
grounds, and the astonishingly active business that they carry
on, are owing. The success of so many marchands des plantes
continually encourages their increase; and        I
                                                  am told that not
a  year passes  without the establishment of some new institu
tion of this kind. On the way to Hammersmith to see Ken
nedy and Lee's Nursery, we met the proprietors of two others,
Gray and Sons, and Malcolm and Co. at Kensington.               The
house of Lee and    Kennedy,  so well known with us on the con
tinent, has lately experienced great changes.        Mr. Kennedy
has withdrawn from the concern, and is gone to Amiens in
France; and the old Lee died about two months ago. At
present, the sons carry on the management of this large nur
sery, which they themselves say contains one hundred acres,
and requires the labour of from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred workmen. Although this estimate seems to me enor
mously large, yet thus much is certain, that it is one of the
greatest nurseries in London, and carries on an extensive trade
both at home and abroad. The more common kinds of plants
seem to be chiefly cultivated here; although there are three
hundred species of Erica, and half of every day is allotted to
the management of Camellias. The stoves are of the usual
kind: there is no pond for the convenient watering of the
plants; nor have the proprietors published a new Catalogue.
    Mr. Colville, on the road to Chelsea, certainly has the rarer
kinds of plants in his collection.     Messrs. Mackay and Co.,
Fraser, &c. have also gardens in this neighbourhood.            We
here became acquainted with Mr. Sweet, whose publications
on the Gerania and Hortus Suburbanus are well known. Many
unknown and rare vegetables from      allparts     the world, par

extent, the beautiful productions with which it is stocked, or
the judgement, taste, and liberality with which it is conducted,
are most worthy of admiration.            With regard to the latter
point, we will venture to say, that much as we have travelled
and seen, we have met with no stoves, belonging to prince,
king, or emperor, which can compare with those of Messrs.
Loddiges, at Hackney, for the magnificence, convenience and
elegance of their plan, and the value of their contents. Let
my reader imagine a dome, eighty feet long and forty feet
high, built in the form of a paraboloid, purely of glass, kept
together by a delicate but strong frame of small iron ribs. This
dome is heated by steam, when the rays of the sun are found

 a manner as useless as it is mean; and this too, when the gar
 dens of the other Universities of Germany have been lately
 doubled and trebled in extent.       As President of the Botanical
 Garden at Landshut, it becomes me thus publicly to declare
 this matter, in order that the disgrace which must accrue to
 the University, which is so far behind her German sisters, may
 not fall upon me, but on those who, contrary to the wishes of
 those wise promoters of good, the Bavarian government,-
 have brought this stain upon Landshut, and whose names will
 be pronounced by posterity with the contempt they deserve.
 Let us only consider what a multitude of people are employed
 and maintained in London alone by these nurseries: not in
 labouring the ground and tending the plants only, but in
 making the millions of pots, of which the smallest costs a half
penny (a groschen of our money); in manufacturing the im
mense quantity of glass which is used; in executing the smiths'
and carpenters’ work;—and it must then be readily confessed,
 that the improvement of a people has attained a high pitch,
when the most pure, noble, and innocent kind of pleasure and
 taste, namely the enjoyment of the beauties of vegetation, has
become a necessary; and thereby bestows food, clothing, and
comfort on thousands of individuals, who must otherwise be
a burthen to society. The nurserymen of London, from their
great business, several of which annually return half a million,
are obliged to have counting-houses of their own. Many of
them keep travelling botanists in their pay, who from the most
remote parts of the globe must send them seeds, roots, and
living plants. In China, the East Indies, the Cape of Good
Hope, at Sierra Leone, New Holland, New Zealand, Para
guay, Chili, Mexico, and the most northern parts of America
and Siberia, many of these enterprising individuals have collec
tors; so that Geography is often improved by the trade of
horticulture.     How reprehensible therefore is the conduct of
those   who,  -instead of promoting the culture of gardens and
the love of plants, by which, according to the immortal Bacon,
the mind and heart are alike improved,—endeavour to sup
press and stifle    allindustry; and whilst they instruct youth
in  such detestable maxims,         that “sin alone

many hundred English citizens (!), who for almost half a

which they might have starved. He has the felicity of seeing
two of his sons grown up, and very much like him; and grand

  I can also  give you a piece of botanical intelligence from
Paris.  The celebrated Baron Bory de St. Vincent will in the
course of this year proceed to the Antilles; there to examine
that favourite tribe, the Ferns, of which he already possesses
a very complete collection.   He expects to be able to elucidate
all the points which Plumier left doubtful.     From the well
known   liberality of mind which this enlightened naturalist pos
sesses, I should hope that it would be as agreeable to him as
to our Germans who are partial to the Ferns, to have this                          in
formation communicated in these pages; and, whether before
or after his voyage has taken place, to see them thus placed in
connection will confer much pleasure on

temporary utility, would be to assume a more intimate ac
quaintance with the earth's crust than we possess. Our know
ledge of this structure is in reality but small, and principally
confined to certain portions of Europe; and even in many of
these portions we are continually presented with new views
and a detail of newly-discovered phaenomena by able observers,
which so modify our previously received opinions as in many
instances almost to amount to a change of them.          Still, how
ever, a large mass of information has been gradually collected,
           <U+017F>º
particularly as respects this quarter of the world, tending to
certain           and important conclusions; among which the
principal are, that rocks may be divided into two great classes,
thestratified and the unstratified;—that of the former some con
tain organic remains, and others do not;-and that the non
fossiliferous stratified rocks, as a mass, occupy an inferior place
to the fossiliferous + strata, also taken as a mass. The next
important conclusion             is,
                            that among the stratified fossiliferous
                                     superposition, marked       pe           by

 the epoch of the Exeter Red Conglomerate (Rothe Todte
 Liegende), resulting from a great derangement in the pre
 viously existing rocks, and the grinding and rounding of de
 tached portions of them into gravels, which when comparative
 tranquillity was restored, were deposited in horizontal beds on
 the disturbed strata. Yet able observers assert, that there is
an occasional passage of these rocks into the coal-measures,
 upon which they so commonly rest in an unconformable man
ner. We have now so many instances of great differences in
the mineralogical structure of the same formations, either ori
ginal or consequent on disturbance, that such structure is no
longer a character of importance; and it yet remains to be
 seen how many of the strata supposed to belong to the primi
tive class are altered rocks.
    M. Brongniart's division into “Sediment Rocks” would be
both natural and useful were it certain where such rocks com:
menced, and that all those necessarily included in the class
were so formed. This division has been much used in France
of late, and would appear infinitely superior to the terms se
condary and tertiary.
    In offering the annexed sketch of a classification of European
rocks to the attention of the reader, it is merely my intention
to show that divisions can be made for practical purposes, inde
pendent of the theoretical terms primitive, transition, secon
dary and tertiary; terms which not being founded on an en
larged view of nature, but grounded on peculiar views, now
doubted, there would appear no good reason for preserving.
It is not presumed that this classification will be adopted, and
I  am well aware that many just objections can be made to
                                                                                   it;

444      Mr. De la Beche's        Sketch   of a Classification
    STRATIFIED Rocks.       –Group 1. (Alluvial) seems at first
sight natural and easily determined; but in practice it is often
very difficult to say where it commences.       When we take
into consideration the great depth of many ravines and
gorges which appear to originate in the cutting power of ex
isting rivers, the cliffs even of the hardest rocks which more
or less bound any extent of coast, and the immense accumu
lations of comparatively modern land, as for instance, those
 great flats on the western side of South America, there is a
difficulty in referring these phaenomena to the duration of a
comparatively short period of time.      Geologically speaking,
the epoch is recent; but, according to our general ideas of time,
it appears to be one that reaches back far beyond the dates
 usually assigned to the present order of things. Man and
the monkey tribe seem to be the most marked new creation of
 this epoch. I would by no means be supposed to deny that they
 may not have previously existed, but at present the mass of
 evidence is against their prior appearance. There seems,
 indeed, no good reason why man and the monkeys should not
 have lived as well as the bears and hyaenas at periods ante
 cedent to this epoch; but until the remains of the two former
 be found in rocks proved to be formed previous to this period,
 it cannot be affirmed that they did”. The animals now existing,
 considered as a mass, appear to differ specifically from those
 whose remains are found entombed in the various rocks,
gravels, clays, &c. formed previously to the existing order of
things.    There are indeed a few exceptions to this observa
tion, but the body of evidence seems to render a new creation
presumable.
   Group 2. (Diluvial) comprises those gravels so commonly oc
curring in situations where actual causes could not have placed
them, but where, on the contrary, such causes tend to destroy
them. The most extraordinary feature of this group is the
distribution of those enormous blocks or boulders found so
singularly perched on mountains, or scattered over plains far
distant from the rocks from whence they appear to have been
broken.     Many valleys appear to have been scooped out of
horizontal or nearly horizontal strata at this epoch; the force
which excavated them having acted often upon strata shat
  * Should     such observations as those lately made on the caverns of the
department     of the Gard by M. de Christol (Annales des Mines 1829) be
multiplied, and should it be always shown that human bones and pottery
are, as is stated to be the case, in these caverns, really of the same date as
the hyaena's bones, dung, &c. with which they are mixed,       we can scarcely
refuse to admit that man existed previous to the alluvial epoch; sup
posing it in all  cases proved that these cavern remains areof   the same date
 asthose considered  of   the diluvial period.
                                                                       tered

tered and broken into faults. Of course a general modifica
tion of the previously existing forms of mountain and valley
must have taken place, if we are to consider the catastrophe
general. . Much information is yet wanting respecting this
group, which it is hoped those observers who have been more
especially occupied with                  it,
                                    will soon afford us.            -

to  the existing order               of

   Group 5. (Oolitic) comprises the various members of the
oolite or Jura limestone formation, including lias. The term
oolitic has been retained upon the same principle as that of
cretaceous: in point of fact even in England and the North of
France the oolites, properly so called, form but an insignificant
part of the mass of rocks known by the name of the oolite for
mation; this character is also not confined to the rocks in ques
tion, but is common to many others. In the Alps and Italy
the oolite formation is replaced by dark and compact marble
limestones, so that                      its

  General Observations.—The weather this month has been mostly fine,
with occasional showers, which were often accompanied by heavy gales of
wind. On the 3rd instant, the last flight of swallows departed for a warmer
climate.   In the evenings of the 6th and 15th lunar halos appeared, and
were followed by rain and wind.
   On the mornings of the 7th, 8th, and 9th, ice appeared on the ground
the first time this autumn, and the days were unusually cold : the maxi
mum temperatrue of the 8th did not exceed 48 degrees, and light showers
of snow were seen at Horndean, and in other parts of Hampshire. The
mean temperatnre of this day and night is about equal to the mean of
Christmas-day and night for the last fourteen years
   On the 25th a fine coloured parhelion appeared on the northern side of
the sun, with a faint solar halo.   In the afternoon of the 30th two winds
crossed each other from North and West, when the clouds between them
showed an electrical appearance, and lightning emanated from them in the
evening.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month, is two and a quar
ter degrees less than the mean of October for many years past.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are, one parhelion, one solar and two lunar halos,
five meteors, and thirteen gales of wind, or days on which they have pre
vailed; namely, three from the North, one from the North-east, six from
the South-west, one from the West, and two from the North-west.
