and make for themselves internal channels, thus creating a dis
jointing of the earth and strata.      These channels, during the
summer, or in frosty weather, become dry; but on heavy rain
or thaw occurring, they become again filled and widened, and
the portion thus severed from the surrounding earth, falls when
it is least expected, from external symptoms.
   In this month (August 1851) a portion which projected like
a buttress from the face of the cliff as much as 15 feet, and which
was about 50 feet in length, fell, displacing the lower or under
cliff, and the shingle and sand for some 150 yards.       The masses
which fall from    above, act as   wedges,  and force  up  the under
part of the strata many feet higher than their original position.
    Mr. Prestwich, in his most admirable and valuable paper,
hardly notices the freshwater strata of Hordwell.       People go to
Alum     Bay, remain there for   weeks, may   months,  examining  the
whole of the series of strata so beautifully developed there and
at Headon Hill. These have been repeatedly figured and de
scribed, but      I
                 am not aware of any figured section of Hordwell
having yet appeared.
    Having so long resided in these parts,                     I
                                                 have devoted a very
large portion of time and attention to the study of these strata
and their contents (of which                   I
                                     have a very large collection);

    They are very level; the only striking exception occurs at Mead
End, where the lowest of this series rises, and where there is a
sudden dip in the 16th and part of the 15th and 17th strata.
The under part of this dip in the 17th stratum is filled up by a
very bright green clay, filled with veins of the dark-coloured clay
above, and containing the same shells.          I was particularly for
tunate in    finding  this  portion  of the cliff uncovered in a way
which had not occurred for four or five years.        The sea on this
coast, sometimes for a week or ten days together, sets in to one
particular spot on shore, that it may not have touched for years,
and washes away shingle and cliff for many yards.
    It is difficult to account for this, unless it be that the shifting
of the enormous bed of shingle in the middle of the channel
between this coast and the Isle of Wight alters the direction of
the under currents, which are very strong, as well as the tide on
this coast.
    As it would be difficult for strangers to find the exact spot
where these beds crop up and where they disappear, I will merely
remark that the whole that are described here, occur within a
distance of 2 miles from their commencement, to Mead End about
a quarter of a mile further than Hordwell House (Dr.Chambers').
I  have not carried my description further, as these constitute pro
perly the Hordwell or freshwater series.         I have divided them
according to the different character of the deposits and their
contents.
    Stratum 1 varies from 6 to 8 feet in depth.         It is composed
of grayish sand in bands with a yellow sand tinged with iron.
It does not dip quite so much as the others, and runs perhaps a
trifle further.
    The upper and principal part of the bed is entirely barren in
fossils; but about half a mile from the spot where this stratum
crops up, a small band of about 4 inches of dark-coloured
 clay appears at the top nearly of the bed, which contains many
remains, though generally much compressed and in a very brittle
 state.   Small jaws of Rodents, portions of the carapace and
plastron of Emys, teeth, and occasionally many broken bones of
 Crocodiles, vertebrae of Serpents, and rarely the teeth and bones
of Mammals, are found here. Remains of Trionyx, so common
 in the lower beds, are not met with in this. Beneath this band
 is an imperfectly formed limestone band, about 5 or 10 inches
 in depth, consisting of crushed Limnea and Paludinae.              The
 whole of these narrow bands run for about 300         yards,  and then
 disappear.     They are generally so entirely covered by the sands
 of the upper part, that unless dug for, they cannot be found.
 They are easily worked, but the larger bones and teeth are
 always in a very brittle, bad state. Just before the commence

on exposure to the air it becomes friable and quickly falls into
pleCeS.
           9 is about 6 feet in thickness. It commences with a
     Stratum
very narrow band    of lignite; after which is a band of clay, green
mottled with  iron,  through the base of which passes a band of
ironstones of about 10 inches in thickness which project from
the cliff.     Under this band appears occasionally a narrow seam
of   limestone,  succeeded by a narrow band of green clay, con
  taining Paludinae and Potamomya very much crushed.               No
 other remains or shells are found here. There is an idea prevalent
 that the ironstones which run through this bed are the result of
 exposure to the atmosphere.     This is utterly fallacious; I myself
 have seen this layer of ironstone uncovered in a horizontal direc
 tion for 8 feet beneath the surface, finding them there in the
 condition precisely as at their first appearance on the face of the
 cliff. Generally they occur in a regular line, extending hori
 zontally in large masses of many feet, but sometimes they are
 replaced by the clay.
     Stratum 10 averages from 8 to 9 feet.   It consists of fine white
  sand traversed with bands of gray marl. The centre of the bed is
 nearly pure white sand.     The gray seams of marl prevail at the
 top and at the base, which consists of them principally, and
 which is about 2 or 3 feet in depth.
     The whole of this stratum contains seams of Limnea, Po
 tamides, and Melania; but the lower part contains beds, barely
 an inch apart, of Potamomya angulata, with innumerable seeds
 of Chara and Serpula tenuis (found only in this stratum),
 which flake off in large masses after any portion of the stratum
 has fallen. About 3 feet from the top is where the animal
 remains are principally to be met with, immediately under the
 gray bands which traverse the upper part of the bed. Asso
 ciated with them are Potamides, Planorbis euomphalus, Limnea,
 Potamomya, Dreissena Brardii, and Paludina lenta.           This and
 strata 5 and 11 are the    only  beds where the first mention of
 these shells is found, except very sparingly, and stratum 10 is
 the only one where they are found in any abundance.             They
 invariably accompany animal remains, and whenever they are
 found we know bones are near. The sand immediately sur
 rounding the bones becomes of a greenish, dirty, clayey nature,
 giving evidence of decomposed animal matter.           It is rare to
find these remains near the commencement or end of the bed.
The middle, a little to the west of Hordwell House (Dr. Cham
bers's), is the locality which I have found the most productive.

is so much occupied, that many of the species found here are
undescribed; I can only give a general idea therefore of           its

a new Emys, which I have recently discovered and restored to a
nearly perfect state, having plastron and carapace entire, which
is undescribed and unfigured.

foot to eighteen inches in depth, and extending in triangular
masses of 4 to 5 feet in a horizontal direction.  It is not con
tinuous; sometimes several feet will occur without the stones,
which are replaced by the same green clay as immediately above.
 From these to the base of this stratum are dirty green clays,
mottled with iron; immediately under the ironstone is a
small layer of white sand, which contains much the same bones
as are found in the small band of crushed shells lying imme
diately above them,--Trionyx, Emys, Crocodile teeth, Serpents’
vertebrae, Birds and Fish bones.    No large Mammalian bones are
found here.     Potamomya    and Paludinae are found with them.
A small band of lignite runs through the clay about 8 inches
after this band.    The clays underneath are full of crushed layers
of  Potamomya,   with which are found in a very rotten state, pieces
of Trionyx and Emys : crystals of selenite are met with in this
bed only.
   Stratum 16 is the first of the fluvio-marine series.    It varies
from 4 to 5 feet in  depth, and commences with a band of lignite
so lightly carbonized that it burns like coal.   The depth of this
is about 18 inches. This is succeeded    by a stratum of very dark
mottled   green  and  gray  clay, about 2 or 3 feet in thickness.
Then there is another narrow band of lignite of about 4
inches, and under that, 4 to 6 inches of the same clay as
above.     These clays contain immense numbers of Potamomya
much crushed with other shells.             The Neritina is only found
here and in stratum 17, as well as in stratum 2, or the upper
marine. No vertebrate remains whatever are found here. The
whole of this stratum (and the lower part of stratum 15) makes
a sudden dip near                   its
                           commencement.           The green clay which

same shells      the clay above.

                          stated before, when the chlorate is in
great excess, and therefore enables us to determine the pre
sence or not of that salt by other means before applying the test
for nitric acid.
   As to the case of hypochlorous acid, that acid also requires to
be in considerable excess in order to form a nitroprusside; and
as hypochlorous acid is endowed with such marked chemical
properties, there is little fear of any mistake occurring from that

 cularly of the cirrus and cirrostratus types, are submitted to the
 consideration of meteorologists, in the hope that the various
 points of inquiry involved will receive a more general and system
 atic attention than they have hitherto obtained.   A highly inter
 esting connexion has been recently discovered between the varia
tions of the solar spots and those of the terrestrial magnetic
forces.   The latter have been long known to be influenced by
the aurora, and this phaenomenon now appears to have the power
of affecting in a very decided manner many of the meteorological
processes of our atmosphere.      A most interesting field for obser
vation is thus  opened  up, the investigation of which promises to
lead to                very important results.

   Although                   I
                 have taken very many observations with a view to
the determination of this point, yet from the want of comparable
notes, a satisfactory result has only in one instance (that of the
auroral arch of March 22, 1841) been attained.      This arch was
observed at Durham by Prof. Chevallier, at York by Prof. Phil
lips, and at Belfast by Prof. Stavelly. From the comparison of
the York and Durham observations, Prof. Chevallier deduced a
height of 156.6 miles, and from that of Belfast and York 1573
miles.   From a subsequent comparison with Prof. Chevallier of
his observations at Durham with mine at Dunse, the height of
the arch appeared to be about 160 miles.     The close agreement
of these results is (when the nature of the subject is considered)
very satisfactory.
   From observations made by Mr. Brown, at Arbroath, and by
myself here, on the aurora of February 11, 1842,       deduced a                                                                                    I
height of 63 miles above the earth's surface; but from the im
perfect definition of the auroral mass observed on this occasion,
there is considerable uncertainty as to the correctness of this
result, though probably not far from the truth.
   I need scarcely add my confirmatory testimony with regard to
the relation of auroral phaenomena to the magnetic meridian, &c.,
and their connexion with “magnetic storms,”—points now most
satisfactorily                established.

                               Ill. Cºst-::i-
    These clouds resemble cirri in their tendeney to an arrange
ment in long parallel bands; they differ, however, from them in
not being composed of ice-crystals.             They appear very frequently
as concomitants of the aurora, so much so as to leave no doubt
of a connecting influence between them and that phaenomenon.
They also prevail in dry, windy weather, occupying a stratum in
the atmosphere above that in motion.                    I have frequently ob
 served  during    a sale from    S.W.,   errostratus bands extending in
 a N.W. to S.E.      direction,   and movins from S.W. so slowly that
 it required some time to determine whether they moved at all,
 whilst immediately under them light cumuli were flying at a
 tremendous rate.        The cirrestratus condition of cloud appears
to be induced        upon    masses of vapour, by the influence of the
electricity developed by the friction of currents of dry air. On
one occasion, a few years aso, upon a susty, showery day,                    I ob
served that when the wind fell, the cirrostratus clouds overhead
immediately became hazy and ill-defined, passing into the nimbus
type, and rain followed.           This continued until the wind again

     appears to subsist between  it and the Formation  of Clouds.   27
rose, when the rain ceased and the clouds resumed the cirro
stratus character.       This interesting phaenomenon was repeated
several times.       Cirrostrati as well as cirri exhibit very decided
luminosity at night.          I have often observed the luminosity
between the dark cirrostratus bands nearly equal to that of a
faint aurora. When the sky is clear during a very high wind, a
faint diffused luminosity has been often observed covering the
whole sky. The light given out on such occasions is often very
considerable.       A friend of mine, who was on board a vessel in
the    Mersey   during  the memorable storm of the 6–7 January 1839,
informs me that he was much struck by the distinctness             with
which objects were visible during that night.
        IV.  Connevion   of the Aurora with Cirri and Cirrostrati.
      The cirrus and cirrostratus modifications of cloud have been
frequently observed as accompaniments of the aurora.           The fol
 lowing extracts from my journal, referring to some of the more
 striking examples of the effect of the aurora on clouds of these
 types, as well as to certain allied phaenomena, will perhaps be of
 some interest.
      “1840. July 15, 11" P.M. A beautiful luminous appearance
 in N. and N.E. arising from cirri in that direction. Light very
 uniform, and as vivid as that of an average aurora.           It had a
  sort of phosphorescent appearance,
      “Aug. 19. Cirrous bands N. to S., moving briskly from W.
  It was    very interesting to see the alternating bands keep distinct
  without mingling, although impelled by a considerable current.
  The bands seemed to act upon each other with a repulsive force.
      “ Sept. 5, 9" P.M. Clear. Some streaky semi-luminous
  masses of vapour resembling cirri scattered over the sky, and
  rendered luminous at intervals by rapid pulsations traversing
  them instantaneously and showing their full extent and forms.
  No aurora visible at the time. Next morning, at 7”, the sky was
  covered by cirri extending in lines from N.N.W. to S.S.E., and
  moving slowly from W.S.W.          A fine 47° halo surrounded the
  sun for three or four hours.,
      “Sept. 21, 9 A.M. Pennated cirri, the principal bands ranging
   N. to S., and the fibres N.N.W. to S.S.E.
       “1841. Jan. 28, 11h 30” P.M. Wind blowing in gusts from
   N.W.       From the N.N.W. point, dark continuous cirrous bands
  extended across the sky to S.S.E., Between the bands through
   out their whole extent a very decided luminosity prevailed, of a
   fine deep yellow tint, like that of the aurora.       The luminous
   bands did not, however, show any tendency to converge to the
   coronal point, which the streamers of the aurora always do, but

 28   Mr. W. Stevenson     on the Aurora, and the connexion which
kept distinctly separate to near the S.S.E. point. The light was
 strongest between the dark rays in N.N.W., but was very distinct
throughout the whole extent of the bands. The absence of
moonlight rendered the phaenomenon much more striking and
unequivocal.
    “March 14, 10 P.M. A splendid display of luminous cirri
or cirrostrati ? From the N.N.W. point proceeded dark lines or
bands, which extended across the sky and appeared to converge
to the S.S.E. point. These were apparently at a much inferior.
altitude than that of true cirri. They sometimes appeared to
shoot suddenly over a large arc of the sky.       Between them a
very distinct luminosity was apparent, which from the N.N.W.
point, up to nearly 45°, equalled in brightness that of an ordinary
aurora; it was, however, very decided even to the S.S.E. point,
but no alteration was observable at the ordinary point of appa
rent convergence of auroral beams (or that to which the dipping
needle points).   The air was still, with the exception of a few
light puffs from W.S.W. Occasionally black streaks appeared
to shoot from the N.N.W. point, contrasting very strongly with
the luminous ground on which they seemed projected, and then
as suddenly became so faintly marked as to be almost impercep
tible. The light emitted by this phaenomenon was very con
siderable, and exactly resembled the pale greenish light of phos
phorescent   substances.            -
   “April    20, 7 P.M. Cirri moving from about N. or N.N.W.,
 direction of the bands W.S.W. to E.N.E., or at right angles to
 that of their motion. The electric state of the atmosphere has
 evidently been disturbed for some days.                *
    “June 6, 11 A.M. Cirri and cirrocumuli moving rapidly
from N.N.W. The cirrous fibres very distinct, ranging W. to
 E., or nearly at right angles to the line of motion. At 1º 30m
 P.M., the wind being brisk from N.W., the cirri presented a
 curious appearance, some of the bands ranging N.N.W. to S.S.E.,
crossed by others from W. to E., and passing downwards into
cirrocumuli.     The changes of form of the cirri at this time were
very rapid.                                                          -
    “July 18, 1* P.M. Cirri exhibiting a most beautiful dendri
form appearance, resembling the fantastic figures seen on glass
during frost.                                               -
    “July 30, 12" P.M. Cirrostrati affected by luminous pulsa
tions.                -
   “August 6, 10° 30” P.M. A very instructive exhibition of
cirrostrati in connexion with the aurora. A dense mass of
straw-yellow light formed an arch with     its  apex about 30° above
the  N.N.W.,   point,   hazy and ill-defined, and partly hidby some
cirrostrati, showing quite black upon the luminous ground and

      appears to subsist between                it and the Formation of Clouds.                    29
 banded in a       W.N.W.             to   E.S.E. direction.      At 11h 30m the arch
was divided into two by a process in the                          N.N.W., the apex of
the larger being N. and of the other N.W.           This process at
length moved upwards and to E., so that the western arch was
in turn the larger.  After this the arches united, forming a single
arch, which was again divided by a similar process moving from W.
At 12h the altitude of the under or inside of the arch was about
15° or 16°.    A most remarkable circumstance was, that some
cirrostrati kept constantly in the same position, sometimes
fading into a light fleecy aspect, and again becoming better
defined as the aurora brightened.   A small dense cirrostratus
cloud in particular remained almost invariably in a position
about 16° above the N.N.W. point.      At Oh 40m A.M. a seud
came over from             W., and the aurora immediately
                                                      became more
active, shooting           its
                     rays into the clear space within the arch, and
also upwards      the coronal point. The auroral rays now began
 to move,     as
                   it to   procession, from W.
                                  in                                     to   E.   in
                  were                                     alternate
light and dark bars, and the cirrostrati,         portion      them,

30     Mr. W. Stevenson on   the  Aurora, and the    conneacion which
    “September 11, 8" A.M.    Cirri passing into cirrocumuli extend
ing in broad fleecy bands from S.S.W. to N.N.E.            These were
crossed at right angles by fine, straight, parallel fibres, and also
by parallel undulating bars ranging W.N.W. to E.S.E.               The
bars were short and   arranged   in fasciculi, a considerable number
being included in each bundle. The motion of the whole was
pretty brisk from S.S.W., or at right angles to the direction of
the fibres and bars.
    “September 25. (During the day some very curious irregu
larities had been observed with regard to the upper clouds.)
11" 30" P.M. Aurora flashing up to the coronal point with extra
ordinary rapidity.   A bank of cirrostrati remained motionless
along the horizon from W. by N. to E., extending upwards a
few degrees.    The corona was well-defined, and luminous sheets
undulated up to it from the horizon with great rapidity.           The
length of the undulations lay nearly W. to E., convex towards the
corona and concave towards the horizon.             Two arches then
formed, the apex of one bearing W.N.W., and that of the other
N.N.E.; the latter was the brighter, and sent a constant undu
lating stream up to the corona.       The cirrostrati next began to
movetoeastward, and with them the whole apparatus of the aurora,
which had a very striking effect, the bright luminosity of the
aurora contrasting strangely with the deep black of the cirro
strati, on which it seemed to sail majestically onward.        12" P.M.
Sky overcast, a broad dark cirrostratus band stretching from W.
to E., with patches of the same form of cloud scattered over the
sky. Auroral luminosity with faint sheets and streamers in
N.N.E. In W.N.W., a few degrees above the horizon, was a
fixed auroral luminosity.    The cirrostrati in several parts of the
sky, especially in N.W., adorned with luminous fringes or tufts.
Light airs from W. Next morning the sky was covered by cirri
ranging N. to S.–N.B. A notable ‘magnetic storm’ accom
panied this auroral display.
   “November 5, 2h P.M. Fleecy cirri moving briskly from about
N.W., under current from S.E., driving before it masses of
cumulostrati.     10 P.M. Hazy aurora in N.N.W., cirrostrati
moving briskly from S.W.       Aurora affected by undulatory pul
sations from the horizon to the zenith, which appeared to influ
ence the movements of the cirrostrati, which were fitful and
disturbed. These clouds were in some instances streaky, but
generally amorphous.      There were one or two faint streamers in
N.N.W., from which point some luminous streaks extended,
becoming fainter and narrower towards the south, without any
appearance  of coronal convergence.
   “November 11, P.M. Cirri irregular, twisted, and passing into
cirrocumuli, moving very rapidly from W. 10 P.M. Clear and

    appears to subsist between   it and the Formation     of Clouds.     31
frosty, with dark cirri or cirrostrati upon a hazy but decidedly
luminous ground, extending from W.S.W. to E.N.E. These
covered the sky to an elevation of about 30° above the N.N.W.
point, and were affected by very rapid pulsations, propagated
apparently in a W. to E. direction.              A similar appearance,
though not so distinctly marked, was seen in the South, the
remainder of the sky being quite clear.
     “November 19, 3h P.M. A few cirri, rather irregular, but with
 a  tendency   to a N.N.W. to S.S.E. direction.       They moved slowly
from W.S.W.          7h 50m P.M. A bank of clouds along the S.W.
horizon, remainder of sky clear. Auroral column shooting up
from the E.N.E. point as far as Auriga.             8h 10" P.M., and for
 several minutes before and         after, sky  as before.     A splendid
 luminous arch extended unbroken across the            sky  from W.S.W.
to E.N.E., varying in width and brightness at different parts of
 its course, and also from instant to instant. Near the zenith its
 width varied from 2° to 8°. Pulsations passed along it from W.
 to E.     Its centre crossed the magnetic meridian at an altitude
 of about 78°, passing over Altair, Arided, Capella, &c. No other
 auroral appearance visible.         I  was now called away for ten
 minutes, and on returning to the open air found the whole sky
 covered by patches of luminous clouds affected by rapid pulsa
 tions propagated from W.S.W.            The arch, though still distin
  guishable, was now very faint and hazy.         A small but very bright
 aurora cloud appeared in Cassiopeia, and then suddenly moved
  2° or 3° to E.N.E., growing rapidly fainter and then disappearing.
  The sky was now obscured by clouds approaching to the cirro
  stratus type, between which the auroral light shone, chiefly,
  however, to the west, there having as yet been no appearances
  of the aurora in the usual quarter (N.N.W.).           So suddenly was
  the  sky  obscured   by the clouds in    question,  that they must cer
  tainly have been formed on the spot by the electric or electro
  magnetic influence, and not brought over by atmospheric cur
  rents.    The air was nearly calm, except for a few gusty breezes
  from S.W. A thermometer rose 2° in 20 minutes, and another
  exposed freely to the sky rose 4° in the same time.            At 9" P.M.
  the former thermometer marked 35}^, and the latter 32°, having
  risen 6° within an hour.       After this the clouds cleared off, with
   the exception of irregular banks of cirrostrati in E. and W.,
   showing a few streaky lines ranging about N.W. to S.E.               The
   thermometers at 10h P.M. indicated 33° and 26°              respectively,
   or nearly the same as at 8" P.M.       The auroral light was now con

      “Dec. 17, 9 P.M. During an auroral display the luminosity
  of the cirri was well-marked. A very curious feature, apparently
  due to the auroral influence, was, that the cirri after proceeding
  in straight lines from the N.N.W. point to an altitude of about
  45° in a S.S.E. direction, took a sudden bend and proceeded in
  straight lines, to the S.S.W. point. At 11h P.M. the auroral light
  had exhausted itself, and the cirri extended unbroken across the
  sky from N.N.E. to S.S.W., well defined and very distinctly
  luminous.

  June   5,0h  40” A.M. The whole sky overspread by fleecy clouds
  emitting a very considerable pale phosphorescent light.         These
  clouds formed an almost continuous stratum of unequal thick
  ness, the denser portions being the more luminous, and arranged
  in tufty patches connected by rarer spaces, through which the
 rays of the stars penetrated as through a veil. The whole were
 agitated in a most singular manner, swinging to and fro, and
 being traversed by undulating pulsations, which varied their
 luminosity, and produced an effect resembling that of the waving
 of a phosphorescent sea. The clouds moved slowly from about W.
 Occasionally they would suddenly assume a deep nimbus aspect.
  Soft drops of rain were constantly falling, but in a very irregular
 and curious manner.       I noticed a flash of sheet lightning at this
 time.     1* 5* A.M. Luminous clouds passing into nimbi.           Lu

    “Jan. 9. A remarkable display of the aurora connected with
cirrostrati. The phaenomena deviated in some respects from the
regular order of auroral displays, no tendency to the formation
of a corona having been exhibited, and the centre of the aurora
having at one time been decidedly to W. of the magnetic
meridian.

appearance, by being at an inferior elevation, and by showing no
 tendency to coronal convergence.       They moved slowly from E.

 in about a minute a splendid arch of intense white was com
 pletely formed, spanning the sky from E.N.E. to W.S.W., and
 crossing the magnetic meridian at an altitude of about 78° above
 the S.S.E. point.     Its breadth was about 1°, regular and well

many different shades, were blended with brilliant white in an
indescribably beautiful manner.     The light given out by the
aurora at this time was considered  fully equal to that of the full
moon.    A dull red haze  (perhaps   merely  the reflection of the
crimson streamers) extended along the southern horizon. White
streamers next began to shoot up to the corona from the northern
points, and a complete cone of rays was formed, of which the
corona formed the apex.       The crimson streamers were still
chiefly confined to the southern parts of the sky.   At 10h P.M.
the sky  (excepting a small  space in S.S.E.) was  nearly covered
by yellowish-white streamers and luminous masses.       From this
till 12 o'elock the aurora continued    with varying brightness,
being chiefly confined to the south, and being most vivid about
the region of the celestial equator.    The rays converged with
great regularity and symmetry to the corona.         After this the
aurora increased in brightness, and at 1" A.M. (18th) the corona
was beautifully defined, the streamers in     vicinity being crim  its

                      to                     the east, about mid   in
way between the horizon and zenith. These arranged themselves
in lines ranging nearly N.W.      S.E., and appeared

Out of nineteen displays, selected from upwards of 250 observed
here within the last thirteen years, on account of their remark
able splendour, we find the following occurring about the middle
of November, viz.:-1835, Nov. 17; 1837, Nov. 12; 1841,
 Nov. 18; 1847, Nov. 19; and 1848, Nov. 17.              On Nov. 17,
 1839; Nov. 17, 1840; Nov. 16, 1844; Nov. 17, 1845, and
Nov. 17, 1846, aurorae also appeared, though not of very remark
able brightness.     The two last-mentioned instances were the
only cases of the appearance of the aurora which were noticed in
the months of Nov. 1845 and 1846 respectively.           There would
thus appear to be a certain periodicity in auroral displays, and
to this we would respectfully call the attention of meteorologists.
   “Several of the meteors called shooting-stars have been seen
in the course of the past week. On the evening of the 12th (a
time notably characterized by appearances of such meteors), at
6h 57m, one of these, much brighter than the planet Venus,
appeared to drop vertically downwards from a point situated
about midway between the star Alpha in the Northern Crown
and the horizon.

by a thin haze, dimming the stars and affected by luminous pul

defined would instantaneously become luminous, and then as
suddenly relapse into the apparently uniform haze. The aurora
could scarcely be said to affect the form of rays or streamers, being
rather a congeries of fitfully luminous clouds, somewhat resem
bling the lightest form of cirrocumuli, and scattered over the
sky in an irregular manner.       8h30m. Patches of hazy cirrostrati

and modification of clouds; the cirrostrati being formed under

the aurora, was at least a substratum for           operations.           its

minating with a quivering light the upper edge of the east cirro

fully formed in the usual position, the streamers exhibiting the
magnetic curves with great distinctness in the vicinity of the
point of convergence.    Streamers and masses of crimson light
were mixed with those of the ordinary white and yellowish hues.
Two of these masses were very persistent, one of them situated
in the west, a short way above the horizon; the other in N.N.E.
at an altitude of about 45°.   The motions of the streamers were
very rapid, and the whole features of the display passed through
an infinity of changes.   Next morning a great number of light
fleecy cirrous clouds were scattered over the sky. About 3" P.M.
these had become more compact, passing into cirrocumuli, and
were arranged in “meridional lines” from N.N.W. to S.S.E.
There is every reason to believe that these had some connexion
with the auroral display of the preceding evening.  Faint aurorae
also appeared on the evenings of the 20th and 21st.
   “On the 22nd, at a few minutes before 8" P.M., a remarkable
meteor exploded behind some dark clouds in the N.N.E. part of
the sky, giving out for two or three seconds a light almost rival
ling that of day. This meteor was also observed at Banff, where
it appeared in the S.E.; at Dundee, where it appeared in the E.;
at Melrose, where it appeared about N.E., and in many other
places.   A comparison of the notices of it contained in the
newspapers would appear to indicate that it must have exploded
over a part of the German Ocean, situated somewhere about 30 or
40 miles east from the Forfarshire coast,-its altitude being then
probably about 40 or 50 miles.     It would be interesting to ascer
tain if the phaenomenon was observed by the crews of any coast
ing vessels that happened to be at that time near the locality
indicated.                                        -

                                                      arched aurora
extended up    toabout 25° above the N.N.W. point         of
                                                         the horizon.
In  the southern part  of the heavens          an
                                           auroral band crossed the
magnetic meridian     at  right angles, passing      byDeneb, under
Procyon, and through the lower part            of
                                           Orion.       highly inter
                                                         A
esting circumstance connected with this was the formation                of
white fleecy cumulus clouds    in  the region about Canis Minor,
where the auroral band referred      towas generally most distinct,
although  it  occasionally disappeared and reappeared like that
seen in  the constellation Perseus   onthe night    of
                                                    the 24th. These

  appears to subsist between   it and   the Formation        of Clouds.        45
clouds after their formation moved gradually to the south, where
they soon disappeared and were succeeded in the same manner
by others.    These phaenomena took place in a part of the sky
otherwise quite clear.
    “April 21, 0" 30" A.M. Luminous cirri scattered over the
sky. Faint auroral pulsations flashing up to the coronal point,
which was occasionally distinctly marked.      During the day the
sky was well covered by cirri and cirrocumuli. A dark haze
extended to about 30° above the horizon; wind gusty, E.S.E.
8" P.M. Cirrus and cirrostratus streaks extended across the sky
from W.N.W. to E.S.E. After dusk the cirri became decidedly
luminous.     10" to 11" P.M. Luminous sheets flashing wildly up
to the zenith, chiefly from W.N.W., along the line of the cirrus
and cirrostratus streaks, the latter showing very dark, and the
former acquiring an additional fitful brightness. Pulsations also
proceeded from the N.N.W. point.        No appearance of a distinct
corona.    The flashes were fainter than those of the aurora gene
rally are, and no well-defined “streamers’ were seen.      The prin
cipal seat of the phaenomenon was also more westerly than usual.
Stars shone faintly through the luminous cirri.       11h 30m. The
cirrus and cirrostratus bands approaching nearer the magnetic
meridian than before.
    “April 24. During the day wind E., gusty; sky clear.
9h 40" P.M. Clear, with the exception of an auroral band about
10° broad, extending from a point a short way to the west of the
magnetic meridian (which it crossed between 45° and 55° above
the N.N.W. point) to about midway to the E.N.E. point. No
other auroral appearance visible.      It continued nearly in the
same position, though frequently disappearing and reappearing,
till 10 P.M. It was affected by rapid pulsations.       At 10 P.M.,
immediately after       its
                         final disappearance,     slender luminous
                                                   a
streak suddenly appeared, extending from the place where the
former phaenomenon intersected the magnetic meridian             near   to
the ordinary coronal point. This soon assumed          cirrocumulus
                                                             a
or  rather compact cirrous appearance, grew broader, and moved
slowly from nearly E.S.E.      to W.N.W. Its length lay nearly
N.N.W.    to S.S.E. Some other luminous patches then appeared
scattered over the sky.     10' 30". The cloud formed          aboveas
described now much      broader, and  resembling     compact
                                                        a       cirro
cumulus. 11" P.M. Broad luminous bands             of
                                                 thin cirri extended
from N.N.W.      S.S.E:; wind N.E., moderate. 25th. During

the forenoon bands       of
                          cirri passing into cirrocumuli (same                  as
last night) extending  from about N.W.        by   N.

from E.N.E. to W.S.W., and under them towering masses of
cumuli, presenting a strange and wild appearance.    The auroral
light nearly equalled that of the moon when similarly clouded.
   “1853. Jan. 7, 7h to 10" P.M. Sky covered by thin hazy
streaks of cirri, much resembling faint auroral clouds, and like
these only dimming the stars. They extended across the sky from
N.by E.toS. by W., and were occasionally traversed by pulsations,
apparently from W., but too rapid to admit of this being satis
factorily determined.    Wind gusty from S.W. No aurora was
seen except  a few slender streamers, which appeared for a few
minutes about 9" P.M. just above the N.N.W. point.       10 P.M.
Cirri as before, but no pulsations now distinguishable. Wind
not so gusty as before.   No auroral appearance visible.
   “March    12, 10 P.M. Clear and frosty, faint auroral light in
N.N.W. A faint luminous streak extended from Orion’s belt
by Presepe to the head of Leo. This soon disappeared, and
shortly afterwards reappeared in the same position. An arched
bank of clouds, apparently cirrostrati, in N.N.W.     In a few
minutes broad, dark, hazy cirrostratus bands appeared in N.W.,
then overhead, and soon after over the whole sky, crossing the
magnetic meridian at right angles.”

 while this was the      case,   the galvanometer   indicated that the
 joint    was cooled, consequently

 thermo-electrical current generated there. When formerly en

48           Mr. R. Adie            on the Electrical Currents induced
gaged with the subject,                   I
                              thought that the heating power of
the primary current on entering a bad conductor like bismuth
at A might be the cause of the galvanometer deflection; but on
my return to the experiments, in consequence of the objection
made to them by Dr. Tyndall, I found I could not verify this
view by artificial heating at A.                    I
                                      therefore began to doubt if
the effects observed in the metallic cross had anything to do
with thermo-electrical currents; and to try this point,         made                I
a cross of copper.    The central joint E was effected by tying the
bars firmly together with cord, the surfaces in contact being
previously cleaned; the other connexions with it were the same
as described in the diagram.      In this arrangement the current
from the battery had a circuit through AED of copper only, and
yet there was generated in the other arms a current moving in
the direction BEC which deflected the galvanometer 38°; the
                                                   I
action being nearly the same as had obtained from a bismuth
and antimony cross, soldered at their centre, but otherwise
under like conditions. An experiment was next made with the
copper cross soldered with tin at the centre E.; this produced a
deflection of 6°.    A cross of copper was then prepared with the
metal at the centre as nearly homogeneous as possible; from it
no permanent effect on the galvanometer could be obtained.
These three experiments show clearly that it is the nature of
the joint which the primary current has to cross at E that governs
the current induced in the outer pair of arms BE and CE;
and that it is not a thermo-electrical effect, is shown by the deflec
tion of 38°, obtained when the joint consisted of two like pieces
of copper tied together.
   From crosses made of other metals the following indications
were obtained:—

mony and bismuth cross soldered, and even the soldered bismuth
bars are superior to the original form.
   The change in the direction of the primary current in the
results from the antimony and bismuth cross, where AC repre
sented the bismuth bar, show how much the induced current is
influenced by the thermo-electrical current developed at E.; for
with the primary current passing in the direction DEA, the
induced effect at E is opposed to a thermo-electrical      current
generated by heat there; with the primary moving in the direc
tion AED, the induced and the thermo-electrical current both
generated at E are in the same direction.        The effect of the
thermo-electrical current opposing or exalting the induced cur
rent, is to change the deflection of the galvanometer 5°; a fact
which is strong evidence of how little in a bismuth and antimony
cross thermo-electricity has to do with the results.
   Although it is easy to construct a cross of copper which will
give no permanent current in the second pair of arms BEC,                                           I
fear that this would not be practicable with bismuth, it is so
exceedingly liable to variations in density in different parts of
the castings.
     In conducting these experiments, the immediate effect of the
primary current in generating the induced one shows that un
equal heating of the bars is not requisite; for this requires time,
while the induced current is at        highest the instant the pri

an  equivalent  of iodine from a solution of iodide of potassium,
like free chlorine or bromine.   All that is now necessary is the
determination of this separated iodine, which may be effected
in the following manner with remarkable exactitude.
    A solution of iodine in iodide of potassium is prepared of such
a  strength,  that the liquid in one degree of the burette may con
tain a small fraction of a milligramme, perhaps, as in the follow

prepared, to contain not more than Tºrºnt of sulphurous acid.

the solution of iodine are required to neutralize a measured volume
of this sulphurous acid. The quantity of iodine necessary is con

   The greatest divergence from the mean of these experiments
                       ºn
therefore amounts only to 0-00001 of iodine, and represents an
error of only          of oxygen. The chances of error in the
determination of the oxygen is thus, according to these experi
ments, so far reduced, that the quantity of this element may be
determined even in less than the tenth of a milligramme of ozone.
   The errors most likely to creep into this method must conse
quently be in the weighing; for this reason the operation was
performed with particular care.      A new CErtling's balance was
employed, which was never made use of for any other purpose
during the whole course of the experiments, by means of which
even the tenth of a milligramme might be determined with cer
tainty. The balance was placed in an unheated place, the tem
perature of which was pretty constant.      The preliminary weigh

nearly corresponding experiments.                A further difficulty also
occurred at the commencement of the investigation: it regards
the connexion of the various pieces of apparatus.                    This can
neither be effected by cork, india-rubber, or any other organic
substance.      It is necessary therefore either to fuse together the
separate pieces of glass tube forming the apparatus, or where
this is not practicable, to unite them by grinding them one into
the other.     The presence of free hydrogen in the gas containing
the ozone must also be avoided, for reasons which I will give
hereafter.     Lastly, even the proportions of the apparatus are
confined within certain limits; the slowly moving stream of gas
requires a space of time sufficient for the spontaneous decompo
sition of a considerable quantity of ozone before arriving in the
solution of iodide of potassium.
    Plate I. fig. 1 shows the apparatus employed in the experi
inents. It is divisible into three parts; the first (fig. 2) serves
for the evolution of the oxygen containing the ozone, the second
(fig. 3) serves to dry the gas, and the third (fig. 1h) is for the
reception of the products of the decomposition of the ozone.
    A wide tube (fig. 2a), which is intended for the reception of
the porous cell b, has smelted to it another tube, such as is used
for the ordinary evolution of gas. About an inch above                     lower          its

56          Dr. M. Baumert on              a new Owide         of Hydrogen
by fusion; the latter serves for the reception of the apparatus h
(fig. 1), the office of which is to collect the products of the decom
position of the ozone. This apparatus also consists of two parts
united by a glass tube closed with two corks.         The first globe
apparatus contains a concentrated solution of iodide of potassium;
the other, bent backwards, is filled with concentrated sulphuric
acid, for the purpose of retaining the water carried along by the
oxygen: at one end it is ground into the short tube of the cap.
Before the commencement of the operation, the union between it
and the glass cap, as well as that between the latter and the drying
tube, must be rendered air-tight; for this purpose the parts are
enveloped in a piece of platinum foil an inch broad, and this is
covered with a thick layer of shell-lac reaching up to the glass.
At the opposite end of the globe apparatus, from which the
oxygen, after passing through the sulphuric acid, is again ex
pelled, an india-rubber tube, dried by a stream of dry air, and
united with a chloride of calcium tube, is attached; this is omitted
in the figure. Lastly, the globe apparatus is protected from
dust during the whole course of the operation by means of a
cloth.
   The fluid employed for the electrolysis is placed in a cylinder,
k  (fig. 1); the height of this column of fluid is proportioned to
the pressure to be overcome in the various parts of the apparatus.
    This arrangement of the whole apparatus presents great advan
tages as regards the putting of it together. When the drying tube

In  this experiment, as well as in the others, the current produced
by six carbon and zinc elements renewed twice daily, was regu
lated by means of an interposed tangent galvanometer. The abso
lute intensity of the current, reduced to Gauss's standard, varied
during a week’s experiments between 10:6 and 21-8. With this
the gas passing through the apparatus moved sufficiently slowly
to become completely dried.

upon the solution of iodide of potassium, that the oxygen which
is combined with the elements of water to form ozone sets free
its  equivalent     iodine, whilst caustic potash

   It is seen by this, that, whether the separated iodine remains
uncombined, or gives rise to the formation of iodate of potash,
it may in either case be determined with equal accuracy.            The
ozone   employed    for the   analysis  was  produced  from solutions of
chromic acid, upon the preparation of which the greatest care
had been bestowed.         It was particularly necessary to get rid of
every trace of muriatic acid, which might have given rise to the
formation of chlorine. In the first experiment, the water, with
the addition of some chromic acid and a little sulphuric acid,
was decomposed by the uninterrupted action of the current for
six days.    In this case the following elements of calculation were
obtained:—
   Total weight of the ozone A=0.0183 grim.
                            a  = 0.00025387
                            #  = 55°l
                            t"=444
                            n = 10
   From this, calculation gives w=0.008109
                            and A–w-0005191.
   A  second experiment, instituted under similar circumstances,
in which,  however, the current was in action for eight days, gave—
   Total  weight    of the ozone A=0.0149 grim.
                             a=     0.00025387
                             t=246'5
                            t! = 121.8
                             m=     3
   Calculated from this, w=0-009887
                 and    A – wi-O-005013.
   From these numbers the formula HO” is derived, as the most
simple expression of the composition of ozone.
   If we now express the composition of ozone in per-centage
numbers, we obtain—
                                          Found.

   In  this manner we get the following series of oxides of          hy
drogen:—
                      HO = water.
                      HO*=peroxide of hydrogen.

   From the position occupied by ozone in this series, it might
be regarded as an acid, which might be not inappropriately
named hydrogenous acid.          In this view it presents some analo
gies with nitrous acid.          One circumstance, which sometimes

ozone—its decomposition when brought directly in contact with

primary current.      This interruption was, as usual, effected by
the current itself, through the agency of a small hammer
and an electro-magnet.         The number of the sparks produced
may be readily calculated from the tone caused by the vibrations
of the small hammer. This tone, which naturally varies in
height and depth according to circumstances, was on the average
E in the great octave. The number of vibrations corresponding
with this sound give eighty-two strokes in a second; this repre
sents more than two million sparks in the course of the experi

stream of sparks was employed is represented in fig. 5.

contains the positive pole, and stands in a glass vessel filled with
diluted sulphuric acid and some sulphate of iron, and kept cool
from without. This receives the negative pole outside the cell,

   The conditions under which this allotropy               oxygen occurs            of
are very remarkable.                  In               other bodies, the      all

by   a remarkable   weakening    of affinity. In this case, on the con
trary, we find an elevation of temperature of the greatest intensity
and shortest duration, producing a state directly the reverse,
which is marked by an increased affinity. That this state is
produced only by the highest temperatures, and yet that when
once produced, it disappears again by heating to a temperature
even below 392°F., is not less remarkable, although explicable.
The conversion of allotropic into common phosphorus does not
take place instantaneously, but in a longer period of time. In
the same manner, oxygen which has become allotropic by the
high temperature of the electric spark may by rapid cooling pass
through the interval between that temperature and 392°F.
without going back completely to the ordinary state, if the dura
tion of the cooling be shorter than the time necessary for it to
 return to the usual modification in that interval of temperature.
 From this it will be understood, how so small a fraction of the
 oxygen is obtained in this permanent state of allotropy, and how
this state so readily disappears at a temperature above 392°F.
 It is highly probable, that the temperature at which ozone
 is decomposed into water and oxygen, and that at which
 allotropic oxygen is converted into the ordinary form of that
 substance, are not the same.
     I hope to return again to this subject. During the preceding
 investigation, which was carried on in the laboratory of Heidel
 berg,    I  enjoyed the benefit of the good advice of Professor
 Bunsen, for which     I have to express to him my warmest thanks.

     After referring to the drawings to his paper on Fibre, published in
  the Philosophical Transactions for 1842, and the opinions entertained
  by physiologists regarding the peculiar views he advanced in that
  paper with reference to the original composition of organic fibre,
  the author states that, after the lapse of eleven years, these views
  have been fully confirmed, and in proof of this refers to a paper—
  “De cellula vegetabili fibrillis tenuissimis contexta” (Lundae, 1852),
  by Agardh.      He further remarks, that his paper of 1842 contains a
  record of other observations made in a field beyond the region of
   Agardh's researches; observations which he thinks explain how it is

  fibre; 2, that when a cell is to arise,               primary membraneits          formed                             is

   The author remarks, that observers in their endeavours to reach
the ultimate structure of the muscular fibril have actually gone too
far, and reached a later generation,-mistaking for the fibril a row of
quadrilateral particles, the mere elements thereof. These particles,
he observes, are   known to be alternately light and dark in alternate
order; they give origin to the term spirals; and for this purpose
the dark particles undergo what observers have entirely overlooked,
division and subdivision, which changes he has figured in Müller's
Archiv, 1850. The preparation in which he has again met with
the subdivision into four is still, the author states, in his possession
for demonstration to others.
    2. “On the penetration of Spermatozoa into the interior of the
Ovum; a Note showing this to have been recorded as an established
fact in the Philosophical Transactions for 1843.”            By Martin
Barry, M.D., F.R.S., F.R.S.E.
    Referring to a statement by Dr. Nelson, in a paper “On the re
production of the Ascaris Mystar,” that the investigations in that
paper “appear to be the first in which the fact of the penetration of
spermatozoa into the ovum has been distinctly seen and clearly
established in one of the most highly organized of the Entozoa,”
the author of the present communication remarks, that when Dr.
Nelson made this statement he was evidently not aware of what had
been published on the subject.      In proof of this Dr. Barry refers to
his own   paper,  entitled “Spermatozoa    observed within the Mammi
ferous Ovum ” (Phil. Trans. 1843, p. 33), in which he states that
he had met with ova of the Rabbit containing a number of sperma
tozoa in their interior; and to the Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal for October 1843, which contains a drawing in which seven
spermatozoa are represented in the interior of an ovum, besides the
 statement that in one instance he had counted more than twenty
spermatozoa in a single ovum.        In conclusion he remarks, that Dr.
Nelson   merely  added a further confirmation in ova of an entozoon, to
 what his own researches on mammiferous ova had enabled him to
record as an established fact nine years before.
    April 7.-A paper was read, entitled “Observations on the Ana
 tomy of the Antennae in a small species of Crustacean.”        By John
 D. M*Donald, M.D., Assistant Surgeon to H.M.S.V. Torch.
    The little crustacean which is the subject of this paper was taken
 in considerable numbers in the voyage from St. Vincent to Rio       Ja
neiro.    There are several anatomical peculiarities mentioned, but
 the most remarkable is the structure of the right antenna of the
male. These organs are in the female perfectly symmetrical, and
resemble that of the left side in the male; and although in the very
 young state of the latter sex the right antenna differs but little in
 external appearance from the left, yet the peculiar hypertrophied
condition of the modified segments in the corresponding organ of
the adult male is to be distinctly traced in a rudimentary state.
    As the animal lives in the open ocean, none of the limbs are
adapted for walking; but when placed in a vessel of sea-water, they

rested upon their antennae on reaching the bottom, and paddled
themselves about by their fore-limbs and tail.
   The author remarks that in all their movements the males exhibit
a tendency   to turn towards the left side, and concludes the rationale
of this fact to be, that the brain on the right side being more deve
loped at the part from which the right antenna derives        nerves,                               its         a

twenty-five segments.          Of these, the first thirteen present nothing
remarkable; but                 all

   The principal results at which the author     has arrived are as    fol
lows:–
   That the posterior roots of the spinal nerves consist of three kinds;
two of these enter the posterior grey substance at right angles, and
the third kind with different degrees of obliquity upwards, a small
proportion of the latter taking a longitudinal course and becoming
lost in the posterior white columns.
   That in no instance were any of the fibres of the anterior roots
seen to ascend with the anterior white columns, before they entered
the grey substance.
   That besides the transverse bundles that form the anterior roots,
a continuous system of exceedingly fine transverse fibres issue from
the anterior grey substance and become lost as they proceed towards
the surface of the chord.
   That from the preceding facts, it may be inferred that nearly all,
if not the whole of the fibres composing the roots of the spinal nerves
proceed at once to the grey substance of the chord; and that if any
of them ascend directly to the brain, it must be those only of the
posterior roots which run longitudinally in the posterior white
columns.
   That the communication between the sensorium and the spinal
nerves is not established by the posterior white columns, but by the
antero-lateral columns, especially the lateral.
   That many of the fibres which belong respectively to the anterior
and posterior roots in different regions of the chord, terminate there
by forming with each other a series of loops of various sizes and
lengths; and that it is not improbable that some of them may reach
even as far as the brain, as it is well known that the formation of
loops is one mode in which nerve-fibres do terminate there. A por
tion of the roots however may be connected with the vesicles of the
chord, although the evidence of any such connection is very un
satisfactory.
   That there are reasons for believing that the grey substance of
the chord does not transmit impressions to and from the brain; and
that the fine longitudinal fibres described by Stilling have not been
found by the author.
   That there is a great correspondence in the fibrous arrangement
between the grey substance of the chord and the chiasma of the
optic nerves. That the fact that the nerve-roots not only diverge
both upwards and downwards to a considerable distance beyond
their point of entrance, but intermingle also with each other in the
most intricate manner, may explain how impressions made at one
particular spot are communicated in different directions to distant
parts of the chord, so as to excite a simultaneous and sympathetic
action in classes of muscles which otherwise would appear uncon
nected.

                                     Dorpat, 15th March (N. Style), 1853.
   I have just completed the memoir on terrestrial magnetism which

I mentioned to you in former letters. It would follow from the ma
terials which I have employed, that the horizontal force requires
constants which differ from those for the vertical force, and the
differences, although for the most part not considerable, are some
times too large, as it appears to me, to be overlooked : it is for
observers to decide in this matter. To avoid the introduction of
insecure numbers I have not computed the potential, but have con
tented myself with deriving the values of X, Y and Z (declination,
inclination, and force horizontal and total) being the quantities
principally used for comparison.        A second calculation of the con
stants for X and Y would have given rather more exact values, but
I think that with the existing data the result would scarcely repay
the labour of so extensive a calculation, for the tables would have to
be entirely recomputed.
   After obtaining the data from the theory, I wished to compare
them with observation.       I could take for the inclination and force
the values which had served as the bases of the calculation; there
are indeed several observations of inclination without our knowing
the force, and a few of the force without inclination; but on the
other hand, there are more extensive districts where I had no declina
tions, although the other two elements were well determined. Under
these circumstances I was obliged to have recourse to older observa
tions, which indeed I had occasion to use also for secular change and
reduction for epoch to 1830.        Thus the character of the work was

excellent Memoir, Contributions No. IX. ; I only added the obser
vations of Lütke, d'Urville, and Rumker; of older observations, I
took those of Abercrombie and Ekeberg, only using them however
in parts where they had observed the inclination, and principally
with the view of finding its secular change.
   In the Pacific there was more deficiency; with the exception of
what has been furnished by Lütke, d'Urville, the ships of the Prus
sian Merchant Service, and in the neighbourhood of the magnetic
equator by Duperrey, modern voyages scarcely gave me anything;

the errors show a certain degree of systematic character over ex
tensive districts, so as to alter the declination or inclination a degree.
The inclination appears to me to be very incorrect in the meridian
of Alexandria.    In India the few results of Elliot's given in the
Philosophical Magazine from the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
accord extremely well with my calculations.   I subjoin a few points
of comparison            :-
   North Pole in 70° 7' N., 263° 37' E. Ross's observations give
70° 5' N., 26.3° 14' E.   For the South Pole, 74°6' S., 152°47' E.
seems to agree less closely with Ross's map, although the inclina
tions observed in the neighbourhood agree well with the calculated

For the force in the southern hemisphere, 2027-6 in 64° 36' S.,
 144° 34' E. is perhaps less correct, but there are in the S. hemisphere
some striking anomalies in the observations.
   The probable error of the force is 19:1; if however some groups
which are at any rate not very correct are omitted, it becomes a little
less than 15.    For the inclination, 31" l ; for the declination, 41' 3.

to divide both sides by r, the following laws are suggested.    The
symbol = is to be read with an index, as in     which has reference                         -n,
to the order on or 0—n, or as in -—n, which has reference to oo-n
or to   0. The equation A=,B is normally satisfied when A and B
are  of the order n, and A–B of a lower order. It is supernormally
satisfied if A and B be both of any (the same or different) higher
order than the nth, and subnormally if both be of any lower order.
Among the most conspicuous rules which follow, are that AC=min BD
is normally satisfied, if A=m.B and C=nD are so; and that when an
equation is multiplied or divided by a quantity of the order n, the
index of equality must be increased or diminished by n.        Various
cases are given in which such results as now present anomalies
are reduced under formal law, and others which would be absolutely
rejected are shown to be capable of consistent interpretation.
   The formal law of connexion of the different states, of which fini
tude (with the index 0) is only one, is that the order 0,n stands to
finite quantity in    respects       all

the universal truth of that principle; and hence he holds that it may
be stated as a theorem, under the name of the principle of mean
values.    Various uses of this principle are given. Further, in assu.
ming the free use of the orders of 0 and oo, it is shown that it is cor
rect to say that the constant passes from A to B while h, a being
a+h, passes through the phases of 0. So that, for instance, at an
epoch of transitiveness the value of p(a+0) is dependent upon the
form of 0. The brevity of an abstract prevents the statement of
those cautions under which such use of language is introduced. One
result, however, may be brought forward.              When the function                                        fris
transitive (or, as commonly said, discontinuous) at wea, the equa
tion p(fa)=(pf)a no longer necessarily exists. But this, as is
pointed out, is what may happen at any value of a which makes a
differential coefficient infinite.                                                  -
    On the    question    of sin oo and cos     oo,   Mr. De   Morgan    deduces
their observed values, sin oo-0 and cos oo-0, both from the prin
ciple of mean values, and from the formal truth of the equation
q(oo + a)=ohoo.         From the same principles follows the equation
(–1)* =0. In this case, however, and in all which come under
the principle of mean values, the absolute necessity of the results is
not affirmed. They are the alternatives of indeterminateness.                  But
in thus representing them, Mr. De Morgan does not concede more
than he conceives must be conceded with respect to oo —o, #, and
the like.
    On the question of series, Mr. De Morgan contends that                      the                           all
 uncertainty and danger          divergent series belongs equally

half an hour to two hours' exposure, varying with the size and nature

cone of blue light hardly reached an eighth of an inch beyond the
surface. The cell filled with the solution was placed opposite the
sky, and a photograph taken of it on iodide of silver with a quartz
lens: the sky, on developing, came out black, while the light which
had passed through the quinine had hardly affected the plate in
the least.    I then diluted the solution, until, on trial, the come of
light reached half way across the cell; still the photograph pre
sented the same appearance as before, and it was not until the solution
was so diluted that the cone of blue light, formed by concentrating
a ray of sunlight upon the solution, would pass completely through,
that   I could perceive an increase in the effect on the photograph.
When the solution was no stronger than one or two grains to the ounce,
there were hardly any chemical rays absorbed.
    The slight effect which the light produced after passing through
the strong solution of quinine,                 I
                                       found to be due solely to the action
of the less   refrangible   rays.   A photograph was taken of the solar
spectrum, the beam of sun-light being allowed to pass through the
above solution before falling upon the prism : there was a slight
impression, but only where the visible rays fell.            The same effect
was produced on bromide of silver in a much shorter time.
   I  immediately procured some collodion with bromine in the place
 of iodine, prepared for me by Mr. Hockin; this found to answer              I
the purpose very well.
    On copying one of the figures seen in nitre on this film, inter

 the rings were now reduced to the visible number, and at the same
 time were much broader, owing to the greater extent of surface in
 each ring capable of affecting bromide of silver.        But here a remark
 able dislocation presented itself; each quadrant of the interior rings,
 instead of retaining                its
                              usual regular figure, appeared          broken          as

    Since the rays which produce these abnormal figures do not act
upon iodide of silver, but affect bromide whether a quinine bath
be interposed or not, they can hardly be present in the more refran
gible, invisible portion of the spectrum, or at least not in that part
which is absorbed by sulphate of quinine; neither can they be in
visible heat rays beyond the extreme red, since these do not affect
bromide of silver.       I have satisfied myself that the figures are in
visible to the eye, by accurately examining each of the crystals in
a polariscope, illuminated first by white light, and then by each iso
lated ray of a very pure solar spectrum; in no case was there any
figure but the normal one perceived.       It is possible, therefore, that
these abnormal figures may be caused by invisible rays which have
hitherto escaped notice, existing within the space enclosed by the
visible spectrum.

clear blue sky, fully 15° high, and very slender, scarcely the diameter
of the sun.
   After the sun had set in a golden sky it became of a rosy hue,
brighter and broader at some places than others, as if the brightest
strata, or thin laminae of the horizontal clouds, reflected the sun
beams most perfectly.     It continued quite perpendicular, and about
half-past 9 o'clock, or 45 minutes after sunset, vanished gradually—
the last spot of it being 1 or 2 degrees above the horizon.       About
an hour afterwards, when the moon rose, a pillar of light also ap
peared over her, but fainter and shorter, and after 30 minutes when
she had risen a little above the horizon, a similar pillar appeared
below her, but they only extended about 3 or 4 diameters of the
moon on each side, having her diameter as a base, and tapering away
as they receded from her.      This continued till 12 o'clock and pro
bably much longer.
   I am told that the sun pillar was again very beautiful before sun
rise next morning, about 3 o'clock.

X.    On the Reflexion   of Polarized Light from        the surface of
     Transparent Bodies.     By the Rev. SAMUEL HAUGHToN*.
INinthe     year 1837, Mr. George Green of Cambridge published
        the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Societyt,
a paper on the    “Laws of Reflexion and Refraction of Light        at
the common surface of two Non-crystallized Media,” in which
he obtained formulae for the intensity of reflected polarized light
which appeared to explain the peculiarities of polarized light
reflected from the surface of transparent bodies endowed with a
high refractive index, as observed by Brewster, Airy, and other
observers.
    Formulae intended to answer the same purpose were deduced
from theory, and published by M. Cauchy in 1839: these for
mulae are not the same as those obtained by Mr. Green.
    The principle from which Mr. Green deduced his formulae is
the following:—that in general there must be in an elastic
medium both normal and transverse vibrations; and that although
we are obliged to assume in physical optics that the velocity of
propagation of the former is infinitely greater than that of the
latter, yet the evanescent normal waves which are produced at
the bounding surface of two transparent bodies will produce an
effect upon the transverse waves by changing their phase.
    In order to apply this principle, and calculate the change of
phase, Mr. Green uses the method of the Mécanique Analytique
of Lagrange; and in applying it to the problem of reflexion, adds
an hypothesis obtained from the analogy of gases, which hypo
thesis reduces the conditions at the limits obtained by following
Lagrange's method to other conditions, which are identical with
those used by M. Cauchy, and obtained by him from what he
calls the ‘principle of continuity of movement.’

   It  is not difficult to deduce from         Mr. Green's       equations the
following —

   Equations (2) belong to the case of light polarized perpen
dicular to the plane of incidence; and since light polarized in
the plane of incidence is proved by Mr. Green to undergo no
change of phase by reflexion, it is easy to see that el-e is the
difference of phase produced by reflexion in the two components
of light originally polarized in any azimuth.

with theory is

    A few trials convinced me that the coefficient Q, as defined by
equation (1), would never represent the observations;                     I  there
fore proposed to myself to examine whether it were not possible
to represent M. Jamin’s observations by equations (2), consider
ing Q as an unknown constant to be determined by experiment.
    The formulae from which M. Cauchy deduces the difference of
phase cannot be reduced to the form of equations (2).                       In the
following table    I  have   given    both M.   Cauchy’s   results and those

     A             of the columns of differences between the

observed results and those calculated from the two theories, shows
that they equally well represent the phaenomena.
   The value of Q, however, deduced from (1), is 0.278.        this                                                       If

of 2:55, the results would have differed widely from the obser
vations.

     It remains for me now to explain the theoretical signification
 of the alteration which I have proposed to make in Mr. Green's
  formulae.   In order to do so, it is necessary to give the equa
 tions from which he sets out, and to show where the restriction
 occurs which prevents Mr. Green’s formulae from accurately
 representing the phaenomena in their present state.

88             Dr. Wrightson on the Atomic Weight and
equations   represent the observations of M. Jamin equally well
as the  equations  given by M. Cauchy, it becomes interesting to
inquire into the reason of this agreement.
   The principles from which Mr. Green and M. Cauchy set out
are the same; viz. 1st, the equivalence of vibrations; 2nd, the
continuity of movement, or equality of coefficients of Lagrange's
function for the two bodies; 3rd, the evanescence of the normal
waves.    It is plain that the third of these conditions may be
introduced into the equations which express the first two in many
different ways, by selecting different particular integrals for the
equations of motion.     Mr. Green has selected one method and
M. Cauchy another; they have arrived at formulae differing in
form, but equally well representing the observations.          This
agreement gives a high degree of probability to the common
principles from which both geometers have started; while at the
same time the difference in the form of the results must render
us cautious in pronouncing positively in favour of either.
     I
     would venture to propose equations (14) and (16) as empi
rical formulae to represent the laws of reflexion of plane polarized
light at the surface of uncrystalline transparent bodies; they
admit of easy calculation and comparison with experiment, and
may be used provisionally until better can be deduced from
theory. Of this, however,          I
                               confess              I
                                          have little hope, so long
as the molecular conditions to be fulfilled at the bounding sur
face of two bodies remain to be supplied by our conjectures, and
cannot be obtained by direct experiment.

90                Dr. Wrightson on                the   Atomic Weight and
the latter body being identical with that previously obtained by
Williamson from kali-aethylat and iodide of methyle.         need                                  I
scarcely advert to the double carbonates, oxalates, &c. obtained
by Chancel; because while their formation could be described
by similar equations, their rational constitution and atomic
weight were not more determinate a priori than those of Wil
liamson's new bodies.    It was the absence of this essential ele
ment in the new theory (namely, the establishment of the equiva
lent weights of the new bodies from which so much was deduced,
in accordance with the long accepted equivalent weights of other
bodies) which led me to doubt the deductions already detailed
of Williamson and Chancel.                               -
   But Williamson, in extending his theory of the alcohols over
their respective acids, appeared to me to furnish a hint for more
rigid experimental proof.            Hitherto the ‘othyle” theory has
remained uncriticised: some chemists, evidently dazzled by the
apparently very simple interpretation which it affords for a
number of phaenomena, have taken it for granted without further
question; others, more cautious, appear to wait the result of more
extended experiment.          It was under these circumstances, that,
with the advice of Prof. Kolbe,                     I

   No further argument will be needful, I think, to show that
Williamson’s ‘othyle’ theory is not based upon scientific prin
ciples. Notwithstanding this, however, his theory of the alco

upon which it is founded are correct, we shall have so far to

        But have we not perfectly analogous                                  cases presented
                                                                                                        by   inor
ganic chemistry? A:thyle-oxide and methyle-oxide are certainly
not more similar    their chemical character than chlorine and
                                    in
iodine, which combine together, not merely    one, but   several                      in               in
proportions. And does not the theory        double salts (as, for            of

94            Dr. Wrightson on the Atomic Weight and
example, thatof sulphates of nickel and potassium oxides) in inor
ganic chemistry, perhaps our safest guide in investigation, justify
us in viewing the bodies obtained by Chancel, for example, the

oxalo-vino-methylat                       according to Williamson, as
a double oxalate with organic bases?
   There appears, therefore, to me very insufficient ground en
tirely to discard the generally accepted theory of the alcohols
and aethers; and although the view here adopted, in which
alcohol is considered not as a hydrate of aethyle-oxide, but as a
binary compound of the oxides of aethyle and hydrogen, may not
be quite free from objections, yet they are comparatively slight,
whilst no change in our system of equivalents is required. Per
haps before chemists become agreed upon the subject, new facts
will be brought to light still more decisive in their character.
My own attention at least will be directed with that aim as early
as opportunity permits.
     I
    shall now describe my experiments upon the deportment of
the cyanides of aethyle and amyle, when mixed in equivalent
proportions and digested with potash in solution.
   For the preparation of cyanide of aethyle I first procured 5 lbs.
of sulphovinate of potash by the usual process, mixing proper
proportions of alcohol and strong sulphuric acid, afterwards
neutralizing with milk of lime, and precipitation of the fluid
(separated by filtration from sulphate of lime) with carbonate of
potash. The slightly alkaline solution, after separating the pre
cipitated carbonate of lime by filtration, was evaporated to syrup
consistence, and before it became quite cold was decanted from
a portion of sulphate of potash which had crystallized out. The
solution when quite cold solidified to a crystalline mass, which
was drained and dried over a water-bath.        Supho-amylate of
potash was prepared in a similar manner from fusel oil, purified
by distillation at a temperature of 132°; about 64 lbs. were used.
Both salts were perfectly white and sufficiently pure.
   As the cyanide of potassium prepared by Liebig’s method
contains so much cyanate of potash that the cyanide of aethyle
prepared with it would be rendered very impure by the quantity
                                      I
of cyanate of aethyle-oxide formed, used cyanide of potassium
prepared by fusing well-dried ferrocyanide of potassium alone in
a covered crucible.    A perfectly dry and finely-powdered mix
ture of   sulphovinate  of potash and cyanide of potassium, the
latter in  excess, was very  carefully distilled over a charcoal fire.
From 3% lbs. of sulphovinate of potash, about 12         oz.  impure
                                                               of
cyanide  of aethyle were obtained, which after being shaken with
water and purified     by
                        fractional distillation, afforded about    oz.
                                                                    9
of pure cyanide   ofaethyle.

                       Constitution       of the Alcohols.                                      95
    In a similar manner a corresponding quantity of pure cyanide
of amyle was prepared from sulpho-amylate of potash.
   The cyanides of aethyle and amyle mixed in equivalent propor
tions and dissolved in alcohol, were boiled with an alcoholic solu
tion of potash        in    excess,    until the smell of ammonia, at first
disengaged  in large quantities,              had quite disappeared.  The
flask in which the fluids were                boiled was connected with a
Liebig’s condensing tube, so that the distilled fluids flowed con
tinually back.   It required about thirty hours to finish the
operation.
   The solutions of the salt thus formed, containing potash in
excess, were evaporated    over a water-bath, adding water from
time to time to the mixture until                     all
                                       the alcohol was got rid                                      of,
finally evaporated      dryness, and then dissolved
                            to                              small              in   a
quantity     of        Sulphuric acid somewhat diluted and
                                                                                                    byin

surrounding the vessel with snow.     After standing short time,               a
an  oily layer separated and rose     the surface; this was sepa

formed being  first removed, and the whole then distilled until                                     no
more volatile acids came over.    The distilled fluids were satu
rated  with carbonate       soda, the saline solution evaporated

few grammes       acid containing
                  of                little water distilled over. The

temperature then rose quickly      140°C., afterwards very slowly
                                          to
to  152°.   That distilled between 140° and 150° weighed between

96              Dr. Wrightson on the Atomic Weight and
2 and 3 oz., and formed three-fourths of the entire              quantity.
It was nearly pure propionic acid, as shown by the               following
baryta determination in the baryta salt.
   0.1225 grim. of the salt, after once recrystallizing          and then
dried at 100° C., afforded 0-0994 grm. of sulphate               of baryta
corresponding to 53.3 per cent. Ba0; theory requires             53.8 per
Cent.
   That portion of the fluid which distilled over between 152°C.
and 180°C., i. e. the entire residue, was so small that no pro
duct having a constant boiling-point could be separated by frac
tional distillation: the greater part was still tolerably pure pro
pionic acid. Analysis gave 500 per cent. carbon and 8 per cent.
hydrogen. The hydrate of propionic acid requires 48.6 carbon,
and 8:1 hydrogen.
                The Oily Acid insoluble in Water.
  The oily fluid smelling like caproic acid, which was dried over
chloride of calcium, was rectified by once distilling, and then
subjected like the first portion to fractional distillation.    It
began to boil at 130°, a small quantity of propionic acid and
water going over; the boiling-point then rose gradually and
uniformly to 196°–198°C., at which temperature it remained
constant until about half the fluid distilled over as pure caproic
acid.  Towards the end of the distillation the temperature rose
about 7°C., and the residue in the retort began to blacken. The
portion distilled over between 130° and 196° was again rectified,
and that part received between 155° and 175° C. put aside,
This operation was repeated several times, the thermometer each
time approaching nearer to a medium temperature between the
boundaries indicated. The product from the fourth distillation
between 165° and 172°C., about 7 or 8 grms. by weight, still
showed no constant boiling-point, nor could any such be observed
in any part of the acid distilled between 130° and 198°C.

show that the substance analysed was really a mixture of pro
pionic and caproic acids, another portion of the same product
was shaken with a little water; as was to be expected, a portion
was dissolved, the rest swam upon the surface of the water, and
was separated by a pipette; the aqueous portion was neutralized
with carbonate of baryta, and the salt crystallized. The crystals
viewed under the microscope were prisms mingled with long fine
needles of another salt (caproate of baryta). 0.1189 grim. of the
salt dried at 100° C. gave 0.0925 of sulphate of baryta = 51.1
per cent. baryta.       The composition of propionate of baryta
                                                ,->-y
requires 53.9 baryta; it contained therefore some caproate of
baryta.     The baryta salt of the acid Cº H90° would require
47.7 per cent. of baryta. The oily portion, which was separated by
a pipette, was treated with caustic solution of baryta, and the salt
crystallized; it consisted of needle-shaped crystals, fatty to the
touch, and proved to be caproate of baryta. 0.1444 grim. of the
salt dried over sulphuric acid (as it undergoes slight decompo
sition at 100° C.), afforded 0.902 of sulphate of baryta, corre

the decomposition of the mingled cyanides of aethyle and amyle
by the action of potash, no new acid of the composition C*H*O"
is formed, but merely a mixture of propionic and caproic acids.
    It  occurred to me that the desired acid might possibly be
formed by a modification of the foregoing process.        It was not
improbable, that if the cyanides of aethyle and amyle were
brought in contact in statu nascensti, they might unite in some
                                               r——º-–)
what the same manner as Cyanaethine, C*H*.3C*N, is formed
by acting upon cyanide of aethyle with potassium.          If such a
compound of cyanide of aethyle and amyle were exposed to the
action of potash, it was highly probable that the desired acid
C*H* O” would        be formed, much easier than from a mere    mix
ture of   cyanides of athyle and amyle,

    It was  possible that such a compound of cyanide of aethyle
and   amyle   might be formed by heating an intimate mixture of
the sulphoamylate and the sulphovinate of potash in equivalent
proportions, together with two equivalents of cyanide of potas
sium, and distilling.

     I havemade the experiment with considerable quantities of
the salts, but obtained only a mixture of the cyanides of aethyle
and amyle, and from this mixture of course only propionic and
caproic acids.
     Iadd the following observations upon some salts of the pro
pionic and caproic acids not hitherto prepared.
   Propionate of Lime, CaO, C6H5O2+HO, obtained by neu
tralizing an aqueous solution of propionic acid with fresh pre
cipitated carbonate of lime, crystallizes by spontaneous evapora
tion of the solution in long and beautiful prisms which group
together. It does not alter by exposure to the air, and dried
over sulphuric acid it retains one equivalent of water, which it
only loses by heating to 100° C. 0.4394 grim. of the salt dried
over sulphuric acid lost by heating in water-bath to 100° C.
0.039 grim. = 8.8 per cent. of water, exactly what the formula
                       CaO.C6H5O3 + HO
 requires. 0.3854 grim. of the salt dried at 100° C., on being
 ignited with the usual precautions, left 0.2098 grim. of carbonate
 of lime = 30.4 per cent. of lime. The formula CaO.C*H*O°
requires 30.4 lime.
    Propionate of Copper, CuO. C° Hº O94-HO, obtained in a
 similar manner, forms very regular octahedral crystals, sometimes
with cube facets, of a dark green colour; it is easily soluble in
water, and crystallizes best by spontaneous evaporation.         These
 crystals, dried over sulphuric acid, retain one equivalent of water
of crystallization, which they lose on heating to 100° C. 0-3951
grm. of salt lost in water-bath 0-0229 grm. of water =7:52 per
 cent. The formula CuO . Cº Hº O34-HO requires 7-9 HO.
0.2218 grm. of the salt dried at 100°, left, after ignition, moisten
ing with NO”, &c., 0-0798 grim. of oxide of copper =37.68 per
cent (calculated 37.9 oxide of copper).
    Propionate of Baryta, Ba0. Cº Hº O*-i-HO, obtained in very

        HE     equation of a conic passing through the points                        of inter
             section of the conics

is of the form
                                          w"U    + V = 0,
where w is an arbitrary parameter.      Suppose that the conic
touches a given line, we have for the determination of w a qua
dratic equation, the roots of which may be considered as para
meters for determining the line in question.     Let one of the
values of w be considered as equal to a given constant k, the line
is always a tangent to the conic
                                          kU+W=0;
and taking   wasp for the other value of w, p is a parameter
determining the particular tangent, or, what is the same thing,
the point of contact of this tangent.
   Suppose the tangent meets the conic       (which is of course   U-0
the conic corresponding to was oo) in the points P, P, and                                 let

     Suppose the conics reduce themselves to circles, or write

R is of course the radius of the circumscribed circle, r the radius of
the inscribed circle, and a the distance between the centres. Then
   £U+W=({-1-1, {-|-1, -eR*—r” + a”, 0, -a, 0)(w, y, 1)*,

and the discriminant is therefore
                      —(£--1)*(£R*-i-r”—a”)—(£-- 1)a?
                      = -(1+8)(r"+*(*+R*—dº)+*R*).
Hence, theorem—
   “The condition that there may be inscribed in the circle
w°4-y”—Rº-0 an infinity of n-gons circumscribed about the
circle (w-a)*4-y”—rº=0, is that the coefficient of £"T" in the

the algebraical equivalent of the transcendental equation, it is

XV. On    the Cause of the Occurrence of Abnormal Figures in
  Photographic Impressions of Polarized Rings. By G.G. StokEs,
  M.A., F.R.S.,                Lucasian       Professor        of      Mathematics           in    the

          object of the following paper is to consider the theory
          some remarkable results obtained by Mr. Crookes in
applying photography to the study of certain phaenomena of
polarization.   An account of these results, taken from the Journal
of the Photographic Society, is published in the last Number of
the  Philosophical Magazinet.
   In the ordinary applications of photography, certain objects
and parts of objects are to be represented which differ from one
another in colour, or in brightness, or in both, according to the
nature of the substances, and the way in which the lights and
shadows fall.     In the photograph the objects are represented as
simply light or dark.        Inasmuch as the photographic power,
in relation to a given sensitive substance, of a heterogeneous
pencil of rays is not proportional to                     its
                                                illuminating power, the

   But when photography is applied to the representation of
phaenomena of interference, such as the rings of crystals seen by
means of polarized light, the case is in some respects materially
different. To take a particular instance,                suppose the           let      us

the circumstances which determine the rings are so different in
the two cases that it is no wonder that the character of the rings
seen on a photograph should differ in some respects from that of
the rings seen directly.
   But not only is a difference of character indicated as likely to
take place; a more detailed consideration of the actual mode of
superposition will serve to explain some of the leading features
of the abnormal rings as observed by Mr. Crookes. Let us take
for example calcareous spar, and suppose the transmitted rays
to be    all  the same refrangibility.

   As the full discussion of this formula presents no difficulty it
may be    left to the reader. The last factor in the numerator of
the fraction is that where fluctuations correspond to the rings.
Whenever a passes through an odd integer greater than 1 the
first factor changes sign, and there is a dislocation or displace
ment of half an order, but when a passes through the value 1
the denominator      changes sign along with both factors of the
numerator, and there is no dislocation. When a becomes con
siderable the denominator a 2–1 becomes very large, and the
fluctuations of intensity become insensible.

                                      columns the numbers lying
between the horizontal lines beginning 20 and ‘60 correspond
to bright rings, and the remainder of each column, together with
the beginning of the next, corresponds to a dark ring.  But the
dark ring, which would regularly follow the fourth bright ring,
is converted, by the change of sign of the factor cos                                              (ºr), into
a bright ring, forming with the former one broad bright ring
having a minimum corresponding to a =3, where however the
intensity falls only down to         mean value unity.  its     similar                                A

       following numerical results have been calculated (by
  THEmeans  of the formulae established above) for application
  to the theory of                     a new electrometerrecently had         which         I have
  constructed to determine electrical potentials in absolute measure,
  from the repulsions of uninsulated balls in the interior of a hol
  low insulated and electrified conductor, by means of a bifilar or
  torsion-balance bearing a vertical shaft which passes through a
  small aperture to the outside of the conductor.

     The following simplified formulae for the determination of the
  relative length of the principal axis in rhombohedrons, from the
  angle over a polar edge, will be found, I believe, more expeditious
  in the working than any that have been hitherto proposed.
  They are adapted to the ordinary logarithmic tables, and are so
  arranged as to be conveniently employed by persons but little
  accustomed to crystallographic calculations.
     Let a = half the given angle over a polar edge; b the incli
  nation of a face of the rhombohedron on the principal axis; and
  p the principal or vertical axis required, the other axes being
  unity.    Then
                   log cos b-log cos a+0.0624694; T
                                                                        I.
                   logp        =logeoth-100624694,        <U+017F>
     Or, let a and p stand as above, and let c       = the inclination of
  a polar edge on the principal axis.       Then
                     log cosc=log cota–02385606;                       II.

     If  the rhombohedron under investigation be not assumed as
  the  protaxial  form, the value of p, thus found, must be compared
  with the   protaxial   value.    Thus, in calcite, p in the form R=
  0.854, and in the form 4R, 3.416.
     The accompanying figures may serve to illustrate the con
& struction of these equations; but it should be remarked, that
  the letters in the figures have no reference to those given above.

   3. Absorption of Water by Chalk.-The following results
(reduced to one uniform term of comparison) of a series of expe

London (Watford) Spring Water Company in the early part of
last year. They confirm in               all

spec. grav. =2:49. Water absorbed by 100 parts = 15.60.
   (5.) Chalk from Tring: spec. grav. =2:482. Water absorbed
by 100 parts = 15.12.
   (6.) Chalk from Luton in Bedfordshire: spec. grav. =2'477.
Water absorbed by 100 parts = 1494.
   The mean of these results gives 16.83 for the amount of water
absorbed by 100 parts of chalk, corresponding to rather more
than 24 gallons per cubic foot, or to very nearly 215 millions of
gallons per square mile of one yard in thickness. The absorbent
power, on the whole, may be greater in the upper chalk beds
than in those of the middle chalk; but it should be observed,
that hard layers of comparatively low absorbent power occur
indifferently both in the upper and in the middle chalk, and,
indeed, in the lower division also; for here, as in   other cases,                all

   5. Tinstone Pseudomorphs.-The well-known pseudomorphs
of tinstone from Cornwall—after feldspar twins, flattened parallel
to the side planes L, or (oo Poo) of Naumann—consist almost
invariably of a granular mixture of cassiterite, quartz, and de
composed feldspar.      Two specimens showed respectively, the
following specific gravities: 5.313 and 5-68. The first, in a
blowpipe assay, yielded 43.6 per cent. of metallic tin, which is
equivalent to a per-centage of 55-46 of the binoxide. In the
centre of this specimen two little crystals of pure cassiterite were
met with, proving the more or less chemical origin of the pseu
 domorphs. For their mode of production, we must look pro
 bably to the action of chlorides in solution or sublimation.
XVIII.      On Molecular Influences.—Part  I. Transmission of Heat
    through Organic Structures.    By John TYNDALL, F.R.S.*
      HE various solid substances which are met with in nature
       allow themselves to be classed under three general heads:—
Amorphous, Crystalline and Organized.               In amorphous bodies
the component particles are confusedly mingled, without any
regard to symmetry of arrangement.             In crystalline bodies, on
the  contrary,  the  particles  are  symmetrically    arranged; the mass
appears as if built up according to certain architectural rules,
and the result is an exterior form whose angular dimensions are
perfectly constant for        crystalsall   the same class. Organized
                                                          of

            the name      implies,  are bodies endowed with,           com                      or

                                                 a       order comes into
play. The granules, cells, glands, tubes, &c.                   animal and         of
vegetable tissues are all,          course, the visible products

 architecture. Crystalline bodies appear                bridge the chasm to
 which separates the amorphous from the organized. Like the
 former, they are devoid                of

 their true explanation by reference simply to the modification of
 the magnetic and diamagnetic forces which peculiarity of aggre

 kind of organ through which force addresses our senses; if the
 organ be changed, it is reasonable to infer that the utterance
 will be correspondingly modified,—an inference which is abun
 dantly corroborated by experiment.               Thus, mechanical pressure
 will polarize   a  ray,  and the same     may     be applied with success to

reasons to be explained presently, is cut away, as shown by the
dotted lines in the figure) four conical ivory points, abod, project
upwards; though appearing to be upon the same plane as the
upper surfaces of the bismuth and antimony bars, the points are
in reality 0.3 of an inch below the said surfaces.
   The body to be examined is reduced to the shape of a cube,
and is placed, by means of a pair of pliers, upon the four sup
ports abcd; the slider S is then drawn up against the cube, and
the latter becomes firmly clasped between the projections of the
piece of ivory II', on the one side, and those of the slider S, on
the other.   The chambers m m' being filled with mercury, the
membrane in front of each is pressed gently against the cube by
the interior fluid mass, and in this way perfect contact is secured.
In fact the principle here applied is the same as that made use
of by Fourier” in his thermometer of contact, although both
instruments have nothing else in common.
   The problem which requires solution is the following:—It is
required to apply a source of heat of a strictly measurable cha
racter, and always readily attainable, to that face of the cube
which is in contact with the membrane at the end of the slider,
and to determine the quantity of this heat which crosses the cube
to the opposite face in a minute of time. For the solution of
this problem two things are required:—first, the source of heat
to be applied to the left hand of the face of the cube, and
secondly, a means of measuring the amount which has made                                                     its
appearance      the opposite face     the expiration                                      of

      We further find that the lateral conductivity bears no defi
nite ratio to the longitudinal conductivity. Indeed the tendency
appears to be that those woods which possess the lowest power
of transmission, along the fibre, possess the highest power across
it.  But here the exceptions are        numerous that we have so                                                        no

periments of Chantrey and Blagden are often referred to as
illustrations of the surprisingly high temperature to which the
human body may for a short time be exposed without injury.
These experimenters owed their safety to two things, to the
non-conductibility of their tissues, and the non-conductibility of
the air in contact with them.      Were either of these materials
changed, the experiments could not have been made.              air                                      If

   The author remarks, that for the integrals in this formula are to
be substituted, in practice, the algebraical sums of the sines and
cosines respectively, of the apparent magnetic bearings of the distant
object, observed with the ship's head successively on the sixteen
principal points of the compass (or on eight principal points, as the
case may be).    He considers that this method may prove useful in
magnetic surveys of the ocean.
  Additional remarks to the foregoing paper.
   In consequence of a suggestion of Professor William Thomson,
the author here investigates the modifications required in the formulae
of the previous part of his paper, when the compass-needle produces
by induction a sensible effect on the mutual magnetic action of the
earth and the ship.
   Let A, as in Mr. Archibald Smith's formulae, represent the mean
of the sines of the deviations of the compass-needle observed during a
complete revolution of the ship.      As there is reason to believe that
this quantity does not vary for a given ship in different parts of the
earth so long as the quantity and distribution of her iron are un
changed, it may be determined, once for all, while in port, in the
usual way.
   When the ship is out of reach of land, let s be the mean of the
sines, and c the mean of the cosines, of the apparent magnetic azi
muths of a distant object observed during a complete revolution of
the ship. Then the sine of the true magnetic azimuth of the object
                           —H-.
is given by the formula
                  sin &=
                           s   v(c2+s°–A°)—cA
When   A=0,    this formula becomes
                                   tan a    E-2
                                              c

being identical with that of the previous part of this paper.
   May 12.-A paper was read, entitled “A few Remarks on Cur
rents in the Arctic Seas.” By P. C. Sutherland, M.D.
   The author states that, during a voyage lately made in the Arctic
seas, his attention was arrested by the power exerted by refrigera
tion and congelation in separating from water any saline ingredients
it may contain, and of thus causing disturbances in the mean density
of the waters of the ocean, which, after being influenced by cur
rents, can be overcome only by subsequent intermixture with water
from other localities where the disturbance in the equilibrium is of
an opposite character.      He considers that evaporation, which is
so active within the  tropical and temperate zones, obviously renders
the sea more dense    by depressing          its
                                        surface, and thus gives rise  to

 the necessity for currents from the two poles of the earth, where de
 position of vapour predominates to a considerable extent over eva
 poration.       This he illustrates by referring to the constant current
 from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, caused by the evaporation
 in this sea preponderating over the supply of fresh-water.                              He
 then points out the necessity also of a current out of this sea, in
                                         by

 obviate the contrary tendency which the waters                        these seas have  of
 to  become fresh.          He calls attention            the importance
                                                                       to           ascer                      of

   From the immense depth to which icebergs extend in Davis's
Straits, and also from their vast number, the author infers that the
temperature of the water will be kept pretty uniformly the same

heat of air at constant pressure determined by the above experiments.”
     Ihad been informed that M. Regnault was working on the spe
cific heat of gases, and on that account did not feel it desirable to
enter upon the laborious investigation which would have been re
quisite in order to add a couple of decimal figures to the number I
had arrived at, and which was sufficient for the object I had in view,
viz. to show that the discrepancy between the actual and theoreti
cal velocity of sound arose from the incorrectness of Delaroche and
Berard's determination of the specific heat of air (0.267), and not
from any notable error in my number for the mechanical equivalent
of the thermal unit.     Having succeeded in doing this, I calculated
the Tables 3 and 4 of my paper, using 0:238944 for the specific heat
of air under constant pressure. I feel much gratified that the result
arrived at by so eminent an experimentalist as M. Regnault confirms
the accuracy in the main of the number I adopted.
    I have only to add that Professor Thomson and myself, in pursu
ing our research on the thermal effects of rushing elastic fluids, are
following up the views on the relation between mechanical and
thermal phenomena originated by ourselves; and we shall feel most
happy if M. Regnault's results, in the important line of investiga
tion he has adopted, will facilitate our labour.
                   I have the honour to remain, dear Sir,

   2. “Experimental Researches on Vegetation.”       By M. Georges
Ville.
   After stating that it has often been asked if air, and especially
azote, contributes to the nutrition of plants; and, as regards the
latter, that this question has always been answered negatively, the
author remarks it is however known that plants do not draw all
their azote from the soil, the crops produced every year in manured
land giving a greater proportion of azote than is contained in the
soil itself.   The question which he has proposed to himself for so
lution    is,whence then comes the excess     azote which the crops
                                                               of
contain, and     in more general manner, the azote
                      a                                plants, which      of
the soil has not furnished     He divides his inquiry into the three
following parts:—
   First. Inquiry into and determination      the proportion   ofthe                     of
ammonia contained      the air
                           in    the atmosphere.

     Second.    Is   the azote   of   the air absorbed          by   plants   2
  Third. Influence         on

attempts have been made          determine the proportion
                                      to                       ammonia              of

                                of            the air, according
                                                          of          M.                 to
Gräyer, contain 0.333 kil. Nº Hº; according           Mr. Kemp 3-880 to

                      to              the air   of

these discrepancies, and proved that the quantity        ammonia con      of

tained in the air is 22:417 grms. for a million of kilogrammes of the
air; and that the quantity oscillates between 17 14 grms. and
29°43 grims.
   2. The author states that though the azote of the air is absorbed by
plants, the ammonia of the air contributes nothing to this absorption.
Not that ammonia is not an auxiliary of vegetation, but the air con
tains scarcely 0.0000000224, and in this proportion          effects are                                     its
inappreciable. These conclusions are founded upon         great number                              a
of  experiments     which the plants lived

   3. “An Account of Meteorological Observations in four Balloon
Ascents made under the direction of the Kew Observatory Com
mittee of the British Association.”       By John Welsh, Esq. Com
municated    by Colonel   Sabine, R.A.,  Treas., W.P.R.S., President of
the British   Association,  on the  part  of the Council of the Asso
ciation.
   The object contemplated by the Kew Committee in the balloon
ascents, of which an account is given in this communication, was
chiefly the investigation of the variations of temperature and humidity
due to elevation above the earth's surface. Specimens of the air at
different heights were also obtained for analysis.
   The instruments employed were the barometer, dry- and wet-bulb
hygrometer, and Regnault's condensing hygrometer.
   The barometer was a siphon, on Gay-Lussac's construction, with
out verniers; the upper branch of the siphon being alone observed,
corrections having been previously determined for inequality of the
tube at different heights of the mercury.
   Two pairs of dry and wet thermometers were used, one pair having
their bulbs protected from radiation by double conical shades open at
top and bottom for the circulation of the air, the surfaces being of
polished silver.    The second pair were so arranged, that by means
of  an “aspirator,” a current of air was made to pass over the bulbs
 more rapid than they would be exposed to by the mere vertical
 motion of the balloon.     The object of this arrangement was to
 enable the thermometers to assume with more rapidity the tem
 perature of the surrounding air, and also to diminish the effect of
 radiation, in case the shades should not be a sufficient protection,
 especially when the balloon was stationary or rising very slowly.
The thermometers used were very delicate, the bulbs being cylinders
 about half an inch long and not more than T'ath of an inch diameter.
 It was found on trial that when the bulbs were heated 20° above the
temperature of the air in a room, they resumed their original reading
in 40 or 45 seconds, when moved through the air at the rate of 5 or
 6 feet in a second. It is thus probable that any error arising from
want of sensibility in the thermometers will be small, and in all like
lihood not more than may be expected from other accidental causes.
    The observations were taken at short intervals during the ascent,
it having   been seldom practicable to obtain a regular series in the
descent.    The intervals were generally one minute, but frequently
only 30 seconds, so that an observation was for the most part
recorded every 200 or 300 feet. All the observations are given in
detail in the tables accompanying the paper. They are also given
in the graphical form in the curves.
   The ascents took place on August 17, August 26, October 21,
and November 10, 1852, from the Vauxhall Gardens, with Mr.
C. Green's large balloon.
   The principal results of the observations may be briefly stated as
follows:–
  Each of the four series of observations shows, that the progress
of the temperature is not regular at all
                                       heights, but that  at a   certain
height (varying  on different days) the regular diminution     becomes

arrested, and for the space of about 2000 feet the temperature
remains constant or even increases by a small amount: it afterwards
resumes its downward course, continuing for the most part to di
minish regularly throughout the remainder of the height observed.
There is thus, in the curves representing the progression of tempe
rature with height, an appearance of dislocation, always in the same
direction, but varying in amount from 7° to 12°.
   In the first two series, viz. Aug. 17 and 26, this peculiar inter
ruption of the progress of temperature is strikingly coincident with
a large and rapid fall in the temperature of the dew-point.             The same
is exhibited in a less marked manner on Nov. 10. On Oct. 21 a
dense cloud existed at a height of about 3000 feet; the temperature
decreased uniformly from the earth up to the lower surface of the
cloud, when a slight rise commenced, the rise continuing through
the cloud and to about 600 feet above                                its
                                                     upper surface, when the
regular descending progression was resumed.                At      short distance       a
above the cloud the dew-point fell considerably, but the rate                dimi                of

    It would appear on the whole that about the principal plane                                           of

            of                                the higher air above what

the earth upwards.
   There are several instances of second or even    a            third sudden fall   a

    The air collected in the ascents was analysed by Dr. Miller; he
 states that “the specimens of air do not differ in any important
 amount from that at the earth at the same time, but contain a trifle
 less oxygen.      All of them contained a trace of carbonic acid, but
 the  quantity  was too small for accurate measurement upon the small
 amount of air collected.”
    June 9.—The following papers were read:—
     1. “Further Experiments and Observations on the Properties of
 Light.”     By Lord Brougham, F.R.S., Member of the Institute of
 France.
    1.  The author considers that Sir Isaac Newton's experiments to
 prove that the fringes formed by inflexion and bordering the sha
 dows of all bodies, are of different breadths when formed by the
 homogeneous rays of different kinds, are the foundation of his theory,
 and would be perfectly conclusive if the different rays were equally
 bent out of their course by inflexion, for in that case the line joining
 the centres of the fringes on opposite sides of the shadow being, as
 he found them, of different lengths, the fringes must be of different
 breadths.     He found that line to be #, inch in the red, <U+017F>º in the
 violet of the nearest fringe; ºr in the red, ºr in the violet of the
 second fringe; and these proportions he found to be the same at all
 distances of the chart from the hair. But if the rays are of different
 flexibility, if the red, for example, is bent to a greater distance from
 its course than the violet, the experiment becomes wholly inconclu
 sive; and the line joining the centres may be greater in the red than
in the violet, although the breadths of the two fringes are equal,
 or even though the violet fringe may be broader than the red.
    2. A variety of experiments are adduced in the paper to show that
this property of different flexibility exists, which Sir I. Newton had
not remarked. These experiments are either made with two bodies
acting jointly on the rays, or with a single body so acting.
    3. When made with two bodies, as sharp edges, these edges
must be perfectly parallel, and when placed in the axis of the pris
matic spectrum they form fringes more distant in the red than in
any other part; least distant in the violet.       The fringes are both
broadest in the least refrangible rays and most removed ; narrowest
and least removed in the most refrangible.         They incline from the
red towards the violet.
    4. The same experiment is easily made with a lamp or candle,
placing a prism between the flame and the edges. This renders
that exact parallelism of the edges which is required in the experi
ment with the spectrum, comparatively immaterial; because a con
siderable inclination of the edges, as at an angle of half a degree or
more, does not affect the action on the rays in the very small space
through which they pass by the edges.
    5. With a single edge, or other body as a hair, the same difference
in the position, as well as in the breadth of the fringes, is found to
be observable, though not so manifestly as when two act together on

                               Royal Society.                         149
the light. The manner of making the observation most conveniently
is pointed out.
    6. These experiments are varied so as to show the various disten
sions of the disc of a flame subjected to flexion between two edges,
according as we regard the various portions of the flame's spectrum
when seen by the prism.         The red part is broadest, and when the
near   approach   of the  edges  to each other divides the disc into two
with a dark interval between them, that interval is the broadest in
the least refrangible rays.
    7. The experiments are further varied by using coloured glass
instead of refracting with a prism.
    8. The   same phaenomena     are found to exist in all the other cases
of flexion    as where   it is combined with reflexion by the action of
specula, or by the effect of striated surfaces. There is always the
same difference in the effects produced by the different kinds of
homogeneous light.
    9. The same phaenomena are not so easily observed in the internal
fringes, or those of the shadow ; but the dark gray line in the axis
of the shadow, having a line of deep black on each side, is found to
vary in breadth and position in the different parts of its length cor
 responding to the colours of the spectrum, when a needle or other
 small body is placed in that spectrum.
    10. The angle of inflexion is shown to be obtained by taking the
 distance at which the internal fringes begin to appear; and the pro
 portion of this angle in the red to the same angle in the violet is
 ascertained.     The deflexion (as deduced from Sir I. Newton's ex
 periments) is much greater than inflexion appears to be.      He had not
 observed the internal fringes of Grimaldi, to whom, however, he refers.
    11. The author states that the property in question, the different
 flexibility of light, coexists with the other property, whatever it may
 be, which disposes the different rays in fringes of different breadths;
 but he considers that the two properties are wholly independent of
 each other.
    12. He thinks there is reason to believe that the dark intervals
between the fringes made in white light are only the dark tint of the
 adjoining fringes, of which the red of one runs into the violet of the
 other.    The greatest care in repeating Sir I. Newton's experiment,
 with the same distances and sizes both of the body and the beam,
 leaves little or no doubt of the fringes running into each other.      In
 homogeneous light it is otherwise ; and there appear in that case to
 be the intervals, as might be expected from the different flexibility of
 the different rays.
    13. The fringes made in homogeneous light have a considerable
 admixture of colours from the scattered rays; so have the small
 spectra by refraction made when a second prism is placed behind a
 small hole in the screen, through which hole the rays of the spectrum
 made by the first prism are successively passed.
     14. The phaenomena of flexion by bodies placed in the portion of
 the spectrum near the prism, and therefore white, are stated to be
 not easily accounted for in any received theory.
    15. The Newtonian hypothesis of the different breadths of the

fringes being caused by the action of flexion extending to different
distances over the different rays, is stated to be insufficient to account
for   it,
        and also    account for the different colours
                             to                                 the fringes                      in                            to
 be  made  by white light.         considered that the different flexibility
                                                It   is
will account for the latter, but not for the different breadths of the
fringes, without another hypothesis, namely, the different ratio             the                                     of
force   tothe distance from the bending body,           different rays.            in
    16. The entire difference of flexion and refraction           shown from                      is
the different breadths     the fringes, and from their formation upon any
                                        of
possible hypothesis being shown         have nothing similar
                                                           to        analogous                         or
in  the phaenomena      refraction,ofthough   the different  flexibility    pre                                     is
cisely similar              to
                  the different   refrangibility, only   applicable    inversely
 to the different rays.

                            the doctrine      interference       the phaenomena

of  flexion      considered and
                   is                      shown that certain
                                            ;         it   is         these phae                      of
 nomena are             at
                   variance with the doctrine.       This       particularly   ex            is
 emplified        in
                the case     the phaenomena observed where bodies acting
                                       of
 on  light are not placed directly opposite           each other, but one be to
 hind the other.
    18. The same phaenomena are adduced                 disprove M. Fresnel's     to
 hypothesis, that the phaenomena          flexion (termed  of   him diffraction)             by
 depend entirely on the size         the aperture through which the light

easterly direction. Along this chain the active volcanoes          the island
are encountered, and      the same general direction the thermal springs
                                       in
occur, thus suggesting      common origin for them and the volcanoes.

placed the immense snow-fields which crown the summits.                From
the arches and fissures of the glaciers, vast masses of water issue,
falling at times in cascades over walls of ice, and spreading for miles
and miles over the country before they find definite outlet. Exten
sive morasses are thus formed, which lend their comfortless monotony
to the dismal scene already before the traveller's eye. Intercepted
by the cracks and fissures of the land, a portion of these waters is
conducted to the hot rocks underneath; here meeting with the vol
canic gases which traverse these underground regions, both travel
together, to issue at the first convenient opportunity either as an
                                                                        -
eruption of steam or as a boiling spring.
    The origin of the water which feeds the springs is here hinted at.
That origin is atmospheric. The summits of the Jökull arrest and
mix the clouds, and thus cause an extraordinary deposition of snow
and rain.     This snow and rain constitute the source from which the
springs are fed. The nitrogen and ammonia which occur, without
exception, in every spring, exactly as we find them in rain-water,
furnish the proof of this; for the known deportment of these sub
 stances preclude them from being regarded as real volcanic products.
    The springs of Iceland permit of being divided into two great
classes; one class turns litmus paper red, the other restores the
colour; one class is acid, the other alkaline.         Periodical eruptions
are scarcely ever known to occur among the former, while to the
latter belong the Geisers of the island.         Here then we have two
facts which form the termini of a certain chain of operations—the
water of the clouds and the water of the spring: in its passage from
one terminus to the other is to be sought the cause of those changes
 which the water has undergone.
    In seeking insight here, experiment is our only safe guide. Let
 us endeavour to combine the agencies of nature, and see whether
 we cannot produce her results.        Sulphurous acid is one of the most
important gases which the water encounters in its passage. Now
 if a piece of palagonite, the rock through which the water filters, be
 heated with an excess of aqueous sulphurous acid, it dissolves in the
 cold to a fluid coloured yellow brown by the presence of peroxide
 of iron. On heating the fluid this peroxide is converted into prot
 oxide ; a portion of      its
                            oxygen goes       the sulphurous acid, forming
                                                       to
 sulphuric acid, which combines with the bases                       of
                                                        the rock and holds
 them in   solution.    This     the first stage
                                   is                the fumarole process.

exist amicably together. In Iceland they wage incessant war, mutu
ally decompose each other, and scatter their sulphur over the steaming
fields.    In this way the true solfataras of the island are formed.
   In  process   of time, however, the heat retires to greater depths,
the sources of the sulphurous acid and sulphuretted hydrogen become
by degrees exhausted, and at such places the acid reaction of the
soil disappears.     Carbonic acid is found in abundance everywhere,
but as   long  as the more powerful sulphuric acid is present the former
must remain free. But when the acid reaction has disappeared, the
carbonic acid combines with the alkaline bases, the bicarbonates
thus formed impregnate the thermal waters, and become solvents
for the silica which these waters are known to contain in such sur
prising abundance, and which, as we shall presently see, furnishes
the materials for the wonderful architecture of the Geisers.
    Casting our thoughts back upon the foregoing description, the
hypothesis of internal heat will be seen to be implied, and from this
as a cause we have deduced the various chemical phaenomena as con
sequences.  Holding fast by experiment, we see that the various
gases whose existence has been urged as one of the strongest proofs
of the so-called chemical theory, follow in the most natural and
necessary manner from the rival supposition.  Given the heat and
the materials the results are such as any chemist acquainted with
the reactions might predict à priori. By the labours of a chemist
indeed a new and wonderful light has been thrown upon the entire
volcanic phaenomena of Iceland. With implicit reliance on the appli
cability of his science to the solution of these phaenomena, he has
travelled side by side with nature, combined her conditions, and pro
duced her effects. Basing                               all
                                      his reasoning upon experiment,                                     he

        The lining of    the tube is silica, evidently derived from the water;
 and hence the          conjecture     may arise that the water deposited the
 substance against the sides of the tube and basin.                   But the water
 deposits no sediment even when cooled down to the freezing-point.
 It may be bottled up and kept for years as clear as crystal, and
 without the slightest precipitate. A specimen brought from Iceland
 and analysed in this Institution was found perfectly free from sedi
ment.       Further, an attempt to answer the question in this way would
imply that we took it for granted that the shaft was made by some
foreign agency and that the spring merely lined                      painting         the  it.   A                      of

exerting  an immense mechanical force. By an easy calculation it
might be   shown that the heat thus stored up could generate, under
ordinary  atmospheric pressure, a column of steam having a section
equal to  that of the tube and a height of nearly thirteen hundred
wards.   This enormous force is brought into action by the lifting
of the column and the lessening of the pressure described above.
   A moment's reflection will suggest to us that there must be a
limit to the operations of the Geiser. When the tube has reached
such an altitude that the water in the depths below, owing to the
increased pressure, cannot attain its boiling-point, the eruptions of
necessity cease.   The spring however continues to deposit      silica                                                   its

lose their repulsive force, and accumulate in them as though by the
influence of an extremely energetic attractive force. The phaeno
menon of porous bodies may be compared to that of capillarity; and
just as the elevation of water in a tube may serve to show the exist
ence of attractions between liquids and glass, the absorption of gases
by charcoal is a proof of the attraction which a solid, isolated and
 continuous surface may exert upon gases.
    After ascertaining and measuring the absorption of gases by various
 porous bodies, De Saussure called the attention of chemists to an
 important fact, namely, that he had proved that gases condensed in
 charcoal produced abnormal chemical actions; since that time Döbe
 reiner discovered spongy platinum : these combinations, anticipated
 by De Saussure, became more evident; but it was seen that they
 were preceded by a condensation of the gases, and, in fact, were the
 consequence of this; they consequently serve to prove                                     it.
    As soon     asthe discovery       Döbereiner was announced, Thenard
                                        of
 and   Dulong   repeated   his  experiments    with some variations. They
 ascertained that the      properties       spongy
                                                 of  platinum were possessed
 by   all porous bodies; they found them             exist  to thin leaves       all

    To these various experiments we must add the leading fact an
 nounced    by M. Pouillet, the absorption             oxygen   of      platinum          in   a
 thermometer, and the condensation             the vapour

  was with nearly       certainty
                          a            success that we undertook the follow
                                            of
  ing experiments.
    We filled glass vessels, which had been carefully measured, with
  pulverized solid substances; we ascertained the densities                     the                      of
  powders and the quantities contained             the vessels, and we had all

  the elements necessary for calculating the space left free.
     Thus arranged, the vessels were connected with good air-pump                     a
               manometer with two branches; one
                                                                                 be of

stopcock;     served to measure a constant volume of gas, which was
                   it
then driven into the vessel, by causing the mercury to rise. At each
introduction of gas the pressure increased by a quantity which was
measured, and which could be calculated by Mariotte's law; the
results of the experiment and of calculation were compared.
   In this manner we have operated upon very various substances,—
Fontainbleau sand, pounded glass of different degrees of fineness,
and metallic filings and oxides. We have always found that the
pressure observed was less than that calculated; we have therefore
concluded that the gases were absorbed by the solid substances.
   These absorptions present great analogy with those manifested by
porous bodies; they are not produced instantaneously, but continue
during several hours, only attaining their limit after a period which
may be prolonged at pleasure; they vary in intensity according to
the nature of the gas employed, being weak with hydrogen, stronger
with atmospheric air, and very considerable with carbonic acid. We
shall give their measure by the following results, obtained with
pounded glass, washed and dried; the free space was 590 cubic cen
timetres, in which a vacuum was produced, and the gas was then
allowed to fill it under the atmospheric pressure; it absorbed—
                  Carbonic acid.                  Air.             Hydrogen.

   We are convinced, moreover, that the preceding results are too
low, and that it is impossible            exactly the quantities of gas
                                              to measure
contained in such spaces.      When a vacuum is produced in them,
the equilibrium of pressure is evidently re-established very slowly;
the air-pump must be worked several hours to obtain a vacuum
within 1 millimetre; and besides this, pressure does not remain con
stant, it gradually increases, and the action of the machine must be
recommenced without ever being able to attain the maximum vacuum
which it is capable of producing.    The condensation obtained is the
more energetic according to the goodness of the vacuum produced ;
but it is necessary toremember that                 its

   Carbonic acid manifests these properties very energetically; when

     XXII.  On the Fourth Law of the Relations of the Elastic Force,
       Density, and Temperature of Gases.  By Prof. Potter, A.M.4
               HEN  matter is in the gaseous state, it possesses three
               principal properties which are common to every species
     of gas, namely elastic force, density, and temperature; these                                           all
     depend     onthe quantity                    of
                                      caloric contained      the gas, arising       in
     from the  peculiar  affinity  existing  between the dense matter and
     the caloric     of
                    the gas.
        There are consequently three laws          the relations        of

162      Prof. Potter on                   the Relations           of the Elastic Force,
   Poisson's assumption was, that in the sudden condensation or
rarefaction of a gas the temperature was increased or diminished
respectively by 1° Centigrade for every THrth part of condensa
tion or rarefaction.     In the method of Laplace, the ratio of the
specific heat of air at a constant pressure to the specific heat with
a constant volume was required to be known.           The ingenuity of
MM. Désormes and Clement devised an            experimental   method+
of determining this ratio which has received the general assent
of the scientific world, and which will not be forgotten in the
history of science.     A receiver furnished with a vertical pipe
and stopcock had also a horizontal pipe connecting it with an
air-pump. To the horizontal pipe were attached a mercurial
barometer-gauge      and a water-gauge, which each indicated the
elastic force of the air inside the receiver, within their respective
limits; but the water-gauge being the most sensitive, was the
one observed in the experiments, and                                its
                                               indications afterwards
convertedby     mercurial pressures.        portion    air being with
                                                               A                  of
drawn      tothe  air-pump,    and the  reading      the water-gauge         of
noted, the stopcock was then opened, and               two-fifths              in                       of
                                                                                                         a
second the atmospheric air ceased         rush into the receiver, and
                                                              to
the stopcock was then closed.            was seen that the water
                                                           It                                            in
the  water-gauge    descended       certain point and then rose
                                                to   a                                                  to

higher level, which were both noted.         This latter rise      level                           of
was attributed entirely        the heat which was developed
                                           to                        the                            in

                       Density, and Temperature     of Gases.            163
Journal in the spring of 1851, I have frequently considered the
methods it would be the most desirable to pursue in order to de
termine the heat or cold produced in the sudden condensation or
rarefaction respectively of gases, and then the ratio of the specific
heat under constant pressure to that for a constant volume
becomes known.       That many precautions were requisite was
generally admitted; but if the changes of temperature were, as
supposed, anywhere near 1° Centigrade for a condensation or
rarefaction of Tºoth part, good indications of great change of
temperature would be easily obtained for a condensation or rare
faction equal to unity.   Amongst others,            I
                                             thought the following
method would enable me to arrive at the heat absorbed when gas
escaped through a small aperture from a higher to a lower
pressure.
   Marcet's boiler, the instrument for determining the relation.
of the pressure and temperature in high-pressure steam, is fur
nished with an adapter for holding a thermometer, which has
the bulb inside and the scale outside the strong spherical boiler;
it has also another adapter with a stuffing-box, which holds ver
tical a long glass tube open at both ends, the lower end being
immersed in a known quantity of mercury which has been poured
into the boiler; the elastic force of the vapour or gas inside the
boiler, when greater than that of the atmosphere, is known from
the height the mercury rises in the tube.      It is also furnished
with a pipe and stopcock, to which nozles can be screwed. When
steam at high pressure issues from such a nozle, the phaeno
menon of the disappearance, at a short distance, of the high
temperature which the steam possessed inside the boiler, is very
satisfactorily witnessed.
      I
      thought that if air were condensed into the boiler, proper
thermometers being employed, the change of temperature of the
air on issuing from the high pressure inside to the pressure of
the atmosphere outside might be determined.         The following
points required attention: first, the aperture through which the
  air
    issued should           be
                       small compared with the size       the pipe,
                                                                  of

selves; for instance, the stopcock, it was found, must not be
opened and shut with the fingers, but a long wooden key must
be applied for that purpose; and, again, the chamber containing
the exterior thermometer must be attached to the nozle by a
wooden adapter, and must be at the temperature required when
put in  itsplace, and the jet must immediately take place.      By

The jet caused the thermometer in the chamber to rise with cer
tainty when the differences were also 0°-6, 0°45, 0°3; but it
fell when they were only 0°l and 0°15.
   The results in the table below were obtained under the best
conditions, and it will be seen that was fortunate enough at           I
length to get the differences of temperature when no effect was
produced by the jet for rarefactions two and one nearly, and so
to determine the relation required; but we must expect some
correction of the constant when greater rarefactions have been
employed with certainty.                       I
                             think it quite probable some methods
can be found for using higher rarefactions or condensations,
and have in view such further experiments myself.

      has long been a favourite subject of inquiry with the pro
IT   fessional man to trace the course of remedies in the system
of the patient under his care, and to know what has become of
the various substances which he might have administered during
the treatment of the disease. Whilst some of these remedies
have been proved to exert a chemical change upon the circulating
medium, and to add some of their elements to the blood for the
permanent benefit of the individual, others, on the contrary,
make but a temporary sojourn in the vessels of the body, circula
ting with the blood for a longer or shorter period, but are eventu
ally expelled and eliminated from it at different outlets and by
various glandular apparatus; some of these substances are found
to be more or less altered in chemical composition in consequence
of having been subjected to the manifold processes of vital che
mistry during their transit through the system, whilst others have
                                                                                         .

aethereal solution evaporated to dryness by a warm water bath,
as before, gave 61 additional alkaloid.
  Therefore
                  # + # = 1.4 grain of alkaloid were obtained                                       by
these two operations from the 8 fluid ounces of urine.
   Now to determine whether it were quinine, the following                                     pro
cess was followed:—
    Test-fluid. A mixture of 3 drachms of pure acetic acid, with 1
fluid drachm of rectified spirit of wine, to which 6 drops of diluted
sulphuric acid were added.
    One drop of this test-fluid placed on a glass slide, and the
merest atom of the alkaloid added; time given for solution to
take place; then upon the tip of a very fine glass rod an extremely
minute drop of the alcoholic solution of iodine added; the first
effect is the production of the yellow or cinnamon-coloured com
pound of iodine and quinine, which forms as a small circular
 spot; the alcohol separates in little drops, which by a sort of
 repulsive movement drive the fluid away; after a time the acid
 liquid again flows over the spot, and the polarizing crystals of
 sulphate of iodo-quinine are slowly produced in beautiful rosettes.
 This succeeds best without the aid of heat.
     To render these crystals evident, it merely remains to bring
 the glass slide upon the field of the microscope with the selenite
 stage and single tourmaline beneath                           it;

 right angles and without the stage. Immediately little circular
 discs of white, with a well-defined black cross very vividly shown,
 start into existence, should quinidine be present even in very
 minute traces. Wide fig. 3.
    This is generally the case if hospital quinine or that of the
 British Alkaloid Company has been employed—these severally
 contain a very large per-centage of quinidine; the former at
 least 50, the latter about 20; but Howard’s disulphate of qui
 mine scarcely contains 5 per cent. of quinidine, according to my
 experiments.      These substances are easily separated in conse
 quence of the much greater solubility of the disulphate of qui
 nidine in cold water.

       One part of disulphate of quinine requires . 740 at 60°;
       One part of disulphate of quinidine requires 340 at 55°;
 so that the latter is more than twice as soluble.
    If we employ the selenite stage in the examination of this
object, we obtain one of the most gorgeous appearances in the
whole domain of the polarizing microscope; the black cross at
once disappears, and is replaced by one which consists of two
colours, being divided into a cross having a red and green fringe,
whilst the four intermediate sectors are of a gorgeous orange
yellow. These appearances alter upon the revolution of the
analysing plate of tourmaline; when the blue stage is employed,
the cross will assume a blue or a yellow hue according to the
position of the analysing plate.
    These phaenomena are analogous to those exhibited by certain
circular crystals of boracic acid and to those circular discs of
salicine (prepared by fusion*), the difference being that the salts
of quinidine have more intense depolarizing powers than either
of the other substances, besides which the mode of preparation
effectually excludes these from consideration.        Quinine prepared
in the same manner as the quinidine has a very different mode
of crystallization; but it occasionally presents circular corneous
plates, also exhibiting the black cross and white sectors, but not
with one-tenth part of the brilliancy, which of course enables us
readily to discriminate the two.
    Having shown in my previous papers that none of the vege
table alkaloids, when treated with sulphuric acid and iodine,
possess the power of forming crystalline compounds of similar
properties, and these artificial quinine tourmalines being pre
eminent in their action on light, it follows that the existence of
these crystals is a positive demonstration         of the presence of
quinine.     It has also been    proved  by me that quinidine (8 qui

patient voided 3 pints of urine in twenty-four hours, we should
only account for 11:304 grains of the remedy used, leaving a
deficiency of 30 grains; three-fourths of the substance being yet
unaccounted for, which has either been assimilated in the body,

fications may necessarily have to be introduced into the general
plan by the natural progress of discovery.        In no case, however,
do the most important of these modifications, any more than the
slight differences of opinion which prevailin regard to some of the
minor subdivisions, invalidate the general fact, that there exist
for these sciences certain primary or fundamental groupings of
universal recognition. In Mineralogy, on the contrary, we have
nothing of the kind.      No broad, well-marked and acknowledged
divisions, which strike the mind at once as being natural and true.
No agreement, indeed, amongst the cultivators of the science as to
what should constitute the basis of a mineral classification. This
arises principally from the double nature, so to say, possessed
by minerals; or perhaps, more correctly, from the prominence
and individuality of each of these natures in every mineral
 species.    For if animals and plants admit also of being considered
both as chemical and as physical bodies, their respective chemical
natures either offer merely a few inessential points of dissimi
larity, or where a real difference of the kind does actually exist—
 as in the solid parts of the Vertebrata compared to those of the
 Articulata, Mollusca and Radiata—the difference affects not indi
 viduals only, but whole classes, and is in conformity with the
 physical differences exhibited by the same; so that in the classi
 fication of plants and animals, it is to their physical attributes
 solely—in contradistinction at least to their chemical qualities—
 that we have to look. In the classification of minerals, on the
 contrary, both natures must be taken into consideration, and it
 is here that the principal difficulty lies; because, as a general
 rule, no immediately perceptible relations can be traced between
 the two.
      That a satisfactory classification cannot be founded solely upon
 chemical characters is becoming daily more and more evident;
 whilst, at the same time, the so-called “natural-historical”
 divisions of Mohs and his followers are seen, in numerous        in
 stances, to be equally unsatisfactory.       In affecting to deny the
 right of chemical characters to be considered a classification
 element in Mineralogy, it is yet very obvious that many of their
 groupings have been influenced by, if not entirely based upon, a
 consideration of these characters.       The incongruous union in the
 order “Ore,” for example, of specular iron, magnetic iron ore,
 ruby copper, and tinstone—minerals which have really no affi
  nities in common, is a striking case in point. The separation,
  again, of apatite from pyromorphite, of siderose (carbonate of
  iron) from calcite, of barytine from anglesite, amongst numerous
  other equally salient examples, are amply sufficient to show how
  little the system merits the appellation of a natural one. If the
  chemical nature of minerals, on the other hand, be only taken
  into account, it is as yet impossible, with all                to
                                                    the assistance    be

derived from a full recognition of isomorphism, to avoid the
most striking incongruities.        A few examples will be sufficient
to establish this assertion :-(1.) Silver, arsenic and sulphur, as
“simple substances,” must be placed in one and the same group.
It is very evident, however, that silver has a far greater affinity
to the argyrose or sulphide of silver, in every point of view, than to
either sulphur or arsenic. What, moreover, has sulphur in com
mon with these other “simple substances” that we should place
it with them —and thus separate it more or less widely from orpi
ment, a mineral to which it is allied not only by general physical
characters and crystallization, but also by the kindred conditions
under which both occur in nature.              (2) Iron pyrites and
molybdenite are bisulphides, and, as such, fall into the same
chemical division;                  all
                            natural analogies are, however, against
this  union,  and            in
                        favour      the grouping   of molydenite with            of
many   of the simple sulphides. (3.) Cinnabar belongs chemically
to  these latter, but crystallographically and physically     has little                     it
affinity with them.              closely allied,

 are unfortunately, open to a similar objection.

combinations two and two with repetitions of the Greek letters
2, 8, and these letters appear in each term in the alphabetical
order. Each such combination may therefore be considered as
derived from the primitive combination a, a by a change of one
or both of the 2's into 8; and if we take instead of the mere
combination a, a the complete first term 2–a 2–b, and simul
taneously with the change of the 2 of either of the factors into
A make a similar change in the Latin letter of the factor, we
derive from the first term the other terms of the expression on
the right-hand side of the expression.      It is proper also to
remark, that, paying attention to the Latin letters only, the
different terms contain all the combinations two and two without
repetitions of the letters a, b, c. The same reasoning will show

it follows from what  has preceded that it is quite as easy to de
monstrate the  corresponding   theorem for the factorial [m]". But
the theorem  being  true for the factorial [m]", it is at once seen
that the product of the series for (1+w)” and (1+a)" is iden
tical with the series for (1+z)”, and thus it becomes un
necessary to employ for the purpose of proving this identity the
so-called principle of the permanence of equivalent forms; a
principle which, however, in the case in question may legiti
mately be employed.

  186     On a Method     of Estimating Minute  Quantities  of Iodine.
  well known, produces in solutions of iodine and the soluble
  iodides a brown or brownish-black precipitate of iodide of palla
  dium. When, however, the quantity of iodine is small, the
 iodide instead of being immediately precipitated, remains sus
 pended in the solution, to which it communicates a brownish
 tinge, more or less deep according to the proportion of iodine
 present.      Consequently, then, by ascertaining the depth of tint
 of such a    solution, by comparing it with that of standard solu
 tions   properly    prepared  with known quantities of iodine, the
 proportion of the latter substance that is contained in the mat
 ters tested may be ascertained with the greatest exactness.
     In an investigation of this kind, therefore, the first thing to
 be done is to prepare certain standard solutions.         1:309 grain
 of perfectly pure iodide of potassium—which is equivalent to
 one grain of iodine—is accordingly dissolved in 10,000 grains
 of water. This constitutes solution No. 1, and contains a little
 less than .01 gr. per cent. of iodine.        By diluting this with
 water, other solutions—Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c.—are formed. The
 iodine in the substance to be tested having been converted into
 hydriodic acid or a soluble iodide, the latter is introduced into a
 colorimeter and diluted with water to the necessary degree,       that
 is to  say,   until it occupies  exactly 100, 500, 1000,    10,000  or
 more water grain measures; the precaution being taken to first
 add the palladium solution drop by drop until no deepening of
 colour ensues. The tint is then compared with that of the
standard solutions before mentioned contained in tubes or phials
of similar diameter, in which certain known quantities of iodine
are contained in the same bulk of water.           Though it might
rarely be possible to identify it with either one of two solutions
in the scale, there can be no difficulty in deciding between which
two it should fall, or nearest to which one of two it should be
placed.
     These standard solutions, it should be observed, may be sealed
up in glass tubes, and thus rendered available in future investi
gations; the only precaution necessary to be taken in such
cases being to well agitate the contents of the tubes, so as to
again get the precipitated iodide of palladium in suspension in
the fluid. Operating in this way, it is possible to estimate the
anºth of a grain of iodine with the greatest readiness. It is
sometimes preferable to employ but one standard solution. The
   roportion of iodine in the liquid analysed is then determined
i.   measuring the volume of water that is required to lighten the
tint, so as to render it identical with that of the normal solution
or vice versd.

XXVIII.           On the Constitution of the Colouring Matters                   of Madder.

     GENTLEMEN,
                                       Physique, 3rd sér. vol. xxxvi.,
IN M.
   the Annales    Chimie    de
      Laurent has published his views
                                            et de
                                               on the constitution of
several series of bodies which have been made the subjects of
investigation by other chemists.        The first series subjected by
him to criticism   comprises   the bodies obtained by me from mad
der, some of them being substances previously known and others
being new ; some contained as such in the plant, others products
of decomposition.      The chief object of my investigation of mad
der was to ascertain the nature of the chemical processes which
take place when madder is subjected to various agencies; and
secondly, to discover the connexion, if any, subsisting between the
different substances of the plant which are endowed with colour,
and, if possible, to trace them back to some common origin, so as
to be able to exhibit them from a common point of view.            The
direction in which the investigation ought to be conducted in order
to yield results of importance was first indicated by Berzelius,
who, while confessing his inability, notwithstanding the time he
had spent on experimenting to clear up this complicated subject,
expressed his conviction that the colouring matters of madder
possess great analogy of composition, and may perhaps be mu
tually convertible. With what success my endeavours have been
attended          I
             do not pretend to say; but                            I
                                                 do maintain, without
hesitation, that my view of the composition of the bodies examined
by me explains their formation and mutual relations more simply
 and naturally than does M. Laurent’s; and should have replied         I
 much sooner to his objections had I not preferred waiting until
 after the publication of the second part of my paper “On Rubian
 and    its
          Products     Decomposition*,”
                            of                 which number   in  facts    a          of
 are mentioned which will           further go  confirming the views

                                       am justified in considering
this substance as the link which unites them        together    one all                in

      In
      this equation verantine may be substituted for the aliza
rine, since, according to M. Laurent, the formula of the former,
C” H707, differs merely by HO from the double of that of aliza
rine, C19H80°. In the same manner, the rubiretine, by adopting
M. Laurent’s formulae, may be replaced in this equation by ru
bianine.
   M. Laurent has prefaced his observations by the enunciation
of several propositions or laws, as, for instance, “In    organic                                         all

 sacrificing somewhat of the minute agreement usually expected
 between experiment and theory.                  Those conversant with this
  species of research will indeed expect some discrepancies between
 the calculated and experimental composition of substances, a
 sufficient quantity of which for the purposes of analysis can sel
 dom be obtained without a great expenditure of time and labour.

 substance is converted by the action of nitric acid into a crystal

 on   rubian with nitric acid, the sugar would                     converted into     be
oxalic acid, the alizarine would yield phtalic acid; and the rubi
retine, which       is  not affected               by
                                             dilute nitric acid, nor           any                         in

insoluble residue.        Now            on

                          considered               as
                                              constituents          rubian. The       of
same     experiment      proves   that neither rubianine nor verantine
exist ready formed           rubian; for

posed    by   nitric acid (rubianine being soluble                  boiling nitric    in
acid, and crystallizing out again               the acid cooling), they would,
                                                        on

                                                                 is      the shape              in
of an insoluble residue.
    Pursuing his favourite idea that phtalic acid the bond which                  is
unites     at all
            the compounds derived from madder, M. Laurent
arrives    the following conclusions. He takes for granted that                   it
         by
alizarine,                             of  changed into phtalic
               the action     nitric acid,                       is

                     the Colouring Matters                       of Madder.                        191
acid and oxalic  acid; and as the formula of rubiretine differs
from that of alizarine, according to him, merely by one equiva
lent of H, it may easily be conceived that, when exposed to the-
influence of oxidation, it may yield the same products:—
              Alizarine.                             Phtalic acid.           Oxalic acid.
              C10H8O3 +          HO +4O = CS H3O++C2HO4.
              Rubiretine.              Phtalic acid.              Oxalic acid.
              C19H4O94-50=C8H3O++C2 HO4.
     In like manner purpurine, the  existence of which M. Laurent
still admits, and rubiacine may, when subjected to the action of
nitric acid, resolve themselves into the same ultimate products,
since purpurine may be considered as an amide (to use                                       M. Lau
rent’s expression) of phtalic acid and alizarine:—
                Purpurine. Phtalic acid. Rubiretine.
                C18H6 O6=C8H8O3 + C19H4O3–HO.
                                                                                     -
                Rubiacine. Phtalic acid. Alizarine.
                C18H3 O6=C3H3O++ C10H8O3–HO.
     Now every one of these conclusions                               is entirely hypothetical,
their only basis being an accidental correspondence between the
formulae invented by M. Laurent.          In the first place,       may                        I
remark that   alizarine, by the action of nitric   acid, yields  phtalic
acid only, without a trace of oxalic acid.        It is certainly true,
that, in acting on madder or garancine with nitric acid, oxalic
acid is also obtained as one of the products; but            formation               its
is due   toother constituents     the root, motof   the alizarine.    In  to
this respect, therefore, the presumed analogy between alizarine
and chloronaphtalic acid does not hold good. As regards rubi
retine and rubiacine, anyone reading my description                these                      of
bodies with attention, will, have little doubt, arrive
                                       I                       the con                   at
clusion that their conversion into phtalic acid         means     nitric       by             of
acid    extremely improbable,
       is                            not impossible.

not sensibly affected            by
                           boiling dilute nitric acid.   Concentrated
nitric acid     inboiling state changes
                  a                         slowly into     yellow sub

                                               in                                                     in

phtalic acid.         As regards the so-called purpurine,                                I    think I
have proved synthetically        well    analytically that this sub

by nitric acid    not remarkable.
                     is                 may state, nevertheless, for
                                                         I

192                       Dr. Schunck on the Constitution of
existence of this colouring matter, that by acting on it with
nitric acid no rubiretine is formed, but that the second product
of decomposition, which is obtained as an insoluble yellow powder,
consists  of verantine only.
   From the circumstance that rubian as well as alizarine, when
decomposed by nitric acid, yield no other solid product but
phtalic acid, and considering that alizarine is in every case a
derivative of rubian,                    I
                             inferred that it would be possible, if not
experimentally at least theoretically, to convert rubian entirely
into alizarine; that by this conversion none of the carbon of the
rubian is eliminated; that the whole of this element enters into
the composition of the alizarine formed, and that, in fact, the
two bodies differ from one another merely by the elements of
water. This conclusion, which I consider to be the most import
ant result of my investigation, derives confirmation from the
experiments made by me on the action of ferments on rubian.
I have found that, by the action of emulsine on rubian, though
only a portion of the latter is decomposed, still that portion yields
almost pure alizarine.         Again, when the action of erythrozym
on rubian is retarded     by  the addition of some antiseptic substance,
such as corrosive sublimate or alcohol, the rubian is entirely
decomposed, though much more slowly than without such addi
tion.    In         its
                  results, however, the action         very different.        is                              If
the retardation was very great, then the         only products       decom                         of
position formed are rubiretine and verantine, without               trace                          a          of
alizarine, sugar,        any other body.
                               or                                   If
                                                  the action was mode
rately retarded, then besides rubiretine and verantine, sugar and
rubiafine      rubiagine are found among the products
                or                                                   decom                         of

   “August 29, 1782. The Royal George, a 100 gun-ship, at
Spithead, sunk in about thirteen fathom water, owing to their
giving her too great an inclination in scrubbing her bottom and
the carelessness of Captain Waghorn.          Admiral Kempenfelt
was on board, and was drowned with the rest: about 800 men
and 200 women were drowned. I was told by several people
that the Captain had notice given him of his danger two or three
times; once or twice by the other ships, and also by his
    *
carpenter and the cockswain.        The ship is laid on her side,
making an angle of about 40° with the horizon, but no attempts
have been made to right her.        A Diving Bell was made in the
Dock Yard for the purpose of        .   .   .     never heard what      I

more is necessary than to moor two or more vessels on that side
of the ship which lies uppermost and in a direction perpendicular
to her; and to fasten ropes and cables to her masts, &c.; and
not only to employ the force of each of their capstans, but also to

about     it,
          but they were         obstinate, and all
would have       that the lower the Sun was
                     it
and the better would be the Azimuths.

                          touch the parallel

200      Mr. T. T. Wilkinson on Mathematics and Mathematicians :
rises  perpendicular in G), SG)Z is a right-angled spherical tri
angle; whence the following rules may be deduced for finding
the proper time of making the observation; the Sun's altitude
at that time and the azimuth angle SZG).
   “Now, tan. ZS : tan. SG) :: r : cos. ZSG).
   “Or,            r:
                    cot. SZ :: tan. SG) : cos. ZSG).
   “Again, cos. SG) : cos SZ :: r : cos. ZG).
   “Or,             r:
                     sec. SG) :: cos SZ : cos. ZG).
   “Similarly, sin. ZS : r :: sin. SG) : sin. SZG).
   “Or,            r:
                    cosec. ZS :: sin. ZG) : sin. SZG).
   “Hence the   following   rules:—
   “1. To find the time.
   “Add the tangent of the Latitude to the cotangent of the
Declination; the sum is the cosine of the hour-angle from
Iloon.
   “2. To find the Azimuth Angle.
   “Add the secant of the Latitude to the cosine of the Declina
tion; the sum is the cosine of the Azimuth.
   “3. To find the Altitude.
   “Add the cosecant of the Declination to the sine of the Lati
tude; the sum is the sine of the Altitude.
                         “General Limitation.
   “It is evident that the polar distance Sn must be less than
SZ the colatitude, otherwise the vertical circle ZG) v cannot
touch the parallel of Declination, and hence the Latitude and
Declination must    be   of   the same name, and the Latitude less than
the Declination.
    “This rule saves a great deal of trouble when it can be used;
for a number of observations may be taken a little before and a
little after the proper time found above, and there is no trouble
of calculation whatever; for the difference between the constant
Azimuth angle found above and the angle observed gives the Varia
tion.    A Table might be readily made with the Declination at
the   top and the Latitude at the side; whence the proper time
and constant angle might be taken out.            I
                                                 think it would be
proper to put such a table in the Nautical Almanack, not be
cause it is anything either new or difficult, but because sailors
are such idle scoundrels that they neglect thousands of oppor
tunities of finding the Variation because they will not be at the
trouble of working the Azimuths, and such a Table would save
them that labour.”
    The object of the preceding problem evidently is “to find the
time when the apparent motion of a celestial body is perpendi
cular to the horizon, from having        its
                                        declination and the latitude
of   the place given; ”—this being the most favourable time for
making the observations required. Under this enunciation the

               the Journals of the late Reuben Burrow.        201
problem is considered by Professor Young as Prop. W. pp. 142–3
of his Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (1833), who also       in
stances the same general limitation; and in a subsequent part of
this work similar observations are made respecting the variation
of the compass as are to be found in the preceding extract.
   Notwithstanding these discouragements, Mr. Burrow “con
tinued to make observations for the Longitude and Variation,
though with very great difficulty, as scarcely anybody would help
to take Altitudes except the Captain, and he had a good deal of
trouble about it.”
   “November 26, 1782. In the afternoon we got into the Bay
of St. Salvador. . . . . . . . . Several Catamarans and boats
came out to see us, but the Portuguese governor ordered that
we should not go beyond the White Fort.
   “December 8, 1782.       I  addressed the following note to the
Governor.
   “‘Mr. Reuben Burrow, an English Astronomer, on board the
General Coote, East Indiaman; humbly begs leave to represent
to His Excellency The Marquis of Valencia, Governor of St. Sal
vador, &c.; that he should be very happy to have the liberty of
making some Astronomical Observations on shore for the pur
pose of determining the Latitude and Longitude, Magnetical
Variation, &c., and other similar matters.        This Mr. Burrow
hopes will be complied with, and the more so, as Observations
of this kind are incapable of being applied to any sinister pur
poses, and are allowed and encouraged by every enlightened
government as being of general utility. A few days will be suf
ficient, if the weather is favourable, and Mr. Burrow will be very
ready to submit his Observations to any inspection His Excel
lency the Governor may think proper after they are made, if
required.
      “‘Bay of Bahia,
   8 December 1782.’”
   Whether he was successful or otherwise in this application
does not appear, since the Journal here terminates abruptly with
several pencil sketches of the appearance of the small islands of
Martinvaz and Trinidada;-on two of the next pages are two
series of observations on the Sun's Altitude, Azimuth, &c.; and
the following memorandum on the cover of the volume affords
sufficient evidence that he lost no opportunities of making ap
propriate observations, notwithstanding the inefficiency of his
pupils and assistants.
    “January 3, 1783.        Gave Captain Burney the Longitude
29° 44' West, Latitude 20° 31' South.        Variation of Compass
2° 3' West; of the island of Trinidada.     The Longitude was de
duced from 15 observations of the Sun and Moon; the Latitude

202      Mr. T. T. Wilkinson    on Mathematics    and Mathematicians :
from 2 observations of the Sun and reduced to the Latitude of
the Ninepin (a tall portion of rock so called), and the Longitude
was also reduced to the same place.”
    On crossing the Line the rites of Neptune were not omitted
by the crew, for Mr. Burrow has a note to the effect that he
“ borrowed half-a-crown of Mr. Hoare” on the occasion, which
was no doubt expended in purchasing an exemption from the
ceremonies usually performed in honour of his Oceanic Majesty.
    The third Journal in my possession contains but few articles of
importance. It appears to relate to the early portion (1784–
1788) of his residence in India, and has numerous entries re
specting the hire and pay of Hindoo servants, household ex
penses, &c.      Among the payments is one for “Jaggernaut Dass,
two    gold  mohurs in full to the 8th of December;”—another
entry certifies the receipt of “32 sicca rupees from A. Colvin on
account of Almanacks sold by Colonel Martin;”—a third states
that “the Sanscrit-Persian Moonshy has had three gold mohurs,
and is to have five in the whole for writing the whole of Gladwin’s
Dictionary;”—whilst a fourth exhibits Mr. Burrow as receiving
from “Colonel Watson’s tailor” the somewhat un-mathematical
costume of “one yellow silk coat without lining; twelve white
waistcoats; twelve pairs of white nankeen breeches; and twenty
pairs of cotton stockings.”       In another portion of this Journal
I  find the   following  “List of Books sent to Woolwich to De

XXX.         Note on the Preparation of Propionic and Caproic Acids.

    the August Number of the Philosophical Magazine I
IN observe a paper by Dr. Wrightson, describing the action of
an alcoholic solution of hydrate of potash upon a mixture of the
cyanides of aethyle and amyle, and employing the result of that
experiment as an argument against the othyle theory. The
author reasons on the assumption, that, of two results which he
conceived possible, the one he obtained must be unfavourable to
the othyle theory, the other favourable to                 regret  it.      It   is   to   be
ted that the author did not endeavour       describe the grounds
                                                              to

result and the corresponding theory; for think

he   expected    it   to   upset.
  The othyle theory represents acetic acid      containing the

   Now Dr. Wrightson assumed that if this theory were correct,
other acids ought to exist, lying between these in their compo
sition; whereas it is evident that, if such bodies existed, we could
not consistently with any theory represent them by fractional
formulae such as
                                               C# h 2    O

but must double the formulae of the original series to make room
for the insertion of these new terms with entire numbers; so
that the existence of these putative acids would have been a deci
sive argument against the correctness of the othyle theory. This
theory ought hardly to be blamed for the non-existence of two
alcohol-radicals in an acid, where it denies the existence of even
07.16.
    As regards the other theory which Dr. Wrightson considers
in connexion with the above reaction, I must frankly state, that,
although the existence of the imaginary acids might be conceived
consistently with              it,I      do
                             not consider the non-existence     those                          of
acids     affording
         as          any  evidence  against         acetic acid con   it.    If

                              it of
tained two atoms
of aethyle (C*h”),     would     quite conceivable that
                                               be           interme-                      an               .

velopment is between Sainte Marie aux Mines and Guebwiller;
it contains quartz, orthose, feldspar of the sixth system, dark
mica, and sometimes hornblende.
    The quartz is hyaline, and of a gray colour; it is most abun
dant in the highly crystalline varieties; those varieties which
are porphyritic and least crystalline contain little or no quartz,
the greater part of the silica having remained in combination
with a feldspathic paste.
    The orthose is the preponderating mineral of this granite. It
is white or reddish-yellow ; both kinds, containing oxide of iron,
turn red by alteration; it sometimes becomes greenish, and by
 decomposition passes into a halloysite. The orthose is the most

   The large amount of silica is no doubt due to quartz mecha

of this granite.
   The feldspar of the sixth system is rare, and only found in
the most crystalline varieties.

210      Mr.   J. J.      Sylvester on the New Rule          of Limits.
   The phaenomena of the rock veins in the masses of granite are
rather complicated.
   These veins appear generally to have formed at the time of
crystallization of the granite ; their great richness in quartz
favours this opinion, it being the last mineral of the rock to
remain in a fluid state.
   The granite of the Vosges forms smaller eminences around
the bosses of the Ballons, and is itself covered by stratified rocks,
into which it graduates by insensible degrees. The granite of
the Ballons has evidently penetrated with violence into the gra
nite of the Vosges; this is well seen at Mehachamp. In some
places the junction of the two is not discoverable.
   Of these rocks, then, that containing the smaller proportion
of silica and the greater of alumina is the more recent.
   The distinction of two granites in the chain of the Vosges is
not of mere local interest; the remark may be extended to most
granitic regions, of which I will only mention the right bank of
the Rhine, Normandy, Brittany, Auvergne, Ireland, &c.
   The general application of the above observations shows that
the same geological phaenomena are reproduced after long inter
vals of time and in widely separated districts.   It is not then
surprising that we should find in most granitic regions two gra
nites: the one porphyritic, and containing but one mica; the
other granular (grenu), and containing two micas; the former
being the more recent, and generally poorer in silica.

IT add
   may appear like harping too long on the same string to
       any further remarks on the rule relating to so simple
and elementary a matter as that of assigning limits to the roots
of a given algebraical equation; but it will be remembered that
some of the greatest masters of analysis, including the honoured
names of Newton and Cauchy, have not disdained to treat, and
to give to the world their comparatively imperfect results on this
very subject.     I hope, therefore, to stand excused of any undue
egotism in adding some observations which may tend to present,
under a clearer aspect and more finished form, the new and beau
tifully flexible rule laid before the readers of this Magazine in
the two preceding Numbers.

   Art 2. And much more generally it may be shown, in like
manner, that if the successions of signs in the series consisting
of the sign + followed by the signs of the principal coefficients
in X1, X2,          ...
                 Xmºn consist of m variations and n continua
tions, the number of real roots of the equation X,+,-0 will
be at least as great as the positive value of the difference between
m and n.    This theorem, moreover, remains true if X1, X2, Xs, &c.
be formed from a symmetrical matrix, in which the terms, instead
of being linear functions of w, are any odd-degreed rational inte
gral functions of w, or fractional functions of which the numera
tors (when rendered prime to their denominators) are odd-degreed
functions of w. My friend M. Borchardt, who has so beautifully
effected the decomposition of my formulae for the Sturmian cri
teria of reality into the sums of squares for the secular-inequality
form of the equation, may now, if he pleases, tax his ingenuity
to effect    a    similar decomposition for the general case supposed in

June 9, “         ESEARCHES         on the distribution of the Blood-vessels,
  1853.      -      &c. in the Lungs.”     By James Newton Heale, M.D.
    After   referring to the   discrepancies    in the opinions entertained
by anatomical writers both with respect to the distribution and to
the functions of the blood-vessels with which the lungs are supplied,
the author states the leading features in which the observations made
by him differ from those which have hitherto been published.              He
finds that:—
    1st. The pulmonary artery makes no anastomosis whatever with
any other artery, nor do its own branches anastomose together; its
branches go direct to the air-cells, and are there distributed, and ter
minate as arteries; none of its branches go to any other tissues of
the lungs besides the air-cells, except some few which perforate the
sub-pleural cellular tissue, and are distributed to the pleura; some of
these also cross the posterior mediastinum beneath the pleura, and
reach the thoracic pleura.
    2ndly. The bronchial (so-called) arteries have their own special
distribution, which will be described further on; they do not supply,
in the smallest degree, any portion of the bronchial mucous membrane,
and they form no sort of communication, either with the pulmonary
 arteries or veins, except as supplying their cellular sheaths, and
 therefore in all probability furnishing their vasa vasorum.
    3rdly. The bronchial mucous membrane is very freely supplied
with an exceedingly vascular plexus, of a peculiar and very charac
 teristic description, which is found to ramify in every part of the
 bronchial membrane, and which may be traced even as high as the
 trachea. The whole of this plexus is derived from the air-cells, and
 terminates ultimately by means of minute radicles, which form trunks
 and join the pulmonary veins.          No trace whatever of any branches
 of the pulmonary artery, previous to this becoming capillary in the
 air-cells, is found in any part of the bronchial membrane.
    4thly. The blood being brought to the air-cells by means of the
 pulmonary artery, is wholly returned by the pulmonary veins; but
 the trunks of these latter are formed by the junction of two distinct
 sets of radicles, namely, one set which comprises those which are
 formed from the perimeters of the air-cells (i.e. that part of the
 air-cell which is distant from the bronchial tube to which it is
 connected), and which at once form trunks which are visible on the
 surface of the lungs, and of all the lobules, and especially of the
 surfaces which adjoin the interlobular fissures; the other set consists
 of those which are derived from the bases of the air-cells, and which
 supply the bronchial membrane, and then terminate by radicles form
 ing trunks, which join the before-mentioned set of pulmonary veins;
 and from these conjoined, the larger venous trunks are derived, which
 at length accompany the larger bronchi, and the pulmonary arteries,
 and which finally terminate in the left auricle of the heart; so that

218                           Royal Society.
the blood brought to the left auricle is formed of that portion which
comes direct from the air-cells, and that which, after leaving the
air-cells, has undergone the further process of distribution on the
bronchial membrane, and has been the source from whence the
epithelium and the bronchial mucus have been derived, and may
therefore be considered as somewhat altered in character from that
which, coming direct from the air-cells, has not been exposed to
such changes.
   5thly. It is possible to inject entirely the pulmonary artery and
veins, without injecting the bronchial artery or veins; and it is also
possible thoroughly to inject the latter without at all injecting the
former; and when that is the         case, i. e. the (so-called) bronchial
 arteries are injected while the pulmonary vessels are empty, it will
 be found that the bronchial membrane is wholly uninjected, however
 perfectly the (so-called) bronchial vessels may have been filled.
     6thly. By injecting the lung through the pulmonary veins, the
 bronchial membrane becomes thoroughly injected, even before the
 air-cells are so; on the contrary, when the pulmonary artery is alone
 injected, the air-cells become injected long before the liquid reaches
 the bronchial membrane. In neither of these cases are the bronchial
 arteries, i.e. those derived from the aorta or veins which correspond
 to them, in the slightest degree injected.
    7thly. The bronchial arteries, which are injected by filling the
 aorta, terminate in veins, which ramify in the subpleural cellular
 tissue; the greater part of these, after ramifying on the surface of the
 lung beneath the pleura, pass along the broad band of pleura, which
 extends from the peduncle of the lung to the posterior mediastinum,
 and encloses the root of the lung, and which may be called the
 mesopleura, and the veins then empty themselves into the oesophageal
 veins and other veins in the posterior mediastinum.           It is probable
 also that some terminate in the     azygos   veins, the  jugular   veins, the
 diaphragmatic veins, and the venæ cavae; in short, wherever they
 can meet with a systemic vein situated conveniently; but they form
no sort of communication with the pulmonary veins, either in their
 capillaries or their larger trunks.
    8thly. It is found that the coats of the lymphatic vessels of the
lung are supplied by blood-vessels which are derived from the air
cells, and which terminate in the pulmonary veins, and the distribu
tion of the blood-vessels on the coats of the lymphatics bears a strong
resemblance to those distributed on the bronchial membrane.
    The author then describes his apparatus for injection; the sub
jects injected; and the drawings which accompany his communica
tion. In conclusion he states, that sufficient has been adduced to
confute the opinion that there is one set of vessels for the nutrition
of the lung in     itsordinary acceptation, and another for the respira
tory function.     Without doubt the bronchial (so-called) vessels and
the pulmonary are distinct, both       as   totheir distribution and func
tions; the one being for the purposes        of breathing, while the other
solely supplies the cellular tissue   of the  organ.

Librarian of the University of Cambridge, &c.
    For the train of thought which suggested the considerations in
this communication, the author states that he is more particularly
indebted to the researches of Professor Draper of New York, con
tained in his work “On the Organization of Plants, the Chemical
 effects of the Solar Rays,” &c., his experiments tending to show
 that the law of action and reaction which prevails so generally in
 other departments of nature is no less true in    the varied phaeno                     all

to be exactly equal to the sum of the vires viva of the reflected and
refracted rays.    But if it be partly expended on the medium and
partly upon the emergent rays, the vis viva of the incident ray ought
to exceed the vires viva of the reflected and refracted rays by a certain
quantity.    The object of his present investigation was to take into
account the effect of such supposed excess, in the hope of arriving at
some explanation of the Stokesian phaenomena.         The remarkable re
sult he has   obtained,  that  every loss of vis viva will be accompanied
with a diminution of the refractive inder, is quite in the direction of
Professor Stokes's own idea of “a change of refrangibility,” but
throws no light on the change of period. This the author is inclined
to think is due to an action of the nature of harmonic resonance, and
from some calculations which he has made, he thinks it probable
that the light produced in the Stokesian experiments may be due to
resonant vibrations which are about a major or minor third lower in
pitch than those of the invisible rays producing them.
   The mode of procedure which appeared to the author most likely
to lead to a successful result, was to assume, in the first instance,
the hypothesis that the vis viva is expended solely on the reflected
and refracted rays, and afterwards to modify, if possible, the steps
of the process so as to adapt them to the hypothesis that a portion
of it is expended on the medium. In adopting the more simple hy
pothesis, he was much struck by the formulae at which he arrived;
for not only did the general law of refraction spring out most unex
pectedly, but the very same expressions for the intensity of the re
flected rays, which were first discovered by Fresnel, and subsequently
verified by the experiments of Brewster and Arago, were an imme
diate consequence of the formulae.        His results however differ in
some particulars from those of Fresnel.      In the first place, the index
of refraction is not the   simple   quotient of the velocities of undula
tion, but of those velocities each multiplied by the density of the
aether in the corresponding medium.       In the second place, the vibra
tions of the aethereal  particles  are performed   in the plane of polar
ization, and not perpendicular to that plane, as Fresnel supposed.
Further, the expressions for the intensities of the refracted rays
differ slightly in other respects from those of Fresnel, as given in
Airy's Tracts.
   The author states that he confines his attention to an isotropical
singly refracting medium, though he thinks, if he had more time at
his disposal, he could extend the theory to doubly refracting crystals.
A very simple integration gives him a general expression for the vis
viva of an elementary cycloidal wave, in terms of the amplitude and
the constants of the periodical function.      By help of this he obtains
two   equations  of vis viva;   one for a wave whose vibrations are in
the planes of incidence, and the other for a wave whose vibrations
are perpendicular to that plane, both vibrations being transverse to
the axis of the ray.     By the principle of superposition these two
equations will hold true simultaneously when the above waves are
regarded as the components of one and the same wave. He obtains
three other equations between the amplitudes from the simple con
                                                                  *

sideration that a particle situated in the common surface of the two
media cannot vibrate in more than one way at once. Of these three
equations two involve the amplitudes of the first component wave,
and the third those of the second. The five equations serve to de
termine, in terms of the angle of incidence and the component am
plitudes of the incident wave, the five following quantities, namely,
the angle of refraction, the two component amplitudes of the re
flected wave, and those of the refracted wave.
    By the aid of the result referred to, that every loss of vis viva is
always accompanied by a diminution of the refractive index, coupled
with the general view which he takes of the cause of absorption,
the author is enabled to give an explanation of Frauenhofer's lines,
and in general of the lines of absorption in coloured media; and also
to explain the phaenomena discovered by Sir David Brewster, that
violet light may exist in the blue spaces, and blue light in the red.
    In the course of the investigation, the altered expressions for the
intensities of the reflected and refracted rays, so far as they are
affected by the coefficient of absorption, are given. The expressions
for the intensities of the two component reflected waves are very
little affected; but those for the intensities of the two component
refracted waves are materially altered in value.
    The theory likewise affords an explanation, the first the author
believes that has ever been offered, of the remarkable properties of
 saccharine solutions and of certain crystals, such as right-handed
 and left-handed quartz, which exhibit the phaenomenon of circular
 polarization.

The polypary is a simple unorganized secretion deposited in layers
from the ectoderm. In the endoderm, the author points out a di
stinct and well-developed glandular structure composed of true
secreting cells, which are themselves produced in the interior of
mother-cells, and elaborate a brown granular secretion which he
assumes as representing the biliary secretion of the higher animals.
He describes, as a system of special muscles, certain longitudinal
fibres, which may be distinctly seen in close connection with the
inner surface of the ectoderm.    The tentacula are shown to be
continuous tubes communicating with the cavity of the stomach,
and thus possess the same essential structure as those of Hydra ;
they are formed of a direct continuation of the ectoderm of the
polype, lined by a similar continuation of the endoderm.                    The
appearance of transverse septa at regular intervals, which is so very
striking in these tentacula, must not be attributed to the existence
of true septa. It is due to a peculiar condition of the endodermal

 that the mean central disturbing force of the sun, by which the
 moon's gravity towards the earth is diminished, depends not only
 on the sun's mean distance, but also on the eccentricity of the
 earth's orbit.      Now this eccentricity is at present (and for many
 ages has been) diminishing, while the mean distance remains unal
 tered.     In consequence of this, the mean disturbing force is also
 diminishing, and therefore the moon's gravity towards the earth at
 a given distance                  is,
                            on the whole, increasing.             Also the area de

 by   this alteration         the central force; whence

 that the moon's mean distance from the earth will be diminished in
                              as            given distance        increased, and the
 the same ratio         the force                    be at a                               is

 will   beobserved that this       reasoning     supposes    that the area described
 by the moon           given time

the disturbing force multiplied by the rate of change of the square
of the eccentricity. It is evident that this alteration of areal velocity
will have a direct effect in changing the acceleration of the moon's
mean motion.
   Having thus briefly indicated the way in which the effect now
treated of originates, the author proceeds with the analytical inves
tigation of its amount.      In the present communication, however, he
proposes to confine his attention to the principal term of the change
thus produced in the acceleration of the moon's mean motion, de
ferring to another, though he hopes not a distant opportunity, the
fuller treatment of this subject, as well as the determination of the
secular variations of the other elements of the moon’s motion,
which, arising from the same cause, have also been hitherto over
looked.
   In the usual theory, the reciprocal of the moon's radius vector is
expressed by means of a series of cosines of angles formed by com
binations of multiples of the mean angular distance of the moon
from the sun, of the mean anomalies of the moon and sun, and of
the moon’s mean distance from the node ; and the moon's longitude
is expressed by means of a series of sines of the same angles, the co
efficients of the periodic terms being functions of the ratio of the
sun's mean motion to that of the moon, of the eccentricities of the
two orbits and of their mutual inclination.
   Now, if the eccentricity of the earth's orbit be supposed to remain
constant, this is the true form of the expressions for the moon's co
ordinates; but if that eccentricity be variable, the author shows that
the differential equations cannot be satisfied without adding to the
expression for the reciprocal of the radius vector, a series of small
supplementary terms depending on the sines of the angles whose
cosines are already involved in         and           it,

    It will, of course, be necessary to carry the approximation much

    In conclusion, the author states, that the existence of the new
 terms in the expression of the moon's coordinates occurred to him
 some time since, when he was engaged in thinking over a new me
 thod of treating the lunar theory, though he did not then perceive
 their important bearing on the secular equation. His attention was
 first directed to this subject while endeavouring to supply an omis
 sion in the Theory of the Moon given by Pontécoulant in his
 ‘Théorie Analytique.”      In this valuable work, the author, follow
 ing the example originally set by Sir J. Lubbock in his tracts on
 the lunar theory, obtains directly the expressions for the moon's
 coordinates in terms of the time, which are found in Plana's theory
by means of the reversion of series. With respect to the secular
acceleration of the mean motion, however, Pontécoulant unfor
tunately adopts Plana's result without examination.        On perform
ing the calculation requisite to complete this part of the theory,
the author was surprised to find that the second term of the expres
sion for the secular acceleration thus obtained, not only differed
totally in magnitude from the corresponding term given by Plana,
but was even of a contrary sign. His previous researches, however,
immediately led him to suspect what was the origin of this discord
ance, and when both processes were corrected by taking into account
the new terms whose existence he had already recognized, he had
the satisfaction of finding a perfect agreement between the results.

and on its Chemical and Physiological Relations.”       By Arthur Hill
Hassall, M.D., Physician to the Royal Free Hospital, &c.               -
    The author was led to the investigations laid before the Society
in the above communication, by the following circumstances —
    Some three or four years since, when examining urinary deposits
under the microscope, he frequently observed in the field of vision
particles of a deep blue colour; so often did this occur, that he
could not even then help suspecting that their presence was not ac
cidental; however, no analysis of the blue colouring matter was
made at that time, and the circumstance was in a fair way of being
forgotten, until the recollection of it was revived by another oc
Currence.
    In June 1852, a sample of urine, freely exposed to the air in an
open vessel, was observed after four or five days’ exposure, gradually
to change colour; the pellicle or scum which had formed upon the
surface of the urine became first slate-coloured, and at length deep
blue, with here and there a rusty-red tint. The urine also under
went at the same time some remarkable changes; it became thick
and turbid, deep brown, greenish, bluish-green, and finally of a
faded yellowish-green colour; a considerable sediment was found
at the bottom of the glass; this was deep brown, intermixed with a

little blue colouring matter, and it had a medicinal smell resembling
somewhat that of Valerian.     In this state, without undergoing any
further material changes, the urine remained for many days.
 . Examined with the microscope, the scum or pellicle on the sur
face was found to consist of vibriones, innumerable animalcules, and
crystals of triple phosphate, with a great many fragments and gra
nules of a deep and bright blue colour.
   A second sample of the same urine was therefore procured, taking
every precaution to avoid fallacy.          Gradually the same changes en
sued as in the first    sample,   and this likewise became blue.          Having
thus ascertained that the        changes   observed were due to       something
contained in the urine itself, the author next proceeded to set aside
in open vessels, a series of urines           from the same patient, noting
                                                       all
the alterations which occurred from day                  day; these samples

 evaporation, it gave a further supply of indigo, which was formed
 most freely at the edge of the liquid. The residue was made black
 by concentrated sulphuric acid and deep brown by potash.
    The blue colouring matter.—Of two samples of this in a dry state,
 mixed with a large quantity of earthy phosphates, vibriones, mucus,
 and epithelium, one gave a dark brown solution with concentrated
 sulphuric acid, and the other a dirty blue.          Both of these solutions
 were decomposed by water, furnishing in the former case a dark
 brown deposit, and in the latter a dirty green.              In most of their
 other reactions, however, they presented the characters of indigo;
 and it is especially deserving of notice, that they were reduced by
 lime and sugar, giving a liquid from which hydrochloric acid threw
 down a greenish-blue precipitate.
    The cause of concentrated sulphuric acid giving with one of these
 samples a brown solution, and with the other only a dirty blue, was,
 the author considers, mainly owing to the large quantity of animal
 matter with which the specimens were contaminated; the acid, from
its charring effect on this, would produce a brown or blackish solu
tion, thus obscuring the colour of the solution of indigo.
    The brown extractive.—The          brown extractive yielded nearly the
same results as on          first analysis, and the aqueous solution fur

cyanourine and indigo are very closely connected with each other,
if they           be
            not identical.    He observes,            least singular that      it   is   at

 be nothing more than cyanourine mixed with urrhodine.

ciful speculations. Their principal objection, reasonable or not, was
  that this aethyle was a purely ideal substance. From hydrochloric
 acid, or from water, we readily procure hydrogen.                We separate
 metals from their combinations; but aethyle could not thus be ob
 tained, and there was a point where it seemed that this analogy
 failed.    Frankland however has silenced this objection in the most
 satisfactory manner, namely by procuring and isolating this aethyle.
     He prepared it by a modification of the form of experiment by
 which hydrogen itself is prepared.            He placed together zinc and
 iodide of aethyle in tubes hermetically sealed, and heated them con
 siderably above the boiling-point of water. On opening the tubes,
 the aethyle escapes as a colourless combustible gas.            There is only
 one property of aethyle on which                       I
                                           need dwell—its specific weight;
 it is about twice the weight of air.
    AEthyle, however, when procured, did not realize                 the antici                   all
                             of
 pations formed              and there was one very important difference
                             it,
 between the actual and the anticipated aethyle.                 was supposed                It
 that when zinc acts upon iodide             hydrogen,  of  takes away (so           it                                to
 say) the iodine, and the hydrogen becomes what               termed free, and          is
 the same with aethyle.       On this view, acthyle would have            certain                       to a
 atomic constitution, C*H*.         Now there       much reason      is  believe,

   As the difference given by theory is 0.000716, the agreement
may be regared as satisfactory.
   The second method admits of far greater exactitude. Two similar
pendulums, but differing somewhat in length, were suspended in the
plane of the meridian at 7 decims. distance from each other.       The
distance of the point of suspension from the centre of the weight
amounted, in the long pendulum, to 10,216 millims., and in the
short pendulum to 10,115.        The conical rotations, one right and
the other left, were impressed upon both pendulums simultaneously,
and the simultaneous passage of their suspending wires across the
meridian was observed by a telescope, the optic axis of which, when
the pendulums were at rest, intersected both wires. The number of
oscillations n, n' of the two pendulums accomplished between two
coincidences was noted ; and we thus had n'=(n+1), where n'
refers to the shorter pendulum.
   When the series was finished, the pendulums were arrested, and
set in motion in the opposite directions; the coincidences were
again observed, and the numbers N and N'-(N-H 1) were deter
mined.

  I wished    to ascertain whether the presence of iron exerted any
influence   upon  the results, and therefore enclosed the mercury of
one of   my   copper  cylinders in a cylinder of iron which weighed
900   grms.    For the difference of both oscillations we now obtained
                                                 O''.000702;
hence the influence of the iron may be regarded as almost null.
   From the whole number of my observations, I conclude that with
a pendulum    10 metres long, when it rotates conically from west to
east, the angular velocity at Paris is retarded 11":4 per second of
time; on the other hand, when the motion is from east to west, the
velocity is increased by the same amount.
   From these observations the length of the simple seconds pendu
lum may be deduced when the following corrections are taken into
account:—
  1. The effect of temperature.
  2. The loss of weight by the air; according to Dubuat, Bessel
and Poisson, the motion of this fluid must also be taken into account.
  3. The sinking of the centre of oscillation under the centre of
gravity.
   4. The diurnal course of the chronometer or of the clock.
   5. The effect produced by the weight of the suspension-wire on
raising the centre of oscillation, an effect which in my experiments
amounted to 10.6 millims.
   6. Finally, the bending of the wire to the form of a catenary by
the simultaneous action of                      its
                                weight and its centrifugal force. From
this    follows that the lowest tangent       the wire, prolonged
                                                               to      the                            to

         rotation, would intersect the latter      point which must at
                                                                     a                                       be

                                                 of          the wire.                of                     I
find     by
         calculation that       subtractive correction

necessary, which        almost the same        the foregoing, and

experiments rises            to is
                        10.5 millims.
   Applying these corrections, find the length    I    the simple seconds  of
pendulum       Paris =993.77

EXAMINATION                OF   A     RED WARIETY OF MOLYBDATE OF LEAD FROM

  In     the Proceedings for the 30th March  this year   descrip    of                     is  a

by me, and in which it is stated that could not detect chromium
either by the moist way or before the blowpipe.   In the July num
ber of Silliman's Journal, page 105, among the mineralogical notices
by Mr. W. T. Blake, he observes that the specimens from the
Wheatley mine, which he mistook for chromate of lead, have been
found to be the molybdate containing chromic acid.                      I find also in
Dana's    Mineralogy,       under   the head    of this  mineral,    the  observation
that “a red      variety   contains   a few    per cent.   of   chromic     acid.”    In
my former      analysis         I
                            looked   particularly   for this acid    without    finding
it.   Supposing that Mr. Blake had been more fortunate than myself,
I  repeated the examination                    on

        oN THE PRETENDED occuRRENCE OF IODINE IN MILK, EGGS,
            AND THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR.  BY DR. LOHMEYER.
    Some years since, Chatin instituted some investigations upon the
 distribution      iodineof   not only found
                                     ;    he             spring-waters, it   in   all

                           plants,    the most various articles

it constantly occurs also   as an essential constituent in the inhabit
ants of our rivers and in land animals.
   As it was shown, about the same time, by Meyrac, Marchand and
others, that the distribution of iodine is much more considerable than
had hitherto been supposed, it could excite no surprise that it should
be found in the animal organism; here, as everywhere in nature, it
was to be regarded as the constant companion of the chlorine
compounds.
   Chatin, however, regards iodine not as an accidental, but as an .
essential constituent of the organs; and according to his statements
with respect to the quantities of it contained in eggs, milk, &c., he
appeared to be perfectly right in so doing.     According to Chatin, a
hen's egg contains more iodine than 1 litre of milk, whilst this again
contains more than our usual articles of food and beverage. He also
considers iodine to be of importance in the respiratory process.   Nor
mally the air contains 1:500 milligrim. of iodine in 4000 litres, and
during respiration 4-5 are said to disappear.       Fourcault, who has
occupied himself with the study of the causes of goitre and cretinism,
examined the air in those places where these diseases are indige
nous; in these localities he found the atmosphere free from iodine,
and concluded accordingly that the deficiency of iodine was the
principal cause of goitre and cretinism. Chatin immediately proved
that the air of the Alps was much poorer in iodine than the atmo
sphere of Paris; he found less iodine in the valley of the Rhone
than in that of the Seine, less still in the valley of the Isère, and a
constant diminution towards the Alps. He only met with it again
in the plain of Piedmont, after it had eluded his investigations on
the French side of the Alps.
    As therefore the influence of iodine appears to be of the greatest
importance to the development and continuance of the animal or
ganism, the author regarded the testing of Chatin's statements as of
sufficient importance to undertake it himself with great care.
    Goitre does not occur in Göttingen, whilst in some of the neigh
bouring villages, in Lengden, for instance, it is very frequently met
with. If the want of iodine in the air were the cause of the evil, it
might be expected that a difference would be presented between the
quantity of iodine contained in the air of Göttingen and that of
Lengden. The author therefore examined first the air of Göttingen;
he allowed 4000 litres of air to pass in small bubbles through a stra
tum of solution of caustic soda 18 inches in thickness, adding quick
lime to the solution from time to time to remove the carbonic acid
which was taken up by          The apparatus was
                              of it.                   arranged that the

with a similar result. Thus no trace of iodine was to be found in
12 eggs or in 600 or 6700 grims. of milk. The fluids in which the
iodine must be concentrated amounted in all cases only to a few
centimetres; for testing them, cold starch-paste and pure nitric acid
into which nitrous acid had previously been passed were employed.
   The author does not deny, that, by the employment of still larger
quantities of milk and eggs, the exhibition of iodine may perhaps be
possible, and that under certain circumstances iodine may also occur
in the atmosphere, especially in the neighbourhood of manufactories
and chemical laboratories; but from his experiments he considers
that he may draw the conclusion, that Chatin's statements are to
be considered as erroneous throughout, and that the absence of
iodine in the air cannot be the cause of goitre and cretinism.—

    1801, year     only after the discovery of the battery, Pepys
IN demonstrated      a
                    that when a battery was placed in air, an
absorption of oxygen took place, and that the current showed a
tendency to cease when nitrogen alone remained.
   Since then, Biot and Cuvier, De la Rive, Joule, and Adie
have successively demonstrated this same influence of oxygen.
   This class of experiments may be considered as having formed
one of the principal bases of the electro-chemical  theory; and
for a long  time  oxygen  by    presence  was   its
                                              supposed    act                               to            on

   These are the principal experiments known to me, which tend
clearly to show the influence of oxygen in batteries.
   Independently of the facts just cited, and of some others to
be afterwards mentioned, many other phaenomena, involving
certainly the presence of oxygen, may be found in the memoirs
of Porret, Marianini, GErsted, Sturgeon, De la Rive, Becquerel,
Faraday, Vorsselman de Heer, Poggendorff, Ed. Becquerel,
Schröder, Adie, Beetz, &c.         I have made many experiments
upon the effects produced by agitating the plates immersed in
the liquids, by elevating the temperature of one of the plates, by
the ebullition of the liquids, and by exposing the one, or the
other, or both plates to the action of the atmosphere.         Almost
all these  phaenomena   vary  with the nature     the liquids     of

nature, connected with a galvanometer, are plunged into the two
tubes, and then the deviation of the needle observed.
   Unfortunately, by employing the same electrolyte, deviations
in the same direction are not always obtained with plates of the
same nature. The experiments appeared generally to indicate
that the presence of oxygen upon a plate renders it negative;
but contradictory experiments, although few in number, throw
some doubt upon the conclusions one is here tempted to draw.
    Let us therefore examine the causes capable of producing such
a variation in the results.

cleansing them chemically, or by exposing a fresh metallic sur

galvanometers,              I think
                           that the presence of these substances, on
a certain length of the wires or stems of the plates employed,
could scarcely have given rise to new causes of current.
   At first, simple glass tubes, 12 millimetres in diameter and 1
decimetre long, were operated with, but afterwards some experi
ments were repeated with two series of four new porous cells,
such as are used in Bunsen’s battery; before using the latter
they were boiled for a long time in pure water.
   As electrodes, wires, plates of 6 square centimetres, and lastly,
plates of from 30 to 40 square centimetres were used.
   In the course of the investigations, where it was necessary to
observe currents of very different intensities, various galvano
meters were employed”.        Their sensitiveness was made to vary
very much ; sometimes by means of a simple magnet, according
to Melloni’s method, and sometimes by means of a small mag
netic compass with which Ruhmkorff provides his galvanometers.
Occasionally the needles were rendered sufficiently astatic as to
require 120 seconds to make a complete oscillation.
   When the plates are withdrawn from one apparatus in order
to plunge them into the other, it is necessary to operate quickly,
and to avoid as much as possible                   all
                                        agitations which could modify

     The experiments with zinc were made either with distilled
 zinc or with amalgamated zinc.
     For some time the experiments with iron failed; for when
 ordinary iron wire, cleaned with emery paper, was used, the needle
 often made sudden leaps, thus rendering the observations ex
 tremely irregular.           It was only by employing perfectly polished
 steel knitting needles that regular results could be obtained.
     Sometimes copper wires were used, but oftener, plates of copper
 beaten flat with the hammer.
     The silver plates had been reduced from chloride of silver by
 means of potash, and may be regarded as very pure. The cop
per as well as the silver plates were well cleaned with emery
paper.
    }.     above tables show clearly the deportment of oxygen; for
example, from the results obtained with zinc and water, we see
that when the wires were plunged into boiled water, the devia
tions were almost null; that when the boiled water on the right
was replaced by acrated water, the deviation announced that the
right wire had become negative; and that when the aérated
water was to the left, the direction of the deviation was changed.
    When the two wires were plunged into acrated water, the
deviation was again almost null; but when the aërated water on
the right or on the left was replaced by boiled water, the right
or left plate became positive.
    The other tables but extend the same results to other metals
and other electrolytes.
    Instead of operating as above explained, another method was
often employed, which, though perhaps less sure, yet when em
ployed with care, leaves no doubt as to the influence of oxygen.
    Two plates, as identical as possible, were covered with test
tubes (fig. 3); these test-tubes and the vessel which served as
their recipient were filled with the same electrolyte, and subse
quently oxygen was passed into the one tube and the current
observed.        The results of these experiments confirmed those
already given, but,          I  must repeat, they require gitat care in

avoided.   The surface                     of
                          these plates contained 20 square centi
metres, and they were connected with the galvanometer       means                                   by
of extremely fine platinum wires.    The plates and the wires were

    needle rested almost stationary.    Passing from the first to the
    second pair caused a strong deviation of the needle; and this
    initial deviation, although it grew rapidly more feeble, indicated
    again that the presence of oxygen rendered the plate negative.
    These experiments succeeded easily with marine salt and with
    sulphuric acid.
y
       It is probable that by operating with platinized platinum,
    more powerful currents, and always in the same direction, might
    be obtained; for with sulphuric acid and two plates of platinized
    platinum, one of which was placed in oxygen, Beetz could not
    only observe a current, but could even deduce therefrom the
    electromotor force*.
       All the currents of which we have hitherto spoken may be
    very well explained according to the ideas of Faraday.              for                                If,

   This table evidently shows that, for the four elements therein
contained, the intensity of the current increases with the quan
tity of oxygen dissolved.
   The plates and liquids were varied in many ways, as may be
seen from the following table; the results, however, were always
similar.  No exception occurred, except with a battery of zinc
and iron in presence of dilute sulphuric acid, which, on account
of the abundant disengagement of hydrogen which then always
takes place, might have been easily foreseen.       We shall after
wards see how it is possible, even in this case, to verify the influ
ence   of oxygen.

  Experimentally, it is easy to prove that the presence of oxygen
upon the negative plate augments the current; but when it is
required to show that                  its
                          presence upon the positive plate dimi
nishes the same, the operation becomes very delicate.         most                                     In

     Neither       of these explanations can be general. Why is it
necessary to admit, in batteries where silver and copper are the
most oxidable metals, that the effect is due to depolarization,
when there are no facts supporting this hypothetical disengage
ment of hydrogen
   How is it possible to admit, in batteries where silver and pla
tinum form the negative plates, that the oxidation of these metals
can produce the current, when this oxidation in itself is so little
known as to be altogether disputed by many philosophers? How
can we conceive that platinum, the least oxidable of metals, can,
by    its
       oxidation and deoxidation, make,      the same time, most       at
oxygen disappear            7

these batteries, as far as could be recognized in a number of ex
periments in other respects very regular, the influence of oxygen
apparently disappears.    Nevertheless, the fact cannot be regarded
as contrary to the theory above exposed; for these batteries
possess a considerable electromotor force, and disengage hydrogen
in abundance, so that almost                      all

  XXXVII.     Note on a Question in the Theory                  of Probabilities.
                              By A. CAYLEY            +.
THEof following question was suggested to me, either by some
       Prof. Boole's memoirs on the subject of probabilities,
or in conversation with him,           I
                                 forget which ; it seems to me a
good instance of the class of questions to which it belongs.
   Given the probability a that a cause A will act, and the pro
bability p that A acting the effect will happen; also the pro
bability 8 that a cause B will act, and the probability q that B
acting the effect will happen; required the total probability of
the effect.
    As an instance of the precise case contemplated, take the fol
lowing: say a day is called windy if there is at least w of wind,
and a day is called rainy if there is at least r of rain, and a day
is called stormy if there is at least W of wind, or if there is at
least R of rain.    The day may therefore be stormy because of
there being at least W of wind, or because of there being at least
R of rain, or on both accounts; but if there is less than W of
wind and less than R of rain, the day will not be stormy. Then
o, is the probability that a day chosen at random will be windy,
p the probability that a windy day chosen at random will be
stormy, S the probability that a day chosen at random will be
rainy, q the probability that a rainy day chosen at random will
be stormy. The quantities A, p. introduced in the solution of
the question mean in this particular instance, A the probability
that a windy day chosen at random will be stormy by reason of
the quantity of wind, or in other words, that there will be at
least W of wind, a the probability that a rainy day chosen at
random will be stormy by reason of the quantity of rain, or in
other words, that there will be at least R of rain.
   The sense of the terms being clearly understood, the problem
presents of course no difficulty.    Let X be the probability that
the cause A acting will act efficaciously; p, the probability that
the cause B acting will act efficaciously; then
                          p=\--(1-X)p<U+017F>?
                          q=p1 + (l —p.)2X,
which determine X,       u; and the total probability               p   of the effect
is given by                p=X& +/18–Apaš,
suppose, for instance,    2=1, then
       p=X--1-Xp18,           q=A +N-Nu,                   p=N-HAB-Ap/8,
that   is,
         p=p, for    p   is  this case the probability that (acting
                              in
   cause which  is certain     act) the effect will happen,
                               to                                 what       or
is a
   the same   thing,  p
                     is   the probability that the effect will happen.

 this opinion.

a   curious fact, that wherever there       cavity which has projected

                        these circular spaces.   When two cavities
 have been near each      other, the circular  spaces unite and lose
 their form; and when the cavities have been more numerous,
 the circular spaces unite into very irregular shapes.    That these
 circular hollows     spaces between the laminae have been pro
                             or
 duced        by

268           Sir David Brewster          on the         Optical   Phaenomena        of
 most interesting specimen of this kind owe to Professor Fle  I
 ming, who pointed out to me one of the peculiarities which it
..contains.    This specimen is accurately represented, of the natural
 size, in fig. 2.   The largest of the five crystals is 0.28 of an inch
 broad, and the smallest 0.08 of an inch. Their thickness can
 not greatly exceed the thousandth of an inch, and yet it is with
 difficulty that the strongest sun-light can be seen through them.
 The form of the smallest is a perfect hexagon, and in the rest
 the same form is more or less distinct.          In the oval crystal
 there are numerous holes, and in all of them there are numbers
 of rectilineal cracks parallel to the sides of the hexagon, and
 some of them so narrow that light can scarcely pass through
 them.    When we look at the sun through one of these crystals,
 a curious optical phaenomenon is seen; a luminous hexagonal
 surface, composed of lines of light, parallel to the sides of the
 hexagon, and six beautiful radiations, like those of the asterial
 sapphire, perpendicular to the sides of the hexagon.
    The existence of these rectilineal fissures is an important fact
 in crystallography. It proves that the crystals were in a soft
 state after they had attained their present form; and that, in
 the process of induration, the fissures were produced by the
 shrinking of the tourmaline, in the same manner as similar fis
 sures are produced during the induration of clay.         In the mica
 which surrounds some of the crystals there is the appearance of
 considerable disturbance, but             I
                                     can find no trace of any cavity
 from which the tourmaline may have been ejected in a fluid
 state.   The faces of these crystals are not everywhere in optical
 contact with the mica, and it is very probable that they could
 be removed without any adhering mica, as I have occasionally
found crystals of tourmaline that were moveable between the
laminae.
   In the same specimen which contains these tourmalines, and
in others,      I
             have found, what                  I
                                   believe has never before been
observed, the woolly filaments of the Penicillium glaucum of Link,
with    its
         sporules scattered about between the laminae, and some
times beautifully moniliform,          the Penicillium glaucum ob

   In examining   remarkable specimen
                       a                  mica from Irkutsk   of                          in
Siberia, found titanium between the laminae
        I                                        various forms,          in

                 in                              powdery state          in
                                                                         a

          Tourmaline,      &c. within   Mica and other Minerals.                269
is opake; but at less thicknesses it has  a brownish transparency,
becoming almost perfectly transparent at thicknesses which do
not seem to exceed the 2000dth part of an inch. In fig. 3                         I
have given a drawing of an opake group executed for me with
minute accuracy by my celebrated friend M. Haidinger of
Vienna, during his residence in Edinburgh.        The transparent
groups are much more beautiful than the opake ones, the cry
stalline ramifications having the most diversified forms, resem
bling often regular organizations.
   When the mica is removed from above the titanium, so that
only an exceedingly thin film of it is left, the reflected light is
extremely brilliant, and consists of the most splendid colours.
These colours, which have always the form of the titanium, are
those which are produced by the thin film of mica which covers
the titanium, and are not produced, as has been supposed, by a
vacuity in the mica.
   In some specimens of mica from Bengal, the imbedded tita
mium is spread out in a very irregular manner from a nucleus,
sometimes having the form of a thin film ; sometimes of oriental
characters; and sometimes it is disseminated in grains so ex
tremely minute, that the flame of a candle seen through it is sur
rounded with a halo of five or six perfectly-formed coloured rings.

                                                      in
   While examining many years ago, along with the late Marquis
of Northampton, several bags          amethyst which had been im
                                        of
ported into Scotland from the Brazils, we were surprised
observe   anumber        fine pyramidal crystals, which seemed
                           of                                                     to to
have a  powdery matter distributed through their mass.         Upon
more   narrowly  examining    these  crystals,  found that this dust
                                                       I

270                        Sir David Brewster             on the      Optical        Phaenomena              of
the particles of dust were seen by the microscope to consist each
of several spicular crystals of titanium, crossing one another at
angles of 60° and 30°, and forming distinct groups.       In one
crystal there were two interior pyramids composed of these
groups; and it will be seen, from the explanation which     shall                                                I
presently give of this phaenomenon, that there may be any num
ber of such pyramids.
   As the crystals of amethyst are supposed to have been pro
duced by the gradual enlargement of a small crystal placed in
an amethystine solution, we have only to assume that a solution
containing titanium has been introduced into the amethystine
solution at different times during the growth of the crystal.
The small crystals of titanium will deposit themselves on each of
the surfaces of the pyramid; and when the whole of the intro
duced titanium has been thus deposited, the enlargement of the
amethyst will go on, leaving a pyramid of titanium crystals in                                                          its
interior.                  If

 If             we     now suppose that the amethystine                              solution        is   exhausted

   When light is reflected from the separating faces of the tita
nium and topaz, it is almost completely polarized; and at greater
angles than that of maximum polarization, colours of singular
brilliancy cross the reflected images.  These colours are doubt
less connected with the fact, that at some of these faces there
are three images of a luminous object seen by reflexion, one of
the two outer ones being polarized oppositely to one of the
double middle images, as in the case of the multiplication of
images   in composite crystals of calcareous spart.
               6. On the Crystals and Cavities in Garnet.
          greater number of the crystals of garnet which
     In the                                                  have                I
had occasion to examine,               I
                            have found many crystals and cavities,
and much amorphous matter.        In one specimen, in particular,
the included  crystals form a larger mass than the garnet, which
is merely a cement for holding them together.      These crystals
have various crystalline forms, while some are amorphous, though
regularly crystallized in their interior.  All these crystals are
doubly refracting, and give the colours of polarized light from
their small size.
   In another specimen, many of the crystals, in the form of
hexagons and rhombic plates, are opake, and exhibit by polarized
light the remarkable phaenomenon, which                      I
                                                 had never before
seen, of having luminous edges; so that when the rest of the
crystal and      all

                                                  is
rhombs, and other geometrical figures, depicted        lines    red      in          of
light.   It   not easy
               is                 to
                           ascertain the cause    this singular ap

pearance, because we cannot see the form     the crystals where
                                                byno

consist    light depolarized
          of                   reflexion from the sides     the                      of
hexagonal and rhombic plates, because the illuminating pencil
ismuch larger than the crystals, and the crystals                        much smaller
than the pupil         of
                   the eye,    that light must
                                           so                       be   reflected from
the prismatic faces          of
                       the hexagons and rhombic                          plates if they
have sufficiently broad faces, and that light                       so   reflected    must
enter the pupil        of   the eye.

274                 Mr. R. Carmichael            on Laplace's Equation,
tions, it is objectionable from the difficulty of determining the
arbitrary functions.     It may be observed that this last form is
unique, whereas in each of the two preceding cases we have
obviously as many general solutions as we can obtain particular
solutions of distinct types.   The order in which these forms have
been stated seems to be that of their chronological employment,
although the reverse of this order is that of their logical filiation.
   It is proposed in the following paper to exhibit general solu
tions of the class of partial differential equations to which the
Laplacian equation belongs, under these three several forms. It
is obvious that, as this class of equations contains no term in                                         its
right-hand member involving only the independent variables, the
general solutions will contain                   no
                                    determinate expression, but will
reduce themselves           the arbitrary portions solely.
                              to                                     will                      It        be
found that the      particular    solutions employed          the first and         in
second forms are duplicate, each indicating                second       close   a                  in
correlation with itself.               In

 286       M. W. Haidinger      on the Iodo-quinine Compound,
 gated in the four or six-sided tabular crystals in two positions,
 at right angles to each other.     There follows as the result—
    1. The substance-colour.—In common light, pale olive-green;
 in very thin plates, up to gºndth of an inch, colourless.               In
 polarized light, if the light is polarized in the long direction of
 the crystal, transparent and colourless, at least with thin cry
 stals; if the light is polarized in the transverse direction of the
 crystal, opake and black, however thin the plates may be.
    An increased interest in the crystals was excited by the follow
 ing optical investigations of the metallic surface-colours which
 Professor Stokes made known at the meeting of the British
Association in Belfast, September 1852. Abbé Moigno's Cosmos
contains a report of the communication.
    Professor Stokes found that in the same direction of polariza
tion of the reflected ray a vitreous lustre answered to the nearly
colourless tint, and the green metallic lustre to the dark or black
tint.   It follows, therefore,
    2. The surface-colour.—When polarized in the transverse direc
tion of the crystals, with a tolerably perpendicular incident ray
gives a metallic yellowish-green; with greater angles it varies
to a dark steel blue.
   As Professor Stokes discovered in the crystals here mentioned
the property of polarized surface-colour*, independently of my
observations of analogous crystals, and without having any
knowledge of them, so in consequence of the great interest of
the phaenomenon, he has given in detail the various modifications
of the observations and illustrative remarks respecting their
nature.
   When I read the report, the circumstance struck me particu
larly, that with similar polarizations a green metallic surface
colour should correspond to a complete black in the substance
colour. The black was in opposition to the perfect transparency
of the light polarized perpendicularly to the preceding colours.
I  had thought, by observations on a tolerable number of bodies,
to have satisfactorily established as a law, “that the surface
and substance-colours      stand in a complementary            relation to
each other.”      To the    “green   * of the surface a “red” in
the colour of the substance should have corresponded.                    It
was now my earnest wish to examine the crystals myself.
According to the method given in the Cosmos,             I could not suc
ceed in forming them; for through an unfortunate misprint,
instead of “solution d’iode dans l'alcool,” there were the words
“solution d'acide dans l'alcool.”     I had quite forgotten, that even
in  May   my   honoured friend Wöhler had written to me about
   * Dr. Herapath noticed that the metallic green reflected ray was a polar
ized beam, and assigned 41° as the angle necessary to produce polarization
by reflexion.—ED.

                         investigated           in       its   optical Relations.                                          287
the substance, and even communicated                    letter from M. Kindt  a
in    Bremen respecting it; also that                 experiment was made,   an
which, however, but imperfectly succeeded, and produced crystals
far too small. Wöhler had also sent me some very small crystals,
but neglected

                             to                      high magnifying power.
                                                                         a
Inow wrote afresh             Stokes and Wöhler.          The first kindly sent
                                  on to
me some       crystals         leaf  a  mica,   and  of

process      oftheir formation,       given above, and

distinct    crystals       Dr.to Ragsky    likewise        our chemical labora    in

     Through the dichroscopic lens now saw the dichroism, but      I
for   an  accurate examination the crystals were quite too small.

of the plates or crystals polarized perpendicularly to the axis.
    In the one, as with the other species, perfectly transparent
pale greenish crystals or plates polarize, when crossed, to a com
plete black. If the crystals are thin, the crossing produces only
red, just like the colour in the examination through the calca
reous spar of the dichroscopic lens. Very thin plates of andalu
site have a pale but evident red colour.     If two such plates are
laid in a parallel position on each other, the red vanishes, it is
absorbed, and the thicker pale green aggregate is in a surprising
degree lighter coloured than each single plate.         Just so, also,
the exceedingly thin crystal plates of the Herapathite are evi
dently pale red; indeed there are many crystals, which, being
unequally thick, exhibit both red and green parts. The more
evident the red, so much the more in the examination by polar
ized light does the tint polarized in the direction of the axis
approach to a perfect absence of colour, so that the crystals are
not at          all
           seen, while the image polarized perpendicularly                                              to  it

 XLIII.      On a new Method for the Determination of Urea.      By
      John W.    DRAPER,   M.D.,  Professor of Chemistry and Physio
      logy in the University of New York+.
Thisin urine
       method depends on the fact, that urea in solution or
             is immediately decomposed by nitroso-nitric acid,
 carbonic acid gas escaping with a brisk effervescence.
     In practice, therefore, the determination of urea is reduced to
 the determination of carbonic acid, one of the simplest operations
  of chemistry.
     It is to be recollected, that the carbonic acid thus set free will
 always be contaminated with a certain quantity of nitrous acid
 vapour; provision must therefore be made to exclude this
 source of error.      In a series of experiments which have been              I
 recently making on the constitution of urine,                        I
                                                         have resorted to
 several different  methods,     but  upon  the whole have preferred to
 determine the urea as carbonate of        baryta.
    As at the present time the attention of physicians is closely
 directed to variations in the composition of the urine, and new
 methods have been published by Liebig and others, the details
 of this one may perhaps be acceptable.           To the chemist, what                   I
 have already stated has made it intelligible.
    Preparation of the Decomposing Liquid.—The substance em
 ployed for the decomposition of the urea is nitroso-nitric acid.
 It may be made by passing into strong nitric acid, kept cold by
immersion in ice-water, nitrous acid arising from the decompo
sition of nitrate of lead by heat. The liquid assumes after a
while a green colour, and evolves dense red fumes; it is then
fit  for use. But      as  this process       somewhat troublesome,
                                                       is                                I
prefer the following.

dilute sulphuric acid          contact with the amalgamated zinc, and
strong nitric acid    in  the porous cup      contact with the platinum.

Connect the zinc and       platinum     together.   The nitric acid soon
begins    to change colour          by
                                   dissolving nitrous acid, and       few           in

   I was led up to a knowledge of the fundamental theorem (be
it new or old) by some recent researches connected with my
new Rule of Limits, considered with reference to the conditions
which must be satisfied when one of the limits found by the rule
comes into actual contact with a root; a contact which                    I  can
demonstrate is       always  possible,      as well for the   superior   as for
the inferior limits, and with so much the fewer equations (as
distinguished from inequations) of condition between the coeffi
cients of the assumed auxiliary function which the application of
the rule of limits requires, as there are fewer pairs of imaginary
roots in the function whose roots are to be limited.
   I  may add that the fundamental theorem is an immediate
result of the representation of the terms of the convergents to a
continued fraction under the form of determinants.               Thus, ea. gr.

   Thus the whole of the properties     of continued fractions are
deduced    without algebraical calculation from a theorem which
itself springs immediately by inspection from the well-known
simple rule for the decomposition of determinants.

June   16,   “        a Theory of the conjugate relations of two rational
  1853.          ON integral   functions, comprising an application to the
Theory of Sturm’s Functions, and that of the greatest Algebraical
Common Measure.”        By J. J. Sylvester, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Bar
rister at Law.
   The memoir consists of four sections. In the first section, the
theory of the residues obtained by applying the process of the common
measure to two algebraical functions is discussed.    It is shown that
a certain superfluous or allotrious factor enters into each, the value
of which, in terms of the leading coefficients of the residues in their
simplified form, is determined; and the simplified residues them
 selves are subsequently obtained from the given functions by a di
rect method.
    In the case where the two functions are of the same degree (m)
in a, m functions of the degree m—l in a are formed, which, being
identical with those employed in the process which goes by the name
 of Bezout's abridged method, the author terms the Bezoutics or
 Bezoutic primaries. By linear elimination performed between these,
 a second system of functions, whose degrees in a extend from
m–1 to 0, are formed, which he terms the Bezoutic secondaries:
these Bezoutic secondaries are proved to be identical with the sim
plified residues. A similar theory is shown to be applicable in the
general case of the functions being of unlike degrees.    Other modes
 of obtaining the simplified residues by a direct method are also given.
The coefficients of the primary system of Bezoutics form a square
 symmetrical about one axis, to which (as to every symmetrical ma
 trix) a certain homogeneous quadratic function of (m) variables is
appurtenant. This quadratic function is termed the Bezoutiant, the
properties of which are discussed in the fourth section.
    Every residue is what may be termed a syzygetic function or con
junctive of the two given functions; these being respectively multi
plied by certain appropriate rational integral functions, their sum
may be made to represent a residue. These multipliers are termed
the syzygetic multipliers; and they form two series, one corre
sponding to the successive numerators, the other to the successive
denominators of the convergents to the algebraical continued frac
tion which expresses the ratio of the two given functions.          The
residues are obviously a particular class of the conjunctives that can
be formed from the given functions; every conjunctive has the pro
perty of vanishing when the two functions to which it is appurtenant
vanish simultaneously; and in general, for any given degree in r, an
infinite number of such conjunctives can be formed.
    In the second section, the author commences with obtaining in
terms of the roots and factors of the two given functions, a variety
of forms,    all
               containing arbitrary forms       of
                                               function  intheir several
terms, and representing    a conjunctive   ofany degree not exceeding

 cated to the author by          M. Hermite; and an instantaneous demon
   stration is   given  of the  properties   of the author's formulae for Sturm’s
  auxiliary functions in determining the real roots of an equation by a
  method quite irrespective of the theory of the common measure, and
  depending upon a certain extremely simple but unobserved law of
  quadratic forms, which he terms the law of inertia. In place of these
  formulae it is shown that others greatly more general, and possessing
  the same properties as regards the determination of the real roots,
  may be substituted; the known formulae are, however, the most
  simple that can be employed. The author then proceeds to inquire
  as to the nature of the indications afforded by the signs of a series
  of successive simplified residues, taken between any two functions
  independent of one another, instead of standing in the relation of
  primitive and derivative, as in Sturm's theorem; this leads to the
  theory of interpositions, of which it is shown that the Sturmian
  theorem may be treated (not so much as a particular case) as an
  easy corollary.       In this part, the author obtains an entirely new
  rule for   determining,     in an infinite variety of ways, a superior and
  inferior limit to the real roots of any algebraical equation, whether
  numerical or literal.
      The fourth section is also divided into two parts. In the first
  part, the index of interposition for two functions of the same degree
  is shown to be determinable by means of the quadratic form, pre
  viously termed the Bezoutiant; and as a corollary, it follows that
  the number of real roots of an equation of the degree m depends in a
 direct manner on the number of positive roots in another equation
 of the degree m—1,                 all
                                     whose roots are real, and the coefficients
                                          of
 of   which are     quadratic   combinations                    of

 which is able to get through both media, it necessarily remains the
 same as before.       In the case of objects which are only feebly fluo
rescent, it is sometimes better to leave the second medium in its
place, and use a third medium, called by the author the transfer
medium, which is placed alternately in the path of the rays incident
 on the object-end of the rays coming from it to the eyes.
   Independently of illumination, the change of colour corresponding
 to the change of refrangibility, and the difference of colour with
 which the object appears, according as the transfer medium, or the
 complementary absorbent used as a transfer medium, is held in front

of detecting fluorescence.
   Instead of trusting to the absolute appearance of the object, it is
commonly better to compare it with some fixed standard. The
standard substance ought to be such as to scatter freely visible rays
of    all
        refrangibilities, but not         give out rays
                                                     to         one refrangibility

 of other animals. He more particularly adverts to a recently pub
 lished memoir by Dr. Keber, in which that physiologist describes
 the penetration of the spermatozoon into the interior of the ovum, in
 Unio and Anodonta, through an aperture formed by dehiscence of
 its coats, analogous to the micropyle in plants.
     Small pellucid vesicles, lined with ciliated epithelium and enclo
 sing a revolving mulberry-like object, such as the author discovered
 imbedded under the mucous membrane of the rabbit's uterus and
 described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1839, have been like
 wise observed by Keber, not only under the mucous membrane, but
 also and most frequently in some part of the cavity of the abdo
 men.    Keber considers these bodies to be fecundated ova.         The
 author agrees with Keber in considering them to be ova, but he does
 not suppose them to be fecundated, nor does he think that their
 membrane is the vitellary membrane (“zona pellucida”), which he
 believes to have been absorbed. He considers such ova to have been
 detached from the ovary along with their containing ovisac, which
in their new situation constitutes the ciliated capsule, and as they
present themselves in unimpregnated animals, he now believes that
the formation of a mulberry-like group of cells from the germinal
spot and the process of division and subdivision of the latter take
place without fecundation; but when this happens, the mulberry is
not found to contain one cell larger than the rest, the nucleus of
which, according to his observations, is the embryo. He is further
of opinion, that in           all
                          cases      separation
                                            of     ova, the ovisac      of                            or     in

     May   13,1853.-On some New Points in British Geology. By Prof.
 Edward    Forbes,  F.R.S., President of the Geological Society.
    Not many years ago it used to be said, that the geology of England
 was done, and yet the best investigated localities are constantly
 affording fresh discoveries. When the Lecturer last year exhibited
 Captain Ibbetson's beautiful and accurate model of Whitecliff Bay in
 the Isle of Wight, in illustration of his views respecting the distribu
 tion of species in time, he had not the slightest suspicion that this
 particular locality, so often and apparently so thoroughly explored,
 could yield new results and new interpretations.          Nevertheless,
 having had occasion, at the suggestion of Sir Henry De la Beche,
 to examine the tertiary strata of the Isle of Wight for the purposes
 of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, this very bay of White
 cliff proved to be a rich source of novel geological information.
 Moreover, a great portion of the Isle of Wight, on further examina
 tion, turned out to belong to a division of the older tertiaries, that
 had never been demonstrated to exist within the British Islands.
 As a general statement of these results and of their bearings may be
 more intelligible to non-professional lovers of geology than the de
 tailed memoirs about to be published on the subject, Professor
 Forbes has taken this opportunity of communicating them to the
 Members   of the Royal Institution.
    The Isle of Wight is divided into two portions by a great chalk
 ridge running east and west.     This is the ridge of vertical chalk
 beds. To the north of               it,
                           the country    composed    tertiary,                    of

 the British Association at Southampton, expressed his belief that
  Hempstead Hill, near Yarmouth, would prove to be composed of
 strata higher than those of Headon; and the Marchioness of Hastings,
 who, having given much time to the search for the remains of fossil
 vertebrata in the tertiaries of the Isle of Wight and Hordwell,
 declared her conviction that these remains belonged to distinct
 species, according as they were collected at Hordwell, Hempstead,
 and Ryde, and that these three localities could not, as was usually
 understood, belong to the same set of strata. The recently pub
 lished monograph of the pulmoniferous mollusks of the English
 Eocene Tertiaries, by Mr. Frederic Edwards, afforded also indications
 of the shells therein so well described and figured having been col
  lected in strata of more than one age.
     A few days’ labour at the west end of the island convinced Pro
  fessor Forbes that the surmises alluded to were likely to prove true,
  and that the structure of the north end of the island had been in the
  main misunderstood.        After four months’ constant work at both
  extremities and along the intermediate country, he succeeded in
  making out the true succession of beds, with most novel and gratifying
  results.    During this work he was greatly aided by his colleague, Mr.
  Bristow, and by Mr. Gibbs, an indefatigable and able collector
  attached to the Geological Survey.
     The freshwater strata of Whitecliff Bay proved to be wholly mis
 interpreted.      Instead of their being constituted out of the Headon
  Hill strata only, more than a hundred feet thickness of them are
 additional beds characterized by peculiar fossils, and resting upon a
 marine stratum that overlies the Bembridge limestone, the equiva
 lent of which at Headon is a soft concretionary calcareous marl,
 scarcely visible except in holes among the grass immediately under
 the gravel on the summit of the hill.
    The beds of the true Headon series, in fact, are              all
                                                              included      the    in
 subvertical portion      ofthe Whitecliff sections and are there present
in   their full thickness.     They are succeeded            by
                                                            peculiar strata             of
 intermediate character, for which the name                 of

                                        so
 stitute  a  valuable building stone. The Bembridge limestone that
lies above     is the same with the Binstead limestone near Ryde, out
of   which were procured the remains              of

any  of   those conspicuous among the fluvio-marine strata            Headon at
Hill, and with which they have hitherto been confounded. They are
far above them, and are distinguished             by

reous or other matters of inferior conducting power deposited from
the water by electrolysis, which soon diminished the available power
of the coil to a considerable extent, I was induced to invent a regu
lator in which liquids were dispensed with, and consequently all
electrolytic action avoided, and which, whilst being unaltered in
conducting power by long-continued use, possessed that valuable
property of the water-regulator, Lof enabling the power to be regu
lated by inappreciable degrees instead of by sudden increases and
decreases, as in all other kinds of coil regulators.
    The regulator I invented and have used in several instances for a
considerable period may be formed as follows:—Take equal quan

powdered rotten-stone, and form them into a series of separate
powders, each of equal quantity, to the number of eighteen or twenty;

all bronze powder with a little black-lead, the third with an increased
proportion of black-lead and less bronze, and so on increasing the
proportion of black-lead and diminishing that of bronze in a regular
manner until you come to the middle powder, which should consist
entirely of black-lead; then begin to form them of black-lead and
rotten-stone, gradually decreasing the former and increasing the
latter until you come to the last one, which should consist entirely
of rotten-stone; well mix each powder, and keep them                      separate                  all

the metal cap screwed in         upper end and its lower end screwed  its

XLVIII.     On the Methods of Measuring very Small Portions of
    Time, and their application to Physiological Purposes.         By
    Professor HELMHolTz+.
    T  is my intention today to direct the attention of the meet
       ing to a series of experiments with which I have lately
been occupied, and the object of which is to ascertain, by means
of the refined methods of measurement furnished by modern
physics, the duration of certain quickly-passing processes which
occur in the living body. In the first place,          I  may be per
mitted, so far as it is necessary to the understanding of what
is to follow, and so far as it is possible, without demonstration
on the apparatus itself, to describe the means by which it is ren
dered possible to measure as small fractions of a second of time
as those into which, by the help of the most powerful micro
scopes, our smallest unit of space, the line, may be divided.
   The perception of small differences of time by means of our
senses and without artificial help is not very fine, especially when
the processes whose difference of time is to be determined are
made the objects of different organs of sense, for example of the
eye and car, or even of different parts of the same organ, for
example, of the eye in various portions of the field of view.
The remarkable fact discovered by Bessel in the case of dif
ferent individuals observing the transit of stars may be men
tioned here. The observing astronomer perceives by the ear the
tick of the clock, at the same time he sees the motion of the star
towards the wire of the telescope, and endeavours to mark the
positions of the star at the last tick before crossing, and at the

cylinder, each half-degree thus occupying the 40,000        midth part of a
second.      Now if the     point   make two successive marks upon the
cylinder, we know that in the interval between both marks, as
many half-degrees will have passed by the point as there are
forty-thousandths of a second in the interval. Thus far, indeed,
the principle was carried out before Siemens; but the chief dif
ficulty which long defied the ingenuity of experimenters, was to
cause the times of marking upon the cylinder to correspond
exactly with the times of commencing and ending of the process
the duration of which was to be measured, for example, with the
precise points of time when the projectile struck two successive

accurately known, it may be calculated with precision how much
the velocity of the magnet must have been altered by the current
in order to produce the observed change in the oscillations, and

320            Prof. Helmholtz       on the Methods              of Measuring
You   see the methods are here for making infinitely finer mea
surements than we need at present.       The difficulty now is to
apply the method to the special cases, to construct the connect
ing links between the process whose duration is to be determined,
and the apparatus to be used for the determination.       Indeed,
the method must depend upon the object sought. In general                                          I
have found Pouillet’s electro-magnetic    method most advanta
geous, but for certain          purposes      the rotating cylinder is to be
preferred.
   The measurements which I have hitherto made refer partly to
the duration of muscular contractions, partly to the velocity with
which an impression made upon the nervous fibres is propagated
through these fibres. The living muscles in the human and
animal body are to be conceived of as strong elastic bands, which,
stretched between certain portions of the bony scaffolding, in a
tranquil position are either quite lax, or else their tensions com
pletely neutralize each other. The elastic forces of these bands,
bowever, possess the remarkable property that they can be sud
denly changed by the influence of the nerves. The state thus
brought about by the operation of the nerves is called the state
of muscular activity. The active muscle behaves also as an
elastic band, but it strives to shorten itself with far greater force
than the inactive one. The consequence of this change in the
living body         is,
                 that the force       the active muscle overpowers
                                          of
       ofthe inactive, the equilibrium                    destroyed,

to   ascribe         to        an    immense velocity.                           The latest admirable                in

 successful series amounted to only rººdth part of the whole
 value.   The difference between the measurements in which dif
 ferent points  of the nerve were excited was, on account of the
 shortness of the nerve, alsovery small, from one to two thousandths
 of a second; it was, however, ten times as great as the probable
 error of the results of the measurements.       The most probable
 value of the  velocity of  propagation  in the motor nerves of the
        I
 frog found to be 26-4 metres, about eighty feet per second.
 This quantity is indeed unexpectedly small, more than ten times
 less than the velocity of sound in the air.
    For warm-blooded animals the method described is not appli
 cable, because it requires series of measurements which occupy
 from one to two hours, during which the state of the body expe
 rimented with must remain constant.         have therefore had anI
 apparatus with a rotating cylinder constructed by M. E. Rekoss,

 which may perhaps be made use of with warm-blooded animals.

324              Prof. Helmholtz      on the Methods        of Measuring
with the frog.         Not only can we not remove the still unknown
influence  of the nervous conduction in the brain and the spinal
column, but we must actually make use of them in the course of
experiment.     After, however, having established by rigorous
experiments that in the nerves of the frog a sensible time is
required for the propagation of an impression, believe I need      I
not hesitate to indicate the results of the experiments which up
to the present time I have made upon the human subject.
   The intelligence of an impression made upon the ends of the
nerves in communication with the skin is transmitted to the
brain with a velocity which does not vary in different individuals,
nor at different times, of about 60 metres (195 feet) per second.
Arrived at the brain, an interval of about one-tenth of a second
passes before the will, even when the attention is strung to the
uttermost, is able to give the command to the nerves that certain
muscles shall execute a certain motion.        This interval varies in
different persons, and depends chiefly upon the degree of atten
tion; it varies also at different times in the case of the same
person. When the attention is lax, it is very irregular; but
when fixed, on the contrary, very regular.       The command travels
probably with the above velocity towards the muscle.           Finally,
about Tºndth of a second passes after the receipt of the com
mand before the muscle is in activity.         In all, therefore, from
the excitation of the sensitive nerves till the moving of the muscle,
14 to 2 tenths of a second are consumed.           The measurements
are effected similarly to those on the frog.         A slight electric
shock is given to a man at a certain portion of the skin, and he
is directed the moment he feels the stroke to make a certain
motion as quickly as he possibly can, with the hands or with the
teeth, by which the time-measuring current is interrupted. We
are therefore only able to measure the sum of the intervals above
indicated.    When, however, the impression is caused to proceed
from different spots of the skin, some nearer to the brain and
others more distant, we change only the first member of the
above sum, that            is,
                        the velocity     propagation
                                              of           the nerves. in
At    all

must, however, confess that this        not strictly proved fact;

indication     rendered probable
                 is                          by
                                        the fact, that the numerical

from the great toe arrives about ºth of a second later than from
the ear or the face.   If from the measured sum of the single
intervals be subtracted that which belongs to the conduction in
the sensitive and motor nerves, and also the time, determined by
other experiments, during which the muscle puts itself in motion,
the remainder is the time which passes while the brain is trans
ferring the intelligence received through the sensitive nerves to
the motor ones.
   Other experiments on man which corresponded to those on
the frog, inasmuch as the motor nerves were directly excited,
have up to the present time given no exact results, but they
suggest other interesting relations connected with the subject.
It is possible, for example, to cause the muscles of the fore-arm
to contract exactly like those of the frog by means of very feeble
electric shocks imparted to the nerves through the skin.                In
this case both hand and fingers are contracted; and it is shown
that these motions are totally independent of the influence of the
will, because the will, informed of the shocks by the sensible
nerves, cannot exert itself sufficiently soon upon the muscles.
Such a series of experiments, in which the hand fell back very
speedily, and when the very object sought was to retain it in the
bent position which it was caused to assume through the con
tractions produced by the electric shocks, failed totally, because
the influence of the will first reached the muscle after the hand
had fallen back again, and simply raised it a second time.
     Ifwe reflect on what has been said at the commencement of
this discourse regarding the inaccuracy of our impressions of
time, we see that the differences of time in the nervous impres
sions, which we are accustomed to regard as simultaneous,             near            lie
the limits      our capability

ences cannot          appreciated simply because the nerves cannot

THE
  gons of any number (odd or even) of sides are well known.
     “If there
             be a polygon of (m+1) sides inscribed in a conic,
and m of the sides pass through given points, the m+1th side
will envelope a conic having double contact with the given conic.”
And      “If     be a polygon of (m+1) sides inscribed in a

conic,    and of the sides touch conics having double contact
                     m
with the given conic, the m+1th side will envelope a conic having
double contact with the given conic.” The second theorem of
course includes the first, but                       I
                               state the two separately for the
sake of comparison with what follows.      -
  As regards the corresponding theory in geometry of three
dimensions, Sir W. Hamilton has given a theorem relating to
polygons of an odd number of sides, which may be thus stated:
“If there be a polygon of (2m+1) sides inscribed in a surface
of the second order, and 2m of the sides pass through given
points, the (2m+1)th side will constantly touch two surfaces of
the second order, each of them intersecting the given surface of
the second order in the same four linest.”
   The entire theory depends upon what may be termed the
transformation of a surface of the second order into itself, or
analytically, upon the transformation of a quadratic form of four
indeterminates into itself.   I use for shortness the term trans
formation simply; but this is to be understood as meaning a
homographic transformation, or in analytic language, a trans
formation by means of linear substitutions.      It will be conve
nient to remark at the outset, that if two points of a surface of
the second order have the relation contemplated in the data of
Sir W. Hamilton’s theorem (viz. if the line joining the two points
pass through a fixed point), the transformation         using the                            is,

that the relation contemplated in the conclusion of the theorem
(viz. that of two points of a surface of the second order connected
by a line touching two surfaces of the second order, each of
them intersecting the given surface of the second order in the
same four lines) depends upon a proper transformation; and that
the circumstance that an even number of improper transforma
tions required in order to make a proper transformation (that
this circumstance, I say), is the reason why the theorem applies
to polygons in which an even number of sides pass through fixed
points, i. e. to polygons of an odd number of sides.

second order such that the line joining them passes through a

    Dividing the linear equations by k, and forming with the
 coefficients on the right-hand side of the equation so obtained
 a determinant, the value of this determinant is +1; the trans
 formation is consequently a proper one. And conversely, what
 is very important, every proper transformation may be exhibited
 under the preceding form *.
    Next considering the equations                                    connecting                 w,    y, z, w with

the surface, and the line joining such point with              corresponding                    its

                 the corresponding point itself          altogether dropped            be
out   ofview.     There are two directions              which we may pass         in

The lines belonging to the curves of the one series generate a

second order         given, and also the two surfaces

sponding     to the first-mentioned      point,     may,      above,weconstruct
the entire system            corresponding points, and then the line
                                of
joining any two corresponding points will                       tangent        be

 be  called  a system          of
                            congruent tangents.        Now           take upon         if    we
the surface three points such that the first and second are corre
sponding points, and that the second and third are corresponding
points, then      it   obvious that the third and first are correspond
                          is
ing points;–observe that the two auxiliary surfaces for express
ing the correspondence between the first and second point, those
for the second and third point, and those for the third and first
point, meet the surface, the two auxiliary surfaces                   each pair              of
in  the same four lines, but that these systems                  four lines are     of
different for the different pairs           auxiliary surfaces.

                               given                                                            my becoming
IN ordinary
     discourse
         a            in 1845, on the occasion of
            professor, I communicated   the results     of certain
experiments,  which, although not without interest,     thought it                              I
well to defer publishing until time should enable me to render
them more complete.                        I
                           find, however, in the Comptes Rendus
of the 6th of June of the present year, a note by MM. Jamin
and Bertrand wherein a similar subject is treated in a different
manner. This induces me to lay the results of my experiments,
although they are still incomplete, before the Academy; partly
because they furnish a corroboration of the observations of
MM. Jamin and Bertrand, but more particularly because the
               I
method have adopted permits not only of establishing the fact
of condensation, but also to measure the amount of it as referred
to the unit of surface.
   After having found that different gases expand differently,
and M. Regnault, retracting his first communication, having
obtained values almost identical with mine, no doubt could exist
as to the accuracy of the different coefficients of expansion.  It
appeared, however, of interest to examine whether the gases were
condensed upon the interior surfaces of the glass vessels made
use
        of,
        and whether such      condensation exerted any influence
                                               a
on  the determination                  of
                          the coefficient    expansion.                   of
   The coefficient was therefore determined        first bringing the             by
gas into contact with    certain surface,

a larger surface    comparison in        volume     act upon
                                                          to   its                    to                  it.      In
the first case    glass tube was made use

          On the Condensation                     of    Gases by Smooth Surfaces.                        335
already found for sulphurous acid could not be made the basis
of comparison.  We must be sure that the gas made use of was
perfectly pure. Hence the coefficient of expansion was always
determined with the two surfaces simultaneously, making use of
two such instruments as that described in the memoir above
alluded toº. The tubes for both were filled at the same time,
by conducting the gas first through one and afterwards through
the other.
   The calculation of the coefficients of expansion is carried out
exactly as in the above memoir; and as the glass is of the same
kind as that formerly used, the same coefficient of expansion for
the glass is taken.
  The calculation gave for the coefficient of expansion of the
sulphurous acid from 0° to 100° C.

These numbers prove that a condensation has taken place upon
the surface of the glass. In order to calculate the magnitude of
the condensation, let                   . denote          the volume           of gas at 0° condensed
on the surface of the rods, and let the volume of the uncon
densed gas, or at least condensed only on the sides of the large
tube, be = 1, then we have

For the unit of the smooth surface of glass, the condensation of
sulphurous acid at 0° is therefore =0.0008 of the unit of volume.
   This calculation is based on the assumption that the conden
sation at 100° is a vanishing quantity.             If
                                            at this temperature
a condensation still exists, which might be ascertained by com
paring the expansion of the gas in the two tubes at high tem
peratures, then the condensation at 0° would amount to more
than 0.0008 of the unit of volume.
  It  remains to determine the condensation of other gases in a
similar manner; this is the more necessary, as the experiments
of MM. Jamin and Bertrand, so far as they have been made
known, have been confined to the condensation effected by
bodies   in powder.
   Having found the amount of the condensation upon smooth
surfaces, it appeared of interest to ascertain whether it is much
greater upon rough surfaces.
   Determinations of the coefficients of expansion were therefore
undertaken where spongy platinum was made use of instead of
glass.   To enable us to judge of the purity of the gas in
these experiments also, a tube was filled which contained no
platinum, while another contained 7 grammes of the substance.
Both tubes had nearly the same volume as the former ones, and
were filled at the same time.      In order to be certain that no
sulphuric acid was formed by the presence of the platinum and
atmospheric air, the tubes were first filled with hydrogen, the
spongy platinum being heated to redness by a lamp. The air
and water being thus completely expelled, the sulphurous acid
was conducted through both tubes, until on           escape     its
                                                              was         it
completely absorbed      bycaustic  potash;  the tubes were then
cooled, hermetically sealed, and fixed    the two pieces
                                               in           appa         of
ratus above mentioned.
   The determination     of   the coefficient       of    expansion      gave the
following result:
                              In   the tube.
  Without spongy platinum.                 With spongy platinum.
             0.38:22                                          0-3922
from which we obtain
                          *    =00005.
                          72
As the content of the tubes was the same                 as   the tubes with the

                                 by Smooth Surfaces.                                             337
glass rods, namely 78525 cubic millimetres, the quantity of gas
absorbed by the spongy platinum was 510-4 cubic millimetres.
   The surface of the spongy platinum cannot be determined,
and hence we are unable to state the condensation due to the
unit of surface. The experiments show simply that in 7 grammes
of spongy platinum a greater condensation takes place than on
the surface of the glass rods, which surface amounted altogether
to 196704 square millimetres.
   According as the spongy platinum is more or less pressed or
shaken together, it takes up a smaller or a greater space. From
several weighings of the substance, it was found that 4 grammes
of it occupied a space of 1 cubic centimetre; and as in the pre
sent instance 7 grammes of spongy platinum absorbed 0-510
cubic centimetres, we find that spongy platinum condenses 0:29,
or nearly one-third of        volume its sulphurous acid of 0°.                            at

much less than charcoal, which, according              De Saussure's         to
experiments, takes              up

Now introducing the condition that the motion is rectilinear,
obtained, as above stated, in a general manner, dB will be the
increment of space, dato tempore, along a line of motion. Also
dR=dR' from the geometrical relation between the principal
radii of curvature.     Hence integrating the above equation along
the line of motion, we have

As this equation has been arrived at without supposing any case
of motion, it expresses a general law of the motion of an incom
pressible fluid.    I proceed now to an analogous investigation for
 a compressible fluid.
    It will be required, first, to establish a general theorem respect
ing the relation between velocity and density in a state of pro
pagation. In accordance with the condition that the lines of
 motion are normals to a continuous surface, let us suppose the
fluid to be bounded by plane faces passing through focal lines,
 so as to be contained in a slender tube, whose length is very
 small and transverse section quadrilateral.           Let P, Q, R be
 three positions on the axis of the tube, separated by equal inter
vals.   Then it will be required to solve the following general
problem relating to propagation: viz. to express the rate at
which the excess of fluid in the space between Q and R above
that which would exist in the same space in the quiescent state
of the fluid, becomes the same as the excess in the space between
 P and Q.
    Let V, p be the mean velocity and density of the fluid which
 in the small time 8t passes the section at Q, and W", p' the same
 quantities relative to the section at R.         Let the magnitude of
 the section at Q be    m,  and of that at R be m', and the interval
 between them be 82.        Then the increment of matter in the time
 8t in the space between Q and R is
                            Wpm8t—V'p'm/8t.
 Let this be equal to the excess of the matter in the space between
 P and Q due to the state of motion, above that in the space
 between Q and R, at the commencement of the small interval 8t.
 The expression for this excess, neglecting small quantities of the
 second order, is
                       (p-1)m82–(p'—1)m'öz.
 Hence we have the equation
                        de:             de       St 2
 which gives the required expression for the rate       #.

position XIII., which relates to the motion and velocity of pro
pagation in a rectilinear tube of arbitrary and indefinitely small
transverse section.
   The investigation of the laws of the mutual action of the parts
of a compressible fluid in Proposition X. (Philosophical Magazine
for December 1852), led by a general process to the conclusion
that the motion takes place along a rectilinear axis, and that the
rate of propagation of the velocity and density along the axis is
constant.   On the suppositions that the propagated motion is
small, and that no impressed force acts, particular functions
expressing the velocity of the fluid parallel and transverse to the
axis and the density of the fluid were obtained.    Also (Prop. XI.)
a numerical value of the rate of propagation in            was found                air
without reference       any  arbitrary

       *%          it follows that the lines of motion drawn at any instant
in the directions of the motions of the particles through which
they pass, are continually varying their positions. This varia
bility is due to the transverse velocities, which, as well as the
transverse accelerative forces, are indefinitely small very near the
axis.    Hence by impressing other indefinitely small transverse
forces, we may alter ad libitum the positions of the lines of
motion, and even give them fixed positions in space. This, in
fact, is done by constraining the fluid to move in rigid tubes of
small and arbitrary transverse section, the boundary of the tube

of the   aether, canwith no propriety be called undulatory, the
word unda    implying the motion of a mass. It is desirable that
two theories, perfectly distinct in their principles and wholly
incompatible with each other, should also be distinguished in
name, and I would therefore call the latter the oscillatory theory
of light, this term having been recently made use of by an advo
cate of that theory.    I venture to add here one consideration,
tending to show that the establishment of the theory of light on
hydrodynamical principles may have an extensive bearing on the
progress of theoretical physics.    Light, considered apart from
the sensation so called, is simply a force, which may be placed
in the same rank as heat, electricity, magnetism, &c. Let it be
proved that this force is due to the transverse vibrations of a
continuous elastic medium, and the inference can hardly be
resisted that heat is due to the direct vibrations of the same
medium. Thus these two forces would be resolved into pres
sures, obeying laws which may be investigated on mathematical
principles, and it might reasonably be presumed that other forces
admit of like explanation.   Whatever may be the truth of this
induction,   am  I
                 prepared  to maintain that many phaenomena of
light may be explained by the motions and pressures of                             a    con
tinuous elastic medium, and to this object   propose, as     I
                                                           find                    I
leisure, to apply some of the hydrodynamical theorems which
have been discussed in various communications to this Journal.

        see, from what Dr. Scoresby has been saying before the
      Association at Hull, there seems to be some difficulty
about obtaining a correct sounding in places where the currents
are strong and flow in different directions at the different points
of depth, causing the line to assume different curves in   descent;        its
and when       comes
                 it           measured over, after the weight has
                             to     be

gives    noapproximate idea        the real depth, now

   the details of my process for the      manufacture of these
useful crystals,           I
                   have been induced to enter into numerous
experiments to obtain greater certainty in the results, and to
study the conditions necessary for the production of broad folia
ceous plates; permit me to make the formula known to science,
together with the precautions necessary for adoption to secure
the crystals when obtained, and to mount them so as to be avail
able as polarisers or analysers for the microscope, or even to
enable us to perform                  all
                         the experiments    the polariscope.

 On the Manufacture                   of Crystals of Sulphate of Iodo-quinine.                           847
   The spirituous solution of iodine is made by dissolving 40
grains of iodine in 1 fluid ounce of rectified spirit of wine.
     I
     can after these explanations give the formula.
   Take of disulphate of quinine 50 grains,
             ---         pyroligneous acid 2 fluid ounces,
            ---          proof-spirit 2 fluid ounces,
             ---         spirituous solution of iodine 50 drops;
dissolve the  disulphate of quinine in the pyroligneous acid mixed
with the  spirit; warm the solution to 130°F., and directly add
the solution of iodine by drops, agitating the mixture from time
to time.
   This formula gives to the mother-liquid, after crystallization
at 52°F., a specific gravity of 0.986, which appears highly
favourable to the deposition of the majority of the crystalline
production, and yet allows only the very broad and thinner
plates to float—thus getting them perfectly free from          inter                             all
fering and adhering plates.

         is              perform this operation
                                  to                   wide-mouthed            in    a

is maintained for    little time after the addition

that the solution should become perfectly clear, dark, sherry-wine
colour; then set     aside   it             to

   The best method     adopt    one which my friend Mr. John

across from one wall    the apartment  of  the other.  This cer         to
tainly gives the most uniform results, and offers other advan
tages.
   The plan    had usually employed was
                   I                           set aside the flask      to                                on

    4th. It is also decidedly an advantage to have a broad surface
in proportion to the depth of liquid; the reason being, that the
thinner and most easily reached plates form on the surface and
float there until the time arrives to remove them; and the greater
the surface, the more numerous are the plates.
    5th. These broad plates are not always formed; but if after
six hours none make their appearance, it is merely necessary to
apply a spirit-lamp to the bottom of the flask and warm the
liquid to dissolve        the deposited crystals, then add little spirit

350       On the Manufacture                      of Crystals of Sulphate of Iodo-quinine.
   It is essential in iodizing the plate that the exposure to the
vapour be not too long continued; the time necessary will of
course depend on the temperature of the apartment, about three
hours at 50°F, being generally necessary. The reason of this
precaution will be at once evident upon making the experiment, for
the crystals assume a rich golden yellow colour, both by reflected
and transmitted light; the field will therefore, when the two
plates are parallel, be intensely yellow, a most objectionable
colour for the examination of objects.     The crystals have lost
the power of stopping the yellow rays, and the complementary
relation of the body to the superficial colours appears to be lost
also-a   very remarkable fact.
    The rationale of the periodizing process appears to be the
 addition of as much iodine to the crystal as will be sufficient to
 communicate the exact complement of yellow to neutralize the
 red and blue rays of the purple “body-colour.”      These rays are
 now absorbed     by the  plates as they would be   by yellow glass.
If  too much iodine be added, an intense yellow light becomes
transmissible when the crystals are parallel, and the plate becomes
 rotten and brittle, and will be almost certainly destroyed in
 mounting, even if it be exposed to the air for some time before
 attempting to do                     so,   by
                              which process the superadded iodine
 again volatilizes, clearly showing that     chemical union could         no

LW.    A Main Cause of Discordant Views on the Structure of
    the Muscular Fibril. By MARTIN BARRY, M.D., F.R.S.,

                                              [With a Plate.]
I       LATELY    had the pleasure, on more than one occasion, of
       examining muscle at Glasgow with Prof. Allen Thomson.
The microscope used was one of first-rate excellence by Smith
and Beck.       We saw the states in Plate V. fig. 2 ab and                                      ikk
drawings sent me a few days after by the Professor, accompanied
by the following description and remarks:– “Portions of three
different muscular fibrillae from the Frog, presenting various
aspects,     ab, a fibril splitting into two at c, viz. cd and ce; the
part ac is probably double; ce and cd are single. db appears
single; but it is possible that it may be double, as e seems to
have been separated from c to d.           From a to c the quadrilateral
form of the sarcal particles and the clearer intervening substance
prevails; in ce and cf the oval and oblong quadrilateral; from
f to d the rhomboidal; and from d to b the rhomboidal, with an
appearance of spiral or twist in the intervals.-g and h are por
tions of another fibrilla, in which the quadrilateral form of the
particles, and the distinction between them and the intervals,
are particularly well marked; in g the upper surface is in focus,
and the cross mark in the intervals is not seen; in h the focus
is adjusted for the deeper or further side, the intervening sub
stance is crossed by a distinct transverse line, and each dark
quadrilateral particle presents a central spot, or rather a slightly
crucial mark in         centre.its Although the portion          fibril here          of
represented appears quite single,            think     can see that

may      be

366               Dr. Barry on             a    Main Cause of Discordant Views
am indebted to the kindness of Prof. Allen Thomson.          It needs
no description, affording unquestionable evidence of division and
subdivision—changes which observers have overlooked, or at
least in their consequences disregarded.         These changes, with
those scen in    fig. 2, and with what I am about to state, furnish
the explanation he requires.
    There first exists a line of bodies comparable to germinal spots.
Each spot divides into halves, and then each half into four parts;
so that each spot comes to consist of eight particles, which eight
particles          lie
                   two strata—four
                         in             each. This    shown in  fig.                   is                  by         5

ticles     outline representing the upper, and the shaded particles
             in

In a few seconds they had hardened and recovered their elasti
city.  After having been minutely examined for the detection
and breaking up (with a needle) of adhesions that might have
occurred in the softening, the wires were gently extended, and
found to spring back into the previous comparatively contracted
state; thus beautifully illustrating the movements of the muscu
lar fibril. The union seen in this model of the two spirals at
the end of the fibril, is to be inferred from analogy with what I
have elsewhere shown in cilia.
        I
      cannot refrain from once more recommending the heart of
some reptile as especially adapted for the examination        of the
fully-formed muscular fibril.     The heart of the Turtle has often
afforded me unquestionable specimens of the twin spiral'k; but
far more easily obtainable is that of the common Frog.
   In order thoroughly to understand the structure of this tissue,
however, it is essential to see it in     most incipient state, and its
patiently    follow   tothrough every stage. At that early period

Here observers, not thus prepared, mistook the winds of spirals
for varicosities or beads; for instance, Bowman, who in single
fibrillae figures as such what were evidently spirals”.        Some of
his delineations of fasciculi, also, afford beautiful illustrations of
spirals distorted in manipulation, of which the appearance he
aptly compares to “engine-turning” is an exquisite example.                                                    I
can attest the accuracy of those delineations of fasciculi.       They
are faithful representations of       nature;  but,  at the same time,
they are proofs of the existence of a structure, which for the
reason just mentioned the delineator did not understand.             As
for the “discs” of Bowman, they are transverse slices of fasci
 culi in full contraction, cut off where least capable of withstanding
 violence in manipulation.       At such parts each spiral of a pair
 is then in contact with         fellow;  there they cross and antago
                                          its
 nize each other;        full contraction this crossing

angles, and consequently there they cut each other through.    And
ifmaceration has been     used,   practice too common with some
                                                    a
observers,     wonderno    the “discs” present little more than

                      particles that the spirals are composed.

                                         of
too far. They passed over what really admits           examination—             of

  translated into German from the English MS. by Prof. Pur
 kinje, Foreign Member R.S., and communicated by him to
 Müller's Archiv for 1850; confirming by renewed inquiries,
 made in his house, the observations I had recorded in the Philo
 sophical Transactions eight years before (1842) on the spiral
 structure of muscle, and announcing the muscular character of
 cilia. It was in bivalve Mollusca and in Infusoria that I saw
 the latter.

phibia, from a like pushing forth of the cell-wall by the fibre
given off by the nucleus in those cells. And when the extremity
of the cilium is free, fig. 9, there is still to be recognized in the
bent form of young cilia a trace of that in which the nucleus
gave them off.
   Every cilium is a twin spiral, like the muscular fibril. Fig. 9,
a drawing from nature, represents a young cilium from the gill
of the common Oyster, in the form in which it proceeds from                                                    its
cell. At the extremity                      its
                              two spirals pass into one another, and
are bent over hook-like towards one side.               the base they              At

lucid globules       high  of
                          refractive  power.    These globules   have                                 I
elsewhere termed the contents           the cell, and such they are.

More particularly considered, however, they represent the re

          the nucleus      the cell resolved into globules. The two
                                       of
after-threads derive their mourishment from,          rather they are            or
formed       by

   Along with the model of a young cilium presented to the
Prague Museum, I left the following remark, translated into
German by my honoured friend Prof. Purkinje:—“From ana
logy it appears extremely probable that the heart arises in like
manner out of the nucleus of a cell, being originally such a
double spiral [as that in fig. 9]. If so, the spiral form of the
heart may be explained by the continued division of what was
originally a double spiral fibre.”
   To the subject of self-division, as part of the process of repro
duction, more importance will by and by be attached than here
tofore. For as the properties of the simplest form of separate
independent locomotive Infusoria descend to it from progenitors
by fission,--by the same fissiparous mode it appears to me do
properties descend from cell to cell, or rather from nucleolus to
nucleolus, though these are not separate but combined, and
merely parts of a more complicated organism.          Having made
known my observations on this subject in Müller’s Archiv and
in former numbers of this Journal+,        have here merely to re        I
peat, for the purpose of applying it to the suggestion referred to
concerning the heart, that the filaments of        organic fibre are                    all
made
              up
              particles (nucleoli), and that these particles, and
                   of
therefore the filaments     fibre, are reproduced
                                            of            other way                           in   no
than        by   self-division+.

    “The subject of the small planets has continued to occupy my
 attention so much, that I could not communicate with you until I
 had relieved my mind of this load of anxiety.                  consider myselfI
 very fortunate on this account in being enabled, through the meri
 torious services of my excellent friend Dr. Brünnow, to transmit to
 you in the annexed paper the mean elements of Flora, with the per
 turbations of the same planet as produced by Jupiter and Saturn.
 From the mode in which the calculation of these elements has been
 worked out, I am induced to entertain a confident hope that we
have it now in our power to compute the perturbations of the first
power of the masses for                 all
                                    the small planets, not even excepting
 Pallas, and that the time bestowed on the calculations              not immo          is
derately long.

   quantities w, y, z are only involved, the perturbations of which are
   already known.      But this process of calculation, which in every
   case is very  troublesome,   would be useless when the question refers
   to the small planets,  since the elements of these bodies are not known
   with sufficient accuracy. Dr. Brünnow, by means of his osculating
   elements, has obtained pretty accurate values of the disturbing
   forces; and by applying the resulting perturbations has deduced the
   mean elements of the planet.        To me it is as good as certain that
   the  perturbations   thus calculated (the hundredths of seconds are
   omitted) are sufficiently accurate to be employed next year for a
  more exact determination of the mean elements. The terms of the
  first power of the masses which are here given will therefore subserve
  the object in view, and on a future occasion the question may be
  investigated, whether the terms of the second order exercise any

paring the results of the foregoing experiments with the relative

every experiment, excepting those of numbers 4, 10 and 17, heat
travelled more rapidly from the better heat conductor to the worse
than vice versd.    Also taking the following series, viz. copper, zinc,
brass, iron, lead, and nickel-silver as the order of their relative
degrees of electric conductibility, and comparing them in like man

travelled more rapidly from the better electrical conductor to the

   The following experiments were instituted with the view of
throwing some light on the tendency of certain circumstances to
promote or diminish the evaporation of liquids.        Water and alcohol
were the liquids chiefly used. The results obtained by the author
may be recapitulated as follows:—
   1. The temperature of a liquid, allowed to evaporate freely in an
open vessel, is always inferior to that of the surrounding atmosphere.
The higher the temperature of the atmosphere, the greater is the
difference between          its
                           temperature and that    the liquid exposed
                                                             of                              to
evaporation.     Between 40° and 50°     Centigrade   the difference was
found       vary from
              to              7°; between 20° and 25°

  containing each 600 grains of water, having been exposed to evapo
  ration during seven days, the temperature of the surrounding atmo
  sphere varying from 20° to 25°, it was found, that at the end of that
  time the porcelain vessel had lost 303 grains of its previous weight,
  the metallic one 277, and the glass vessel 275.5 grains only.               The
  author enters into considerable detail as to the precautions he took
  to make sure that these differences could not be attributed to any
  difference in the radiating or conducting powers of the vessels em
 ployed.
     The differences observed in the temperature of liquids according
  to the nature of the vessels in which they are contained, depends, no
  doubt, on the property with which these vessels appear to be en
 dowed, of accelerating or delaying evaporation.               It is evident that
 in each case the quantity of sensible heat subtracted from the liquid,
 or, in other words, the diminution of its temperature, must be in
 proportion to the quantity of vapour formed. For instance, the fact
 that water and alcohol are constantly colder in a porcelain vessel
 than in a similar vessel of metal or glass, is the natural result of the
 more rapid evaporation of these liquids from the former of these
 vessels than from the two latter. The reason why a porcelain vessel
 evaporates more freely than a metallic or glass one is far less evi
 dent. The author has proved, by placing a hermetically-closed bottle
 of porcelain containing water under the vacuum of the air-pump,
 that it cannot be owing to any perviousness of the sides of the vessel,
 as he was at first inclined to suspect.
     3. The influence of the mass or depth of a liquid was next exa
 mined. The author's experiments appear to lead to the curious fact,
 that the rapidity with which any given liquid evaporates depends
not only on the extent of its surface, but also, within certain limits,
 on  its depth.    He found, for instance, that with two similar cylin
 drical porcelain vessels, containing, the first         layer               one
                                                                        of of

the evaporation from the latter exceeded that                    of
                                                              the former      the       in

tity of distilled water alone. The fact was ascertained in the fol
lowing manner:—The author, having procured two small porcelain
vessels, exactly of the same size, introduced into one of them 300
grains of distilled water, and into the other a small quantity of sili
ceous sand, over which 300 grains of water were poured, so as not
only to saturate the sand, but also to leave a layer of water of about
one-tenth of an inch in thickness over and above its surface. At
the end of five days, it was observed that the water standing alone
had lost 184 grains of its previous weight, while the water mixed
with the sand had lost no less than 196 grains. The average dif
ference, resulting from a series of experiments, was 7% per cent. in
favour of the more rapid evaporation of water mixed with sand com
pared to that of water standing alone. If the experiment be made
with glass or metallic vessels, the difference is only about 4% per cent.
   6. The last result which we shall mention, and which may be re
garded as a direct consequence of the preceding one, is the follow
ing:—Water mixed with sand remains habitually at a slightly lower
temperature than an equal surface of water standing alone. The
difference varies to a certain extent, according to the nature of the
vessels in which the experiment is performed, never however ex
ceeding # a degree Centigrade.       It is greater, when the comparison
is made between water and wet sand placed in two similar metallic
vessels, than when they are placed in porcelain or glass vessels; in
the latter case it seldom exceeds 0°-1 to 0°2,
   The author concludes by remarking, that the foregoing result
tends to confirm an opinion expressed some time since by Professor
De la Rive, in a letter to M. Arago, published in the Comptes Rendus
de l'Académie des Sciences for October 1851.        In this letter, M. De
la Rive attributes the sudden appearance of vast glaciers in divers
parts of Europe to a temporary refrigeration produced at the period
of the elevation of the most recent European strata, by the evapora
tion of the water with which they were previously covered.                           If,    as
the author's experiments tend       show, evaporation takes place more

that the cold   produced              by
                               evaporation    from the  recently   elevated
and still humid strata, must have been greater than that resulting

  MEANS OF GREATLY DIMINISHING THE COST OF NITRIC ACID
  FOR THIS BATTERY. BY F. P. LEROUX.
   M. Guignet has recently stated” that the nitric acid                                 of    Bunsen's
pile might    replaced,

sulphuric acid and deutoxide of manganese. The author employed
several coke elements cut from the same piece in order that the
porosity and conducting power might be the same ; he had as many
porous cells, and introduced the pieces of coke successively into
the same Bunsen's element, the carbon being inside, and the sur
rounding zinc perfectly amalgamated; he took care to operate with
acidulated water of a constant strength.     With these precautions he
ascertained—
    1. That the effect of deutoxide of manganese mixed with concen
trated sulphuric acid and employed at ordinary temperatures, is not
to be compared with that of nitric acid, and that it does not sensibly
increase the production of electricity due to the solution of the zinc ;
the sulphuric acid contained in the porous cell acts merely as a
conductor.     The author has verified the latter fact by employing
alternately a cell filled with the mixture and one containing only
sulphuric acid.
    2. When the mixture has been left several hours, it is then put
into the pile; a current almost as energetic as that produced by nitric
acid is observed just at first; but the intensity of this current rapidly
decreases, and in ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour at the utmost,
it is as weak as already stated.
    This arises from the mixture disengaging oxygen only very slowly
at ordinary temperatures; when left to itself, the oxygen accumu
lates, so that in this case the apparatus acts like a gas battery; but
 as soon as all the free oxygen is consumed, the production of elec
tricity is only supported by that which is slowly disengaged.
    3. From this it appears, that if the disengagement of oxygen
 could be increased, the current produced would be much more
energetic.    This is most simply effected by an elevation of tempe
rature, which the author proposes to produce by placing his battery
 in a vessel of boiling water; a thermometer placed in the battery
 shows the temperature.      He found that towards 140°F. the inten
 sity of the current increased very rapidly, and that the maximum
was at about 167°F.        Some bubbles of oxygen are disengaged from
the mixture.      The current thus obtained is more energetic than that
produced by nitric acid.      It is consequently only by an elevation of
temperature that this mixture can furnish a sufficient quantity of
 electricity; it may be observed also, that, in proportion to the aug
mentation of temperature, the conductibility of the fluids diminishes
 the internal resistance.
    This process is only applicable on a large scale. The author
 proposes the following as more convenient.      Starting with the sup
 position that M. Guignet's experiments were made with coke cylin
 ders which had already been used, and to which, in consequence,
 some nitric acid still adhered, he soaked a cylinder in nitric acid and
 then plunged it into a cell filled with concentrated sulphuric acid.
 The current produced was more energetic than with pure nitric acid.
 The advantage to be obtained by the employment of sulphuric acid
results, consequently, from the fact, that by its avidity for water it

to give   up      its
                oxygen. The nitric acid employed          batteries becomes                in

lump, however,         very different appearance presented itself; these

      DR. MARTIN BARRY's contRIBUTIONs                          To EMBRYOLOGY.
   The last Number of this Journal contains the abstract of a Note
 n Embryology by Dr. Martin Barry, who requests us to correct an
error in it. Dr. Keber is there stated to have considered certain
vesicles containing a revolving mulberry-like body as fecundated
ova. This was not Dr. Keber's opinion.     He believed the vesicles
in question not to have been fecundated, and Dr. Barry agrees with
him.    [The membrane of those vesicles, however, Dr. Barry believes
to have been his “ovisac,” and not the vitellary membrane (zona
pellucida) which had probably been absorbed.]

LXI.   On the Metallic Reflexion exhibited by certain Non-metallic
    Substances.  By Professor G. G. Stokes, M.A., F.R.S.*
IN translation
    the October Number of the Philosophical Magazine is a
               of a paper by M. Haidinger of Vienna, contain
ing an account of his observations relating to the optical pro
perties of Herapathite. In this paper he refers to a communi
cation which  I made to the British Association at the meeting at
Belfast; and indeed one great object of his examination of this
salt was to see whether a law which he had discovered, and
already extensively verified, relating to the connexion between the
reflected and transmitted tints   of bodies which have the property
of  reflecting  a different tint from that which they transmit,
would be verified in this case. The report of my communication
published in the Abbé Moigno's Cosmost had led him to suppose
that my observations were at variance with his law.
   My attention was first directed to this subject while engaged
in some observations on safflower-red (carthamine), which                         I
was led to examine with reference to its fluorescence.        In fol
lowing out the connexion which                I
                                         had observed to exist be
tween the absorbing power of a medium and                     its

394              Prof. Stokes on the Metallic Reflexion
the metallic yellowish-green reflexion which this substance ex
hibits. It occurred to me that the almost metallic opacity of the
medium with respect to green light was connected with the
reflexion of a greenish light with a metallic aspect.          I found, in
fact, that the medium agreed with a metal in causing a retarda
tion in the phase of vibration of light polarized perpendicularly
to the plane of incidence relatively to light polarized in that plane.
The observation was made by reflecting light polarized at an azi
muth of about 45° from the surface of the medium to be examined,
the angle of incidence being considerable, about equal to the
angle of maximum polarization, and viewing the reflected light
through a Nicol's prism capped by a plate of calcareous spar cut
perpendicularly to the axis.       Now by using different absorbing
media in    succession,   it was found that with red light, for which
safflower-red is comparatively        transparent, the reflected light
was   sensibly   plane-polarized,  while for green and blue light the
ellipticity was very considerable.
    In the case of a transparent medium, light would be polarized
by reflexion, or at least very nearly so, at a proper angle of inci
dence.     Hence if the light reflected by such a medium as saf
flower-red were decomposed into two pencils, one, which for
distinction’s sake may be called the ordinary, polarized in the
plane of incidence, and the other, or extraordinary, polarized
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, the extraordinary
pencil would vanish at the polarizing angle, except in so far as
the laws of the reflexion deviate from those belonging to a trans
parent substance. Hence the light remaining in the extraordinary
pencil might be expected to be more distinctly related to the light
absorbed with such energy.           Accordingly, it was found that
under these circumstances the extraordinary pencil (in the case
of safflower-red) was of a very rich green colour, whereas with
out analysis the light was of a yellowish-green colour. Similar
observations were extended to specular iron.
    These phaenomena recalled to my mind a communication which
Sir David Brewster made at the meeting of the British Association
at Southampton in 1846%; and on referring to his paper,                  I
found that the appearance of differently coloured ordinary and
extraordinary pencils in the light reflected by safflower-red was
the same phaenomenon as he has there described with reference
to chrysammate of potash.
    The observations above-mentioned were made towards the end
of 1851. Accordingly, when Dr. Herapath’s first paper on the
   * Notice of a new property of light exhibited in the action of chrysam
mate of potash upon common and polarized light. (Transactions of the
Sections, p. 7.)

            exhibited by certain Non-metallic Substances.                          395
new salt    of quinine appearedº,         I
                                          was prepared to connect the
metallic green reflected light with an intense absorbing action
with respect to green rays.            Having prepared some crystals
                                     I
according to his directions, was readily able to trace the pro
gress of the absorption in the case of light polarized in a plane
perpendicular to what is usually the longest dimension of the
crystalline plates, and to observe how the light passed from red
to black as the thickness increased.           Even the thickest of these
crystals was so thin as to show hardly any colour by light
polarized in the plane of the length. The result of crossing two
such plates is of course obvious to any one who is conversant
with physical optics.       The intense absorption was readily con
nected with the metallic reflexion.           An oral account of these
observations was      given   at a  meeting     of the Cambridge Philo
sophical   Society  on March 15,    1852;    but it was not till the obser
vations were a second time described, with some slight additions,
at the meeting of the British Association at Belfast, that any
account of them was published.           A notice of this communication
appeared in the Athenæum of September 25, 1852, and from
this the report in Cosmos seems to be taken, though the latter is
not free from errors. In the report in the Athenæum, the colour
of the more rapidly absorbed pencil is briefly described in these
words: “But with respect to light polarized in the principal
plane of the breadth, the thicker crystals are perfectly black,
the thinner ones only transmitting light, which is of a deep red
colour.”      The comparative transparency of the crystals with
regard to red light is afterwards expressly connected with the
green colour of the light reflected as if by a metal.            But in the
report in Cosmos, the passage just quoted is replaced by “tandis
que pour le cas de la lumière polarisée dans le plan principal de
la largeur      ils
                 sont opaques       noirs, quelque minces qu'ils soient
                                     et
d'ailleurs.”     This error led M. Haidinger             suppose that my
                                                          to
observations were     opposed        to
                                    his  law;   whereas the fact        that,is,
without    knowing       the time what
                           at                 he
                                               had  done,     had been led

independently         to
                       asimilar conclusion.
     In mentioning my own observations             onsafflower-red, Hera
pathite, &c., nothing        further from
                                is          my   wish than       neglect the

several years before discovered the phaenomenon                  of
                                                               the reflexion
of   differently coloured oppositely polarized pencils, which Sir
David Brewster shortly afterwards, and independently, discovered
in  the case    ofchrysammate        of
                                      potash.    M. Haidinger had from

not  seem to have noticed in the case of chrysammate of potash,
and which perhaps was not very evident in that salt.      In a later
paper M. Haidinger had announced the complementary relation
of the reflected and transmitted tints+. There is nothing new in
employing the rings of calcareous spar as a means of detecting
elliptic polarization; and the property of producing elliptic
polarization in reflecting plane-polarized light had previously
been observed in substances even of vegetable origint.           am            I
not  aware,  however,  that the chromatic variations of the change
of phase had been experimentally connected with the chromatic
variations of an intense absorbing action on the part of the
medium.          I
               have hitherto mentioned but one instance of this
connexion,       but     I   shall presently     have     occasion to allude       to
another.
   I think it but justice to myself to point out the error in Cosmos
(from whence M. Haidinger derived his information respecting
my observations), in consequence of which                    I
                                                   would appear to
have been guilty of a grievous oversight in the examination of
                             I
Herapathite: but would hardly have ventured to mention my
observations on carthamine, &c., were it not that, when different
persons arrive independently at a similar conclusion, it frequently
happens that views present themselves to the mind of one which
may not have occurred to another.       In the present case, in sta

Number of the Proceedings of the Mathematical and Physical Class of the
Academy of Sciences at Vienna for the year 1852, will be found a list of
M. Haidinger's previous papers on this subject. This paper contains a
methodized account of the properties, with reference to surface and sub
stance colour, of the substances up to that time examined by the author,
amounting in number to thirty.          For a copy of this, as well as several
others of his papers,        I
                          am indebted to the kindness of the author.
  f  More than twenty years ago Sir David Brewster,in his well-known paper
“On the Phaenomena and Laws of Elliptic Polarization, as exhibited in the
action of Metals upon Light,” pointed out the modification produced on
the rings of calcareous spar as a character of polarized light after reflexion
from a metal. (Pnil. Trans. for 1830, p. 291.)        In a communication to the
British Association at the meeting at Southampton in 1846, Mr. Dale
mentions indigo among a set of substances in which he had detected ellip
tic polarization by means of the rings of calcareous spar. In this case,
however, he connects the property, not with the intense absorbing power
of the substance, but with        its
                                  high refractive index.
 I     donot here mention the minute degrees         ellipticity which have been

I hope   to be able to add something to what has been already
done by    M. Haidinger and Sir David Brewster, and it seemed
not out of place to mention the observations in which those
views originated.
   It appears, then, that certain substances, many of them of
vegetable origin, have the property of reflecting (not scattering)
light which is coloured and has a metallic aspect. The sub
stances here referred to are observed to possess an exceedingly
intense absorbing action with respect to rays of the refrangibilities
of those which constitute the light thus reflected, so that for
these rays the opacity of the substances is comparable with that
of metals. Contrary, however, to what takes place in the case of
metals, this intense absorbing action does not usually extend to                                                 all
the colours              of

which itself alone would form but         uncertain indication,an    not                                   is
the   only  nor the   principal character which   distinguishes    these

 398           Prof. Stokes   on the Metallic   Refleavion
 character of metallic reflexion consists in the circumstance, that
 as the angle of incidence increases from 0°, the phase of vibra
 tion of light polarized in the plane of incidence is accelerated
 relatively to that of light polarized in the perpendicular plane.
 Accordingly, the same change takes place, with the same sign,
 in the case of these optically metallic substances; but the amount
 of the change is subject to most material chromatic variations,
 being considerable for those colours which are absorbed with
 great energy, but insensible for those colours for which the
 medium is comparatively transparent, so that the absorption
 may be neglected which is produced by a stratum of the medium
 having a thickness amounting to a small multiple of the length
 of a wave of light. If the medium be crystallized, it may happen
 that one only of the oppositely polarized pencils which it trans
 mits suffers, with respect to certain colours, an exceedingly in
 tense absorption; or, if that is the case with both pencils, that
 the colours so absorbed are different.      It may happen, likewise,
 that the absorption varies with the direction of the ray within
 the crystal.   In such cases the light reflected by virtue of the
 metallicity of the medium will be subject to corresponding varia
 tions, so that the medium is to be regarded as not only doubly
 refracting and doubly absorbing, but doubly metallic.
                       I
    The views which have just explained are derived from a com
 bination of certain theoretical notions with some experiments.
 They have need of being much more extensively verified by ex
                             I
periment; but, so far as at present know, they are in confor
mity with observation.
    To illustrate the effect of bringing a transparent medium into
 optical contact with an optically metallic substance,      I may refer
to safflower-red.    If a portion  of this substance be    deposited on
glass by means of water, and the water be allowed to evaporate,
a film is obtained which reflects on the upper surface a yellowish
green light, but on the surface of contact with the glass a very
fine green inclining to blue.      A green of the latter tint appears
to be more     truly related to the colours absorbed with greatest
energy.     Similar remarks apply to the light reflected by Hera
pathite, according as the crystals are in air or in the mother
liquor.    If a small portion of Quadratite (platino-cyanide of
magnesium) be dissolved on glass in a drop or two of water, and
the fluid be allowed to evaporate, the tints reflected by the upper
and under surfaces of the film of crystals are related to one
another much in the same way as in the case of safflower-red.
For a fine specimen of the salt last mentioned        I  am indebted to
the kindness of M. Haidinger.        I may mention in passing, that
the platinocyanides as a class are of extreme optical interest.
The crystals are generally at the same time doubly refracting,

            exhibited by certain Non-metallic Substances.             399
doubly absorbing, doubly metallic, and doubly fluorescent.             By
the last  expression    I mean that the    fluorescence,  which the   cry
stals generally exhibit in an eminent degree, is related to direc
tions fixed relatively to the crystal, and to the azimuths of the
planes of polarization of the incident and emitted rays.
    M. Haidinger has expressed the relation between the surface
and substance colours of bodies by saying that they are comple
mentary.      This expression was probably not intended to be
rigorously exact; and that it cannot be so, is shown by the fol
lowing simple consideration. The tint of the light transmitted
across a stratum of a given substance almost always, if not
always, varies more or less according to the thickness of the
stratum. Now one and the same tint, namely, that of the
reflected light, cannot be rigorously complementary to an infinite
variety of tints of different shades, namely, those of the light
transmitted across strata of different thickness. In most cases,
indeed, the variation of tint may not be so great as to prevent
us from regarding the reflected and transmitted tints in a general
sense as complementary.          But as media exist (for example, salts
of sesquioxide of chromium, solutions of chlorophyll) which
change their tint in a remarkable manner according to the
thickness of the stratum through which the light has to pass, it
is probable that instances may yet be observed in which M. Hai
dinger's law would appear at first sight to be violated, although
in reality, when understood in the proper sense, it would be
found to be obeyed.         As the existence of surface-colour seems
necessarily   to imply a very intense absorption of those rays which
are reflected according to the laws which belong to metals, it
follows that it is in the very thinnest crystals or films of those
which it is commonly practically possible to procure, that the
transmitted tint is to be sought which is most properly com
plementary to the tint of the reflected light.
    I will here mention another instance of the connexion between
metallic reflexion and intense absorption.         I choose this instance
because a different explanation from that which            I am about to
offer has been    given   of a certain  phaenomenon      observed in the
substance.     The instance     I allude to is specular iron. As it is
already known that various metallic oxides and sulphurets possess
the optical properties of metals, there is nothing new in bringing
forward this particular mineral as a substance of that kind.            It
is to the chromatic variation of the metallicity that I wish to
direct attention.      If  light polarized at an azimuth of about 45°
be reflected from a scale of this substance at about the polarizing
angle, and the reflected light be viewed through a plate of cal
careous spar and a Nicol's prism, it will be found, by using dif
ferent absorbing media in succession, that the change of phase, as

                                                                          **

the very remarkable mode of absorption of light by red solution
of mineral chameleon”. This solution, which may be regarded
as an optically pure solution of permanganate of potash, inas
much as it is associated with only a colourless salt of potash,
absorbs green light with great energy, as is indicated by the
tint, even without the use of a prism. But when the light
transmitted by a pale solution is analysed by a prism, it is found
that there are five remarkable dark bands of absorption, or
minima of transparency, which are nearly equidistant, and are
situated mainly in the green region. The first is situated on
the positive or more refrangible side of the fixed line D, at a
distance, according to a measurement recently taken, of about
four-sevenths of the interval between consecutive bands; the last
nearly coincides with F. The first minimum is less conspicuous
than the second and third, which are the strongest of the set.
Now it occurred to me, that as the solution is so opake for rays
having the refrangibilities of these minima of transparency, cor
responding maxima might be expected in the light reflected from
the crystals.    This expectation has since been realized by obser
vations made on some small crystals.          On analysing the reflected
light by a prism, I was readily able to observe four bright bands,
or maxima, in the spectrum. These, as might have been expected,
were more easily seen when the light was incident nearly per
pendicularly than at a large angle of incidence.                  The first
band was yellow, the others green, passing on to bluish-green.

room, and allowed to fall on a crystal.     The reflected light was
limited by  a slit, placed at the distance of two or three feet from
the crystal. This precaution was taken to ensure making the
observation on the regularly reflected light.       Had no slit been
used, or else a slit placed close to the crystal, it might have been
supposed that the light observed was not regularly reflected, but
merely scattered, as it would be by a coloured powder.           The
appearance of a spot of green light on a screen held at the
place of the slit showed that the light was really regularly
reflected.   The slit was also traversed by the light scattered by
the support of the crystal, &c. The slit was viewed through a
prism and small telescope; and the position of the dark bands,
or minima of brilliamey, in the reflected light could thus be
compared with the fixed lines, which were seen by means of the
scattered light in the uninterrupted spectrum corresponding to
that portion of the slit through which the light reflected from
the crystal did not pass. The minimum situated on the positive
side of the first bright band lay at something more than a band
interval on the positive side of the fixed line D; the minimum
beyond the fourth bright band lay at the distance of about half
a band-interval on the negative side of F.    It thus appears that
the minima in the light reflected by the crystal were interme
diate in position between the minima seen in the light trans
mitted through the solution, so that the maxima of the former
corresponded to the minima of the latter.
   It might have been considered satisfactory to compare the
reflected light with the light transmitted, not by the solution,
but by the crystals themselves.     But the crystals absorb light
with such energy as to be opake; and even when they are
spread out on glass, the film thus obtained is too deeply coloured
for the purpose.    For to show the bands well, the solution must
be so dilute, or else seen through so small a thickness, as to be
merely pink.     As M. Haidinger states that the phaenomena of
the reflected light are the same for all the faces in             all

reflected light to make use of a crystal recently taken out of the
mother-liquor.    I have only observed four bright bands in the
reflected light, whereas there are five distinct minima in the
light transmitted by the solution. However, the extreme minima
are less conspicuous than the intervening ones, besides which
the fifth occurs in a comparatively feeble region of the spectrum.
The fourth bright band in the reflected light was rather feeble,
but with finer crystals perhaps even a fifth might have been
visible. As the metallicity of the crystals is almost or perhaps
quite insensible in the parts of the spectrum corresponding to
the maxima of transparency, we may say, that, as regards the
optical properties of the reflected light, the medium changes
four or five times from a transparent substance to a metal and
back again, as the refrangibility of the light changes from a little
beyond the fixed line D to a little beyond F.

               1. Difficulties of          the present Hypothesis.
                              the perfection to which the geome
        trical part  of the undulatory   theory of light has been
brought, it is admitted that great difficulty exists in framing, to
serve as a basis for the theory, a physical hypothesis which shall
at once be consistent with itself and with the known properties
of matter.
   The present paper is a summary of the results of an attempt
to diminish that difficulty.   All the conclusions stated have been
deduced by means of strict mathematical analysis; and although
it is impossible to read the investigations before the British
Association in detail, their results can easily be verified by every
mathematician who is familiar with the undulatory theory in                       its
present form.
  It  may     be                      as
                                  established, that       we assume the

    into which they have been moved.       But even this hypothesis
    requires the assumption, that the elasticity     the luminiferous          of

    elasticity which transmits transverse vibrations.
       The difficulty just referred      arises from    comparison

    originally assumed, that        crystalline media, where the velocity
                                               in
    of  light varies with the position      the plane     polarization, the
                                                               of                  of
    direction   of vibration     perpendicular
                                         is          that plane. This    to                                    is
    equivalent   to  the supposition, that the velocity with which state                                  a
    of  rectilinear transverse vibration      transmitted through such
                                                                is                                             a

                     a         simply    the direction    ofwhich the par           in

    he   obtained also     near approximation

sity of plane-polarized light reflected                            from singly refracting
substances.
  But it was afterwards     demonstrated, that the elastic forces
which  propagate  a transverse movement in any medium must
necessarily be functions, not merely of the direction of the move
ment, but jointly of this direction and the direction of propaga
tion; that is to say, of the position of the plane containing these
two directions. Consequently, if the various velocities of vari
ously polarized light in a doubly refracting medium arise from
variations of elasticity in different directions, the direction of
vibration is in the plane of polarization, contrary to the hypo
thesis of Fresnel. Fresnel's wave-surface, and his approximate
formulae for the intensity of reflected light, are deducible from
this supposition as readily as from his original hypothesis; and
Mr. MacCullagh obtained from it formulae for the intensity of
light reflected from doubly refracting substances, agreeing closely
with the experiments of Sir David Brewster.

Mr. Green as modified by Mr. Haughton”, expressing the
effects of reflexion on the intensity and phase of polarized light,

406             Mr. W.        J.   M. Rankine's                 General              View      of an
movement,     is the direction of vibration) is perpendicular to the
plane of polarization.
   Hence it follows, that in a crystalline medium the velocity of
light depends simply on the direction of the transversal charac
teristic of the movement propagated, and not on the direction
of propagation.
   This conclusion is opposed to the laws of the propagation of
transverse vibrations through a crystalline elastic solid, or through
any medium in which the velocity of propagation depends on
elasticity varying in different directions. Therefore the velocity
of light depends on something not analogous to the variations
of elasticity in such a medium.
   To solve this difficulty, the author of this paper some time
since suggested the hypothesis that the luminiferous medium
consists of particles forming the nuclei of atmospheres of ordi
nary matter; that it transmits transverse vibrations by means
of an elasticity which is the same in             substances and        all                                   in      all

   The coefficient of polarity in question is proper only to an
axis of oscillation transverse to the direction of propagation. To
account for the stability of direction of the axes of the atoms,
and also for the non-appearance, in ordinary cases, of phaeno
mena capable of being ascribed to oscillations round axes parallel
to the direction of propagation, it is necessary to suppose the
corresponding coefficient for the latter species of oscillations to
be much greater than the coefficient for transverse axes of oscil
lation.
   It is evident, that how powerful soever the polarity may be,
which is here ascribed to the atoms of the luminiferous medium,
it is a kind of force which must be absolutely destitute of direct
influence on resistance to change of volume or change of figure
in the parts of that medium, or of any body of which that medium
may form part; and that, consequently, the difficulty which in
the hypothesis of vibrations arises from the necessity of ascribing
to the luminiferous medium properties like those of an elastic
solid, has no existence in the hypothesis of oscillations now
proposed.
   The luminiferous atoms may now be supposed to be diffused

                 space, and     molecular nuclei, throughout

 408              Mr. W.    J.    M. Rankine's         General View         of an
 logous to that demonstrated by Professor Stokes for a transverse
 vibratory movement, substituting only the axis of oscillation for
 the direction of vibration; that is to say,
     The direction of the awes of oscillation in the diffracted wave is
 the projection of that of the awes of oscillation in the incident wave
 on a plane tangent to the front of the diffracted wave.
    Consequently, oscillations in the incident wave, round axes
 oblique to the diffracting edge, give rise to oscillations in the
 diffracted wave round axes more nearly parallel to the diffracting
 edge.
   But the experiments of Professor Stokes have proved, that
light polarized in a plane oblique to the diffracting edge, becomes,
after diffraction, polarized in a plane more nearly perpendicular to
  the diffracting edge.
     Therefore the axes of oscillation in plane-polarized light are
  perpendicular to the plane of polarization.
     Therefore the velocity of transmission of oscillations round
 transverse axes through the luminiferous medium in a crystalline
 body is a function simply of the direction of the axes of oscillation.
     Now if the variations of the velocity of transmission arose from
 variations of the coefficient of transverse polarity (denoted by C),
 they would depend on the direction of propagation as well as
 upon that of the axes of oscillation, so that the plane of polar
 ization would be that which contains these two directions. Since
the velocity of transmission depends on the direction of the axes
 of oscillation only, it follows that                 its
                                               variations       given cry  in

writes:—“In the August Number of the Philosophical Magazine
I observe a paper by Dr. Wrightson, describing the action of

cyanides of aethyle and amyle, and employing the result of that
experiment as an argument against the othyle theory;” he goes
on to show the inadmissibility of such a deduction, derived from
the above-named experiments, as adverse to the othyle theory.

where     I

can one atom of the aethyle radical, conformable to Williamson’s
alcohol and aether theory, be substituted by any other alcohol
radical    ?
   The experiments to satisfy this inquiry furnished me with
conclusions which I applied to the alcohol and aether theory alone.
These conclusions represented Professor Williamson's theory of
the substitution of the aether radicals as much less probable than
before, especially as it was unsupported by any decisive facts,
but by no means represented that theory as overturned. To
the othyle hypothesis they did not refer, except in so far as
the latter is dependent upon the former. Without further dis

Urwº              of sixty years have passed since gas was first
        applied for the purposes of illumination ; but notwith

       Prof. Magnus on the Origin of Tar in Olefiant Gas.                                        421
Brande”, J. Davyt, and G. Bischofff of Bonn, have engaged
in inquiries on coal-gas, marsh-gas, and the different carburets
                                                                   -
of hydrogen.
   To these have been lately added Frankland's Sexcellent contri
butions to our knowledge of the manufacture of gas, the object
of which is to prove that the process of White is to be preferred,
which consists in driving the gases forth from the red-hot retorts
by the introduction of other gases produced by the action of
steam upon charcoal.        As, however, Frankland has only occupied
himself with coal-gas, which is a mixture of different gases, the
decomposition of the pure olefiant gas was not in his case further
looked into.
   An investigation which specially treats of the decomposition
of this gas was carried on by Marchand             He conducted olefiant

red-hot tube which was filled with copper wire. The gas which
issued from this tube              he
                                analysed               by
                                              conducting      through               it             a
red-hot tube containing oxide             copper, and determining the

at  the commencement          was almost     pure  marsh-gas,   but after
the tube had attained        complete white heat, the issuing gas was
                                 a
almost pure hydrogen. All the carbon had been separated.
   The olefiant gas generated from sulphuric acid and alcohol,
after    has been freed

   When the upper portion of a curved tube or receiver filled
with pure gas and shut off by mercury was heated in a bath of
Rose's metal, the temperature of which was a little higher than
that of boiling mercury, the gas did not assume the smell of tar,
but retained              its
                   original odour. The formation       tar from                           of
olefiant gas begins therefore     temperature     events higher

the tube is longer exposed to the heat and assumes a higher
temperature than that formed at another portion of the tube, for
example, near the end at which the gas leaves the tube.
   Not always, therefore, was the tar found to possess the same
composition; sometimes, as already remarked, it was darker,
sometimes lighter; sometimes it was so volatile that it could not
be weighed in an uncovered vessel.      After having been some
time exposed to the air, a portion was volatilized, and it was pos
sible to weigh the remainder in a small porcelain vessel without
a COWer.
   When volatile substances are decomposed, it is not necessary
that the products of decomposition should be also volatile; and
in the decomposition of olefiant gas, non-volatile products are
also formed, for, as has been already remarked, the tar cannot
be wholly distilled.
   It would certainly have been desirable to ascertain the com
position of each separate product of decomposition.    But as we
are not yet in a position to separate these products,   must be                             I
content with an analysis of the entire tar.  It     however, evi                    is,

character for analysis, and hence arise the divergences     the                                     in
results.
   The analyses were      conducted that the substance was weighed
                                     so
in a  small  porcelain vessel,  and with the latter was introduced
into  a tube filled with the oxide        copper.    During the com

the  disagreeable  property       readily      of

and       I sometimes
                  found, particularly when the more volatile por
tion had  disappeared, small white crystals within the tar which
were manifestly   nothing else than naphthaline.   We can there
fore regard tar as a mixture of several hydrocarbons which are
isomeric with naphthaline, or as a solution of naphthaline in
such isomeric compounds.
     If
      we assume that olefiant gas is resolved only into naph
thaline and marsh-gas, then eight volumes of olefiant gas are
necessary to form six volumes of marsh-gas and one equivalent
of naphthaline.

been often observed.      The reason why this has not been the

LXVII.     On a proposed Barometric Pendulum, for the Registration

                                            was not aware that a baro
            metric pendulum formed part of an instrument sent
by Mr. G. F. Hall to the Great Exhibition of 1851. There is
this difference, however, between Mr. Hall’s pendulum and that
here proposed, that the former oscillates in a plane, while the
latter is intended to revolve.     It appears to me that the revolving
pendulum will possess a considerable advantage, inasmuch as the
mercury will remain steady in the tube during each revolution,
instead of rising and falling with each vibration, as it would do
in the oscillating pendulum.
    It has been objected to the proposed barometric clock, that
its introduction would be superfluous, owing to the great accu
racy which has been attained in the photographic method of
registration. With                   all

cation of the variations of the rate of a clock, viz. to determine
the mean barometric pressure during long periods.
    For this purpose the clock should be regulated by a centri
fugal or revolving pendulum, part of which should consist of a
siphon barometer. The rising and falling of the mercury would
evidently affect the rate of the clock; so that from the number
of revolutions of the pendulum in a given time might be deduced
approximately the mean height of the mercurial column during
that period.
    The formulae applicable to this calculation are the following,

OUlofknowledge
      the
                of cyclones is limited to that mature condition
          phaenomenon    in which it has become a hurricane                   :
nothing is known of their origin, and very little of their gradual
development.   It might be anticipated that some light would be
thrown on these important points by investigating and comparing
the corresponding phases of the apparently analogous phaeno
mena of waterspouts, tornados, &c.     This comparison seems to
have been somewhat too    hastily abandoned by cyclonologists on
meeting with some cases in which the law of rotation appeared
to be violated. If this discrepancy had been well established, it
might be thought fatal to the hypothesis of the homogeneity of
the two meteors; but the observations of the direction of rotation
of waterspouts are both too few and too uncertain to outweigh
the numerous remarkable coincidences which tend to show that
cyclones and waterspouts differ only in degree; a waterspout being
either a cyclone in miniature, or an embryo cyclone.     In several
instances two or three waterspouts have been seen within the
area of one cyclone, which confirms the supposition that both
meteors are produced by the same physical agent.      Each has a
motion of rotation about a vertical axis, and another of transla
tion along the surface of the earth.      Both arise after extreme
heat, and travel towards a colder region.    The central portions
of both are characterized by an excessively low temperature and
extreme rarefaction; by copious falls of rain, snow and hail; by
peculiar noises; by lightning, and other manifestations of the
presence of electricity.     Further research will disclose more
points of close resemblance.      An inquiry into the origin and
nature of waterspouts,   tornados,  and other apparently cognate
phaenomena, may therefore lead to valuable suggestions respect
ing the more important but less known phaenomenon called a
cyclone.
   The following appear to be the main facts which are available
as a basis       for
                theory which shall comprehend

analogous     ones:—
     “In the Aleutian Archipelago a new island was formed in
1795.    It was first observed after a storm, at a point in the sea
from which a column of smoke had been seen to rise.”—Lyell,
Principles of Geology.
   “Among the Aleutian Islands a new volcanic island appeared
in the midst of a storm, attended with flames and smoke. After
the sea was calm, a boat was sent from Unalaska with twenty
Russian hunters, who landed on this island on June 1, 1814.”

    “On July 24, 1818, a submarine eruption broke out between
the mainland of Orkney and the island of Stronsa.             Amid
thunder and lightning a very dense jet-black cloud was seem to
rise from the sea, at a distance of five or six miles, which tra
velled towards the north-east.    On passing over Stronsa, the wind
from a   slight air became a   hurricane, and a thick, well-defined
belt of large hailstones was left on the island. The barometer
fell two inches.”—Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol.                            ix.

    When an earthquake of excessive intensity occurs, as at Lisbon
in 1755, the volcanic craters, which act as the safety-valves of
the regions in which they are placed, are supposed to be sealed
up ; and it is a remarkable and highly suggestive fact, that no
hurricane follows such an earthquake.     The number of instances
of the concurrence of ordinary earthquakes and hurricanes might
easily be increased, but the preceding suffice to show the gene
rality of this coincidence both as to time and place.
  4. The breaking of waterspouts on mountains     sometimes  accom
                          panies hurricanes.
    In  1766, during the great Martinique hurricane, before cited.
    “  1826, Nov. At Teneriffe, enormous and most destructive
waterspouts fell on the culminating tops of the mountains, and

     5. The fall of an avalanche sometimes produces a hurricane.
     “ 1819, Dec. A part (360,000,000 cubic feet) of the glacier
 fell from the Weisshorn (9000 feet). At the instant when the
 snow and ice struck the inferior mass of the glacier, the pastor
 of the village of Randa, the sacristan, and some other persons
 observed a light.   A frightful hurricane immediately succeeded.”

the numerous circumstances indicative       intense electrical action,

  Mr. T. Dobson   on the Theory   of Cyclones, Waterspouts,   &c.  443
  such as the appearance of fiery meteors, the loss      of sight, the
  deranged action of the needle, &c.
     As long as the integrity of the conducting column is main
  tained and the supply of electric fluid continued, the aqueous
 vapour through which a cyclone passes will be condensed and
 accumulated. Hence arises the immense fall of water (always
 fresh) when a waterspout breaks, and the excessive rains that
 accompany the passage of the central space of a cyclone. When
 the condensation is sufficiently sudden and intense, hail and even
 ice may be formed.     The fact marked 4 is thus explained.
     A  physical mechanism adequate to the formation of the con
 ducting cylinder presents itself in the form of an avalanche
  (fact 5), and in the sudden ejection from a volcanic crater of
 long pent-up and highly elastic gases (facts 1, 2, 6 and 7). It
 follows, moreover, that a waterspout, a tornado, or even a cyclone,
 may be produced by anything which tends to form a vertical
 column of considerably less density, or of much greater humidity,
 than the surrounding atmosphere.         Hence the well-known fact
 that storms follow great battles, great bush fires, &c.
     When an earthquake and a cyclone occur nearly together in
 the neighbourhood of a volcano, the earthquake indicates the
 activity of the volcanic forces, and the cyclone bears evidence of
a sudden ejection of gases from the crater, although no eruption
 of flame or lava may have taken place or been observed. (Fact 3.)
The atmosphere will be most highly charged with electricity,
and therefore the tendency to a violent restoration of electrical
equilibrium will be most powerful just after the season of greatest
heat, during which the processes of evaporation and vegetation
have been most active, and therefore the development and accu
mulation of atmospheric electricity most rapid. Accordingly it
is found that cyclones generally originate in tropical regions;
that the hurricane season in any locality is the same as the season
of greatest heat; and that waterspouts, tornados, and hail
storms occur on very hot days.       The terrestrial electric currents
flow towards the magnetic west, and must therefore decline
towards the south in passing from Java towards the Mauritius,
and towards the north in passing from the Caribbean Isles
 (Barbadoes, Martinique, &c.) towards Cuba.        This explains the
directions of the two great cyclone tracts in the South Indian
Ocean and in the West Indies, up to the points where they are
found to recurve, but the facts enunciated in (8) concerning the
direction of a cyclone's track in middle latitudes remain unac
counted for. With this exception, the electro-dynamical theory
of cyclones here proposed will account for every important and
definite fact connected with the phaenomenon, and will likewise
embrace the obviously allied phaenomena of waterspouts, tornados,
hail-storms, &c.

     It
      follows from this theory, that hurricanes are most likely to
be produced by such volcanic eruptions as succeed seasons of
great heat, and that the eruption of a low volcano is more likely
to produce a hurricane than that of a high one, since the whole
of the insulating atmospheric shell is pierced through in the
former case, and only the upper portion of it in the latter.

the circles almost joining at their extremities, formed towards the

it was covered for the most part by small woolly clouds.
   Professor Kaemtz, in his ‘Meteorology,’ remarks that “as the
halos appear most frequently when the barometer falls, they are
likely to be followed by rain;” and in the present instance, on the
morning of the 20th of January, the barometer fell more than six
millimetres, and a heavy rain fell which continued during the day.
   oN THE MOTIon of ELASTIC FLUIDs, AND THE THEORY OF
               WIND INSTRUMENTS.        BY A. MASSON.
   The author's memoir treats of the flow of elastic fluids through cir
cular orifices pierced in metallic plates; the acoustic phaenomena
produced by the flow of air through circular orifices adapted to
cylindrical pipes;   numerous experiments on pipes of different
material and   length;  an examination of the various theories pro
posed as explanatory of the motion of air in acoustic pipes, together
with some remarks on the function of the apertures of organ pipes.
   Flow of air through circular orifices.—A rectangular deal box was
suitably placed upon the reservoir of an organ bellows, and on its
upper surface were adjusted metal discs pierced at their centres
with a circular orifice.        A manometer—consisting of a narrow
inclined tube     communicating     at one part with the conduit pipe and
at the other with a large flask filled with water—indicated                 the
aërial pressure during the experiment.               This differential mano
meter, capable of being inclined in any direction, gives the true
pressure by multiplying the variations of the column of water by the
sine of the respective inclinations.        Several applications of this new
apparatus are pointed out in the memoir; its great sensibility was
a main condition of the success of the experiments, which required
the application of very minute degrees of pressure, frequently less
 than that of one millimetre of water.
    The air in flowing through the circular orifices in the metallic
plate produces a sound which rises to a higher pitch in a continuous
 manner with the increase of pressure, as in the syren.

   The stoppage of the vibrations by the mass of exterior air, the
form, still unknown, of the gaseous vein, the too feeble elasticity
of the fluid, may contribute together or separately to the prevention
of any acoustic impression.
    In order to strengthen the sounds originally produced at the
orifice from which the flow takes place, for the purpose of submit
ting to a further investigation the laws of the vibrations of columns
of air, a cylindrical pipe of wood was fixed upon the metallic plate,
so that its axis passed through the centre of the acoustic aperture.
   When air was forced through by the bellows a sound was pro
duced, and the vibrations were communicated to the pipe, which gave
out a series of harmonics comparable in point of purity and inten
sity with the finest sounds of the organ.
   The results of these experiments upon the motion of air in tubes
may be expressed as follows:—
    1. Air in flowing from an orifice acquires a vibratory condition
capable of producing sound in gaseous columns.
   2. The acoustic phaenomena are not altered by placing the orifice
on the upper or under part of the pipe through which the air flows,
or by forcing or drawing the air through                         it.

    Alcohol presents the same phaenomena as water. The calorific
decomposition is much more active in alcohol than in water. When
a point and a ball are immersed in the liquid, no decomposition
appears to take place on the ball if it be positive, the oxygen pro
bably combining with the alcohol; the decomposition is very weak if
it be positive, and the gas obtained appeared to consist of bicarbu
retted hydrogen.        The product of the calorific action appeared to
be a mixture of    hydrogen   and carbonic oxide, which would be very
readily explained by the composition of hydrated alcohol.
    The author had observed in his eudiometric analyses that the two
wires of the inductive apparatus became unequally heated,—the
negative wire became red-hot and fused, whilst the other remained
cold.     He then tried the decomposition of some gases placed in a
tube furnished with two wires, the extremities of which were very
 close together.
     Sulphuretted hydrogen gave sulphur and hydrogen; the negative
wire was incandescent and furnished the sulphur, the positive wire
 remained dull. Sulphurous acid underwent no decomposition. The
 negative wire fused, whilst the positive did not even redden.—

           ON  THE FORMATION OF CRYSTALLINE MINERALS.
                           BY A. DREWERMANN.
     The author has instituted a series of experiments upon the arti
 ficial production of those crystalline minerals which are formed in
 the humid way, starting from the opinion that the crystals occurring
 in geodes could be produced neither by gradual evaporation nor by
 the cooling of saturated solutions.     By the method employed, sub
 stances the most difficult of solution, as well as those which are
 readily soluble, may be crystallized in a simple and easy manner; it
 also at the same time admits of an infinite variety of modifications
 of the forces acting. The principle of the method consists in gradu
 ally changing the affinity of the solvent for the substance dissolved
 in such a manner that the latter may be gradually separated. This
 change is effected by the diffusion of one liquid into another, which
 liquids must be so chosen, that, when they mingle, a solid substance
 will separate.
     The arrangement of the apparatus is exactly the same as in Gra
 ham's experiments.       Some powdered chromate of potash and nitrate
  of lead was introduced into two tolerably long gas cylinders, filled
  carefully with water, and then placed close together in a large
  beaker, which was also so far filled with water that the two
  cylinders were covered.      In consequence of the upward diffusion,
  the nitrate of lead reached the large beaker in the course of a few
 months, when several very beautifully coloured amorphous com
  pounds were formed on the margin of the cylinder filled with chro
  mate of potash. Within the same cylinder beautiful orange-red bril
  liant acicular crystals of chromate of lead (PbO, CrO3) were attached,
  together with small, dark red, rhombic tables of melanochroite
  (3PbO, 20rO3): these constantly grow larger.            The needles of
  chromate of lead formed in this manner attained a size of 3 or 4

 millimetres, when they were detached by the constant shaking of the
 ground which always occurs in a large town, and falling on the bot
 tom of the cylinder, got beyond the reach of the conditions necessary
 for their formation ; were it not for this circumstance, they would
 certainly have attained a length of half an inch or more in the course
 of three or four months. In the same vessel crystals of carbonate
 of lead (PbO, CO") were also formed, evidently in consequence of
 the contamination of the chromate of potash by carbonate.
     In a similar manner crystals of calc-spar, rhombic tables of 2CaO,
 HO, PO3 +4HO, and other acicular crystals of a fatty lustre, which
 the author regards as 3CaC), PO", were obtained.              As the principle
 of this method may be applied almost universally, and as amorphous
 carbonate of lead is soluble in 50,000 parts of water, and chromate
 of lead is still less soluble (sulphate of baryta is soluble in 43,000
 parts of water), we may conclude that the fact of a compound being
 difficult of solution is no hindrance to its artificial preparation in a
 crystalline form. In the course of these experiments it was remarked,
 that the slowness with which these crystals were formed (they were
 generally only produced in several months) depended upon the fluids
 only coming together in that time; the experiment was therefore
 varied by introducing a glass vessel filled with a dry salt into another
 containing a saline solution, so that the former was only slightly
 covered.      A considerable precipitate was produced, which was depo
 sited  upon     the undissolved salt.       Several days afterwards small
 crystals were observed upon the amorphous precipitate, which, as
 the conditions of their formation continued, must constantly                in
 crease in size.      In this manner the author hopes to obtain large cry
 stals of  heavy   spar,  calc-spar, sulphate of lead (PbO, SO3), pyromor
 phite [3(3PbO, PO3 +Pb Cl)], apatite, &c.            By the diffusion of solu
 tions of silica and alumina in    potash the  authorhopes   to produce felspar.
    The   crystallization    of soluble bodies is   equally  simple.    Thus, if
 a solution of    sulphate   of iron be  put  into a beaker,  carefully covered
 with a thin stratum of water, and the beaker filled up with alcohol,
 crystallization commences in the course of a few hours and proceeds
 rapidly. Crystals may probably be prepared in the same manner
 from acid and alkaline, alcoholic, aetherial and other fluids; and the
 separation of two bodies by alteration of the solvent which is so often
 employed in organic chemistry, may thus be combined with a sepa
 ration by crystallization.                            *
    The identification of the      crystals obtained with the minerals does
not repose upon chemical analysis. However, the number of com
pounds which might possibly be produccd is very limited, and the
crystals correspond most exactly with the minerals in their physical
and qualitative chemical properties, as well as in their grouping and
geometrical form.—Ann, der Chem. und Pharm. vol. lxxxvii. p. 120.
           ON   THE PASSIVE STATE OF NICKEL AND COBALT,
                                 BY J. NICKLEs.
    The curious property possessed by iron of becoming less oxidizable
after being placed in contact with fuming nitric acid, has exercised
the sagacity of many chemists and physicists.            This passive state is

                    Intelligence           and Miscellaneous        Articles.                    455
induced, not only by the contact of fuming nitric acid, but also when
the iron is blued by the spirit-lamp, or when it is touched with a
piece of platinum whilst immersed in non-fuming nitric acid. The
same effect is obtained when the iron is attached to the positive pole
of a voltaic battery.
   In consequence of the modifications which it undergoes under
these circumstances, iron does not precipitate sulphate of copper
when it is employed as the anode of a voltaic element; oxygen is
evolved around it without attacking it; it bears contact with aqueous
nitric acid without alteration, but becomes active again when it is
plunged into water after being taken out of the acid.
   The same thing takes place more or less with nickel and cobalt
when drawn into wire. In contact with fuming nitric acid these
two metals only acquired a passive state of very short duration, but
their passivity becomes permanent, when, after bluing over the flame
of a spirit-lamp or a charcoal fire, they are plunged whilst hot into
this acid; they then behave exactly like passive iron, except that
they are less negative than that metal in nitric acid. They never
theless communicate their passive state to active iron immersed in
non-fuming nitric acid, and arrest the violent attack of the acid on
the metal.
   Platinum is always negative in regard to these three metals when
rendered passive, and each of the latter is also negative in regard to
the three active metals. The neutrality of passive iron in sulphate
of copper, pointed out by Schönbein, could not be reproduced out of
the circuit; in        the experiments the passive iron was soon sur
                           all
rounded with metallic copper.

        HIGH TEMPERATURES.               B.Y. M. EDMOND BECQUEBEL.
    The   apparatus    employed      in these researches consists of a long
platinum tube without a joint, surrounded by an earthen tube which
traverses a furnace horizontally.           This tube, which is to receive the
gases submitted to experiment, is of sufficient thickness to allow of
a vacuum being produced in it without disfigurement, even when a
portion of it is at a red heat.
    Two platinum wires, completely insulated, are stretched lengthwise
through the tube parallel to one another, in such a manner that if
each of them communicates with one pole of the battery, the elec
trical current can only circulate when the gaseous medium sepa
rating the wires becomes a conductor. These two wires are some
times replaced by a rod of platinum or iron, also insulated and parallel
to the tube, when the rod and the tube are employed as electrodes
instead of the two platinum wires.
    In the course of the circuit are interposed a galvanometer of
extreme sensibility, and a rheostat of peculiar construction.                 This
rheostat consists of a column of fluid of very small diameter con
tained in a divided capillary tube like that of a thermometer, and so
arranged that       its
                      length can              be

same temperature.          The circuit now containing the battery, the gas
which has acquired conductive power, the rheostat and the galvano
