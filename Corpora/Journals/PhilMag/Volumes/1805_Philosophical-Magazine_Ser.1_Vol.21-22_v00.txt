I.  On the present State of Husbandry in Bengal.              By a
          Gentleman now residing in that Country *.
 -L he regular succession of periodical rains, followed by a
mild winter, which exempt from frost, is almost as free from
Tain; and this succeeded by great heat, refreshened occa
sionally by showers of rain and hail, affords its proper sea*
son for every production of tropical and temperate climates.
Few are altogether unknown in Bengal.             Those which ac
tually engage the industry of the husbandmen are numerous
and varied.    Of these, rice is the most important. Corn in
every country is the first object of agriculture, as the prin
cipal food of the inhabitants ; in this, where animal food is
seldom used, it is especially important.
   The natural seasons of nee are ascertained from the pro
gress of wild rice.     It sows itself in the first month of the
winter ; vegetates with the early moisture at the approach
of the rains; ripens during that period; and drops its seed
with the commencement of the winter.
   A culture calculated to conform to this progress is prac
tised in some districts.     The rice is sown in low situations
when nearly desiccated ; the soil hardening above the seed
gives no passage to early showers ; the grain vegetates at
the approach of the rains, and ripens in that season, earlier
or later, according as the field is overflown to a less or greater
depth.
   This method is bad, as it exposes the seed to injury
during a long period in which it should remain inert : the
practice is not frequent.       Common husbandry sows the
rice at the season when it should naturally vegetate, to
gather a crop in the rains ; it also withholds seed till the
second month of that season, and reaps the harvest in the
            * From the Asiatic Annual Register for 1801.

 4                     On the present State
  beginning of winter : and the rice of this harvest is esteemed
  the best, not being liable to early decay.
     In low situations, where the progress of desiccation I*
  slow, and on the shelving banks of lakes which retain
  moisture till the return of the rains, a singular cultivation
  sows rice at the end of the rain3, and, by frequent trans
  planting and irrigation, forces it to maturity in the hot sea
  son : and in situations nearly similar, sows in the cold sea
  son for an early harvest, obtained by a similar method at
  the commencement of the rains.
     In almost every plant the culture, in proportion as it is
  more generally diffused, induces numerous varieties.          But
  the several seasons of cultivation, added to the influence of
  soil and climate, have multiplied the different species of
  rice to an endless variety, branching from the first obvious
  distinction of awned and awnless rice. The several species
  and diversities, variously adapted to every circumstance of
  soil, climate and season, might exercise the judgment of
  sagacious cultivators : the selection of the most suitable
  kinds is not neglected by the husbandmen. There is room,
  however, for great improvement, from the future tight to
  be thrown on this subject by the observations of enlight
 ened farmers.
     Other corn is more limited in its varieties and its culture.
 Of wheat and barley, few sorts are distinguished. ^11 sown
 at the commencement of the winter, and reaped at the be
 ginning of the hot season.
     A great variety of different sorts of pulse finds its place in
 the occupations of husbandry.         No season is without its
 appropriate species : but most sorts are sown or ripen in
 the winter. They constitute a valuable article in husbandry,
 as thriving on die poorest soils, and requiring Utile culture.
     Millet and other small grains, though bearing a very
 low price, as the food of the poorest classes, are not un
 important : several of
                          tlvewj grains, restricted to no season,
 and vegetating rapidly, are useful, as they occupy an in
 terval after a tardy harvest, which would not permit the
 usual course of husbandry.        Maize, which mav be placed
 in this second class of corn, is letis cultivated in Bengal than
 in most countries where it is acclimated.           For common
'food, inferior to white corn, it has not a preference above
 millet to compensate the greater labour of its culture.
    The universal and vast consumption of vegetable oils is
supplied bv the extensive cultivation of mustard, linseed,
sesame, palmacbristi, &c.         The first occupy the winter
reason ;    the sesame ripens  in the  rains,

     Among the most important of the productions of Bengal,
rich in proportion to the land they occupy, valuable in com
merce and manufactures, are tobacco, sugar, indigo, cotton,
mulberrv, and poppy.           Most of these require land solely
appropriated     to the  respective culture of each ; they would
here deserve full notice, with some other articles, if we
were not in this place limited to a general review of the
usual course of husbandry, and the implements and me
thods it employs.
     The arts and habits of one country elucidate those of
another.       The native of the North may deem every thing
novel in India ; but if he have visited the southern king
doms of Europe, he will find much similarity to notice.
     The plough, the spade of Bengal, and 'the coarse substi
tute for the harrow, will remind hiin of similar implements
 in Spain.      Cattle treading out the corn from the ear, will
 recall the same practice in the south of Europe : where, also,
 he has already remarked the want of barns and of inclosures;
 the disuse of horses for the plough ; the business of domestic
 economy conducted in the open air; and the dairy supplied
 with the milk of buffaloes.
      The plough is drawn by a single yoke of oxen, guided
 by the ploughman himself.            Two or three pair of oxen as
  signed    to each   plough,   relieve  each other until the daily
  task becomplcted.        Several ploughs in succession deepen
  the same furrows, or rather scratch the surface ; for thd
  plough wants a contrivance for turning the earth, and the
  share has neither width nor depth to stir a new soil.           A
  second ploughing crosses the first, and a third is sometimes
  given diagonally to the preceding. These frequently re
  peated, and followed by the substitute for the harrow, pul
  verize the surface, and prepare it for the reception of seed.
  The field must be watched for several days, to defend the
  •eed from the depredations          of numerous flocks of birds.
  This is commonly the occupation of children, stationed to
   scare the birds from the fresh sown field.
      After the plant has risen, the Tapid growth of weeds de
   mands frequent weedings, particularly in the rainy season.
   For, few indigenous herbs vegetating in the dry season,
   weeding is littfe, if at all required for plants which are
  cultivated in the absence of ram. Viewing the labours of
   the weeders, the eycis not easily reconciled to see them
   sitting to their work.     The short-handled spud, which they
   use for a hoe, permits no other posture : but however fa
   miliar that posture may be to the Indian, his labour is not
  employed to advantage in this mode of weeding.       ~

 6                         On the present State
     The hook (for      the scythe is unknown) reaps every liar-
 vest.     In this   also much unnecessary labour is employed ;
 not merely from the want of a more expeditious implement,
 but from the practice of selecting the ripest plants, which,
 taught by the harvest of different plants ripening succes
 sively, the Indian extends to the harvest of a simple crop.
 Yet such is the contradictions of custom, that while the
 peasant returns frequently to one field to gather the plants
 as they ripen, he suffers another to stand long after the
 greatest part of the crop has passed the point or maturity.
 He justifies his practice upon circumstances which render
 it impracticable to enter these fields to select the ripe plants
 without damaging the rest ; and upon the inferiority of crops
 w hich mix wilh ripe corn a considerable proportion not
 fully ripened. Though his excuse be not groundless, his
 loss is considerable, oy the grain which drops before the
 harvest in so great a quantity, that if the field remain un
 sown it will afford a crop by no means contemptible *.
     The practice of stacking corn intended to be reserved for
,seed, or for a late sale, is very unusual.            The husk which
 covers rice preserves it so perfectly, that, for this grain, the
 practice would be superfluous : and the management of rice
 serving for the type of their whole husbandry, it is neglected
 by the peasants lor other corn. A careless stack which waits
 the peasant's leisure.to thrash it out serves for a convenient
 disposition, rather than as a defence from the inclemencies
 of weather. With the first opportunity his cattle tread
 out the corn, or his staff thrashes the smaller seeds. The
 grain Is winnowed in the wind, and stored in jars of un
 baked earth, in baskets, or in twisted grass formed into the
 shape    of  baskets.      ,
     The want of roads, which, indeed, could not possibly be
 provided to. give access to every field; in every season, does
 not leave it in the option of the farmer to bring home all
 his harvests by cattle ; but the general disuse of cattle irt
 circumstances which would permit this mode of transport,
 is among the facts^ which show a great disproportion be
 tween the population and the husbandry,
    • Of this, instances are frequent : the remarkable result of one instance •
 deserves to be mentioned.      An early inundation covered a very extensive
 tract before the rice had been sown : the landlord remitted the rents, but
 claimed the spontaneous ciop; and he profited by the accommodation,
 realising from this harvest a greater amount than the rents he remitted 5
 although, in aifdition to the common expenses, he was at considerable *
 cott to watch the crop, and wat probably defrauded of a large proportion
 pf the harvest,                                           .         * —

            Irrigation is less neglected than facility of transport.  In
        the management of forced rice, dams retain the water on
        extensive plains, or reserve it in lakes, to water lower lands
        as occasion requires.     For either purpose much skill is ex
        erted in regulating the supplies of water.          For the same
        culture, ridges surrounding the field retain water raised hy
        the simple contrivance of a curved canoe swinging from a
        pole. In other situations ridges are also raised round the
        field, both to separate lands and to regulate the water on
        considerable tracts. . In some provinces water raised by
        cattle, or by hand, from wells, supply the deficiencies of
        rain.     Each of these, being within their compass, is the
        undertaking of the peasants themselves.       More considerable
        works, not less necessary, are much neglected.        Reservoirs,
        water-courses, and dykes, are more generally in a progress
        of decay than of improvement.                      ¦ ¦
            The succession of crops, which engages      so  much the at
        tention of enlightened cultivators in Europe, and on which
        principally rests the success of a well-conducted husbandry,
        is .not understood in India.       A course extending beyond
        the year has never been dreamt of by a Bengal farmer: in
        the succession of crops within the year, he is guided to no
        choice of an article adapted to restore the land impoverished
        by a former crop. His attention being fixed on white corn,
        other cultivation only employs the intervals of leisure which
         the seasons of white corn allow to the land and to labour ;
         with an exception' however to sugar, silk, and other valuable
        productions, to which corn is secondary; but which, grown
        on appropriate lands, belong not to the consideration of the
        course of crops.      In this, which is not regulated by any
        better consideration than convenience ofvtime, it would be
        superfluous to specify the different courses which, occur in
        practice : as little would it tend to any useful purpose to
        dcvelope the various combinations of different articles grown
                                                                            '

          A    competent notion may be formal of tfeis practice by
        conceiving a farmer eager to obtain.the utmost possible pro

        pome article suited to the time, and not content to use his
        field so soon as the harvest makes room for succession, but
        anticipating the vacancy, or obtaining a crop of quick ve

as the several    articles deprive each other of the nourishment
which would have afforded a more abundant crop of either
 separately, and as the land impoverished makes bad returns
 for the labour and seed. In most situations the land racked
in this husbandry soon requires time to recruit ; the Indian
allows it a lay, but never a fallow.            This would be well
judged,   if  the   management     of stock  gave to the lay all the
benefit which belongs to this method, and if the inefneacy
of the plough, which must be preceded by the spade, did
not greatly increase the expense of opening old lays.
    The abuse of dung, employed for fuel instead of being
applied to manure, must have concealed from the husband
man the benefit of well managed stock : else, in his prac
tice of pasturing his cattle in the stubble of his harvest, and
in fields of which the crop has failed, he could not omit -
to notice the advantage of a farm well stocked.              For want
of perceiving this benefit, the cattle for labour and subsist
ence arc mostly pastured on small commons, or other pas
turage, intermixed with arable lands, or fed at home on
straw or cut grass ; and the cattle for breeding, and for the
dairy, are grazed in numerous herds on the forests and
downs.      Wherever fed, the dung is carefully collected for
fuel.

ol cattle, through the wilful neglect of the herdsmen,, it is
                                                                          ',
a matter of surprise that inclosures are so much neglected.
For a reason already mentioned cattle cannot be left at
night unattended : birt, in the present practice, buffaloes,
only are grazed at nighty cows and oxen are pastured in                         ...
the day.     For these, inclosures would be valuable, and even .
for buffaloes would not be useless ; and the farmer would
be well rewarded by suffering the cattle to fertilize all his; .

snear-canc, mulberry, tobacco, poppy, &c.

      the complicated models of Europe should be copied in India.
     A passion for the contrivances of ingenuity has adopted in
     tricate machinery for simple operations. The economy of
      labour in many cases justifies the practice, whether an ef
      fect be produced at a smaller expense, or more be performed
  •' at
          proportionate expense, but with less labour.        In Bengal
      the value of money, and the cheapness of labour, would
      render it absurd to propose costly machinery            but is no
      objection to simple improvements, which, adding little to
      the cost of the implements, would fit them to perform,
  ^'roorc effectually, and with less labour, the object under

     ^0              Present   Stale   of Husbandry in Bengal.
          The want of capital, employed in manufactures and agri
       culture, prevents, in Bengal, the division of labour.         Every
       manufacturer, every artist, working for his own account,
       conducts the whole process of his art from the formation of
       his tools to tjie sale of his production.    Unable to wait the
       market, or anticipate its demand, he can only follow his
       regular occupation as immediately called to it by the wants
       of his neighbours.     In the intervals he must apply to some
       other employment in immediate request ; and the labours
       of agriculture, ever wanted, are the general resource. The
       mechanic, finding himself as fully competent as the constant
      cultivator to the management of common husbandry, is
       not discouraged from undertaking it at his own risk. Every
      labourer, every artizan, who has frequent occasion to recur
       to the labours of the field, becomes a tenant. Such farmers
      are ill qualified to plan or conduct a well judged course of
      husbandry, and are idly employed, to the great waste of
      useful time, in carrying to market the paltry produce of their
      petty farms.
          If Bengal had a capital in the hand of enterprising pro
      prietors, who employed it in husbandry, manufactures, and
      internal commerce, these arts would be improved ; and,
      with greater and better productions from the same labour,
      the situation of ihe labourers would be less precarious and
      more affluent, although the greatest part of the profit might
      rest with the owners of the capital.
         Capital is certainly not less deficient to the internal com
      merce of Bengal than to manufactures and agriculture. The
      small capitals now employed require large returns. Blessed
     as Bengal   is,  beyond any country, with an extensive internal
     navigation,     the  want of roads (though      agreat evil) would
     not sufficiently account for the very limited intercourse of
     commerce at present existing.        But tbe large profits which
     small capitals require, explain the want of intercourse.
     This conspires with the deficiency of capital in manufac
     tures     and husbandry to depress Bengal             for in agri
                                                             ;
     culture particularly, which         the basis of prosperity to
                                          is                                         a
     country, the want of capital             bar to all improvement.

     Under   a    system of government which neither drained its
     wealth nor curbed rational enterprise, Bengal could not fail
     to revive; the employment of capital in husbandry would
     introduce large farms, and from these would flow every
     improvement wanted; and which must naturally extend
    'from husbandry into every branch of arts and commerce.
         Without capital and enterprise, improvement can never
     be obtained.       Precept will never inculcate        better hus-

           Present State     of Husbandry in Bengal.                    11
bandry on the humble unenlightened peasant.          It could
not, without example, generally engage a wealthier and
better informed class.    Positive institutions would be of as
little avail. The legislator cannot direct the judgment of
his subjects ; his business is only to be careful lest his re
gulations * disturb them in the pursuit of their true in
terests.
    In Bengal, where the revenue of the state has had the
form of land-rent, the management of finances has a more
immediate influence on agriculture than any other part of
the administration.     The svstem which has been adopted,
of withdrawing from direct interference with the occupants,
and leaving them to tenant from landlords, will contribute,
more than any of th« rcmediary             f
                                        regulations which have
been promulgated, to abuses and evils which had rendered
the situation of the cultivator precarious. But not yet hav
 ing produced its effect, it requires us to review the system
 of finances, under which abuses had grown, and placed the
 occupant in a precarious situation, as discouraging to agri
 culture as any circumstance yet noticed ; for without an
 ascertained interest for a sufficient period, no person could
  have an inducement to venture a capital in husbandry.
   *   A strong instance of such ill-advised institutions occurs in a local
regulation, which prohibited farms exceeding fifty begahs.
   t   Regulations on this and other subjects have copied too closely the
notions and forms of European na: ions. Though they have been framed
by persons well informed of the customs and prejudices of the natives, a
predilection for the maxims' of European societies has introduced rules,
which, if not incompatible with the disposition of the Indian, have at
 least been pressed with too eager haste, not allowing time to the natives
to accommodate themselves to new forms and to innovating maxims.
 The provisions of new laws, not easily apprehended by the natives, are
 to them the more (obscure, being framed in a foreign language, fre;m
 which translations cannot assimilate to the' idiom of their own tongue.
  Hence the best intentions have not yet produced good effects.          The
  people have received no material relief, no considerable benefit i the only
  consequence is,  that their understandings are confounded, and their minds

   too grains of the best stick lac, separated as much as
possible from the twigs, were put into a glass retort, to
which a double tubulated receiver and hydro-pneumatic
apparatus were adapted.       Distillation was then gradually
performed,    with  an   open  fire, until the bottom of the
retort became red hot.

   The coal of the shell lac, by incineration, afforded about
one grain of ashes, which contained a muriate, probably
of soda, and a little iron, with some particles of sand,
which may be regarded as extraneous.
                     Analysis of Stick Lac.
    A. 200 grains of stick lac, picked and reduced to powder,
Were digested in a pint and a half of boiling distilled water
during 12 hours.       The liquor was transparent, and of a
beautiful deep red ; this was decanted into another vessel,
and the operation was repeated, with fresh portions of wa
ter, until it ceased to be tinged : the lac then appeared of a
 pale yellowish-brown colour.
    The whole of the aqueous solution being evaporated, left
a deep red substance, which possessed the general proper
ties of vegetable extract, and weighed 1 8 grains.
    B. The dried lac was digested for 48 hours, without heat,
in eighteen ounces of alcohol ; and the clear tincture being
cautiously decanted,     different portions of alcohol were
added, and the digestion was repeated, until the alcohol
ceased to produce any effect.
   The whole of the solutions in alcohol were then poured
into distilled water, which was heated, and an attempt was
made to separate the precipitated substance by filtration ;
but, as this did not succeed, on account of the filter
speedily becoming clogged, the whole was subjected to
gentle distillation ; by which a brownish-yellow       resin was
obtained, amounting in weight to 136 grams.
    C. The remainder of the lac was again digested in boil
ing distilled water ; by which 2 grains of the colouring ex
tract were obtained.
   D. The residuum was then digested with one ounce of
muriatic acid diluted with two ounces of water, which, by
boiling, became of a bright pale red, but changed to purple,
)vhen saturated with a solution of carbonate of potash.
    A flocculent precipitate was thus obtained, which pos
sessed the characters of precipitated vegetable gluten com
bined with some of the colouring extract ; this, when com
pletely dried, weighed 1 1 grains. • .
   E. There now remained 25 grains, which evidently con
sisted of a sort of wax, mixetl with small parts of twigs
and other extraneous substances.
   A part of the wax was separated by heat and pressure iii a
piece of linen ; and another portion was separated by di
gestion in olive oil, which assumed the consistency of an .

    The residuum was then boiled with lixivium of potash,
 and became tinged with purple, in consequence of some
 of the colouring extract which had not been dissolved by
 the preceding operations.
    The undissolved part, now consisting only of the extra
 neous vegetable and other substances, weighed 1 3 grains j
 so that the wax, with a small portion of the colouring ex
 tract, may be estimated at 12 grains.
    By the above process, 200 grains of stick lac afforded,
                                                         Grains.

                     Analysis of Shell Lac.
    A.   500 grains of this substance were first  treated   with
boiling distilled water, as above-mentioned, and yielded
of extract only 2.50 grains.
    B. The 497.50 grains which remained, were then di
gested with different portions of cold alcohol, until this
ceased to produce any effect ; the resin which was thus
separated amounted to 403.50 grains.                             '
    C. As the shell lac had not been reduced into powder,
but only into small fragments, these were become white
and elastic, and, when dry, were brittle, and of a pale
brown colour ; the whole then weighed 94 grains.
    D. These 91 grains were digested in diluted muriatic
acid ; and the acid, being afterwards saturated with solu
tion of carbonate of potash, afforded a flocculent precipi
tate (resembling that obtained from solutions of vegetable
gluten), which, when dry, weighed 5 grains.
                                                   E. Alcohol

               Experiments and Observations     on  Lac.          15
      E. Alcohol acted but feebly on the residuum ; it was
  therefore put into a matrass, with three ounces of acetic
  acid, and was suffered to digest without heat during six
  days, the vessel being at times gently shaken ; the acicl thus
  assumed a pale brown colour, and was very turbid.              The
  whole was then added to half a pint of alcohol, and was
  digested in a sand-bath ; by which a brownish tincture was
  formed, and at the same time a quantity of a whitish floc-
  culent substance was deposited, which, being collected,
  well washed with alcohol on a filter, and dried, weighed
   20 grains.
       This substance was white, light, and flaky, and, when
  rubbed by the nail, it became glossy, like wax ; it also
'
  easily melted, was absorbed by heated paper, and, when
   placed on a coal or hot iron, emitted a smoke, the odour
   of which very much resembled that of wax, or rather
   spermaceti.
       F. The solution formed by acetic acid and alcohol being
   filtrated, was poured into distilled water, which immediately
   became milky ; and, being heated, the greater part of the
   fesin which had been dissolved assumed a curdy form, and
   was partly separated by a filter, and partly by distilling off
   the liquor ; this portion of resin amounted to 51 grains.
       G. The filtrated liquor, from which this resin had been
   separated, was saturated with a solution of carbonate of
   potash ; and, being heated, a second precipitate of gluten
    •was obtained, which, when well dried, weighed 9 grains.
       The 500 grains of shell lac thus yielded,         Grains.

        The mode of analysis    adopted for the shell lac, must un
    doubtedly appear    less simple than that which was employed
    loir seed ana stick lac ; but, upon the whole, it was attended
    With advantages ; for the shell lac being in small fragments,
    and not in the state of a powder, considerably facilitated
     the decantation of the solution in alcohol from the resi
     duum ; and although, in this last, a portion of the resin
     was protected from the action of the alcohol, by being
     enveloped in the gluten and wax, yet, by the assistance of
     acetic acid, the remainder of the resin, as well as the whole
                                                                    of

 of the gluten, were dissolved ; the wax was obtained in a
 pure state, and a separation of the resin from the gluten
 was afterwards easily effected by the method which has
 been described.       As therefore acetic acid is capable of
 dissolving  resin,  gluten, and many other of the vegetable
 principles,  it certainly may be regarded as a very useful
 solvent in the analysis of bodies appertaining to the vege
 table kingdom.
    From the results of the preceding analyses it appears, that
 the different kinds of lac consist of four substances, namely,
 extract, resin, gluten, and wax, the separate properties of
 which shall now be more fully considered.
                Properties     of the colouring Extract of Lac.
      1.   When dry it   is of a deep red colour, approaching to
  purplish   crimson.
     2. Being put on a red-hot iron it emits much smoke,
 with a smell somewhat resembling burned animal matter,
 and leaves a verytulky and porous coal.
     3. Water, when digested with it in a boiling heat, par
 tially dissolves it ; but the residuum was found to be ab
 solutely insoluble in water.
     4. Alcohol acts but slowly on              and, in
                                                      it,    digesting      a
 heat, dissolves less than water. The colour of the solution
is   also not so beautiful     and  ; considerable part of the re
                                             a
 siduum left             by
                     alcohol was, when digested with water,
 found to be soluble, although this was not the case when
 the residuum left             by
                           water was treated with alcohol.
     5.    It  insoluble in sulphuric ether, excepting
                is                                                very          a
 small portion of resin, which appeared to be accidentally
 mixed with it.
     0. Sulphuric acid readily dissolves           and formsit,  deep           a
brownish-red solution, which, being diluted with water,
and saturated with potash, soda, or ammonia, becomes
 changed to       deep reddish-purple.

a  deep reddish-purple.
    8. Nitric acid speedily dissolves           the solution

 by   the alkalis, for these only deepen the yellow colour.
This nitric solution did not afford any trace of oxalic acid.

when saturated with alkalis, are changed to a deep reddish-

    1 1. The lixivia of potash, soda, and ammonia, act power
fully on this substance, and almost immediately form per
fect solutions, of a beautiful deep purple colour.
    12. Pure alumina, put into the aqueous solution, does
not immediately produce any effect ; but, upon the addition
of a few drops of muriatic acid, the colouring matter
speedily combines with the alumina, and a beautiful lake
is formed.
    13. Muriate of tin produces a fine crimson precipitate
when added to the aqueous solution.
    14. A similar coloured precipitate is also formed by the
addition of solution of isinglass.
    These properties of the colouring substance of lac, espe
cially its partial solubility in water and in alcohol, and its
insolubility in ether, together with the precipitates formed
by alumina and muriate of tin, indicate that this substance is
vegetable extract, perhaps slightly animalized by the coccus.
    The effects which it produced on gelatin, also demon
strate the presence of tannin ; but this very probably was
afforded by the small portions of vegetable bodies, from
which the stick lac can seldom be completely separated.
                  Propei lies of the Resin of Lac.
    This substance is of a brownish-yellow colour ; and,
 when put on a red-hot iron, it emits much smoke, with a
 peculiar sweet odour, and leaves a spongy coal.
     It is completelv soluble in alcohol, ether, acetic acid,
 nitric acid, and the lixivia of potash and soda.
    Water precipitates it from alcohol, ether, acetic acid,
 and partially from nitric acid ; and it possesses the other
 general characters of a true resin.
                  Properties  of the Gluten of Lac.
     It has been already observed, that when small pieces of
 ehell lac have been repeatedly digested in cold alcohol, they
 become white, bulky, and elastic. By drying, these pieces
 become brownish and brittle; the elasticity is also destroyed
 by boiling water, exactly as when the gluten of wheat is
 thus treated.
      If the pieces of shell lac, after the digestion in alcohol,
  be digested with diluted muriatic acid, or with acetic acid,
  the greater part of the gluten is dissolved, and may be
  precipitated in a while flaky state, by alkalis; but, if these last
 be added to excess, and heat be applied, then the glutinous
  substance is redissolved, and may be precipitated by acids.

18         Experiments and Observations on Lac.
     If
      the pieces of shell lac, after digestion in alcohol, be
treated with alkaline lixivia, then the whole is dissolved,
and forms a turbid solution. But when acids are employed,
the chief part of the gluten is alone acted upon, and a con
siderable residuum is left, consisting of the wax, some of
the resin, and a portion of gluten, which has been protected
from the action of the acid by the two former substances.
   The above properties indicate a great resemblance between
this substance and the gluten of wheat ;              I
                                               therefore have
called it gluten, but at a future time I intend to subject it
to a more accurate examination.
                Properties   of   the    Wax of Lac.
     Ifshell lac be long and repeatedly digested in boiling
¦Uric acid, the whole is dissolved, excepting the wax, which
floats on the surface of the liquor, like oil, and, when cold,
may be collected ; or it may be more easily obtained in a
pure state, by digesting the residuum left by alcohol in
boiling nitric acid.
  The wax thus obtained,          when pure, is pale yellowish
white, and (unlike bees-wax) is devoid of tenacity, and is
extremely brittle.
   It melts at a much lower temperature than that of boiling
water, burns with a bright flame, and emits an odour some
what resembling that of spermaceti.
   Water does not act upon         it,neither does cold alcohol           ;
but this last, when boiled, partially dissolves            it,
                                                         and, upon
cooling, deposits    the  greater part    ; small
                                              a     portion, how
ever, remains in solution, and may be precipitated           water.  by
   Sulphuric ether, when heated, also dissolves it; but,
upon cooling, nearlv the whole           is
                                        deposited.
   Lixivium of potash, when boiled with the wax, forms                    a
milky solution but the chief part of the wax floats on the
                ;
surface, in the state of white flocculi, and appears to be
converted into  a   soap of difficult solubility   ;   is no longer

                                                  a
from which, as well as from the solution in potash, the
wax may be precipitated      by  acids.
   Ammonia, when heated, also dissolves           small portion of
                                                  a
the wax, and forms solution very similar to the former.
                       a
   Nitric and muriatic acids do not seem to act upon the
wax   : the effects of sulphuric acid have not been examined.
   When the properties of this substance arc compared with
those of bees-wax,   a   difference will be perceived      and, on
                                                                 ;

   An account of the latter substance has been published
by Dr. Bostock, of Liverpool, in Nicholson's Journal,
with comparative Experiments and Observations on Bees-
Wax, Spermaceti, Adipocire, and the crystalline Matter
of biliary Calculi*.
   The properties of the myrtle wax, as described in Dr.
Bostock's valuable paper, so perfectly coincide with those
which I have observed in the wax of lac, that I cannot but
consider them as almost the same substance ; indeed I
think they may be regarded as absolutely identical, if some
allowance be made for the slight modifications which have
been produced by the different mode of their formation.
   From the preceding experiments and analyses we find,
that the varieties of lac consist of the four substances which
have been described ; namely, extractive colouring matter,
resin, gluten, and a peculiar kind of wax.               Resin is the
predominant substance ; but this, as well as the other in
gredients, is liable, in a certain degree, to variation in re
spect to quantity.
   According to the analyses which have been described, one
hundred parts of each variety of lac yielded as follows.

to           Experiments and Observations on Lac.
  The proportions of the substances which compose the
varieties of fae, must however be subject to very .consider
able variations ; and we ought therefore only to consider
these analyses in a general point of view.   Hence we should
state, that lac consists principally of resin, mixed with
certain proportions of a peculiar kind of wax, of gluten,
and of colouring extract.
   The relative quantity of the two latter ingredients very
considerably affects the characters of the lacs ; for instance,
we may observe that the glutinous substance,      when present
in shell lac in a more than usual proportion, probably pro
duces the defect observed in some kinds of sealing-wax,
which, when heated and burned, become blackened by
particles of coal ; for the gluten affords much of this sub
stance, and does not melt like the resin and wax.    From
what has been stated, therefore, lac may be denominated a
aero-resin, mixed with gluten and colouring extract.
                              §111.
                         General Remarks.
     From the whole of the experiments which have been re
 lated, it appears, that although lac is indisputably the pro
 duction of insects, yet it possesses few of the characters of
 animal substances ; and that the greater part of its aggre
gate properties, as well as of its component ingredients, are
 such as more immediately appertain to vegetable bodies.
     Lac, or gum lac, as it is popularly, but improperly, called,
 is certainly a very useful substance ; and the natives of
 India furnish full proofs of this, by the many purposes to
which they apply it.
     According to Mr. Kerr it is made by them into rings,
beads, and other female ornaments.
     When formed into sealing-wax, it is employed as a
japan, and is likewise manufactured into different coloured
 varnishes.
     The colouring part is formed into lakes for painters : a
sort of Spanish wool for the ladies is also prepared with it ;
 and as a dyeing material it is in very general use.
     The resinous part is even employed to form grindstones,
 by melting      and mixing with it about three parts of sand.
               it,
 For making polishing grindstones, the sand       sifted through

    But in addition to all the above uses to which it is ap
plied in India, as well as to those which cause it to be in
request in Europe, Mr. Wilkins's Hindu ink occupies a
conspicuous place, not merely on account of its use as an
ink, but because it teaches us to prepare an aqueous solu
tion of lac, which probably will be found of very extensive
utilitv.
    This solution of lac in water may be advantageously em
ployed' as a sort of varnish, which is equal in durability
and other qualities to those prepared with alcohol; whilst,
by the saving of this liquid, it is infinitely cheaper.
     I do not mean, however, to assert that it will answer
 equally well in all cases, but only that it may be employed
 in many. It will be found likewise of great use as a vehicle
for colours; for, when dry, it is not easily affected by
damp, or even by water.
     With a solution of this kind I have mixed various co
lours, such as vermilion, fine lake, indigo, Prussian blue,
 sap green, and gamboge; and it is remarkable, that al
 though the two last are of a gummy nature, and the others
 had been previously mixed with gum (being cakes of the,
 patent water-colours), yet, when dried upon paper, they
 could not be removed with a moistened sponge, until the
 surface of the paper itself was rubbed off.
     In many arts and manufactures, therefore, the solutions
 of lac may be found of much utility ; for, like mucilage,
 thev may be diluted with water, and yet, when dry, are
 little if at all affected by it*.
     We find, from the experiments on lac, that this substance
 is soluble in the alkalis, and in some of the acids.                  But
 this fact (considering that resin is the principal ingredient
 of lac) is in opposition to the generally received opinion of
 chemists ; namely, that acids and alkalis do not act upon
 resinous      bodies.    Some experiments, however, which                I
    * The alkaline solutions of lac are
                                         evidently of a saponaceous nature,
 and,   like other soaps, may be decomposed by acids. The entire sub
 stance of be is not however completely dissoived, as appears from the
 turbidness of the liquors.    Three of the four ingredients; namely, the
 resin, the gluten, and the co>ouring extract, appear to be in perfect so
 lution ; whilst the wax is only partially combmed with the alkali, and
 forms that imperfectly soluble saponaceous compound which has been
 formerly mentioned, and which remains suspended, and disturbs the
 transparency of the solution.
     From various circumstances, it does not seem improbable that the
 long sought for, but hitherto undiscovered vehicle employed by the cele
 brated painters of the Venetian School, may have been some kind of
 resinous solution, prepared by means of borax, or by the alkalis.

lwtve made on various resins, gum-resins, and balsams, fully
establish that these substances are powerfully acted upon by
the alkalis, and by some of the acids, so as to be completely
dissolved, and rendered soluble in water.
    It will be a very wide and curious field of inquiry, to
discover what changes are thus produced in these bodies,
especially by nitric acid. Each substance must form the
subject of a separate investigation; and there cannot be a
doubt but that much will be learned respecting their nature
and properties, which hitherto have been so little examined
by chemists.
    The alkaline solutions of resin may be found useful in
some of the arts ; for many colours, especially those which
are metallic, when dissolved in acids, may be precipitated,
combined with resin, by adding the former to the alkaline
solutions of the latter.        I have made some experiments of
this kind with success ; and perhaps these processes might
prove useful to dyers and manufacturers of colours.                It is
probable also,      that  medicine may      derive   advantages   from

           III.   Some Account      of the Trade   of Siam*.
The       English know so little of this place and its trade,
that    it will require a particular description, as the traffic
may be much improved, particularly for the import and
consumption of British manufactures, such as broad cloths,
cutlery, ironmongery, jewelry, and toys.
    The Portuguese have principally enjoyed the trade and.
profits of this place.        There have been some speculations
made by British merchants from Calcutta, and which al
ways turned out to advantage.
    The Menam (the chief river), by which ships enter Siam,
discharges itself into the gulph of Siam, and is rendered dif
ficult or access on account of' a bar, to cross which it is ne
cessary to have a pilot.
    The winter here is dry, and the summer wet, occasioned
by the different monsoons, which act here as in the bay of
Bengal, viz. the north-easterly monsoon bringing in dry,
and the south-westerly monsoon bringing in heavy clouds,
thick weather, and rain.

                                                                   The

      The southerly monsoon         is therefore the season for ships
   to go to Siam,     as it is a fair wind to cross the bar ; and the
  northerly monsoon to leave the bar, and proceed to India
  through the straits of Malacca.
      Bankasoy, situated on the river near the bar, is the prin
  cipal place of trade ; and the king is the chief merchant, for
  his revenues are paid in elephants' teeth, sapan, and aquilla
  wood. This is the best part of the Malay coast for pro
  curing that exquisite sauce called ballichong, which the
  eastern epicures so much seek, value, and regale upon : it
 is made of a composition of dried shrimps, pepper, salt,
  seaweed, &x. &c. beaten together to the consistence of a
  tough paste ; and then packed in jars for sale, use, or ex
  portation.
      Siam, near the shores, (the only places where Europeans
  have access to,) is very unhealthy.           The land seems to be
  formed by the mud descending from the mountains ; to
 which mud, and the overflowings of the river, the soil owes
  its fertility ; for in the higher places, and parts remote from
  the inundation, all is dried and burnt up by the sun soon
  after the periodical rains are over.
      The arts have been in more repute, and better attended
  to formerly, than at the present time.           Few travellers will
  omit noticing the many casts at this place, both of statues
 and cannon, of an immense calibre and length, as well as
  many other curiosities, many of them in gold.
     The mountains produce diamonds of an excellent water,
  (little if at all inferior to those of Golconda, though not
 so large,) sapphires, rubies, and agates.
     They have tin of a very fine qualitv, of which they make
 tutanag ; steel, iron, lead, and gold : they have copper
 also of a fine quality, but not in great plenty.
     The low grounds produce rice in great quantities ; and
 on the higher grounds, that are not inundated, they raise
 wheat.        \hty have many medicinal plants and gums, oil
 of jessamine, sack, benzoin, crystal, emery, antimony,
 cotton, wood, oil, varnish, cinnamon, cassia buds, and
 iron-wood, which is much used by the natives, Malays,
 and Chinese, as anchors for their vessels.           They have also
 great quantity of white betel nut, which is exported to
 China, by the junks and Portuguese ships, which have en
joyed almost uninterruptedly the whole trade of this place,
 and the coast of Cochin-China, from the Ridang islands to
 Macao.
     They have also the fruits known in India, as well as the
                                    6 4 ,                      durian,

durian, mangostein, and tamarind, which are remarkable
for thriving here.
    The animals are horses, oxen, buffaloes, sheep and goats,
tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, deer, and some hares.
    There is poultry in great abundance, with peacocks, pi
geons, partridges, snipes, parrots, and many other birds.
    They have insects and vermin, as peculiar to other parts
of India.
    The sea yields them excellent fish of all kinds, particu
larly flounders, which are dried and exported to all the
eastern ports ; and they have extraordinary fine lobsters,
small turtles, and oysters. Here too are very fine river fish,
particularly the beatie (or cockup), silver eels of a very large
size, and mangoe fish, so much esteemed in Calcutta.
    From the humidity of the soil, it is almost unnecessary
to observe, that the chief disorders to which Europeans are
subject, are fluxes, dysenteries, fevers, and agues.
    No private merchant here dare trade in tin, tutanag,
elephants' teeth, lead, or sapan wood, without leave from
the king; which permission is seldom granted, as he mo
nopolizes these articles to himself, and pavs in them for
any goods he purchases, at the highest prices they will
bring at most markets in India.
    The following are the general prices for elephants' teeth
from the king in payment :
            2 teeth .to the pecul, equal to 1 20 ticalls.

 thus falling eight ticalls in each pecul, as the number of
 teeth increases.   But if you purchase with ready money,
 instead of receiving them in barter (or payment) for goods,
 you will buy each quality eight ticalls per pecul cheaper
 than the above prices ; and still lower if you have permis
  sion to trade with the Christians, or private merchants.
     In purchasing sapan wood, it is customary to allow five
  catties per pecul for loss of weight ; and as each draft is
                                                        weighed

                Account   of tlte Trade of Siam.                85
weighed by the large or five pecul dotchin, you are allowed
525 catties ; which, if it is the first sort, should not be
more than 1 6 to 1 8 pieces : second sort runs 2.2 to 24 pieces ;
and as the number of pieces increase the price falls in pro
portion.
   After you have settled with the ministers what part of
your cargo the king is to have, (which is commonly called
a present, unless he asks particularly to buy any thing,)
some of the principal merchants of the place arc called to
value them ; and as they are valued you are paid by the
king, as a present, in the fore-mentioned goods at the
highest prices they will bear.
    It may not be deemed superfluous here to observe, that
complaisant behaviour and a cheerfulness of disposition are
absolutely necessary, particularly if you have, as all traders
must have, a point to carry.       Presents, as they are called,
but in grosser language bribes, properly applied, give the
officers of government and the people in power the true tone
and relish to serve you, as you will have frequent occa
sion to call upon them in their official capacities.
    Every application for a permit to purchase any descrip
tion of goods costs 10£ ticalls : this permit only serves for
one house, and one time of weighing ; so that if you are
about receiving any quantity of goods of the same quality
from different merchants, agree with them to send it all to
one house, and make one day for weighing off the whole in
the merchant's name at whose house it is weighed. This
mode will save the expense of a multiplicity of permits, and
quicken dispatch.      Upon each of these weighing days you
 must have three of the king's writers; the first and second
 shabunder, and the linguist : to each of these, daily, you
 pay one-quarter ticall ; but it will be your interest to give
 them some trifling presents.
     Elephants' teeth, tin, sapan wood, and lead, purchased
 from the king, are free of all customs j but if bought from
 private merchants, they pay as follows :
         Elephants' teeth (any sort) 4 ticalls per pecul.
         Tin        -                 2 ditto   per bhar.
         Sapan wood           -       4 ditto per 100 pecul.
         Lead                         2 mace per bhar.
     If from any part of India, (as Bengal, the Coromandel,
 Malabar, or Guzerat coasts, Bombay, Surat, &c.) you
 pay the following customs before you sail :
    Measurage, if above 3 fathoms, or 1 8 feet beam, to the
        king          -            -                10 ticalls.

take a fresh port clearance from Malacca ; as the great in

IV.       Account of the Self-immolation of the tu o Widows                     of
              Ameer Jung, the late Regent of Tanjore *.
The     regent died on the 19th of April 1802, about ten
o'clock a. m. The moment he expired, two of his wives
adorned themselves with their jewels and richest clothes,
entered the apartment in which the body was laid, and,
after three prostrations, sat down by it ; and announced to
the whole court, which had assembled around        their de    it,
termination to devote themselves to the flames.
   The youngest of the women was the regular wife, and
about twenty years of age, and without children    the other    ;
was     wife of inferior rank, aged twenty-six, having one
         a

                                                                        child,

child,   a daughter four years old. The fathers and brothers
of both   were present in the assembly ; they made use of the
most pressing and affecting entreaties to avert them from
their purpose, but without success.
    The British resident at Tanjore, having been apprised of
the intention of these ladies, and not being able to be per
sonally present at the residence of the late regent, had sent
hi* hircarrah to the spot, with orders to use every possible
effort, short of absolute force, to prevent the horrid sacri
fice* When the relations of the ladies found their entreaties
of no avail to induce them to relinquish their purpose, the
hircarrah was sent for ; but his threats of the displeasure of
               had only a temporary and feeble effect.     The
   lahratta chiefs observed, that the Company had never in
fovernment
terfered in their religious institutions and ceremonies ; that
the sacrifice in question was by no means uncommon in
Tanjore ; that it was highly proper to use every art of per
suasion and entreaty to induce the women to relinquish
their resolution ; but, if they persisted in     it,
                                                   force ought
not to be used to restrain them. The women laughed at
the menaces of the hircarrah, when he told them that their
fathers and brothers would be exposed to the displeasure of
government. The younger widow observed, that           was not
                                                       it
the custom of the English government to punish one person
for the act of another and pointing to her father, who had
                       ;
actually thrown himself at her feet in an agony of grief,
asked the hircarrah   if   he thought any other inducement
 could alter her resolution when the affliction of her father
failed to move it. Tire young brother of the other widow
 went into the women.s apartments and returned with his
 sister's child in his arms, which he laid at her feet       but
                                                             ;
 such was the resolution of these astonishing women, that
 not a   single expression of regret, not  a sigh or tear could
 be drawn from them.       Any one  of these  weaknesses would
 have disqualified them from burning with the body; and
 the efforts of the relations were strenuously and constantly
 directed to excite them, but in vain.     In answer to an ob
 servation of the hircarrah, that   ifthe late regent had been
 aware of their intention he would have forbidden           it,
                                                            they
 said they had formed their resolution      a  year before, and
  communicated   it  to him;  who, after several ineffectual at
 tempts to dissuade them, had consented to it.
     The hircarrah, however, determined to protract the per-
-formance of the obsequies,    if possible, until the arrival of
  the resident. The women waited with patience until seven
 jn the evening, taking no other refreshment than little    a
             1                                                    betel

  betel occasionally.     They then sent for the hircarrah, arid
  told him that they suspected the cause of the delay, and were
  resolved, if the procession did not immediately set out, to,
  kill themselves before him. Their relatives now gave up the
          in despair.   The other chiefs, who had taken no part
    itherto, now interfered, and said they had a right to be in
  Eoint
  dulged, and should not be restrained.          The hircarrah re
 tired, and the procession set out. The younger and regular
 wife mounted the pile on which the body of the deceased'
 regent had been placed, and they were consumed together.
 The fate of the other, who was not entitled to this distinc
 tion, was, in appearance, more dreadful. A pit eight feet
 deep, and six in diameter, had been dug a few yards distant
 from the pile ; it was filled with combustible matter, and
  fire set to it.      When the flames were at the fiercest,
 fire was applied to the pile in which the young widow and
 the body of the regent had been enclosed.          The other, un
 supported,     walked  thrice  round  the pit,  and,   after making
 obeisance to the pile, threw herself into the midst of the
 flames, and was no more heard or seen !
 V. Memoir       on a. new Genus    of Mammalia with Pouches,
             named Perameles.      By E. Gkoffrov*.
The        animals with pouches which first engaged the at
 tention of naturalists are, as is well known, natives of
 America. They are carnivorous animals, which easily catch
their prey by means of their long canine teeth, and divide
it by employing their molar teeth, which, are laterally com
 pressed and terminated by three points.          Like the apes of
the same country, they can make use of their hind feet as
 a hand, the thumb being at the same distance from the
other toes, and suspend themselves by means of their long
tail, which is naked and covered with scales.               They are
 more particularly characterized also by being the only mam
malia which have ten incisor teeth in the upper jaw and
eight in the lower.
      Linnaeus mentions these animals under the name of the
didelpha. This denomination, by expressing that they are
provided with two matrices, has the advantage of bringing
 to remembrance one of the most remarkable facts of their
organization, the existence of a pouch under the belly of
the females, where the gestation begun in the real matrix is
in some measure completed.

                On a new Genus     of Mammalia.                29
  The      of the didelpha was
        eenus                        scarcely established when
new ammals wiih  pouches were       discovered in the Indian
Archipelago ; but at first they     were described only in a
vague manner.       It was however known that the females
had their dugs inclosed in a bag, and in consequence            of
this circumstance naturalists did not hesitate to comprehend
these new quadrupeds among the didelpha.            It was not till
a long time after, that it was known that the marsupials of
India differed from those of the new world by important
organs, such as those of mastication, digestion, motion,
and prehension ; but they were then so accustomed to de
note them by the same generic name, that they hesitated
to make any change ; and, as through respect for a usage
 introduced contrary to rules, they had retained in the s;enus
of the didelpha species which were anomalous; they
found tliemselves encouraged after the important discovery
of the lcanguroos to rank among the latter the didelpha,
though they were very remote from it.             In a word, as if
after   so much   confusion   it had  been  allowed  to venture on
any thing,     Gmelin   admitted    into  the  same  genus a qua'
drumarius fully known as such, which my illustrious master
 Daubenton published under the name of the Tarsier.
     In the year 4, I conceived the idea of enabling naturalists
 to estimate with some precision the distance there is be
 tween these different ammals, and, in a dissertation which
appeared in the 9th volume of the Magazin Encyclofiedique,
 I submitted to a sort of revision the last labour «f Gmelin
 in regard to the genus of the didelpha.
     My first care was to bring this genus to its primitive state.
 I left none in it but the animals with bags, of America, to
 which all the characters without exception assigned by
 Linna?us are applicable.          This groupe, deducting three
 animals, which are placed there under a double point of
 view, will be carried to nine species by my future publica
 tions.
     I then proposed to form, under the name of phalaiiger, a
 genus of the marsupials of the Archipelago of India, which
 have the upper jaw armed with incisor and canine teeth
 like the carnivorous animals, and in the lower jaw of which,
 however, there is found only that system of dentition which
 characterizes the rodentia.         Fourteen species, of which
 almost the half are yet unpublished, unite the charactciistic
 traits of these two great orders, with this difference, that
 «even of them are endowed with the faculty of leaping from
  tree to tree, and of flying by   means of membranes extended
  on their flanks while the oityer seven, unprovided with
                 ;

   SO              On a new Genus     of Mammalia.
  these membranes, have nothing to facilitate their existence
  on trees but their tail, with which they can lay hold of any
  thing, like the didelpha, and which is naked either entirely
  or in part.
     The kanguroos, so remarkable by the disproportion of
  their extremities, the want of canine teeth and the thumb
  of the hind feet, formed my third genus; and the fourth
  was composed of the daysures, on which I wrote a paper
  printed in the third volume of that work.
     I flattered myself with the idea that the order of the mar
  supials, which I proposed to establish, would be confined
  to these four genera.     They form a direct and very natural
  scries. By means of the daysures and the didelpha this
  series was connected with the carnivorous animals, and by
  the phalangers and the kanguroos it was blended in some
 measure with the numerous species of the rodentia.                There
 was no interruption, no gap, whether we consider in general
 the organs of mastication and digestion in particular, or
 attend only to the organs of motion and prehension.                 But
 this result, which was so striking that I thought it at the
 time worthy of remark, was susceptible of being changed
 by the discovery of a new family ; nature, properly speak
ing, being unacquainted cither with continued series or
 chains in one single direction. Two new genera indeed have
 destroyed the whole simplicity of this combination.                The
 first is that of the phascolomes, the characters of which I
have already traced out*, and the second is the new genus,
which I now announce under the name of the perameles
 (blahreau    i poche) .
                    I. Description of the   Genus.
    The perameles are animals which on the first view have
a pretty near resemblance to the didelplia, but their head is
longer and the muzzle much slenderer.             They are far also
from participating in the habits of these mammalia, and
from being able to live on the summits of the largest trees.
Their whole economy indicates that they live on the earth :
as in the badger, their nose is elongated, their hair stiff,
and their feet terminate in large claws almost straight ; there
is no doubt therefore that they dig for themselves holes, and
they do it perhaps with more dexterity than any other
animal, as they have no reason to apprehend either that
their claws will break or be detached, an advantage for
which they are indebted to the form of the last phalangium
        * Annates du Museum dHistoire Naiurel/e, vol. ii. p. 3 64.
                                                                      of

of   the toes, which, like that of the sloth, pangolin, and
myrmecophagi, is cleft at the free extremity.
    It needs excite no surprise that I should here employ the
last character among the number of those which may serve
for the determination of the genera, if we recollect the
result to which my colleague, Dumeril, was conducted by
his learned researches in regard to the different configura
tions of the unguical bone. It is indeed natural that this
small bone which terminates the fingers, and serves as a
mould to the corneous matter with which they are covered,
should contribute more than all the other parts of the hand
to those determinations of animals which are founded on
touching.
    The feet of the perameles, remarkable by the conforma
tion of the last phalangium, are distinguished also by the
combination and numerical arrangement of the fingers in
the fore feet : the three middle fingers only can rest on the
ground while the animal is walking ; those on the sides are
so short that they exist only in rudiments, and they are
                                   under the form of a spur.
    The hind feet have a great analogy to those of the kan-
guroo : the fourth finger is the longest and the largest ; the
second and third are united and enveloped under common
integuments.      They are distinguished, however, by their
 claws, which are free ; these two fingers are besides shorter
 and slenderer than the last or the fifth.     The character by
which the feet of the perameles differ however from those
of the kanguroos, is the presence of a thumb, which
 really exists though it is very short.      It is needless, no
 doubt, to add that this thumb has no nail, since it is one
 of the distinguishing attributes of all the marsupials.
    The organs of mastication appear also in the new family
 of the perameles, in an order which has never yet presented
 itself to observation.    The canine and molar teeth have
 indeed a resemblance, in regard to their number, form, and
 arrangement, to those of the daysures and the didelpha ;
 that is to say, the perameles have four long canine teeth and
 twenty-eight molar.     But the case is not the same in re
 gard to the incisors ; for if there be ten in the upper jaw,
 as in the didelpha, the order is different.    The last incisor
 on each side is very much separated both from those of
 the same kind before and from the canine tooth behind ;
 and this incisor has besides the form, and discharges the
 office, of a second canine tooth : it is implanted however in
 the intermaxillary or incisive bone : moreover in the lower
jaw there are only six teeth ; a curious anomaly, since this

 32              On a new Genus     of Mammalia.
is the first time that the combination of ten and six incisors
has been met with among the mammalia : the last incisor
below is a little broader than the rest, and is half divided
by   a small groove.
    All the marsupials are able, more or less, to assist them
 selves readily with their tail : on the other hand it does
not appear that the perameles can employ theirs for any
 thing ; it is too short, is covered with short hair, and is
destitute of the faculty of prehension.
    Their muzzle, which is much too long, gives them an
air exceedingly stupid ; but this dismal and disagreeable
physiognomy is compensated           by the lightness of their
motions, and the gracefulness of their gait, since they have
 the posterior extremities twice as long as those before.         I
have already remarked that the form of their hind feet has
 some analogy to that of the kanguroos.          This dispropor
 tion between   the paws gives  them   a greater similarity : it it
indeed so great that I have no doubt that they possess the
means as well as the latter of raising themselves on their
 hind legs, and of using them to take leaps almost as ex
 tensive.
    In the last place, it is probable that the organs of genera
 tion of the perameles, while they exhibit that analogy of
 form which characterizes all the marsupials, might nave
 afforded some generical differences, but I had no oppor
 tunity of examining them.
    These considerations, however, on which I have here
 enlarged, seem to me to require the establishment of a new
 family of the perameles, in the natural order between the
 didelpha and the kanguroos.
                    Description  of the Species.
    This genus hitherto has been composed of two species :
 that published by Dr. Shaw, under the name of didtlphis
 obesula, and another which is new, and to which I have
 given the name of nasuta.
    I. Perameles nasuta. (Plate I.) The length of the
 muzzle and nose of this peramele forms its principal cha
 racter ; measured from the extremity of the lips to the root
 of the tail, its length is 0*45 metre ; its head O'll metre,
 and its tail 0'lfl metre: its anterior extremities are 01 8
 metre, and its posterior 0, 1 6 metre.
    Its last incisor, the canine tooth, and the first molar,
 instead of being contiguous, are very much separated from
 each other, and hence the great length of the muzzle.
 The cutting molars are lobed and hare three points ; those

in the bottom-of the mouth j' with a broader base and a flat
crown, do not seem to have been used': they are furrowed
transversally, so that their crown is rough, with several
small points," which are ihe- summits of these molar teeth.
This observation might give reason to suspect that the
Perameles nasuta does not supply, like the daysures and the
didelpha, the want of flesh by a vegetable regimen, but
that this marsupial contents'itself with insects; and indeed
there is reason to suppose that it forms of thein its principal
nourishment, its muzzle being too long to fit it with any
advantage for combat : its fore feet, which render it so easy
for it to dig up the earth when searching for its food, ap
peared tQ me to be a proof 6f it. .
    The ears of the Perameles nasuta, however, are short and
oblong, and its eyes are verv small.      Its hair is moderately
thick, more abundant and stiffer on the shoulder, mixed a
little with some very thick, and abundance of silky hair, ash-
coloured at the root, and fawn-colour or black at the points ;
the general tinLabove is of a bright brown colour : the
whole lower part of the body is white, and the "claws are
yellowish ; the tail may be sufficiently strong to contribute
in the same manner as that of the kanguroos to progressive
motion ; it is besides of a more decided tint, brown "in
                                                                 "
 clining to maroon above, and below of a chesnut colour.'
    2. Perameles olesula.     (Plate II.)    Though I do not
 observe that this animal is in any" manner fatter than
 others of the same genus, 1 have retained the trivial name'
 given to it by Dr. Shaw.      In my opinion we cannot hi
too cautious in changing a denomination consecrated by
                                    >
 usage.
    I was acquainted long ago, by means of the Naturalist's
Miscellany, with the figure of the didelpkis obesula, but I in
 vain endeavoured to determine its relations. I set out on this
 research neither bv the way of analogy, since this species be
longed to none o/niy genera of the order of the marsupials,
 nor by the description of Dr. Shaw, since he qualifies the
teeth only by the epithet of numerous. I however presumed
that this might be the type of a new family; and, under this
persuasion, knowing that the obesula formed part or the
collection of Dr. Hunter,       I  wrote to England, to Mr.
 Parkinson, for the information I wished to obtain.        I re
ceived in return the drawing from which the annexed figure
was engraved.
     It was therefore only when I saw the first perameie of
 which I have spoken, that I was able to supply, by con

to the olcsula the teeth of the nasuta. I do not think that
I have been more deceived by analogy on this occasion than
before. The organ* of motion are too perfectly similar in
the two perameles for the organs of mastication not to be
the same.       The relation which always exists between them
 is well known.
    The obesula, in the proportions of its body, resembles the
preceding. The only difference             that its bead is, shorter,             is

might give reason to believe that this peramele            more car             is

 Botanv f,            like all the other physical sciences, may be
 considered under two points of view.                     In the first, we ex*
.amine in plants those things which are perceptible to the
 senses ; and, by comparing the differences observed, deduce
 the means of distinguishing them with certainty from each
 other.       In the second, we endeavour to discover the qua
 lities by which they may be useful to man : — the one is
 pure botany, the other is the application of botany.                      Most
 people      who     have    devoted      themselves      exclusively   to   one
 branch of knowledge, or who have not had an opportunity
 of acquiring any, being accustomed to judge superficiallv,
 value only the second, and consider the first as almost en
 tirely useless.         It ought, however, to be considered as the
 foundation of the second ; for, as it alone establishes, as we
 may say, the state of a vegetable, it is by it that we can
 be assured what plants are capable of giving us that assist
 ance for which we may have occasion. The moment, there
 fore, that the theoretic botanist seems to attend least to
  the wants of society, is very often that when he is about
  to announce an important discovery.                   Being enabled by an
  exact synonymy to consult all the books which have been
  written on the object he examines, he takes, ad vantage of
  the knowledge of all nations and of all periods. In the se
  cond place, if the vegetable he examines have escaped the
  researches of his predecessors,              observation enables him to
  find out      the    purpose   for  which    it  may be employed.         The

So"              On the Tinctorial Properties   of
of interrogating nature; it is the examination of affinities,
or the study of natural families ; for observation has taught,
 that, in general, plants which have an external resemblance
in their organization, retain it in the immediate principles
«f which they are composed. The natural classification,
therefore, may give reason for conjecturing the virtues of
A new plant ; out, unfortunately, the labour which could
give us any certainty in this respect has not been carried
 to a sufficient length : — to bring it to perfection would re
 quire the complete union of a thorough knowledge of bo
 tany and chemistry.         Hitherto, therefore, the senses of
 taste and smell have been almost the only guides for disco
vering in several families, exceedingly natural, one common
 principle.   In the umbelliferous plants, for example, it is
 traced from plants the most wholesome and the most com
 monly used tor food, such as the carrot, to those which are
 aromatic, as fennel, and even to poisonous plants, such as
 hemlock : one observes in all these plants a particular taste,
 more pr less striking, and which is found in its highest
 degree in those species accounted poisonous.        It even ap
 pears that the observation of it is sometimes more certain
 than the common classifications. It is thus that the lagucia
 could not by these means be separated from the umbelli
 ferous plants, when by its fruit u was referred to them only
 with doubtfulness : we must therefore hope that botanists
 will be able to discover a substance common to all these
 plants, an umbelliferous principle.      In a word, there exists
 one equally striking in the leguminous plants, from which
 it passes also, but more rarely, from those that are fit to be
 eaten to those which are poisonous, when it exists in its state
 of greatest concentration.
    But there are several other families which seem to he
 equally natural, and in which it is difficult to discover a
 common principle: of this kind are the rubiaceous plants of
 Jussieu.    The signal services derived from a small number
 of the plants which they comprehend are of a nature so
 different that it is difficult to deduce a genera] induction for
 the rest. Of this kind is madder, the root of which possesses
 a dyeing quality in so eminent a degree ; coffee, the berries
 of which are so useful ; and, in the last place, cinchona, ren
 dered so valuable by the febrifuge qualities of its bark.
 Though all the plants comprehended in this family have a
 greater affinity to each other than they have to any other
 of the vegetable kingdom, it appears itself to be composed
 of particular groupes or species of sub- families, and each of
  the plants I have mentioned tnav be considered as the type
                                                               of

»f One of them.           It may be readily seen that the other
plants which accompany each of them, either as belonging
to the same genus or as its neighbour, participate more or
(ess in the quality on account of which it is emploved.
Thus it has been found that almost all the stellatce of Ray
are tinctorial ; almost all the seeds of the neighbouring
genera of the coffee shrub, sufficiently large to be torrified
with advantage, appear to be of the same nature. The case
is the same with cinchona.              I have seen the bark of a
beautiful mtissenda of the Isle of France employed as a
febrifuge by a physician, one of my friends.
    These qualities also are seen to pass from one groupe to
another.        It is thus that the Indians extract the beautiful
red colour of the chaillivcr, which, according to Adanson,
was a hedrjotii, and which Roxburgh has described as an
oldenlandia. They extract also a red colour from the royoc
or morinda. The cinchonas themselves have given colours.
Some of their particular properties have been found also iu
shrubs which had a very distant relation to them. The
psychotria emctica approaches near to some of those which
 have been found to be emetic. The antirrhea of Commerson,
or wood of the lost eau, participates in the anti-dysenteric
 quality of the last-mentioned plant.          In a word, according
 to Gaertner and several others, a kind of coffee has been ex
 tracted from the seeds of the aparine.
    Other properties less extensive in one groupe have others
analogous to them in another. Thus the pretty species of
 the mussenda, which Commerson named, after his country
man, Lalandia stelliflora, has a relation to the asperula
 bdorata.      Its dried leaves, tike those of that plant, acquire
an agreeable odour, on which account they are put among
 linen : on the other hand, the fetid and cadaverous odour
 of the paederia is found in the serissa of Jussieu, or the
 dysoda of Loureiro, and in the fruit of some kinds of py-
 rostricit
    However vague these indications may be, they may serve
 as guides in experiments ; and though one cannot previously
 assert that a rubiaccous plant possesses any of its properties,
 one will not be surprised to find them in it.         When I was
 in Madagascar, in         1795,  I  saw without astonishment the
 natives of the country extract, from the root of a rubiaceous
 plant, the red dye they employed for the cloth which
 they wore of thread, made from the tafia palm.            I readily
 knew it to be a creeping shrub, common in the elevated
 places    of the Isle of France.

  some    experiments in regard to the utility it might be of k»
  giving an intense and fixt colour ; but having no apparatus,
  and being unprovided with books which might point out
  the process I ought to follow, I could only make a few
  trials, which convinced me of its utility, but they were not
  sufficient to indicate the method of using it. They exhibited
  one phenomenon which was very remarkable ; it is not,
   however, peculiar to this plant, for it is found in another
   vegetable, but which has so Hi tie relation to the one in
   question, and exhibits it in a part so different, that the con
   formity itself is still another singularity.         But before I de
           it,
   scribe  I      must speak of the plant.
      It   has been described          byCommerson, and         found    is          in
   his herbals.     This naturalist, whose premature death was.
   sensibly felt     by
                      all those who cultivate the sciences, besides
   his knowledge, had            particular instinct
                                  a                      the application
                                                               in
   of names. Observing that this plant was dicecous                 abor      by
   tion, so that the stamina seemed to be choked by the
   pistil, he compared          to the Danaides, which put to death
                                  it
   their husbands, and thence gave                the name of Danais
                                                     it                              ;
  he was not able to procure any of its fruit. The fruit being
  the important character of this family,                was impossible
                                                               it
  for him to determine its place with precision             and Jussieu
                                                                    ;
  and Lamarck united              to the posderia.

  Dictionary, calls the odoriferous danais, becar.se its flowers,
                          it
  according to the remark of De Court, are exceedingly odo
  riferous, and of beautiful orange colour.

  turalists having afterwards procured some of its fruit, found
 that they had Imo cells, each containing several seeds, anrf
  consequently that         differed from the pcederia, which had
                           it
 only     two.    Having an opportunity of seeing them in all
 their states,  I    observed the same thing           and finding also

confirmed       by the difference of appearance         but   ;ought to it

them here would be misplaced, they will form part of my
Flora.     I   shall at present confine myself to an account of
                                                                                   the

the few experiments which I made, to point out the route
 to some one more successful who may be able to determine
 the means of employing it.
      Having pulled up the roots of this plant, I was much
surprised to see them of an orange colour, inclining rather
to yellow than to red : the rind was purpy and succulent.
Having cleaned them, I put some pieces of it into spirit or
rack extracted from the sugar of the country, which in a.
little time became charged with a tincture of a very pure
yellow. When it appeared to me that it had extracted all it
 could, I poured it into a saucer; the pieces of the root were
 then of a beautiful red colour : having poured more rack
over them, some more particles of yellow were extracted,
 but it became still redder, and this colour continued un
 alterable, thour/h I suffered the iiquor to remain over theni
several days.        What I poured into the saucer having eva
 porated, the residuum wa3 of a very beautiful vellow colour.
For want.of other means, I contented myself with rubbing
it over paper.        Being desirous to try whether a pigment
           for  water  colours Could be extracted from            it,
                                                              mixed
proper                                                              I
 it with gum arabic:        it spread very well on the paper;                    I
 tasted also the extract,     it had the bitterness of cinchona in
 such a      degree as gave me reason to hope thai           may beit
 rendered of utility in this point of view.
      Having tried this root with spirit of wine,      put some of
                                                          I
it    fresh into pure water. By ebullition the water became
charged in like manner with the yellow colouring principle,
 which  it     extracted entirely: the root also assumed         red     a
 colour, which could no longer be attacked                by
                                                      water. One
of my friends had given me small quantity of solution
                                         a                        a
of tin in the nitric acid        ;   poured
                                     I         few drops of
                                                   a            into    it
 the liquor    I    had obtained, and they precipitated all the
colouring parts suspended in it.             Having decanted the
 water, the residuum was of            beautiful yellow colour:
                                         a
hoped I       should obtain from           kind of Dutch pink

therefore poured more water over               to wash
                                                   it             it,
                                                            but the
water, though cold, took up all the colour            nothing then
                                                          :
remained at the bottom of the vessel but oxide of tin ex
ceedingly      white.
   '
 I      learned at Madagascar that the process employed by
the natives, and probably from time immemorial, to obtain
a    red colour,   is  to boil the root with ashes     thence pre

  colour of a fawn's belly, exceedingly beautiful. These were
  all the experiments I was able to make*                    They are suffi
  cient to show the relation between this plant and the car-
  thamus : its flowers give in like manner a yellow colour ;
  and the beautiful red which they produce becomes purer in
  proportion as it is separated.            1 wish I could present results
 more satisfactory ; but, being buffeted by circumstances, I
 was seldom able to carry my plans into execution ; and in
 regard to many other objects I have nothing left but regret :
  but I easily console myself when I reflect, that I shall be
 exceedingly happy if I can publish what I have left of ten
 years' observations made in a field almost new.
     Since this memoir was written, having had an opportu
 nity of observing the asperula tinctoiia, 1 remarked that its
 roots exhibit the same colour as those of the danais. Hav
 ing put them into spirit of wine they gave also a yellow
 colour, but not so pure as that of the danais.                    I obtained
 the same thing from the rubia tinctorum ; and I have since
 learned that it had been observed that these plants give two
 colours, according as they are treated ; which still tends to
 confirm the analogy I have announced.

 One      of  the most instructive and important parts of geo-
 logy,   is the  study of the spontaneous alterations by which
 bodies formerly appertaining to the organized kingdoms of
 nature have, after the I033 of the vital principle, become
 gradually converted into fossil substances.
     In some cases this conversion has been so complete as to
 destroy all traces of previous organic arrangement ; but in
 others the original texture and form have been more or
less preserved, although the substances retaining this tex
ture, and exhibiting these forms, are often decidedly of a
mineral nature. Some, however, of these extraneous fossils,
 (as they are called) retain pait of their original
                                                                substance   or
 principles,    whilst      others   can   only   be   regarded   as casts  or
impressions.

    From the animal kingdom we may select, as examples,
the fossil ivory, which retains its cartilage * ; the bones in
the Gibraltar rock, consisting of little more than the earthy
part or phosphate of lime ; the shells forming the luma*
chella of Bleyberg, which still possess the lustre and irides
cence of their original nacre ; and the shells found at Hord-
well in Hampshire, and in Picardy, which are chiefly por
cellaneous, but more or less calcined ; also the fossil echini
aiid others so commonly found in the limestone, chalk,
and calcareous grit of this island, which, although they
retain their original figure, are entirely, or at least exter
nally, formed of calcareous spar, incrusting a nucleus of
flint or chalcedony. And                       if,
                                   in addition to these, we may
be allowed to regard the more recent limestone and chalk
strata as having been principally or partly formed from the
detritus of animal exuviae, we shall possess       complete series     a
of gradations, commencing with animal substances ana
logous in properties to those which are recent, and termi
nating in bodies decidedly mineral, in which all vestiges of
orgamzation have been completely destroyed.
    The vegetable kingdom has likewise produced many                                          in
 stances not less remarkable and           worthy of notice, that

   The principal object     have in view  I to adduce some            is
additional proofs that the bituminous substances are derived
from the organized kingdoms of nature, and especially
from vegetable bodies     for although many circumstances
                                      ;
seem to lead'to the opinion that the animal kingdom has in
some measure contributed to the partial formation of bitu
men, yet the proofs are                     by
                              no means so numerous, nor so

 42                      Observations   on the Change        of
  positive, as those which indicate the vegetable kingdom to
  have been the grand source from which the bitumens hav«
  beert derived.   But this opinion (founded upon very strong
 presumptive    evidence), although generally adopted, is how
  ever questioned by some persons; and I shall therefore
 bring forward a few additional facts, which will, I flatter
 myself, contribute to demonstrate, that bitumen has been,
 and is actually and immediately formed from the resin, and
 perhaps from some of the other juices of vegetables.
    The chemical characters of the pure or unmixed bitumens,
 such as naptha, petroleum, mineral tar, and asphaltum, are,
 in certain respects, so different from those of the resins and
 other inspissated juices of recent vegetables, that, had the
 former never occurred but in a separate and unmixed state,
 no positive inference could have been drawn from their
 properties in proof of their vegetable origin.    Fortunately,
 however, they have been more frequently found under cir
 cumstances which have strongly indicated the source from
 whence they have been derived ; and much information has
 been acquired from observations made on the varieties of
 turf, bituminous wood, and pit coal, on the nature of their
 surrounding strata, on the vestiges of animal and vegetable
 bodies which accompany them, and on various other local
facts, all of which tend considerably to elucidate the history
 of their formation, and to throw light upon this interesting
part of geology.
    Some instances have already been mentioned which show
 that fossil animal substances form a series, commencing
with such as are scarcely different from those which are
recent, and terminating in productions which have totally
lost all traces of organization.
    Similar instances are afforded by the vegetable kingdom ;
but, without entering into a minute detail of every grada
tion, I shall only cite three examples in this island, namely,
    1 . The submarine forest at Sutton,   on the coast of Lin
colnshire, the timber of which has not suffered any very
apparent change in its vegetable claracters *.
    2. The strata of bituminous wood (called Bovcy coal)
found at Bovey, in Devon ; which exhibits a series of gra
dations, from the most perfect ligneous texture, to a sub
stance nearly approaching the characters of         coal, and,    pit
on that account, distinguished              by
                                     the name of stone coal.

extremities and centre of the series ; but as, from some local
circumstances, the process of carbonization and formation
nf bitumen has not taken place in the first instance, and as
these effects have proceeded to the ultimate degree in the
last, it seems most proper that we should seek for informa
tion, and for positive evidence, in the second example,
which appears to be the mean point, exhibiting effects of
natural operations, by which bitumen and coal have been
imperfectly and partially formed, without the absolute ob
literation of the original vegetable characters; and although
I have selected the Bovey coal as an example, because it is
found in this countrv, we must recollect that similar sub
stances, or strata of bituminous wood, are found in many
parts of our globe; so that the example which has been
more immediately chosen is neither rare nor partial *.
   The nature, however, of the various kinds of bituminous
wood may in some respects be different ; but this I have
not as yet had the means of ascertaining : I shall therefore
only state the facts resulting from experiments made on
Bovey coal, and more especially on a peculiar bituminous
substance with which it is accompanied.          But, before I
enter into these particulars, it will be proper to mention a
very remarkable schistus with which I was, some months
since, favoured by the right honourable Sir Joseph Banks.
                                  §   nr.
   This schistus was found by Sir Joseph in the course of
his tour through Iceland, near Beykum, one of the great
spouting hot springs, distant about twenty-four English,
miles from Hafnifiord ; but circumstances did not permit
him to ascertain the extent of the stratum.
   The singularity of this substauce         thatis,great part of
                                                       a
it consists of leaves, which are evidently those of the alder,
interposed between
mere impressions of leaves, such as are frequently found in
many of the slates, but the real substance, in an apparently
half-charred state, retaining distinctly the form of the leaves
and the arrangement of the fibres.
   The schistus      light, brittle, of easy exfoliation
                      is                                   in the

       .                                                           when

  44               Observations  on the Change   of
  when longitudinally     divided, the whole surface constantly
  presents a series of the leaves which have been mentioned,
  uniformly spread, and commonly of a light gray on the
  upper surface, and of a dark brown on the other ; the fibres
  on the light gray surface being generally of a blackish-
  brown, which is also the colour assumed by the schistus
  when reduced to powder.
     The leaves appeared to be in the state of charcoal, by being
  extremely brittle, by the blackish brown colour, by defla
 grating with nitre, by the manner of burning, and by form
 ing carbonic acid. I was, however, soon convinced that
 the substance of these leaves was not complete charcoal,
 but might more properly be regarded as vegetable matter in
 an incipient state of carbonization, which, although pos
 sessed of many of the apparent properties of charcoal, still
 retained a small portion of some of the other principles of
 the original vegetable.
     My suspicion was excited, partly by the odour produced
 during combustion, which rather more resembled that of
 wood than that of charcoal, and partly by the brown solu
  tion formed by digesting the powder of the unburned
 schistus in boiling distilled water ; for by various tests 1
 ascertained that the substance thus dissolved was not of a
 mineral nature. In order, however, fully to satisfy myself
 in this respect, I digested 250 grains of the pulverized
 schistus with six ounces of water.
     The liquor was, as before, of a dark brown colour.
     It had hut little flavour.
     Prussiate of potash, muriate of barytes, and solution of
isinglass, did not produce any effect; tutrate of silver formed
a very faint cloud ; sulphate of iron was slowly precipitated,
of a dark brownish colour ; and muriate of tin produced a
white precipitate.
     A portion of the solution, by long exposure to the air,
was partially decomposed ; and a quantity of a brown sub
stance^ was deposited, which could not again be dissolved
in^water.
     Another portion     vwas also evaporated to dryness, and
afforded a similar     brown substance, which was only par
tially soluble in water; and the residuum, in both of the
above cases, was found to be insoluble in alcohol and in
ciher.
    When burned it emitted smoke with the odour of vege
table matter.
     $iO grains of the schistus afforded about three grains of
the above substance ; and, when the properties of the
                                                         aqueous

       some of the Principles of     Vegetables into Bitumen, 49
aqueous    solution are considered, such as its partial decom
position, and the deposit which it yielded by exposure to
air, and by evaporation ; the insolubility of this deposit
when again digested with water, alcohol, or ether; the
smoke and odour which it yielded when burned ; and the
precipitates formed by the addition of sulphate of iron and
muriate of tin to its solution ; when these properties, I say,
are considered, there seems much reason to conclude, that
the substance dissolved by water was vegetable extract,
which had apparently suffered some degree of modification,
but not sufficient to annul the more prominent characteristic
properties of that substance.
    The powder of the schistus which had been employed in
the preceding experiment, was afterwards digested in al
cohol during two days ; and a pale yellow tincture was thus
formed, which, by evaporation, left about one grain of a yel
low transparent substance, possessing the properties of resin.
    It appears, therefore, that a substance very analogous to
vegetable extract, and a small portion of resin, remain in
herent in the leaves of this remarkable schistus.
    As solution of isinglass did not produce any effect, there
was reason to conclude that the aqueous solution above
mentioned did not contain any tannin ; but, as the tannin
 might be combmed with the alumina of the schistus, I di
 gested a portion of it in muriatic acid, which, after filtra
tion, was evaporated almost to dryness, leaving, however,
 the apid in a slight excess.       This was diluted with water,
 and afforded   a blue   precipitate with prussiate of potash, a
 yellowish precipitate with ammonia, and a white precipitate
 with muriate of tin, but not any with solution of isinglass.
 The tannin which might have been contained in the recent
 vegetable appears therefore to have been dissipated or de
 composed, with the greater part of the other vegetable
 principles, excepting the woody fibre reduced to the state of
 an imperfect coal, and the small portions of extract and
 resin which have been mentioned.
     Previous to having made the analysis, I had an idea that
 this schistus might be a lamellated incrustation, formed by
 the tufa of the not springs ; but, according to Mr. Klap-
  roth's analysis*, the tufa of Geyser is composed of,

     It  is therefore very different from the schistus, the compo
     nent ingredients of which were ascertained by the following
     analysis.
                 Analysis of the Schistus from Iceland*.,
         a. 250 grains, by distillation, yielded water, which, in
     the latter part of the process, became slightly acid and
    turbid, = 42*50 grains.
         B. The heat was gradually increased, until the bulb of
    the retort was completely red hot. During the increase of
    the heat, a thick brown oily bitumen came over, which
    weighed 7'50 grains; it was attended with a copious pro
    duction of hydrogen, carbonated hydrogen, and carbonic
    acid, the whole of which may be estimated at 23,75
    grains.
         C. The residuum was black, like charcoal, and weighed
    J76'35 grains; but, being exposed to a strong red heat in
    a crucible of platina, it burned with a faint lambent flame,
    and was at length reduced to a pale brown earthy powder,
    which weighed 122 grains; so that 54,25 grains were con
    sumed.
        D. The 122 grains were mixed with 240 of pure potash ;
   and,' as some particles of charcoal remained, 50 grains of
   nitre were added, and the whole was strongly heated, during
   half an hour, in a silver crucible.           The mass was then dis
   solved in distilled water; and muriatic acid being added to
   excess, the liquor was evaporated to dryness, and was again
   digested with muriatic acid much diluted; a quantity of
   pure silica then remained, which, after having been exposed
   to a red heat, weighed 98 grains.
        E. The liquor from which the silica had been separated
   was evaporated nearly to dryness, and added to boiling lixi
  vium of potash ; after the boiling had been continued for
  about one hour, the liquor was filtrated, and a quantity of
  oxide of iron was collected, which amounted to 6 grains.
       F. Solution of muriate of ammonia was added to the
  preceding filtrated liquor; and the whole being then heated,
  a copious precipitate of alumina was obtained, which, after
  having been made red hot, weighed 15 grains.
       Carbonate of soda caused the preceding liquor (after the
  separation of alumina) to become slightly turbid, but not
  any precipitate could be collected*

It evidently, therefore, belongs to the family of argillaceous
schistus, although the proportion of silica is more consi
derable than has been found in those hitherto subjected to
chemical analvsis.
   This schistus has not been noticed by Von Troil, nor by
any of those who have written concermng Iceland ; for the
slate which was sent to professor Bergmann by the former,
and which is mentioned by the latter in one of his letters,
is there expressly stated to be the common aluminous slate
containing impressions 4.

  From the experiments which have been related, we find
that the leaveg'obntained in the Iceland schistus, although
they are apparently reduced almost to the state of charcoal,
nevertheless  retain some part of their original proximate
principles ; namely, extract and resin. This, of itself, is

     Mr Faujas St. Fond has, however, described a schsitus nearly simi
 lar, ^rhich is found near Roche-Seauve, in the Vivarais. The stratum
 extends about two leagues ; and the only difference is, that, according
 to Mr. St. Fond, the schistus at Roche-Seauve is of the nature of marie,

49                    Observations     on tfie Change    of
undoubtedly a remarkable fact ; but if it were unsupported
by any other, the only inference would be, that the schistus
was most probably of very recent formation, and had been
produced under peculiar circumstances.
     I was desirous, therefore, to discover some similar cases
which might serve as additional corroborative proofs of the
gradual alterations by which vegetable                   bodies become
changed,       so   as at  length   to  be regarded   as  forming part of
the mineral kingdom ; and from the reasons which have
been stated in the commencement of this paper, as well as
from a certain similarity in the external characters of the
Substance composing the leaves above mentioned with those
of the Bovey coal, I was induced to make this last also a
subject of chemical inquiry.
     In the Philosophical, Transactions for the year 1760*,
some remarks on the Bovey coal, and an account of the
strata, are stated, in a letter from the Rev. Dr. Milles to
the Earl of Macclesfield.            The object, indeed, of the author
was to establish that this and similar substances are not of
vegetable but of mineral origin ; and, to prove this, he
adduces a great number of cases, most of which, however,
in the present state of natural history and of chemistry, must
be regarded as proving the contrary ; whilst others, men-*
tioned by him, such as the Kimmeiidge or Kimendge coal,
are nothing more than bituminous slates, and of course are
of a very different nature.
    Dr. Milles's account of the varieties of the Bovey coal,
and of the state of the pits at that time, appears to be very
accurate ; and for the present state, or at least such as it
was in 1 796, I shall beg leave to refer to a paper of mine,
published in the fourth volume of the Transactions of the
Linnean Society          f  ; for, as this is more immediately a che-
^nical investigation, I wish to avoid, as much as possible,
uttering into any minute detail of geological circumstances.
     Jt piay however be proper to observe, that the Bovey coal
 is found in strata, corresponding in almost evrry particular
with those of the surturbrand in Iceland described by von
Troil \ and by Professor Bergmann §.                        The different
strata of both these substances              are likewise similar, being;
 composed of wood or trunks of trees, which have com
 pletely lost their cylindrical form, and are perfectly flattened,

    The Bovey       coal is commonly of a chocolate-brown, and
sometimes       almost black.         The quality and texture of it are
various in different strata : from some of these it is obtained
in the form of straight flat pieces, three or four feet in
length, resembling boards, and is therefore called Board
coal.      Others have an oblique, wavy, and undulating tex
ture, and, as Dr. Milles observes, have a strong resemblance
to the roots of trees, from which, most probably, this sort
has in a great measure been formed.
     Some Kinds also appear to be more or less intermixed
with earth ; but that which produces the most powerful and
lasting fire is called stone coal : it is black, with a glossy
fracture ; has little or none of the vegetable texture ; is more
solid and compact than the others, being almost as heavy
as some of the pit coals, the nature of which it seems very
nearly to approach.
     For chemical examination I selected some of the coal
    *
       Bergmann, in the dissertation above quoted, accurately describes this
 appearance of the surturbrand, and then says, " Qua; autcm immanis
 requiritur vis, ut truncut cylindiicus ita complanetur ? Nonnc antra
fmticutrnum nexus putredhtis qmdam gradu fuerit relaxants ? Certe, nisi
compares quodammodo mutatur. quodlibet pondus incumbers huic effec-
 rui eiit impar. Ceterum idem observatur phenomenon in omni scbisio
argillaieo.'.   This is certainly a very curious fact; and tlic learned Pro-
 fessor, with his usual acutencss, rejects the idea that mere weight can
 have been the cause.      As a further proof also, he afterwards observes,
 " Orthoceratitae, qua; in strata catcareo i onicam figurant
                                                                f/rfecti servant,
 in schisto planum fere triangulare comprrssione      efficiunt. Idem valet de
 piscihus, conchis, insectisque petrcfacris."       And again, " Observatu

 rareum sub scbtsto i o!h aium sit,et wojpriideo pondere comprtmente onus'. um."
 Df P'0>!u:tis Vohaniis, p. 140. It is evident, therefore, that weight
 alone has not proditced this effect ; and Bergmann.s idea, that the soli
 dity of the vegerable bodies may have undergone some previous change,
 in the manner of incipient putrefaction, by moisture, and by becoming
 heated in the mass, must be allowed to be very probable.              But bodies
 such as shellt could not be thus affected ; and therefore they must have
 been exposed to some mechanical effect peculiar to argillaceous           strata \
 which effect, however, from the circumstances which have been adduced,
 evidently could not have resulted from the mere pressure of the super
 incumbent strata. To me, therefore, it seems not very improbible that,
 together with a certain change in the solidity of vegetable bodies, pro
 duced in the manner imagined by Bergmann, and, together with some,
 degree of superincumbent pressure, a real and powerful mechanical action
 has been exerted, by the contraction of the argillaceous strata, in conse
 quence of desiccation; this, I believe, has not hitherto been much con-
 cidercd ; but I am inclined, from many circumstances, to attribute to it ft
 very great degree of power.

     The charcoal,             in

                                                      perfectly resembled
which is made from recent vegetables.        By incineration,
about 4 grains of yellowish ashes were left, which consisted
of alumina, iron, and silica, derived most probably from
some small portion of the clay strata which accompany the
Bovey coal. But it is very remarkable, that neither the
ashes obtained from the charcoal of the Bovey coal, nor
those obtained from the leaves of the Iceland schistus,
afforded the smallest trace of alkali*.
   B. 200 grains of the Bovey coal, reduced to powder,
were digested in boiling distilled water, whieh was after
wards filtrated and examined ; but I could not discover any
signs of extract, or of anv other substance.
   C. 200 grains were next digested with six ounces of
alcohol, in a very low degree of heat, during five davs.    A
yellowish-brown tincture was' thus formed, which, by eva
poration, afforded a deep brown substance, possessing all
the properties of resin, being insoluble in water, but soluble
in alcohol and in ether ; k also specdilv incited when placed
on a red hot iron, burned with much name, and emitted a
fragrant odour, totally unlike the very unpleasant smell
produced by burning the coal itself, or by burning any of
the common bituminous substances. The quantity, how
ever, which could be extracted from 2()0 grains of the coal,
     *    This,   as far    as relates to the    Bovey coal, has been also noticed by
Dr. Milles.         Phil. Trans, vol.      li.

                             I
experiments on the wood of the submerged forest at Sutton, 011 ihe coait
of Lincolnshire, and have found    to contain potash.

     some   of the Principles of     Vegetables into Bitumen.   51
by alcohol, was but small,     as it did not exceed 3 grains:
But this small quantity   was sufficient to prove, that although
the Bovey coal does not contain any vegetable extract, like
the schistus formerly mentioned, yet the whole of the
proximate principles of the original vegetable have not been
entirely changed ; as a small portion of true resin, not con
verted into bitumen, still remains inherent in the coal, al
though the bituminous part is by much the most prevalent,
and causes the fetid odour which attends the combustion of
this substance.
   Upon a comparison of the general external characters of
the Bovey coal with those of the substance which forms
the leaves contained in the Iceland schistus, a very great
resemblance will be observed ; and this is further confirmed
by the similarity of the products obtained from each of them
in the preceding experiments, with the single exception that
the leaves contain some vegetable extract, which I could
not discover in the Bovey coal. They agree however in
every other respect ; as they both consist of woody fibre ia
a state of semicarbonization, impregnated      with bitumen,
and a small portion of resin, perfectly similar to that which
is contained in many recent vegetable bodies ; and thus it
seems, that as the woody fibre, in these cases, still retains
9ome part of its vegetable characters, and is but partially and
imperfectly converted into coal, so, in like manner, some
of the other vegetable principles have only suffered a partial
change. Undoubtedly there is every reason to believe that,
next to the woody fibre, resin is the substance which, in
vegetables passing to the fossil state, most powerfully resists
any alteration ; and that, when this is at length effected, it
is more immediately the substance from which bitumen is
produced. The instances which have been mentioned cor
roborate this opinion ; for the vegetable extract in one of
them, and more especially the resin which was discovered
in both, must be regarded as part of those principles of the
original vegetables which have remained, after some other
portions of the same have been modified into bitumen.
   The smallness of the quantity of resin obtained in both
the preceding cases by no means invalidates the proof of
the above opinion ; but, as an additional confirmation of       it,
I shall now give an account of       very singular substance,
                                       a
which  is found with the Bovey coal.

I take      leave to lay before this honourable Board an ac
count of a substance as a manure which I find, on exa
mination, is one of the things hitherto universally believed
to be a poison to vegetables.    Having ascertained that this
substance is what is commonly known by the name of vi
triol of iron (the sulphate of iron of the chemists), invete
rate opinion prevented me for some time from accepting
the testimony of it as a manure ; but feeling the weight of
the respectable evidence by whom it was attested, after
consideration I perceived that the fact in question was not
at variance with established principles of vegetable philo
sophy, as I shall, I think, make appear in this communi
cation.
    My friend John Williams Willaume, esq. of Tingrith,
in Bedfordshire, having desired his brother, Charles Dv-
mokc Willaume, esq. to ask mv opinion of a saline sub
stance collected fr»m peat, which has been used with pro
fitable consequences as a manure in his neighbourhood, I
proposed a set of queries to Mr. John W. Willaume, the
answers to which, in. the two following copied letters, com
prehend the evidence I have to offer.

        MY DEAR SIR,
    I received the inclosed last Saturday, and hope the an
swers to your queries will be satisfactory, and tend to elu
cidate this curious subject.  Though the answers under the
article dust only relate to your queries, vet my brother has
thought proper to advert to the aslws, which yon conceive
to be a caput mortuum ; but which have been used as, and
have been supposed to be, a beneficial manure from time
immemorial. I have reserved a piece of the peat from which
the ashes are produced, and if you would wish to analyse                  it,
I  will send   you.

                Queries proposed by Dr. Pear son.
     1. How   long has the salt of peat been used ?
    2.  How   much per acre is laid on ?
    3. On what kind of lands ?
    4. The effects of it on vegetation ?
    5. Whether it is mixed with dung manure, or lime ?
    6. In what parts of the country has it been employed ?
     7. Any other facts which can be collected relative to the
 use of this substance ? v
     In answering the above queries, I shall divide the subject
 into three articles : 1st, The peat considered as an object of
 fuel , 2d, The ashes : 3d, The salt of peat, or dust : the
 two last (is objects of manure.
                               I.  Peat.
    The peat, which is found after the removal of the turf
or exterior surface to about a spade's depth, has long been
 known as an article of fuel.         It is, however, used only by
 cottagers,  who   burn   it  on   a brick  hearth : it has been re
jected from die parlour, the kitchen, the brewhouse, &c.
 as being injurious to grates, and to all sorts of vessels put
 on it ; it cannot be employed in the roasting of meat, as it
will impart a disagreeable taste ; and it is destructive of all
 sorts of furniture oy the effluvia which it emits, or by the
dust or athes which may chance to be blown from it.               If
 these disagreeable consequences could be obviated, it might
 he made an article of general consumption as a substitute
 for coal, much to tfee advantage of the seller and consumer:
 it is dug out in the form of a "brick to a certain depth, well
 known to the common labourer. This depth must be care
 fully attended to, lest you should cut out the staple, in
 which case it would never be retrieved ; but, this circum
 stance attended to, it will grow again to its former state in
 the space of fifteen years. Thus the whole moor is divided
 into proper portions, and periodically cut once in fifteen
 years.
                              2. Ashes.
    The turf or surface, and such parts of the peat as do not
 appear to be of the best quality, are laid up in considera
 ble heaps and reduced to ashes by the action of fire.          The
 ashes are red.

                                 Answer to Queries.
   1. The ashes have been long known as a manure, and
the demand is on the increase.
   2. The quantity usually laid on an acre, by spreading or
sowing   Ft is fifty bushels, either on grass or arable land.
   3.    is it,
           laid on hot land.                      By

most commonly used for grasses but               in considerable
                                                           ;         is

waggons, particularly Mr. Brumiger, near Sundon, in Bed
fordshire,    considerable and intelligent farmer, who in
                    a
creases his consumption every year, both for his grass and
arable land.
                3. The Salt    Peat, or Dust.of
       Answer to Queries. — 1. The dust or gray saline substance
    is produced         by

    should not be exceeded, for            be laid on in too great

of corn; the ground, whether grass or arable,     being of a
cold nature.

   6. The dust is likewise bought by the higglers, and carried
to great distances.   The nearer farmers likewise send for
the dust in waggens, particularly Mr. Anstie, of Dunstable
Houghton, and Mr. Smith, of Sundon, who hold this ma
nure in great esteem.

siate of iron      and this test was added gradually, till no

further precipitation took place.
   4. Into the decanted and filtrated fluid (3) was poured
liquid caustic volatile alkali, but without inducing any
change.
   5. "Into the same fluid (3) was poured liquid carbonate
of vegetable alkali, which produced scarcely perceivable
                                                       a
cloudy appearance.

sued with caustic volatile alkali.
   11. The solution (2) with oxalic acid, gave instantly a
very turbid blueish green precipitation.
   The preceding experiments manifested that the peat salt
consists of sulphate of iron, vulgarly called green vitriol of
iron, mixed with a very minute proportion .of siliceous
earth, and of lime united either to sulphuric acid or to car
bonic acid.    But the presence of the earths magnesia and
argil ; the uncombiued alkalis ; the uncombined acids ;
are by these experiments excluded.     In short, the salt of
peat is almost pure sulphate of iron.
                                       EEMAUKS.

                                                                    "j.

               or Sulphate of Iron, as a Manure.                     57
of one-sixteenth of a grain, it is as harmless as a glass of
wine ; and further, in that dose is a remedy for inveterate
agues.
    From these considerations I conclude, that there is no
admissible contradictory evidence to the testimonies for the
fertilizing effect of sulphate of iron, unless by such con
travening evidence the quantity stated to be used exceed
fifty bushels per acre ; it being an established fact, that in
certain proportions this metallic salt is a poison to plants.
    This discovery of Mr. Willautne will, I think, give new
light, so as to explain fully the rationale of the improve
ment of land by the burnt earth and ashes from paring and
burning.      It is usual to account for the effects of this pro
cess, by referring to supposed alkaline or other salts ; but
of these there is no evidence ; nay, on trial I have not de
tected them, or at least not in any efficient quantity ; but
this I know, that such earth and ashes contain oxide of
iron, and as I suspect of manganese ; which from the ana
lysis, and the effect of salt of peat, mustnow be admitted
into the class of manures. This very communication of
 Mr. Willaume affords evidence of the truth of this conjec
ture; for the ashes of the peat which affords the salt " have
 been long known as a manure, and the demand is on the in
 crease :" of course, these ashes contain an unusual quantity
 of oxide of iron. A consequence of this reasoning             is,
                                                                 that
 the burnt earth of soils will, cceteris paribus, fertilize in pro
 portion to the oxide of iron   it  contains.     Accordingly, the
 ashes of the peat, says Mr. Willaume, have           a   surprising
 effect
      ;    they
                " will double or treble crop of any new sown
                                         a

                               :
 spite of the expence, they are carried in bags      by  higglers to
 great distances.   It   would be extending this paper beyond
 the proposed limits, to reason at greater length, and to make
 ajurther induction of facts therefore
                               ;             I  will close with as
 serting, that the more contemplate the facts in Mr. Wil-
                          I
 laume's letter, the more evidence    I    perceive for the truth,
 that metallic salts and metallic oxides in general, and salts
 and oxides of iron in particular, are manures,      if   applied in
 proper doses.
  I   do not think   it   is within the design of this paper to
 make    observations  on  the answers to the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th,
 and   6th  queries, except  once  for all, desiring that it may be
 understood that I    consider the salt of peat, and the ashes of
 peat, as operating in promoting vegetation analogous to
 seasoning, or condiments, taken with the food of animals             ;
 that    is,
           analagous to mustard, cinnamon, ginger, &c. which
                                                                     are

   are not   of themselves at all or necessarily nutritious, but
   contribute to render other things nutritious by exciting the
   action of the stomach and other organs of digestion and as
   similation.    I have no doubt of the truth of the proposi
   tion, that no living thing, neither plant nor animal, can
   grow and live in a state of visible action without constant
  supplies of matter which has been alive ; in other words,
  living animals and vegetables can only live on dead animals
  and dead vegetables.       No plant nor animal has ever been
  known by experience, nor in the nature of things does it
  seem reasonable,     that they can be nourished by mere water
  and pure air, as some persons have asserted.
      I shall make a very few remarks on the other two sub
  stances which are the subject of Mr. Willaume's letter.
                              2. The Peat.
      The peat is a dense mass of vegetable matter for a certain
 depth, partly in a dead and partly in a living statu, with
  which is mixed more or less earth, and in burning it affords
  so much empyreumatic oil as to give a disagreeable taste to
  roasted provisions ; hence, as we are told, it has been re
 jected from the kitchen.         This fuel affords a vast quantitv
 of what the chemists call lignic acid; hence it is rejected
 also from the parlour, as very destructive to the grates.         I
 beg to suggest that this lignic acid might be saved in burn
 ing the peat as fuel, and be used for various purposes in
 manufactures; and the charred peat may be used in place
 of charcoal of wood. Probably, too, other useful products
 will be found, on examining the matters more accurately
 which are afforded by distillation.
                               3. Ashes.
     If the peat w ere mere vegetable matter, the ashes afforded
by    it would  be as trifling as those of wood ; but some parts
of the moor contain so much earth and oxide of iron as
to leave behind, on burning, a considerable quantity of in
combustible matter ; and such kind of peat, we are told, is
not used as fuel ; but, after burning, the residuary matter
is an efficacious manure, much more so than is commonly
afforded by paring and burning.         The ashes are more red
and more fertilizing tban ashes of common turf, because
they contain more iron.
     The spontaneous springing up of white clover, in land
manured with these ashes, is similar to the spontaneous
growth of this plant on heath land which has been covered
with lime to destroy all its present vegetation ; and this fact
                                                            shows

              or Sulphate   of Iron,  as a Manure.                 59
shows that probably these are seeds buried in the earth for
many ages, which yet remain alive, but do not grow until
txposedto the stimuli of air, water, calorific, and lifeless
animal or vegetable matter.
                               APPENDIX.
    The following facts, lately discovered by most respectable
chemists, appear to be worth adding to the preceding me
moir, as they serve to show that other salts, besides sulphate
of iron, and certain earths, maybe employed advantageously
as manures, although, like iron, they have been esteemed
deleterious to plants.
      1. Ashes of Pit Coal are a good Manure for Grass.
    My much valued friend, the Rev. Wm. Gregor, of
 Grampound, on examination of the ashes of coal from Li
 verpool, found them to contain both sulphate of magnesia
 ana sulphate of lime, especially the former, salt.          I appre
 hend that these ashes also contain oxide of iron, or perhaps
 sulphate of iron.    These *ashes, says Mr. Gregor, steaded*
 over grass apparently produced good effects notwithstand
 ing the sulphate of magnesia, which I was well assured they
 contained.     (See Nicholson's Journal, vol. v. p. 225.)
     From this observation of Mr. Gregor, it seems he is
 aware of the prevailing popular opinion, that sulphate of
 magnesia is not favourable to vegetation ; and to reconcile
 his fact with the unfriendly nature of magnesia to plants, as
 discovered by Mr. Tennant, he observes that the effects of
 sulphate of magnesia may be very different from those of
 magnesia and carbonate ot magnesia. I apprehend it is the
 magnesia (calcined magnesia) only which this learned che
 mist found hurtful to vegetables, as the discovery was made
  on the examination of Nottingly lime, which the farmers
  near Doncaster employ as a manure, while they reject the
  lime of their own neighbourhood.            In the latter Mr. Ten
  nant met with magnesia, and in the former none.                 (See
  the account of this important discovery in the Philosophical
  Transactions.)

     one of the Representatives in Congress.        Addressed to Dr.
      Pearson.
     Dr. Mitchill,   in a letter addressed to me on cinis, or

or notice.
   " A?hes of wood contain very commonlv sulphate of

remains a peculiar e3i*th and a small proportion of iron.

any other known species of earth.           I would call it cinis, for

the farmer to pay for     the  article  twelve   months     beforehand.

last twenty years.      Although     some   of the other ingredients
of the ashes left after lixiviation .may prove beneficial, yet
the effects are chiefly frond the cinis, or new named earth.

                                      a             This piece
of intelligence gave me much satisfaction.      have, for some   I
years, been engaged in an extensive series of experiments
                                                       relative

               or Sulphate of Iron, as a Manure.                      61
relative to the effects    of various stimulating articles, such
as   camphor, &c. upon vegetables ; and on the absorption
of certain powerful mineral substances into the organic sys
tem of vegetables. In numerous instances I have subjected
the stems and leaves of plants, young and old, large and
small, to the influence of the sulphates of iron and copper.
I have found that both of these metallic salts are verv
greedily absorbed by vegetables, insomuch that I have de
tected the presence of iron in the vessels of a branch of mul
berry, at the height of five or six feet above the plai:e of im
mersion, in a solution of the sulphate of this metal. A full
account of my experiments I design to communicate to the
public in two memoirs. Permit me to observe in the mean
 while, that the sulphate of iron applied to vegetables in the
manner I have mentioned " is only (to use your own words)
 a poison, like almost every thing else, from the over-dose."
 In several of my experiments the branches of vegetables that
were placed in vessels containing solutions of the sulphate
of iron and copper, lived longer and exhibited more signs
of vigour than similar branches that were placed in equal
 quantities of simple water.        It is true, that in many other
 experiments     these  metallic  salts  proved fatal to my plants;
 but this was when I employed too large a dose.                  In like
 manner I had found, several years ago*, that camphor,
 by greatly stimulating, often kills vegetables ; and yet, when
 properly dosed, this is a very wholesome stimulant to plants.
 I had also found that large doses of nitre (which is unques
 tionably a powerful stimulant, both with respect to animals
 and vegetables) produce an appearance like genuine gan
 grene in the leaves of vegetables ; and yet it is certain that
 nitre, when it is judiciously dosed, may be made to greatly
 assist the healthy vegetation of plants.
     Excuse the liberty I have taken in troubling you with
 these few loose hints, and permit me to subscribe myself,

     Something else besides vegetable matter is necessary to
  form peat or black moss of the moors.            The smell of burn

  is so abundant as to effloresce.    In particular, on a moor
  near St. Petersburgh, the clods show the vitriol (sulphate
 of iron) every morning when the dew has evaporated. Ao
 cording to this learned professor's observation, the sulphate
 of iron in pit coal may be accounted for in the following
 manner : — " Peat mosses form very regular strata, lying,
 indeed, on the surface ; but if any operation of nature' should
  cover this with a deep load of other matter, it would be
 compressed and rendered very solid ; and, remaining for ages
 in that situation, might ripen into a substance very like pit
 coal.     (See the Medical and Cbirurgical Review for No

 which you requested me to inform you what experiment              I
 had made from the turf dust taken from Tingrith Moor.
 I have made use of the ashes and dust near thirty years, and
 1 frequently lay on from eighty to a hundred bushels per
acre. Our land is dry, and very thin stapled, owing to
the chalk rock laying so very near the snrface : it encourages
vegetation in moist warm weather ; but when hot and dry,
the reverse.     We never mix any other manure with it. It
costs about fourpence per bushel, including all expenses.
     We chiefly spread it on our seed grass, clover, &c.
                          I am, sir, your humble servant,
                                                  Jos. Anstev.

This      gentleman, so much distinguished by his abilities,
is a native of Neweastle-upcn-Tvne,        where he was born
about the year 1737-      At an early age he was placed at a
school in that town, where he soon made a rapid progress ;
and about the eighteenth year of bis age, having lost his
parents, who, though in the humbler ranks of Tile, were
always respectable, he endeavoured to provide for him
self by . commencing country school-master.             His first
eitabliihmeut in this line was at the village of Jesmond,

               Claries Button,     L. L. D.    F. R. S.          63
about two miles from Neweastle, where he remained some
years ; during which he improved himself by close study,
reading all the mathematical and other books he was able
to purchase.
    About the yeaT 1760, Mr. Hutton removed to Neweastle,
where he had a better opportunitv of displaying his talents
to advantage, and where he gave extraordinary proofs of
the progress he had made, by the solution of several curious
and difficult questions in various periodical publications ;
and particularly in the Ladies' Diary, in his own name, and
in Martin's Magazine of Sciences, under the signature of
Tonthu, being the letters of his name transposed.               The
first of Mr. Hutton's separate publications was a little work
on arithmetic, for the use of schools, first printed at New
castle in 1764.        It has already gone through ten large
editions ;  and   in printing the first, to supply the want of
proper   mathematical     types, which at that time could not
be procured in Neweastle, Mr. Hutton was obliged to cut
witn a pen-knife, on the reversed end of old types, many
of the algebraical characters used in the vulgar fractions
and other parts of the work.
    Mr. Hutton employed his evenings in composing a large
 work on mensuration, which came out in quarto numbers,
 the last of them in the year 1 770.        It was printed at New
 castle. This work met with a very favourable reception,
 and a second edition, with improvements, was published at
 London in 1788, large octavo. Mr. Hutton soon gave
 another proof of his genius and industry, by a republication
 of all the useful parts of the Ladies' Diaries, from the com
 mencement in 1 704 to that of 1 773.          This work was given
 to die public, in parts or numbers, quarterly, beginning in
 July 1771, and ending in July 1775, forming altogether
 five volumes, viz. two volumes of the poetical parts, and
 three of the mathematical.         These extracts were accom
 panied   with   numerous    notes  and  illustrations, which sup
 plied  the defects   in  the original  solution   of the questions.
 Each number contained also a few sheets of new mathema-
 making one volume, in which the contributions of the
 editor himself made a considerable portion, but under
 various fictitious names.      About the years 1 771 and 1772,
 Mr. Hutton was employed by the magistrates of Neweastle
  to make an accurate survey of the town and county of New
  castle-upon-Tyne,      which he did with great correctness.
  This plan was soon after engraved and published in a map
  consisting of two very large sheets, with an abridged

  account of the history, trade, and population of that
  place.
     The old bridge of Newcastle being borne down by a very
 high flood on the 17th of November 1 77 1> which raised
 the waters in the river about nine feet higher than the usual
 spring tides, — this accident gave rise to so many absurd
 notions among the people in regard to the arches of bridges,
 that Mr. Hutton conceived that a demonstration of the re
 lation between the more essential parts of bridges might be
 of great utility to such architects and builders as might
 have mathematical knowledge sufficient to enable them to
 comprehend the theory of arches. In a few months, there
 fore, he composed, and published at Neweastle, a very
 learned and useful little book, entitled " The Principles of
 Bridges, &c.," 1772, 8vo. As this tract had been out of
 print for many years, the author was induced, in conse
 quence of being consulted on the project of a new bridge
 for the improvement of the port of London, to give a new
 edition of it. This edition, as the author thought, was
 very illiberally and unfairly attacked in the Monthly Re
view for March 1 802 ; and he consequently wrote a very
 able and masterly reply to the reviewer, which was pub
lished in the Monthly Magazine for August the same year.
    About this period the health of Mr. John Lodge Cowley,
professor of mathematics at Woolwich, having so much
declined that he could no longer attend the duties of his
office, the master-general and principal officers of the Board
of Ordnance, came to the resolution of permitting him to
retire. His successor was to be appointed by competition ;
and the gentlemen made choice of to examine the candi
dates were the ablest mathematicians that could be found,
viz. the Rev. Dr. Horslcy, now bishop of St. Asaph, the
Rev. Dr. Maskclync, astronomer Royal, Colonel Watson,
chief engineer in the service of the East India Company,
and Mr. Landen, well known by his publications on ma
thematical subjects. The candidates were in number seven
or eight ; but Mr. Hutton, who had repaired to London
for the purpose of competing on this occasion, was the
person whom the examiners thought it their duty more.
particularly to recommend, on account of the very able
manner in which he had answered all the proposed
questions.
    In consequence of the advantage which Mr. Hutton ac
quired by his new situation at Woolwich, he entered upon
a new and severe course of study, with a view of qualifying
himself better for the important task he had undertaken,
           9                                              and

                Charles Hutton,      L. L. D. F. R. S.            65
find for the execution of some new works which he had
.projected.
     The first publication which he engaged in after this
 period was the Ladies' Diary, to which for many years
 he had been an useful contributor.          On his arrival in Lon
 don, he was informed of the death of the last compiler,
 and a few days after the future management of this fa
 vourite work was confided to his judgment and industry, by
the Stationers' Company, with increased emoluments.
     For several years after his settling at Woolwich, Mr.
Hutton employed part of his time in writing accounts of
 mathematical and philosophical books for the reviews pub
lished monthly in London. The same year that he removed
 to Woolwich he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society,
 to the Transactions of which he was afterwards a valuable
 contributor.    The first of his papers published in that work
 was " A new and general method of finding simple, and
           converging scries, by which the proportion of the
3uickly
   iameter of the circle to its circumference may be easily
 computed to -a great number of figures," printed in the
Transactions for 1776. The second was " A demonstration
 of two remarkable theorems mentioned in a former article
of the Transactions," published also in the same year, 1776.
 The next was a paper, in the year 1778, " On the force of
 fired gun-powder, and the initial velocities of cannon-balls,
 determined by experiments; from which is also deduced the
 relation of the iuitial velocity to the weight of the shot, and
 the quantity of the charge of the powder."              This papei
 contains the account and calculation of a great number of
 curious experiments with cannon-balls, made at Woolwich,
 in the year 1775, by the author and other ingenious gen
 tlemen ; and so sensible were the Society of the value of
 this communication, that Mr. Hutton was honoured with
 the prize medal of that vear.        Soon after, he was elected
 one of the council, and appointed Latin secretary for con
 ducting the foreign correspondence, vacated by the election
 of Mr. Maty, to the reading secretaryship.
     In the Transactions of the same year appeared " An ac
 count of the calculations made from the survey and mea
 sures taken at Schehallien, in order to ascertain the mean
 density of the earth."        The determination of the mean
 density of the earth was an important problem proposed
 by the Society, and the survey and measurements for this
 purpose were taken at the hill of Schehallien, in Perth
 shire, in the years 177-1, 1775, and 1776, by the direc
 tion, and partly under the inspection, of Dr. Maskelyne,
    Vol.  2 1. No. 8 1 . Feb. 1 S05.       E                     the

66    Biographical Anecdotes    of Charles Hutton. L.L.D.
the astronomer royal ; after which the Society entrusted to
Mr. Hutton the important charge of making the calcula
tions, and drawing the proper conclusions from them.
The result was, that the mean density of the earth was
found to be in proportion to that of the hill of Schehallien,
as 9 to 5, so that when the actual density of the hill shall
be ascertained,   the real density of the earth will in some
measure be determined.
    The year following, Dr. Hutton gave another paper, as a
supplement to the preceding, which contained
                                                     " Calcula
tions to determine at what point in the side of the hill its
attraction will be greatest."       The next communication,
which was in the year 1780, was a long tract on cubic
equations, and this was followed, in 1783, by
                                                    " A project
for a new division of the quadrant."       This was the last of
his communications to the Transactions, as, it seems, a stop
was put to his usefulness in this way by a misunderstanding
between him and the Society, in consequence of which he
resigned his office in the year 1784.
    Soon after, that is in 1786, Dr. Hutton published a
volume of mathematical and philosophical tracts, in quarto,
containing a number of curious papers, which would pro
bably have appeared in the Philosophical Transactions had
not the before-mentioned misunderstanding taken place.
One of these tracts consists of "'New experiments in
artillery for determining the force of tired gun-powder ;
the initial velocity of cannon-balls ; the ranges of pieces of
cannon at different elevations ; the resistance of the air to
projectiles ; the effect of different lengths of cannon, and
of different quantities of powder," &c. These experiments
were made in the years 1733, 17S4, and 1785.
    Besides these, Dr. Hutton has given to the public several
other useful and ingenious works on mathematical subjects;
 as, in 1781, a folio volume, containing "Tables of the pro
 ducts and powers of numbers," published by order of the
 Commissioners of Longitude: — In 1785, "Mathematical
 tables of the common hyperbolic and logistic logarithms ;
 also sines, tangents, and secants, versed sines, both natural
 and logarithmic, with several other tables useful in mathema
 tical calculations; to which is prefixed an original history of
 the discoveries   and writings relating to these subjects;"
 a second edition of this work was printed in 1 794 : — In
 1786,   "  The compendious measurer; being a brief yet
 comprehensive treatise on mensuration and practical ge
 ometry ; with an introduction to decimal and duodecimal
 arithmetic, adapted to practice and the use of schools."

This is chiefly an abridgment of his large work on mensu
ration, and has since gone through several editions : — In
1 787» in one volume 8 vo,
                              " Elements of conic sections,
with select exercises in various branches of military mathe
matics and philosophy, for the use of the Royal Military
Academy, Woolwich."'          This volume, which consists
chiefly of practical exercises for the use of the cadets at the
Academy, was ordered to be printed by the Duke of
Richmond, then master-general of the ordnance ; and on
this occasion Dr. Hutton had the honour of being pre
sented to the king, and of kissing his majesty's hand.
    In 1796, Dr. Hutton published, in two large volumes, in
quarto, his " Mathematical and philosophical dictionary,"
an useful and laborious work,       replete with curious and
original matter. It has been said that one article alone in
it,  namely, that on algebra, occupied no less than two
years of the author's time, in reading all the treatises on the
same subject to collect the materials and arrange them.
    In 798 appeared,
          1                  " new course of mathematics,"
                                 A
in two volumes, composed, and more especially designed,
 for the use of the gentlemen cadets in the Royal Military
Academy, Woolwich.          In this work the author has con
 densed into two octavo volumes, of            middling size,
                                                          a                            a
 great  variety of useful  matter,   and  the  subjects, though
 mostly elementary, are treated in novel manner, with great
                                             a
neatness, precision, and even elegance.
    In 1799 our author had the honour of being presented
 with    diploma of Doctor of Laws
          a                                   the University of
                                                         by
 Edinburgh, and he has since been elected honorary mem
 ber of several learned academies and -societies both ii\
 Europe and America.

 A.   hk method of killing  cattle               by
                                       dividing the spinal mar-
tow, with     view to lessen or prevent entirely the suffering
               a
of the animal, was introduced at Mr. Mcllish's slaughtering-
houses        by
             the laudable perseverance of Lord Somerviue
and other members of the Board of Agriculture, and Mr.
Mellish found the flesh of the beasts so killed equally good,
ifnot better, than the flesh of those slaughtered in the usual
way. And as the operation         performed quietly, and with
                                      is
out alarm to the animal, all bruises are avoided, and such

are  not very uncommon in forcing them into a proper posi
tion to receive the stroke when they are to be knocked
clown. A butcher at Wisbech practised this mode several
years ago, from the representations made to him by captain
Clarkson, of the navy, who had seen them so slaughtered
for the use of our fleet when at Jamaica. After this person's
death, Mr. Smith, a butcher of the same place, adopted the
same method, and in the year 1796 I procured, by favour
of Mr. Clarkson (whose name accords so well with any
question of humanitv), the following account, which he had
from Mr. Smith. — " Mr. Smith informed me, that he kills
all his bullocks by striking them in the spinal marrow.         If
a line were drawn from ear-root to ear-root (at about an
inch and half distance from the horns), and the centre of this
line were found, this centre would be the place where the
knife should enter.      The knife is not in the form of a
dagger, nor is it thrust in with anv force. It is rather larger
than a common penknife, but the blade is permanently fixed
to the handle.     The handle is taken into the hand, and the
forefinger goes down it towards the point, merely to direct
it. The person using the knife takes hold of one ear of
the beast with his left hand, and with the right he strikes it
with the knife. In the same instant the bullock drops, and
is out of sensation of any pain.      He informs me, that it is
not once in a thousand times that any person misses the
right place; perhaps an apprentice may at the beginning,
but the rule is so certain that it may be said hardly ever
to fail, and if it should fail, the knife is at any rate so near
the proper place, that by the least alteration of the position
(without even taking it out) it finds its way.      In this case
there would hardly be the pain of two seconds.              I was
obliged   to leave Wisbech   before the  killing-day, or I would
have seen this method practised.       I talked to Smith's ap
prentice, who assured me that he had no difficulty in find
ing the, proper spot, and that the beast drops instantly.
Though Smith kills in this manner, no other butcher of
Wisbech follows the example. He says, however, that
the practice obtains pretty universallv on the Lincolnshire
bank of the Humber, as at Barton and several other places.
Calves, sheep, pigs, Sec. are killed by Smith in the same
manner.       I saw three sheep that had been skinned, and
were hanging up in his shop, which had been killed by his
apprentice in this way.     He showed me the small hole on
the back of the head, or neck, which the knife had made."
    Plausible, however, as these experiments are, I believe
now that they proceeded upon a mistaken principle; or
                                                           rather,

rather, that the operation did not accord with the principle,
so far as tenderness towards the animal is concerned : for
though a beast is managed completely by this mode, it is
not so certain that his sense of feeling is destroyed.      The
contrary   indeed  seems  proved by the meritorious pains taken
by Mr. Du Gard, of the Shrewsbury Infirmary, who has
shown in the following communication, that though the
spinal marrow was divided, the nerves that supplied the or-
       of respiration and most of the senses were uninjured.
  ir. Du Gard's experiments were communicated to Mr.
fans
Everard Home, of London, and by him, through sir Joseph
 Banks, to the Board.         Mr. Home afterwards sent lord
 Carriugton the valuable paper that follows Mr. Du Gard's,
in which he has suggested a mode of performing the> ope
 ration which would answer completely, could we be sure
 of having operators sufficiently skiliul. We may the less
 regret the difficulty in getting new modes established, when
 we thus see the superiority of an old custom under very
 improbable circumstances ; and if well-meant reformers
 wanted any additional motives to care and circumspection,
 a very forcible one is furnished in the instance of the time
 and trouble taken to introduce this operation, and which,
 as it has been hitherto practised, is the very reverse of what
 was intended.

   " The   subject of slaughtering cattle by puncturing the
medulla spinalis, with a view of superseding the method
generally practised in England, has lately engaged the at
tention of the Agricultural Board, and been strongly recom

 panied with sensation.
    " To constitute pain, there must be a communication
between the injured organ and the brain.
    " The heart of a viper pulsates after being taken out of
 the body ; and that pulsation is increased if it be goaded
with a pin. Limbs suddenly separated from the human
body sometimes start and twitch for a few moments. The
viper cannot be said to feel pain on its heart being pricked
with a pin : nor would any man who saw his own finger
contract from electricity or heat, after it was cut off, fancy
it suffered pain. The pain in both instances is in the part
only from whence the separation took place.
    " Perception, and the power of exertion, are derived
from the brain in the skull and back-bone.                       That part
which lies in the skull seems principally to supply our
senses and appetites with nervous energy ; and that part
which lies in the spine, and is called marrow, is more par
ticularly appropriated to the action of the large locomotive
muscles.
    " An injury to the skull not sufficient immediately to
take away life, often leaves the patient with the power of
moving his limbs, though without any feeling or perception,
lying in a profound apoplectic sleep.
    " On the contrary, an injury to the spine leaves the
power of perception perfect, though the limbs are immove
able ; but as life depends more on the functions of the
brain and of the lungs, than on the spinal marrow and its
dependent locomotive muscles, the animal feels and lives
longer on its sustaining a given injury in the spinal marrow
than on a fracture or concussion of the head*.
                                                                    «  J. B.
   * That
             perception may remain in the head, and respiration be conti
nued after the division of the medulla spinalis, will be evident to any one
who consults the anatomy of those parts.
   In the human subject, the par vagum, or eighth pair of nerves, arises

          J.  B- fell in the summer of 1801 from a load of hay ;
   he was bled, and brought to the infirmary at Shrewsbury,
   which, being my residence, gave me hourly opportunities
  of examining him : he complamed of great pain in the upper
  and back part of his neck, but of none lower down : he had
  not the power of using the least motion with any of his
  limbs.      His arms, body, and legs, were all quite insen
  sible to any pain or feelmg from pricking or pinching, and
  therefore all sensation below the injured part of the spine
  was destroyed.        In this state he languished a week, being
  apparently in full possession of the feelings and faculties of
  his mind, and of his senses of hearing, sight, smell, and
  taste. He took food for two or three days, though the power
  of retaining or protruding his evacuations was lost. On
 examining the neck after death, the second cervical vertebra
  was found fractured.
      "  On reflecting on this case it occurred to me, that a
 dumb animal, if reduced to the state of this poor man,
 would not have the power of expressing the pain it endured,
 for   J.  B. had great pain above the injured part, though all
 power of movmg, as well as feeling, was destroyed below ;
 and in the brute creation, we judge of pain by the muscu
 lar efforts of the animal. I therefore, by means of a dagger,
 punctured the spinal marrow of a cow according to the new
 method of slaughtering, and having divided it as much as
 possible after she tell, reduced her to the same state as the
 poor man whose case I have related,              The animal breathed
 with freedom, and perception in the head continued, as
was evinced by the eyelids closing on the approach of my
hand, till the butcher struck a blow near the horns, when
her breathing ceased, and the eye became fixed with imme
diate death.
     "                                I
         In all the experiments have hitherto tried, the ani
mal     has  suddenly dropped, and has been slightly convulsed,
but has not died immediately.             In sheep, after puncturing
the medulla spinalis in the new way, I have seen their eyes
close and open on the approach and withdrawing of my
hand, for twenty times successively, and the pupil as much
contracted as in health, till I was anxious to terminate their
misery by having the blood-vessels of the throat divided.

    I have examined the head and neck of a sheep killed by the puncture,
and found the par vagum uninjured.

From   the loss of blood their eyes have then soon become
dilated  and insensible.
     "In the old method of slaughtering, a concussion of
the brain takes place, and theretore ihv power of feeling is
destroyed. The animal drops, and although convulsions
take place generally longer and more violent than when the
spinal marrow is divided, yet there                    is,
                                              think, reason to

believe that the animal suffers less pain.
     "The immediate consequence of the blow          the dilata  is
tion of the pupil of the eye, without ar.v expression of con
sciousness or fear on the approach of the hand.
     "In this state of insensibility, which in man would be
called apoplexy, or extreme stupor, the blood            always       is
drawn otf      the butcher cutting the throat, and the animal
                  by
dies without the least sign of feeling or uneasy faintness.
     "In severe epilepsy the brain suffers     temporary sus a
pension of power, in many respects very similar to the
concussion of the brain from       blow, only that the convul
                                           a
sions and expressions of pain seem greater     yet the patients

                                           is   a
of feeling.
     " From all these circumstances    conclude that the new

        MY LORD,
     "
     I  had the honour of presenting to your lordship,
through sir Joseph Banks, some experiments and obser
vations made            by
                   surgeon at Shrewsbury, to show that the
                             a
mode adopted in this country, of killing animals bv wound
ing the spinal marrow,     less humane than the more com
                                      is
mon one of knocking them down.
   " have, at your lordship's request, repeated these expe
     I
riments, and find the results agree with those of the author
of the paper in every respect but the want of success
                                               ;
appears to arise entirely from the operation having been
performed in very imperfect manner.
                       a
                                                                           « On

                       On Pilhing Cattle.                              73
  "    On Thursday the 15th of July 1802, the following
experiment was made at Mr. Giblet's, in Bond-street : A
very fine ox was pithed, as it is termed, by Benjamin Bar
tholomew, who has performed this operation more than
twenty different times, and is considered to be very expert
in the mode of doing it.        I begged that he would take some
pains, so as to do it in the most effectual manner.
  "    The instrument he used was in the shape of a brick
layer's trowel, made sharp at the point, and having a guard
at the shoulder, to prevent the blade from being buried in
the neck.
    " He plunged    it,     with great dexterity, into the canal
containing    the  spinal marrow, and the animal instantly
dropped, but the breathing continued, the motions of the
eye and eye-lids were perfect, and the whole face lost no
part of its animation.
   "    This being ascertained      byobservation for ten minutes,
and the animal not being sufficiently quiet to admit of the
throat being cut,  it     was knocked on the head, and every
appearance of animation in the countenance immediately
ceased, and the breathing stopped.
  "     The spinal marrow was afterwards examined             was
                                                              :   it
 found completely divided, but too low          in  the neck, the
 wound having been made one inch and            a  half below the
 origin of the nerves that supply the diaphragm.
     " That division of this part of the spinal marrow does
             a
 not deprive an animal of life, has been known to anato
 mists for many years and the causes of its failure cannot
                           ;
 be better explained than      by  extracting an account of some
 experiments made      by   Mr. Cruickshank, in the year 1776,
 at which   I  was present, and gave my assistance.          They
 are published in the 85th volume of the Philosophical
 Transactions.
     " Experiment VI. April 19, 1776. — divided the spinal
                                            I
 marrow of dog, between the last vertebra of the neck and
             a
 first of the back. The muscles of the trunk of the body,
 but particularly those of the hind legs, appeared instantly
 relaxed;   the legs continued supple, like those of an animal
 killed by  electricity.    The heart, on performing the opera
 tion, ceased for  a     stroke or two, then went on slow and
 full, and in about quarter of an hour after the pulse was
                       a
  160 ina   minute.      Respiration was performed       by
                                                          means of
 the diaphragm only, which acted very strongly for some
 hours. The operation was performed about quarter of an
                                                     a
 hour before twelve at noon     ;    about four in the afternoon
 the pulse was ninety only       in a minute, and the heat of the
                                                              body

                         On Pithing Cattle.
   body exceedingly abated, the diaphragm acting strongly,
   but irregularly.   About seven in the evening the pulse was
   not above twenty in a minute, the diaphragm acting
   strongly, but in repeated jerks.   Between twelve at night
   and one in the morning the dog was still alive : respiration
   was very slow, hut the diaphragm still acted with consi
   derable force.   Early in the morning he was found dead.
  This operation I performed from the suggestion of Mr.
  Hunter. He had observed in the human subject, that
  when the neck was broke at the lower part (in which cases
  the spinal marrow is torn through), the patient lived for
  some days, breathing by the diaphragm.      This experiment
  showed that dividing the spinal marrow at this place, on the
  neck, if below the origin of the phrenic nerves, would not
  for many hours after destroy the animal ; it was preparatory
  to the following experiment.
      " Experiment VII. April 26. — I divided the par vagum
  and intercostal nerves, on both sides, in a dog.        Soon
 after, I performed on the same animal the operation of the
 last experiment, and the same symptoms took place. His
 respirations were five in a minute, and more regular than
  in Experiment III. ; the pulse beat 80 in a minute.      Five
 minutes after, I found the pulse 1 20 in a minute, respiration
 unaltered ; at the end of ten minutes, the pulse had again
 sunk to 80 in a minute, respiration as before ; at the end
 of fifteen minutes, the pulse was again 120, respiration
 not altered.     The operation was performed about two in
 the afternoon, at Mr. Hunter's in Jennyn-street. At three-
 quarters    of an hour after five, the respirations were in
 creased to fifteen in a minute ; the pulse beating 80 in the
 same time, and very regularly : the breathing seemed so
 free, that he had the appearance of a dog asleep.        At a
 quarter before eight, the pulse beat 80, respirations being
 ten in a minute. At three-quarters of an hour after ten, re
 spiration was eight in a minute, the pulse beating 60. The
 animal heat was exceedingly abated : I applied heat to the
 chest, he breathed stronger, and raised his head a little, as
 if awaking from sleep. At half after twelve Mr. Hunter
 saw him ; the breathing was strong, and twelve in a mi
nute, the heart beating forty-eight in the same time, slow,
but not feeble.       He shut his eyelids when they were
touched ; shut his mouth on its being opened ; he raised
his head a little, but as he had not the use of the muscles
which fix the chest, he did it with a jerk. Mr. Hunter
saw him again between four and five o'clock in the morn
ing ; his respirations were then five in a minute, the heart
                                                       beating

                      On Pithing Cattle.                         75
beating exceedingly slow and weak. We suppose he died
about six in the morning, having survived the operation
sixteen hours. This experiment I made from the suggestion
of Mr. Hunter, with a view to obviate the objections raised
against the reasoning drawn from the three first experi
ments.     It was urged, that though by these experiments          I
had deprived the thoracic and abdominal viscera of their
ordinary connexion with the brain, yet, as the intercostals
communicated with all the spinal nerves, some influence
might be derived from the brain in this way. This expe
riment removed also the spinal nerves, and consequently
this objection.
    " As I found by the two last experiments that dividing
the spinal marrow in the lower part of the neck did not
immediatelv kill, although instant death was universally
known to be the consequence of dividing it in the upper
part of the neck, I expressed my surprise to Mr. Hunter,
that the spinal marrow should, according to modern theory,
be so irritable in the one place, and so much less so in the
other.
  "    He told me, that from the time he first observed that
men who had the spinal marrow destroyed in the lower part
of the neck lived some days after      it, he had established an
opinion,    that animals  who had   the  spinal marrow wounded
in the upper part of the neck did not die from the mere
wound, but that in dividing       so high we destroyed all the
                                  it
nerves of the muscles of respiration, and reduced the animal
to the state of one hanged    ; whereas,     in dividingit  lower,
we still left the phrenic nerves, and allowed the animal
to breathe by his diaphragm.          If this opinion be well-
founded, though dividing the spinal marrow in the lower
part of the neck does not kill instantly, whilst the phrenic
nerves are untouched, yet,    if  I  divide the phrenic nerves
first, and then divide the spinal marrow in the lower part of
the neck, the consequence, said, will be the same as
                              I                               if I
had divided  it  in the upper part.
   "  Experiment VIII. — By detachingthe scapulae of dog     a
from the spine and partly from the ribs, got at the axillary
                                             I
plexus of nerves on both sides from behmd.          I    separated
the arteries and veins from the nerves, and passed ligature
                                                       a
under the nerves close to the spine.         I  thoughtI     could
discern the phrenic nerves, and instantly divided two con
siderable nerves going off from each plexus.         The action of
the diaphragm seemed to cease, and the abdominal muscles
became fixed, as   if   they had been arrested in expiration,
 the belly appearing contracted.      His respirations were now
                                                             about

 76                        On Pithing Cattle.
 about twenty-five in a minute, the pulse beating a hundred
 and twenty.       As I was not willing to trust the experiment
to the possibility of having divided only one of the phrenies
 (which I afterwards found" was really the case) , and some
different nerve instead of the other, after carefully attending
 to the present symptoms I divided all the nerves of the
 axillary of each side.         The ribs were now more elevated in
 respiration than before ; respirations were increased to forty
 in a minute, the pulse still beating a hundred and twenty
in the same time. Finding that respiration went on very
easily without the diaphragm, in about a quarter of an hour
after dividing the axillary plexus of each side I divided the
spinal marrow as in Experiment VI. The whole animal
took the alarm ; all the flexor muscles of the body seemed
to contract, and instantly to relax again : he died as sud
denly as if the spinal marrow had been divided in the upper
part of the neck.
    "  Having explained the causes of failure in the present
mode of pithing animals, it becomes necessary to state, that
when the operation is properly performed, its success is
complete. Of this I will mention the following instances :
    "  A small horse was killed in this manner, that a cast
might be made of its muscles in their natural state of action.
The animal was allowed to stand upon a pedestal, and the
operation was performed by Mr. Hunter, with a large awl :
the breathing ceased instantaneously, and the animal was
so completely dead as to be supported by the assistants,
without making the slightest struggle, and was fixed in
the position in which he stood, without ever coming to the
ground*.
    " A dog was' killed       so instantaneously in the same way,
by Mr. Hunter,           that   Mr. Clift, the conservator of the
Hunterian Museum, who held the legs, and did not see the
awl introduced, was waiting till the animal should struggle,
and had no knowledge of any thing having been done, till
he was told to let go, and was surprised to find that the
animal was completely dead.
   "   In these operations the instrument was small, and di
rected by the skill of an anatomist upwards into the cavity
of the skull, so as to divide the medullary substance above
the origin of the nerves which supply the diaphragm.
    "  By adopting this method of performing the operation
of pithing cattle, it will be attended with the same success."
    * The  cast of this horse  has a place in the Hunterian Museum

country where provisions of every kind are extremely low,
is  about six shillings per annum. This produce          no doubt          is
considerable.     There      no tree in any part of the world
                                  is is
which in this respect       equal to               it,

also that various kinds of leguminous and gramineous
plants, and even fruit-trees, can be cultivated under its
shelter; that      scarcely requires any care or expense; and
                     it
that all its parts are useful, as will be shown in this memoir.
     It   well known that the fibrous covering of the coco
        is is
nut       converted into good ropes, which are useful in na
vigation, and for various purposes on shore. Cables for
anchors made of this substance arc much better than those
made of hemp.        They are exceedingly elastic, stretch with
out straining the vessel, and scarcely ever break; inappre
ciable advantages, which are not possessed        those of hemp.   by
They are also lighter, and never rot,       consequence of their
                                                          in
being soaked with sea water. They never, like those of
 hemp, exhale damp miasmata, exceedingly hurtful to the

 ropes are kept when ships are under sail.            To all these
 advantages    must  be  added,  that ropes  made   of  the kaer*
 float like wood, that they are much easier managed, and
 run better in the pulleys during nautical manoeuvres.

78            Natural History of   the Coco-nut Tree
of straw.      They do not attract rats and reptiles like the
latter; and they are lighter, equally strong and durable,
and much less exposed to danger in the case of fire.           If
fire happen to fall on a roof of this kind, which consists
of two leaves placed one over the other, it can burn only a
small surface, and is prevented from spreading for want of
aliment. It may therefore be said that the coco-nut tree, which
in the fields defends the wearied Indian by its shade from
the scorching rays of the sun, protects the peaceful farmer
in the night from the long and heavy rains of the monsoons.
    The liquor of the coco-nut, when it is yet tender, is an
agreeable and cooling beverage; its kernel, when newly
formed, is sweet, and exceedingly pleasant to the taste.
Both of them are salutary to persons afflicted with the
scurvy.     It would be dangerous, after long sea voyages,
to make immediate use of them : instead of being beneficial,
they would produce pernicious consequences*
    When the coco-nut has attained to maturity, it detaches
itself from its stalk and falls spontaneously; but its fall
might be dangerous, and to prevent accidents the bunch is
cut by the chana some days sooner than the period at which
it attains to complete maturity.        When the nut is rasped
                                                                  "
with a circular-teethed piece of iron, there is extracted from
it a kind of milk or emulsion, by' mixing with it a small
quantity of boiling water and then straining it through a
piece of thin cloth in the same manner as those do who
extract milk of almonds.
    This emulsion is employed for different purposes : it is
used for preparing saloop and sago. When put into coffee,
                                                                  .
instead of cream, it gives it an exquisite taste : that of our
almonds produces nearly the same effect.       This emulsion is
employed     also in the art  of painting chintzes  ; to remove
stains of the colours, and scour the cloth after the colours
have been applied.       The milk of the coco-nut, though
oily, effervesces with an acid extract of ihat plant called
by the Hindoos colechi, and the acid then precipitates it
into a grayish lime, which becomes of a rich violet colour
by the addition, of fixed alkali ; it is with this colour that
cotton cloth and chintzes are dyed.       When this emulsion
is mixed with quicklime the alkali becomes rose-coloured.
It is by these means that the Hindoos prepare the rose-co
loured lime which they use with betel.
    The dyers employ this milk with great advantage for
silk, cotton, and woollen stuffs, which they dye black s It
 prevents that colour, which is generally caustic, from burn
 ingS the stuffs, and the dyey becomes darker and more beau-
                                                  .        tiful.

tiful.     I  suppose that emulsion of almonds would produce
the same        effect as that of the coco-nut ; our black stuffs
then would not be burnt, as is generally the case : this ob
servation may be of use to dyers.
     If the milk of the coco-nut be concentrated by ebullition
over a moderate fire, a sweet oil, agreeable and fit. for the
table when fresh, is obtained from it.             The physicians of
the country compose with this emulsion a gentle purgative,
which is not nauseous : it produces no cholic or violent
 pain.       It is administered in cases of plethora, gonorrhea,
 and other diseases ; it is also an excellent vermifuge.         It is
composed of half a pint of emulsion in which three or four
 heads of garlic have been dissolved, by boiling over a slow
 fire, to the consistence of marmelade : it is given to the
 patient fasting, while warm, with the addition of            a little
 sugar.
     The oil of this nut is extracted by pressure ; it is fit only
 for being burnt in lamps ; it is of a drying quality, a little
 acrid, white, and so light that it becomes fixed even in the
 torrid zone ; when burnt it gives a clear bright flame with
 out exhaling any odour or smoke.            It is employed by rich
 people     and   in the  houses of  the Europeans in preference to
 any    other    kind.    The  substance  from which this oil has
 been squeezed is given to beasts of burden mixed with their
 forage ; this food when given to cows and goats increases
  the quantity of their milk.
      Such are the properties and different uses made of this
  palm.       If the wood could be employed for building or for
  domestic purposes, it might justly be said that the coco
  nut tree alone would be sufficient for the use of man. It
  is, however, a useful vegetable production, a valuable gift
  of Providence to the peaceful inhabitants of that fine country
  where it has been placed.
      It was the coco-nut tree which gave the Hindoos the
  first idea of inventing the allegory and ingenious fable
  of the phoenix, as may be seen in the fifth chapter of the
   Poronia, one of the commentaries of the vaides, a sacred
  book of these people, which contains the principles of their
  religion, the history of the country, their sciences, and in
              all their knowledge, as well as the practical know-
  fjeneral
    edge of all the arts which are cultivated in it.
      The coco-nut tree does not renew the buds of its flowers
   after an interval of two months, but in April, a period at
  which the year of the Hindoos commences, it is produced
   only from its fruit, which are their children.         This is ex
                                                                  actly

   to say, that it nourished and reproduced itself.              It is seen
  in the Indian mythology that these people deified the coco
  nut tree in the same manner as many other trees and smaH
  vegetables ; useful animals, such as the ox ; the sea, and all
  rivers. The Egyptians and all the neighbouring nations
  adopted the mythology and fables, as well as the arts and
  sciences, of these people, as is fully proved by researches
  made for more than half a eentury : the Egyptians, the
  Tyrians, and the Greeks deified therefore, like the Hindoos,
  animals, useful vegetables, and rivers.                Hence the ox be
  came   the   god apisi   and   the  date-tree    the phoenix.

 XII.    Experiments to ascertain whether there exists any
     Affinity betwixt Carbon and Clay, Lime and Silex, so
     parately or as Compounds united with the Oxide of Iron
    forming Iron Ores and Iron Stones. By David Mushet,

                         3d,   Siliceous   Ironstone.
 The      varieties   of this ironstone are in general much poorer
 in iron than       the common qualities of ironstone : from 15
 to 25 per cent, seem to be the medium contents in metal.
 Somc specimens have been obtained as high as 35 per cent,
 and 38 per cent.         At first sight this class of ironstones re
 semble sandstone ; but, upon minute examination, there
 appear other characteristic features, of which density is al
 ways one, to distinguish them from each other.
     The varieties of this class are, like the argillaceous and
calcareous,      found both in balls and in regular strata, and
 subject to the same general rule, i. e. the thicker the band
or stratum, the less metal will be found in a given quantity
of the ore. Siliceous ball ironstone is generally rich in
iron, and is commonly found with a fracture more or lest*
granulated resembling a coarse variety of freestone.                What
distinguishes it from sandstone is the calcareous earth that
is found in the state of chalk, and which appears in some
measure to be the seat or bond of union of each individual
granule of ore.
    The poorer varieties of siliceous ore are sometimes found

From 2 to 4 feet in thickness ; they are either called liard-
eeking freestone, or water-whin, or dyke metal ; and have
seldom heen suspected of containing iron.      Almost every
variety  I have examined   has  contained a portion of calca
reous earth, either in the stale of chalk, spar, or crystal.
This circumstance, added to density, leads always to a
 strong suspicion of iron being contained in quantity.
    The ironstone subjected to the following experiments is
Found in an irregular stratum from 4 to 8 inches thick.           A
 bed of coal is immediately below              it,

finely prismatic, and the lustre of some of the shades un
commonly luminous and deep.           Towards the bottom two
cavities of   a pearly white colour were found         and imme

The surface of the glass, however, in place of being shining
and crystallized, as in No. I., was dull, black, and covered
with an enamel of oxide usual in these experiments, but of
an unusual thickness.        The fracture was prismatic and
wavy. A metallic spherule was obtained which weighed
lO£ grains.    Equal to 2,625 per cent.

under appearances somewhat different from No.              and II. I.
When the cover was taken off, after redness had ceased,
the surface of the glass was fuund semi -spherical.         In half
a minute part of the convex was removed             at the time

slight explosion was heard, accompanied with               Hash of a
sparkling light blue flame. Beneath, the glass was found of             a
variety of brown and blue colours. Their fragment displayed

   The result of the fusion of this compound was a shining
pearly coloured g'ass. A minute hollow sphere of glass
m cooling reared itself upon the surface : this was quite
transparent, and became immediately filled with a smoky
blue vapour.     It then burst with a fine flash of light, as
happened in    the  former experiment.
    The metallic product consisted of one button of white
cast iron and five carburated globules, weighing in all 32
grains; and equal to. S percent.        A large portion of char
coal remained untaken up, and symptoms of general in-
fusibility were evident from the. nature of the glass. To
correct this, and by the effects of the addition of calcareous
to siliceous ironstone, the following experiment was made:

                40          of charcoal,
              140           of chalk.
    The reduction of this mixture was complete. The whole
of the charcoal had disappeared and a dark green glass ob
tained, which in thin fragments possessed a little transpa
 rency. A metallic button and a few small globules were
 obtained, which weighed 70 grains, equal to 1 7 per cent.

    Uniformly we find that argillaceous ore lets fall its first por
tion of metal with the smallest quantity of carbon ; or, what
amounts to the same thing, with equal portions of carbon
it yields a greater produce in metal than the siliceous iron
stone. On the contrary, we find that the calcareous ores
require a greater dose of carbon to separate the first portions
of iron ; or, what is similar, with equal portions of carbon
less metal is revived from the ores of this class thau from
any of the other two; with this limitation, however, that
calcareous     ironstones in general never become infusible,
even with a very high proportion of carbon, until nearly
the whole metallic contents, become revived.            This, by a
strict examination of the tables, will not be found applicable
to the argillaceous and siliceous, one-half of the metallic
 contents of which are either not separated or not revived.
    The general results of these experiments are sufficient to
establish ail operation of affinity directly betwixt carbon,
clay, and silcx, in temperatures of fusion, or approaching
 thereto. Thev are also sufficient to establish the operation
of a principle still more powerful, -a hen these enter into the
 composition of ores of iron and become subjected to the
 heat of the assay furnace.         Under these circumstances we
 find calcareous earth, the affinity of which for carbon, bv
 fusing them together, could not be detected bv any altera
 tion of colour or combination, operating as a stimulus to
 the well known affinity that exists between iron and carbon,
 and by its simple .agency alone doubling the produce from
an argillaceous or siliceous ore.         In some of these experi
 ments we find the result accompanied bv a small portion
 of iron, and a large proportion of the carbonaceous matter
 originally introduced.       If the same experiment is repeated
 with the addition of l-3d or J-4th of calcareous earth, the
 charcoal will be no longer found, the metallic contents will
 be considerably increased, and the glass, from beiug black
 and spongy, will exhibit a mass of uniform colour, density,
 and comparative transparency.
     As numerous experiments have formerly been given to
          out the effect which the addition of calcareous earth
    as in reviving the metallic produce from an ore, the fol
  Eoint
 lowing experiments will prove its secreting powers in the
  early stages of separation.

From these experiments it appears most evident that the
effects of the carbonaceous matter at a certain stage of se
paration arc more extensive with clay and sand than with
lime ; and still more so when fused with oxide alone than
in addition with any of these earths ; though vitrified Corn
wall clay nearly approaches the same standard.

 xiiXTiiACT of a letter from Capt. Lieut, von Kreusenstern,
 commander of the ships Nadcshda and Neva, to the acade
 mician Schubert, dated the Harbour of St. l'ctcr and St,
 Paul, in Kamtschatka, Aug. 8, 1804.
     " On the 4th of February we left the island of St. Ca-
 therine and the coast of Brazil ; on the 25th we discovered
 Staten Land ; and on the 25th of March doubled Cape
Horn. After entering the Great South Sea, or Pacific Ocean,
we had stormy and cloudy weather, in consequence of
 which the two ships were separated, and did not meet till
 six weeks after, when they arrived at the Marquesas : on'
the 6th of May we saw Hood's island and some other
islands to the north-west of the Marquesas ; on the day fol
 lowing we anchored at the island Nukatera in the harbour
 of Anna Maria, a bay called by the natives Tayo Hoae.
 Three days after, that is on the 10th of May, the other ship
the Neva entered also, after having cruised three davs
around Easter Island in search of us.          In this island we
discovered   an excellent harbour,      never    before   known,
which has deep water close to the shore, and is so sheltered
 by the land that vessels can lie in calm water during the
most boisterous winds.       The inhabitants behaved exceed
ingly well, showed us every mark of attention, and the
good understanding between us was never interrupted. The
island, however, supplied only wood, fresh water, coco
                                                             nuts,

                                Palladium,                         89
  tiuts, bananas, and some bread-fruit.            In regard to pro
  visions, we could with difficulty procure six swiqe, because
  the inhabitants had only a few themselves.
      " On the 18th of May we left this island ; and on the 25th
  crossed the equator in the igaih degree of west longitude,
      " On the 7th of June we discovered the island Owhyhee,
  celebrated     by the death of Capt. Cook, which is the
  southernmost and largest of the Sandwich islands.              We
  sailed three days along the coast in order to procure fresh
'
  water from the inhabitants ; but there is so great want of it
  in this island, and the inhabitants were so well supplied
  with iron articles, that they brought us only a sow, which
  they would not barter but tor a cloke of the finest cloth.         I
  therefore found myself under the necessity, on the I Oth of
  June, of bearing away for Kamtschatka, especially as the
   slightest symptom of the scurvy or of any other disease had
  not manifested itself among the people, though they had
  lived so long on salt meat.        The Neva remained some time
  longer at the Sandwich Isles.
      " On the 1 1th of July we saw the coast of Kamtschatka,
  and on the afternoon of the 14th anchored in the harbour
  of St. Peter and St. Paul, thirty-four days after our depar
  ture from Owhyhee, and somewhat more than five months
  after we had left the coast of Brazil.      The whole crew were
  in perfect health, and the rich lading destined for Kamt
  schatka was found in the best condition.           Soon after our
  arrival the whole country experienced the beneficent con
  sequences of this voyage.         At our arrival, wretched brandy
  cost 20 rouhles the can; at present the best is sold for 8;
  sugar cost 3! roubles the pound ; at present it costs 1£
  rouble ; and other articles in the same proportion.           On a
  proposal    made   by  the  worthy governor,   General  Koschelef,

a considerable quantity of platina with a view to make it

 the palladium ; but observing; that there were yet many phae-

his claim to the discovery without directing the attention
of chemists to a subject he desired to investigate more fully.

           ORIGINAL VACCINE POCK INSTITUTION.
    At the quarterly court held on the 29th January, a cri
tical examination of Mr. Goldson's second pamphlet was
read by Dr. Pearson.       We are sorry our limits do not admit
of our laying before our readers more than the concluding
remark of Dr. Pearson, which was as fallows :
    " Dr. Pearson repeats his proposal to Mr. Goldson, of
coming himself, or deputing two friends to the Vaccine
Pock Institution, to decide the questioned facts by experi
ments, and lay the issue before the public.           In the mean
time Dr. Pearson, in the name of the institution in general,
and his own in particular, returns his acknowledgment to
Mr. Goldson for provoking the investigation of a subject
which is so much wanted to obtain precision in practice,,
which has been checked hitherto by so many pretenders to
knowledge of the subject, and who would wish it to be
believed that the history of vaccine inoculation was ex
hausted by the publication of half a dozen instances of
inoculated cases on the promulgation of the new practice.
Dr. Pearson willingly concedes to Mr. Goldson, that a test
of security is wanted for many of those who have been or
shall be inoculated, because a criterion has been wanting
to guide practitioners, and determine whether constitu
tional affection was produced or not ; and that, admitting
that even all the adverse cases published are cases of small
pox after cow-pock, which does not appear to be the truth,
they will only serve to regulate practice in future ; for the

     The emperor of Russia, while  he attends to the prosperity
of the people whom he governs, seems anxious to promote,
by his patronage, the cause of science every where, as being
beneficial to the general interests of mankind.
  Among recent instances of his munificence in this re

    posed by the Royal College of Surgeons, Mr. Chevallier,

    In regard to the celebrated plant ayapana, which is said
to be an antidote to all poisons, I have made two experi
ments on myself.         A soldier brought me a brown catter-
pillar  covered  with   hair, an inch in length and intermixed
villi small prickles. I took it from the leaf into my hand,
upon which the soldier cried out,
                                              " For God's sake take
earc,   the caterpillar  is  poisonous." His exclamation- how-,
ever was too late: I received three pricks in the middle
 finger of the right hand, the finger appeared red, swelled,
and became exceedingly painful.             In a quarter of an hour
the redness and swelling extended over the whole arm, and
as far as the elbow, so that in half an hour I could scarcely
move it ; I recollected the ayapana, sent for                      it,
                                                             expressed
the juice, and applied        to my ami with some of the bruised
                                 it
plant :   in two or three minutes the pain decreased            in half  ;
an hour       Iwas able to bend my arm, and the next day                      I
recovered the perfect use of it.           The pricks             in
                                                           my finger,
however, retained         dull pain for two days, but at the end

possible to prevent suppuration.           I was obliged to open

    This beneficent plant must, where possible, be emploved
immediately after being bitten or pricked : its speedy action
may then be traced ; if applied later it removes the heat and
swelling, and counteracts the effects of the poison, but
connot prevent suppuration.
                           ASTRONOMY.
    If astronomers are very anxious to determine the orbits
,of the planets lately discovered, their principal object is to
ascertain their route, in order that they may be able to find
them again when bad weather, or any other cause, has pro
duced a long interruption of observations. This has been
the case in regard to the new planet discovered by M. Har
ding : for a month we have not been able to see it ; and it
would have been impossible to find it again, in consequence
 of the great faintness of its light, had not its position been
previously known. This observation succeeded on the 20th
and 21st of December: it is the more important, as the
 planet is in that situation most favourable for determining
its position from the sun.           It has now passed over the
 twelfth part    of its  orbit ; at the time of my preceding re
 searches   it had  made   only   half that  progress.  These new
elements, then, deserve more confidence.            They, however,
differ little from the former; for I have found nothing to
 be changed in the mean distance and in the revolution,
which is four years four months, almost equal to that of
 the other two planets, Ceres and Pallas.          But I have in
 creased the eccentricity by a 70th part, so that it is deter
mined that this new planet has the greatest eccentricity
 of all the planets known : the perihelion has been advanced
 to 24 minutes ; the node and inclination have changed only
 a very few minutes.
    The effect of this great eccentricity is so sensible, that
the time employed by the planet to pass over the first part
of its orbit, the middle of which is occupied by its aphe
lion, is the double of that necessary for completing the
second half.      In like manner, its greatest distance from
the sun is almost double the least distance : in absolute
measures the difference between these two distances is 45
 millions of leagues, or equal to one and a third of the di
 stance of the earth from the sun.

    The planet is approaching the sun, and will not pass it*
 perihelion till the J 5th of February.              This circumstance
 affords some hope that we shall still be able to observe it.             I
 have therefore thought it might be useful and agreeable to
 astronomers to give the following ephemerides with the new

    Last night Vesuvius, which had been pretty tranquil for
 some weeks, suddenly began to excite attention.                   A smart
 shock of an eartl^quake was first felt : a column of flame
 of an astonishing height then issued from the crater?
 and this was followed by an abundant discharge of lava,
 which in three hours flowed beyond the boundaries to which
 that thrown up by the volcano three months ago had pro
 ceeded.     The inhabitants of the mountain were thrown into
 the  utmost    consternation, and most of them fled with what
 ever they    could  carry with them. The greatest danger seemcd:
 to threaten     the  town of Torre dej Greco, for the current of
 lava  ran   directly   towards it ; but it has not yet reached it :
 and   this  day   the  discharge of the lava has perceptibly de
 creased.      The   court   is now at Portiei, an elegant seat be

 XV.     On the Means most proper to be resorted to for ex
    tinguishing accidental Fires in Ships.     By Alexander
    Tilloch. Read before the Askesian Society in December
     1801.
 It    is impossible for human imagination to conceive any
 calamity more horrid and distressing than that of a ship on
Jire, —a species of accident to which vessels are much ex
 posed, owing to the combustible nature of the materials of
 which they are constructed, and which, unhappily, too
 often baffles every effort to subdue it.
    To discover some means by which those on board, in
 such circumstances, may extinguish the flames efficaciously
 and speedily, has long been a desideratum ; for experience
 has but too fully proved, that buckets and fire-engines, with
 water, the methods heretofore resorted to, are not effectual.
 To point out such means as are calculated to arrest the pro
 gress of the devouring flames will not be thought an useless
 labour; nor will they be the less valued for oeing simple,
 and, in almost every case likely to occur, perfectly within
 the reach of the people.    That the efficacy of the means to
 be proposed may be established on incontrovertible prin
 ciples, it may be of some use to examine, previously, what
 takes place in deflagrations of the kind to which we allude.
 This inquiry will also probably lead us to a knowledge of
 the cause why the methods usually employed prove inade
 quate to the end proposed.
    The laws and operations of nature arc extremely simple,
 and, if we attend to what she points out, we cannot be
 misled.
    For maintaining the common process of combustion,
 certain conditions arc indispensable.
     1 . A substance   or substances capable of undergoing a
 chemical decomposition, and of entering, wholly or par
 tially, into new combinations when circumstances favour"
 the process.
    Such are wood, tar, hemp, &c.
     2. The presence of some other substance which, by its
 decompositiop, may furnish a principle or principles capa
 ble of entering; into union with those of the combustible
 substances, thereby liberating caloric or the matter of heat,
 which, with the light also liberated, constitutes the most
 striking phenomena in combustion.
    Atmospheric air is such a substance.
    It is a fact well known, that the atmosphere consists of
 VoU 21. No. 62. March 1805.           G                  two

    03         On the Means most proper to        be resorted   to
    two distinct substances dissolved in caloric or heat, which
    forms a third ingredient.      The two first are oxygen and
    azote.
       The azote is in such strong chemical union with the. ca
    loric, in which it is dissolved, that in no common process
    of combustion is the union destroyed : or, in other words,
    that portion of the heat of the atmosphere which is united
    to the azote is never liberated to exercise its action in form
    ing new combinations*.
       It is otherwise, however, with the portion of heat united
    to the oxvgenous part of the atmosphere.        These two have
    so weak an affinity for each other, that a little increase of
    temperature is all that is necessary to determine their sepa
    ration, if substances to which the oxygen can unite itself
    be present. In proportion as the oxygen joins itself to ihe?c
    substances, the heat thus liberated raises the temperature of
    other portions of them to that point which determines their
    union with oxvgen ; thus more air becomes speedily decotn-
-
    posed, and all the phenomena of combustion arc rendered
    mope and more conspicuous, till complete deflagration pre
    cludes ail possibility of checking the progress.
       What office does water pciform when employed for the
    purpose of checking the progress of a fire ? It extinguishes
    the flame by cutting off the communication, between the bunt
    ing body and the air which maintains the combustion.        But-
    this il can do onlv in certain cases.
       Water is known to consist of two substances, oxygi'n
    and hydrogen.     The former, as has already been noticed, is
    an ingredient also in atmospheric air, and is that substance-
    which unites itself to the burning body in everv case of com
    bustion : the latter is the base of hydrogen gas ox inflam
    mable   air.
         Water, like atmospheric air,     may be decomposed by pre
    senting to      it,
                     under certain circumstances, substances for
    which either of its constituent principles has              stronger
                                                                a
    affinitv than the two have for each other.
       When     afire has got to such     a  height that water cannot
    be thrown on       in sufficient quantity to interpose itself as
                          it

    decomposed,    —     that  ease, instead   ofextinguishing,     adds
                                                                     it
       *  It  must be here obsetved. however, that this remark should be
    taken with some limitation: modern chemistry    is    some mcasuie forced
                                                         in
    to suppose that the azote goes t» the formation of alkalis when thtv
    result from the combustion    in which case the caloric may lie supposed

 to the deflagration.      Its oxygen joins the combustible ma
 terials, while its hydrogen, disengaged in the form of in
flammable air, mixes with the atmospheric air present, and
inflames almost as quickly as it is liberated.
     A ship in such a case becomes filled with flames, even in
those places where, before, there, was no fire; and it may
truly be said, these parts are set on fire bv water !
    But water has been the only means hitherto employed to
extinguish fires ; and if this is not to be used, what other
method can we resort to ?
    The question is answered in part by what we have stated
respecting water when it succeeds in any case in extinguish
ing fire.     Cut off all communication      between the burning
body   or bodies  and the   atmosphere.
   The presence of air, we have already observed, is indis
pensably requisite to maintain combustion.
   This fact has been long known, and it appears wonderful
that advantage was never taken of it to extinguish fire in
                                       is,
ships; especially when it         considered that their structure
is such that, had this been one of the principal objects in
view in the building of them, they could not possibly have
been better constructed to enable us to take advantage of
this law of nature.

 does the process of combustion cease.           on this princi

100        On the Means most proper to     be resorted to
fire on board a ship.     If the fire cannot be got at, and in-      >
stantlv extinguished with a bucket or two of water, no time
should be wasted in fruitless attempts to reach the spot;
for during all this time the prime auxiliary, the most for
midable ingredient in the conflagration, viz. the atmo
spheric air, is allowed to pour itself upon the burning ma
terials and to furnish the very essence of the flame, — for the
fire is fuunished bv thf. air, and not by the wood, far,
 &c. ; a fact too well established to be insisted on here. In
 stead of suffering this to take place, all hands should be
 called up; the ports, hatches, &c. should be shut, and every
 one 9et to work to stop up with oakum, tallow, pitch, (any
 thing,) every chink and crevice all over the vessel.         She
 would thus literally become a large extinguisher ; and it
 ,would be just as rational to insist that a man could live de
 prived of fresh air, as to assert that fire can continue to
 burn in the interior of a ship when every possibility of a
 fresh supply of air is thus cut off.
     Such is the general principle that ought to direct the pro
 ceedings of the officers and crew on everv emergency of this
 kind. They ought all to be drilled to the business, that
 every one may know the particular station and specific duty
  allotted to him in case of such an accident taking place.
  This would be an antidole against that confusion and in
  subordmation which almost always take place in case's of
  fire. The means are so infallibly certain in their effect,
  that not onlv the officers, but a great number of the men
 would have full confidence in the issue of their exertions ;
 this would insure firmness, and the unruly would be as ef
  fectually kept in order as on any common occasion.
     The general principle we have stated to be, the rutting
  off every possibility of a fresh snppli/ of atmospheric uir
 getting into the interior of the ship. But a still further ad
  vantage may be taken of the natural laws before examined',
  so as to hasten the destruction of the whole air contained in
  the ship, and to render it unfit for maintaining combustion.
  W   e have -already brought to recollection, that the larger the
  mass   of burning materials compared with the quantitv of
  air present, the sooner will the fire extinguish itself : (his it*
  a truth that cannot be too forcibly impressed on the mini]*
  both of the officers and crews ; for, however fiercely the
  fire may be raging below, the sooner will it be extinguished
  if they can only succeed in making every thiirg ait-light
   above decks and round the ship (as the ports, scuttles, scup
   pers, windows, &.c.) : the full conviction of this truth will
   prevent them from relaxing in their exertions, and wonder

                  for extinguishing   accidental Fires in Skips.              101
fully conduce to their ultimate    safety.  This is no small
advantage  that results from the law of nature now under
considertion ; but a further use ought still to be made of it.
If a number of fires he made between decks, by setting fire
to pitch and other inflammable substances in pots, stew-
pans, &c., before closing down the hatches and making
everv thing air-tight, the sooner will the air left in the vessel
be deprived of its oxygen, oiuI the combustion
                                                    of course be
terminated.
     Thus           that ^fihes mav tie emploved to ex
                   we see
tinguish      fike; and the more there are of them, the
sooner will all of them, as well as the prime fire, be ex
tinguished.     This is the more necesiary because, if      the         all
air in the interior of the vessel must expend itself in the
prime fire,      hole mav possibly be the consequence, and
                      a
there fresh air would rush in to maintain the flame       but      ;           a
number of fires in different parts of the vessel would quickly
destroy all the air, and render that accident impossible.    Jn
short,     the people be once made thoroughly masters of
              if
their duty in such cases, they need not fear even to kindle
fires on the bare boards for the purpose of extinguishing one
where they cannot reach         for the exclusion of fresh air
                                      it
                                       ;
will soon arrest the progress of the flames.
      If
      fears (groundless fears) should be entertained that such
fires would increase the danger, candles may be employed
with considerable eflVct.              A
                                 good sized candle consumes
about     gallon of air
              a             one minute of time: several hun
                                in
dreds of them lighted between decks, before closing all up,
0ould contribute not a little to exhaust the oxygen of the
atmosphere.      In short, proper receptacles for fires, to be
employed for this express purpose, should constitute        part     a
of the outfit of every ship, especially thoic of the royal navy
and East India companv.                If
                                such arrangements were made
a part  of  the system (they surely ought to be so), any fire
below decks might be extinguished in less tlian half an hour.
      need hardlv be remarked here, that in this case, as in
     It
eveKy case of danger, the foe should be opposed with firm
ness from post to post,               If
                               the lire breaks out in the hold,
the first stand should be made on the lower deck.         ought    It
instantly, and with deliberation, to be cleared, fore and aft,
that not chink or crevice mav escape observation. Every
                  a
opening, the pumps among others, ought to be closed, and
the officers and men to be at their stations.    This search

 cannot, at one and the same time, blow in opposite direc
 tions through the same aperture : therefore every scam should
 be examined ; nor will it be difficult to do so, when it is
 considered in what a close and substantial manner ships are
 built.
    While this is going on in the deck immediately above
 the fire, the officers and men on the next deck above should
 be preparing every thing for a second barrier to the ingress
 of air ; and so of the third deck : and each, before quitting
 their own deck, should light the extinguishing fires before
 recommended.        Similar fires should, if possible, be intro
 duced under the lower deck, the sooner to exhaust the air
 in the hold.
    If these means be cooly and deliberately pursued, when a
 ship is on fire below or between decks the flames may be as
 effectually extinguished as a burning candle when an extin
 guisher is put over it ; the ship, as we have alreadv said, is
 in fact converted into an extinguisher ; nor is she less so on
 account of the combustible nature of the materials of which
 she is constructed : for a cone made of paper extinguishes
a candle as effectually as one made of metal. A fact of
which any one may easily satisfy himself by making the
experiment.
    To discover when the conflagration is subdued, the test
of a candle should be employed. For this purpose there
ought to be a few places in each deck that can be opened
when necessary.        Into one of these introducea lantern and
candle, taking care instantly to close the hole again.          If
the candle, after remaining a few minutes below, is foun^
on being drawn up, to have been extinguished, it may be
concluded that all is safe, and that the air left is unfit for
maintaining combustion.         The people will then feci cheer
ful ; nor will they be impatient to open the decks when in
formed that, though the fire is out, some articles may have
attained such a high temperature, that the access of fresh
air might occasion a new deflagration.       Even when, by the
test of a candle, it is found that all the air is destroyed, the
precautions should be continued for a number of hours.
    (It will occur from w hat has been stated, that if there be
anv particular part of a ship where fires arc supposed to ori
ginate oftener than in any other, that part ought to be in
sulated, as it were, in the building of the vessel; that is,
every part of  it,  all round, ought to be caulked up so as to
make that room or apartment a'ir-tight, that, when an acci
dent occurs, no more might be necessary that} to close the
door or entrance, and caulk   it   up.)

      In
       the preceding remarks we have pointed out the prin
ciples that ought to be kept constantly in view iu every at
tempt to extinguish fire on board a ship.    That we might
not interrupt the connection we purposely avoided men
tioning another mean which it might he advisable to pro
vide against such accidents, and which depends on the same
principles.    The methods already laid down,          followed up            it'
with firmness, cannot fail to answer the purpose intended                                  ;
hut what we are going to mention would prove                  most                  a
powerful auxiliary.
   We have already noticed that the presence of oxygen in
combination with caloric       an indispensable requisite in the
                                     is
process of combustion, and that atmospheric air contains
these two ingredients in such         state of combination, and
                                                a
therefore serves to maintain combustion               giving up its      by
oxygen to the combustible bodv, in consequence of which
its caloric    liberated.
                   is          follows from this, that the sub

104       On the Means most proper to     be resorted to
more mischief, should a vessel of it by accident be broken
or spilt, than as muxh strong vinegar. No good objection
can therefore, be offered against its Use on the score of its
being dangerous.
   The chalk should be in powder, either in a dry state or
diffused in water, and the vessels containing it should be
so disposed and arranged in regard to those containing the
diluted oil of vitriol, that, without needing to hunt for and
arrange them in the hour of danger, (when the hurry and
alarm miejht make it impossible to get at them, or to make
a proper use of them whin found,) no more might be ne
cessary than to turn a cock, somewhere        near the cabin,
under the immediate eve of the commander or some intel
ligent officer, to allow the acid to convey itself through
leaden pipes into the vessels containing the chalk or lime
stone.
   The moment the sulphuric acid comes in contact with
the chalk, the latter will be decomposed   and part with the
carbonic acid, one of its constituent principles, which will
escape in the gaseous form, while the lime, its other prin
ciple, will remain united to the sulphuric acid.
   All the articles connected with this process should be
made of lead, or lined with         it,
                                   as the sulphuric acid exer
cises little or no action on that metal, which renders     it
                                                           pre
ferable to every other material for the purpose.
   The ways in which the parts of such an apparatus might
be arranged to advantage are so various, that to insist on
any one in particular    isunnecessary. The principle of the
arrangement    is all that  need be noticed here.   The vessel
or vessels containing the acid must be.    in ahigher situation
than those containing the chalk or unburnt lime.              The
latter may be  in   the hold, or    in
                                     any situation lower than  the
former; and pipes of communication, that can be opened or
shut at pleasure    by  turning     cock, as already mentioned,
                                    a
must pass from the vessels containing the acid to those in
which the chalk is.
   The latter, if  in the hold, should have perforated covers,
that the fixed air, when liberated from the limestone or
chalk    bythe action of the sulphuric acid, may have      a  free
escape.    If above any of the decks, hose or tube should
                                          a
pass from their tops down to the hold and lower decks for
the liberated gas to descend through.        These tubes should
be secured from injury         bycovering them with planks, or
casing them at the time ok their fitting up.
   Such an apparatus as   is here recommended would be found
mugh more simple than          can possibly appear to be from
                              it                                a

description, nor can any fire-engine that has ever yet been
constructed be compared with it in point of simplicity.
Still less will fire-engines bear comparison in point of effi
cacy; for the gas that may be liberated by this simple ap
paratus will infallibly extinguish flames,                but the water
thrown by a fire-engine seldom succeeds in doing so, and
often, as we have before proved on physical principles, in
creases their fury *.
     With a view to the application of the means for extin
guishing fires which we have pointed out, care ought to
be taken in future in the construction of ships, to fill up,
 at the decks, all the seams and Joinings between the side
 timbers, that an air-tight line of division may reach from
 the decks even to the outside planks, to prevent all passage
 of air behind the linings. But I shall not insist longer on
 this. The principles         f have laid down are sufficiently ob
 vious, and the only wonder is, that they have not been re
 sorted to before this time as a safeguard against fires below
 and between decks,
     As the minor details are perfectly obvious, and cannot
 fail to present themselves to the minds of those in whose
 department it may lie to give efficacy to the plan we have
 proposed, it would be carrying the present paper to an un
  necessary length to enter into them.              There is one point,
  however, that must not be overlooked, being connected
  with the     safety of the people : —
      After    the lire has been extinguished by the means that
  have been recommended, the air which remains in the inte
  rior of the vessel will be found as unfit for maintaining ani
  mal life    as  for maintaining combustion.          It would instantly
  suffocate those who should descend into it ; and consists of
  two non-iespirabje gases, azotic gas and fixed air. It would
  be unsafe, therefore, to venture down till after the vessel
  has been ventilated by opening the ports from the outside
  of the ship, and by means of bellows and leathern hose
  thrown down into the hold.              In short, any or all the ways
  now employed for ventilating ships may be employed to re
  move the foul air, and make it safe for the people to go down,
      • It is
              possible that in some cases a vessel may not be able to afford
  ro.im for a sufficiency of these materials to furnish a quantity of fixejl
   air equal in volume to her hold, and there may be other objections to
  taking so large a supply which have not occurred to me ; but as in a case
  of fire it may be necessary to stave the run) and brandy on board, as much
   oil of vitriol and chalk should always be provided as would furnibh a
   »tratum of fucd air ablu to rise a few inches at least over any spirits ;lmt
   may thua be staved into xhc hold.
                                                                            To

  106       On the Means most proper to le resorted to
     To determine when the air is sufficiently renewed to ad
 mit of this, a lantern with a burning candle should pre
 viously be let down at the end of a string.      If, after being
 allowed to remain below for some time, it come up unex
 tinguished, the people may venture down, — and so from
 deck to deck till they have got every part completely ven
 tilated.
     In the preceding observations I have confined myself to
 fires which may happen below or between docks; but as
 accidents (though this is perhaps less to be apprehended)
may also take place above decks, or below the quarter-deck,
 &c, where the same means cannot be employed for extin
 guishing them as in the former case, it may not be thought
 superfluous to offer   a few hints for subduing them when,
thev occur.
     It is obvious that the means adapted to accidents below
are inapplicable to such as may happen above decks ; but
it is equally obvious, that, whatever method may be resorted
to, it must agree in principle with the former.        A  wall of
separation must be interposed between the burning materials
and the atmosphere, or the fiames cannot be extinguished.
    Water, we have already seen, can but seldom be applied
with effect for this purpose ; and the experience of ages has
only served to furnish evidence that it ought not to be trusted
to.     By its great volatility and its extreme liquidity (even
if  it could not be decomposed, and so add to the conflagra
tion, as it has already been proved to do,) it is but little
fitted to remain on the places where its presence might be
serviceable.
    Some other matters, therefore, ought to be provided, that
may, when employed, be able to serve as an effectual co~
vering to the burning ?ua/erials, or to the subjacent parts of
the vessel, to prevent the fire from penetrating downwards.
They ought to be such as can be met with in every port,
and at the cheapest rate : such are sand, or mould, or clay.
    The first is perhaps the best, because it can be moistened
with water in a moment ; though the last, if means could be
insured for speedily converting it into a kind of soft pap or
puddle, would answer better tor throwing upon such burn
ing parts as may be vertical or over head.
    Everv ship carries some ballast, or might carry as much
as would be necessary for the end in view.         A part of the
ballast ought to be sand or clay, in bags or in small casks,
and these ought to be so disposed in the hold, that, in the
             *                                               case

          for extinguishing accidental Fires in Ships.     107
case   of a fire above decks, they may be easily got at, and
taken up.     A  number of buckets should also be provided
that the people may not be without the means of hoisting
up the sand, &c. even when the ricging takes fire and pre
vents them from employing a tackle for that purpose.
    The sand, as brought up, should be thrown upon the
burning materials, especially on those on the deck. Where-
ever it rests it will instantly extinguish the flames by pre
venting the access of atmospheric air. In fact, the whole
deck, especially near the spot on fire, should be covered
¦with sand to the depth of three inches, which will be much
more easily accomplished than at first may appear possible;
for the people have only to begin at the side of the fire next
to them, covering the deck before them with sand, and
spreading it with shovels, — thus making a road for them
selves to advance upon, still covering more of the deck as
they advance; an advantage that cannot be commanded by
the use of mere water. By these means, even where the
deck has been absolutely on fire, the flames will be so effec
 tually extinguished that the people may instantly ivalk over
 the place with perfect safety.
     This will enable them to gain upon the fire, and with
 mops (especially if a clay puddle instead of water be em
 ployed) to dash out the flames on such parts of the sides
 (under the quarter-deck for instance) or over head as may
 have caught fire.     Let it be particularly observed, that if
 means can be found to enable the people (sand, &c, would
 enable them) to advance on the flames, in that case mops
 with water, or rather water mixed with clay or sand, applied
 directly to the burning wood, Sec, beginning at the part on
 fire immediately next to them, and proceeding step by step,
 will extinguish flame better tlian water thrown from a fire-
 engine.    The reason is obvious : water so thrown on runs
 off by the most direct course it can find, and will not stop
 to spread itself over prominences or to penetrate into inter
 stices; but when dashed on by means of mops, it has no
  choice, but must apply itself where it is intended it should.
     I do not mean by this that a fire-engine ought in no case
 to be employed ; but when resorted to, its jet should be di
  rected forward further than the people can yet advance, and
 never in such a manner as to wash away the bed of sand
  from the decks, or the coating of sand or clay that has been
  applied by mops to the uprights and parts over head.     And
  the moment the people can advance to apply mops, the en
  gine should be stopt.
     In mopping, the process should go on from the lower'
                                                          parts,

108            On ilie Means most proper to be resorted to
 parts upwards ; there will then be the least waste of labour,
 and consequently the greater chance of success : for when
 a contrary mode is followed (which is always more or less
 the case with water thrown on by an engine) the parts ex
 tinguished are again rekindled by the flames ascending from
 the lower parts, and which therefore ought first to be sub
 dued.
    Clay or sand is recommended to be applied with the water
 employed in mopping, thai a kind of incrustation may be
formed wherever the mops are applied ; but in attending to
 this, the uniform continuity of the bed of sand, distributed
 and still distributing on the deck, must be carefully main
 tained ; for this is the chief ultimate security that the men
 have for saving the hull of the vessel, and consequently their
 own lives.
    The red-hot balls employed by the garrison of. Gibraltar
 to destroy the Spanish floating batteries, were carried from
 the furnaces to the bastions in wooden barrows with only a
 layer of sand interposed', and this was found sufficient to
prevent the balls, though in a high statu of incandescence,
from setting fire to the wood. A fact so notorious renders
 it perfectly unnecessary to insist further on the efficacy of
 sand on the upper deck to prevent the descent of the fire
 from above.
    As to the rigging, there appears but little hope of any
 means being ever devised to secure it effectually from the
 effects of a fire above decks, and perhaps the least evil will
 result from clearing it away in such a case, and getting it
 overboard as fast as possible.    I shall, however, venture to
 hint at one improvement. The hull is sheathed with copper
 as a guard against the worm. — Would there be any thing
 absurd in sheathing the masts with copper to preserve them
 from fire ? I think not : and the expense would be no ob
ject*. In that case an iron or copper chain (composed of
 very long links to make it require the less weight of metal)
 should accompany each main-stay, to secure the masts in
 any case when the other rigging might be destroyed by fire.
 The chains, of course, would require to be less tight than
 the stays, that they might only act in case of the other being
destroyed.
    All the upper works ought to be covered with sheet cop
 per to secure the side timbers from being set on fire by any
      * This
          could be done without increasing the weight ofths masts; for
the copper would add so considerably to their strength, that they might
b,tnude mtich. smaller than at present.
                                                             accident

          for extinguishing accidental Fires  in Ships.      loQ
accident that may happen above the upper deck.              This
would effectually answer the cud intended ; for as to those
parts where cross timbers of any kind join the side, and
where consequently the fire might communicate, they could
individmdhj be extinguished in succession, by the means we
have pointed out, with much less trouble than if all the
upper works were exposed to the accident.
    But, though we recommend sheet copper as a covering
for the upper works, which surely ought to be as well se
cured against fire as the lower are against the worm and
against water, even if this improvement be not adopted, the
means we have pointed out (wet sand, wet mould, and wet
clay,) should be provided to enable the people to extinguish
the parts in detail till they master the fire; which in many
cases they will be able to accomplish when the application
of water would not be of the smallest avail. I need hardly
add, that when any part of the cargo consists of articles
that will of themselves, by the aid of an increased tempera
ture, furnish a sufficient supply of oxygen to maintain comv
bustion without the aid of atmospheric air, '(as for instance
saltpetre,) such part of the cargo should be disposed low in
 the hold, and should, if possible, be cut off from all com
 munication with the other parts of the lading, that, should
 a (ire happen, there may be the less chance of its being
 communicated to that part of the cargo.        For this purpose
 a part of the hold should be set aside, and ought to be
 boarded up, caulked, and covered with sheet cdpper.           If
 that cannot be done, a false flooring should be laid in above
 that part of the cargo, which should be covered over with
 coarse matting of any kind : over the matting there ought
 to be a layer of sand or earth of two or three inches in thick
 nest, and over the sand another cover of matting, to pre
 vent it from being displaced by the stowing of the rest of
 the cargo.
     But whether such arrangements are practicable respect
 ing the oxygenous parts of the cargo or not, the other ge
 neral precautions ought to be strictly enjoined, and the
 people should be appomted and trained to their respective
 duties in case of fire: books of instructions should also be
 profuselv distributed among the officers and crews, and
 these instructions ought to be drawn up in a manner so
 plain and simple that no one may be at a loss to know what
  is necessary to be done, wliether lie understand the scientific

    The areca-tree            that beautiful palm which Linnaeus has so
                              is

    great   number      of  authors,       no less certain

       This tree     is called pakmarou in almost all the languages

       Its foliage presents an agreeable spectacle              the regular by
    arrangement of its palms, which are known in botany                                     by
    the name of spadix, to characterize their form, and in ge*
    neral that of the branches of this family.                The palms in
                                                                                        the,

                     and the Areca-nut Tree.                  Ill
the centre of the crown of the areca-nut tree, to the number
of seven or eight, stand erect, while the rest, being five
in number, incline, rounding themselves by a slight curva
ture, and by their union form a kind of elegant crown.
The leaves of the areca-nut tree, as long as they vegetate,
are of a rich and brilliant green colour ; the eye can Behold
them without being fatigued : as they grow old they assume
successively an orange colour, which, though it contrasts
with the brilliant green of the other leaves, does not offend
 the sight.
    This palm exhibits, as a distinguishing character, very
small flowers of a pale apple green colour, with a sweet
and agreeable odour, monoecous,         disposed in a panicle in
closed in a very thin spath or sheath like that of the coco
nut tree, which differs from it only by its thickness, and by
the other being fibrous.      Each of these flowers consists of
a calyx half a line in length, with three acute and coria
ceous points ; a corolla of three petals perfectly similar to
the calyx.     The male flowers have six and sometimes nine
stamina not projecting, and the female an upper ovarium
furnished with three styles.        The male are placed along
small twigs proceeding from a common pedicle which form
the panicle. They are parted from each other in groups of
 five or six ; in these intervals is the group of female flowers
 consisting of from nine to ten. The fruit are all set before
 the spath opens.
    It is seen by this exact description that most naturalists
are deceived, or at least have implicitly believed and mutu
 allv copied each other, instead of making observations be
fore they wrote.       I shall make known the rest of their
 errors as circumstances furnish me with an opportunitv.
These facts, though apparently of little importance in re
 gard to a vegetable which we do not possess, are, however,
 interesting to botany ; and this consideration alone has in
 duced me to indulge in this kind of critique, for which I
 hope I shall be forgiven, as it tends to promote iruth.
    The areca-nut tree, as well as all the other palms, are re
produced only by the fruit : to thrive, it requires good soil,
 and this is a character which distinguishet the coco-nut tree
 from vegetables of this family; it needs less watering, but
 it requires much more air, and the full enjoyment of the
 rays of the sun, without which its vegetation would only
 languish.
     Some plants which I cultivated in a large garden, and
 beneath which I caused animals to be interred, produced
 much more than usual ; yet this increase of fecundity did
                                                              not

   1 12          Natural History of the    Coeo-nut   Tree
  not seem to hurt or exhaust them.           I shall here observe,
  that I obtained the    same   results in the cultivation of orange
  and lemon trees, vegetables which we have naturalized in
  our climates.
      The areca-nuts are planted in beds, with their husk or
  fibrous covering, one by one, in holes rive or six inches in
  depth, and at the distance of twelve or fourteen inches in
  every direction.     The plantation is slightly watered.
      On the twenty-ninth or thirtieth day the germ issues from
  the earth : in form it is similar to that of the coco-nut, but
  it differs from it by its hardness, and by an acrid or sour
  taste.
      They    are generallv transplanted in a year or fifteen
 months     :  they may be removed without danger even in
  the seventh year, because they arc exceedingly lively, and
 expand very slowly. Their total duration, however, is only
 fifty or sixty years ; they never go beyond the seventieth.
 Of all the pal ins it is the shortest lived. This forms a con
 trast with the slowness of its vegetation, and particularly
 with the hardness of its wood, which is surpassed only by
 that of the sindi, called by Linnaeus lonlarus.           This palm
 has given its name to the river which separates Hindostan
 from Persia, and which, copying the Greeks, we have dis
 figured by the denomination of the Indus.
     As the palms of the areca-tree are not above eight or nine
 feet long, they can give only a shade of a moderate extent,
 and which it would appear could not hurt the plants cultivated
 in the same ground ; but experience proves that this shade,
though it cover only a small surface, is hurtful, and would
certainly occasion the destruction of the most of those ve
getables over which it extends : neither men nor animals
ever remain under its immediate shelter, especially during
 the strong heats.      Its foliage is so thick that the sun's ravs
can never penetrate it ; the rain water, therefore, vvnich falls
on its palms is thrown off; they form a real parapluie.
     Though this tree be one of the most beautiful ornaments
of gardens, there are few worse neighbours : it attracts all
the adjacent juices ; and herbs, as already said, cannot ve
getate under its shade. The different kinds of banana, how
ever, called commonly the Indian fig, known in botany
under the name of vnna, thrive when planted in the same
soil, provided they arc not brought too near to the areca-nut
tree.     I shall add, that I saw at Nigambo, a maritime town
in the island of Ceylon, an immense orchard of areca-trees,
among which were cultivated coffee shrubs which appeared
to me to thrive, as they were exceedingly beautiful.

                    and the Areca-nut Tree.                   1)?
    An orchard of areca-trees,     between    which the Hindoos
almost always plant bananas, exhibits a charming and dcr
lightful prospect. To form a just idea of such a spectacle,
it must be seen.
    The arcca-nut, of which we make no use, might, in
my opinion, become an advantageous object of exchange
in some of the African markets. This fruit might be ren
dered useful also in Europe in regard to the arts, as I shall
hereafter show.
    The leaves of this palm arc fit only for being burnt. The
ashes which arise from them produce good manure when
mixed with the clung of sheep or of cows. They give also
bv Iixiviation a kind of soda, employed for bleaching raw
silk. This manure is used with great advantage in the cul
tivation of the anil, or plant which produces indigo.
    The trunk, which is exceedingly straight, is employed
for rafters to sheds and houses winch have pent roofs; it is
also split into excellent laths, which arc very strong, and
never liable to be pierced by worms.        A pectoral and anti
scorbutic decoction is extracted from the flowers.
    The nut or fruit is of different sizes, and of an oval form,
spherical or turbinated, according to the species to which it
belongs.     The lamest nuts do not exceed the size of a large
pigeon's egg.     The bunches generally contain a hundred
and fifty; and when the number rises to two hundred and'
fifty, which is sometimes the case, they are thinned from
time to time for the use of persons who set no value oh
these nuts unless when they are fresh.
    The areca-trec begins to produce fruit in its seventh
year; but it is never in full bearing till the age of ten.
Vigorous trees give annually six, seven, and sometimes teh
bunches.
    The Hindoos, as well as all the people of Asia from
Arabia to China, make a general use of the artca-nut along,
with the leaves of betel, which by some nations is called
tmnloiil, and by the Moguls pane. This aromatic plant is
so well known that it is needless to describe it : I shall
therefore confine myself to giving some details respecting
its use, and the properties ascribed to it.
    Betel acts a distinguished part in all companies : at
courts as well as in the towns, and even in the most
wretched hovels, to be deprived of it would to the Indians
be a misfortune.     At all visits betel is served up ; and when
 friends meet they mutually offer to each other this drug.
The Hindoos consider it as a great uncivility to speak to a
person of dignity or consideration without chewing this
    Vol. 21. No. 62. March 1605.          H'             mixture:

114               Natural History of the Coco-nut           Tree
mixture     : it is composed     of the betel leaves, areca cut vety
thin,    a little lime spread over the leaves, cardamom, fine
spiceries, and cachou, rolled up in small cornets in a leaf
of betel. The Indians ascribe to this preparation, which
gives to the saliva and lips a very bright rose colour, the
propcrtv of allaying hunger, perfuming the breath by cor
recting the humours of the breast and stomach, and of fa
cilitating digestion.        This mastication, in their opinion,
prevents also perspiration, or speedily restores it; preserves
from megrim and pains of the head ; strengthens the gums,
and secures the teeth from rottenness : in a word, it inspires
gaiety, removes spasms and attacks of the nerves, prevents
suppression of the menses, and maintains the tone of the
fibres. According to my experience, all these ideas are well
founded.
    That substance which we call cachou and the Indians
catecamhc, of which the Portuguese have made catvcambrS,
a word adopted by all the Europeans, though corrupted, is
the inspissated juice of the areca-nut.             Naturalists have
entertained       a variety of opinions on this object of natural
 history.       In speaking of this drug, which has many pro
perties    with    which we are unacquainted, I shall endeavour
to remove all uncertainty by making known the process for
 preparing        it,
                    and the manner in which the Hindoos extract
 that concrete juice of the areca known under the name of
cachou.       The process, as saw      I  practised in different parts

                     and the Areca-nut Tree.                   115
After strong ebullition of two hours,     the fire is lessened till
 it is nearly extinguished, and it is then kept at that degree
for five or six hours.      When the pot is completely cold, it
is unluted, and the areca is taken out with a large shovel
           with holes ; after which it is suffered to drain on a
  mrdle of bamboo. The Hindoos in this operation use only
Eiierced
utensils of wood, on account of the sour quality of this nut.
When the pieces have been well drained, they are exposed
to the sun. This kind of areca, which the inhabitants of
the upper part of Hindostan, where this palm is not found,
call chikui-soupari, that is to say, gummy areca, is preferred
in the use of betel to the raw nut.
    The whole aqueous part is evaporated over a slow fire till
the juice is inspissated to the. consistence of an extract, and
till it has such adhesion that it can be held in the hand. It
is then taken out to be formed, by kneading, into small
pieces as large as the fist, which are dried in the shade that
they may not crack and break.
    These pieces in several of the dialects of Hindostan are
called batai, a word to which is joined that of cambe ; so
that the whole signifies a lump of the juice of the areca.
    The catecambre, to use the expression generally employed
by the Europeans, though faulty, receives a preparation at
Goa, Batavia, and Macao, which we endeavour to imitate.
The Portuguese call it cachonde, from which we have made
the word cacliou.      It is obtained in these places by com
bining    the catecambre  with a proportional quantity of sugar,
cinnamon, coco-nut milk, musk, and sometimes a very
small quantity of essence of roses.
    This paste of the cachotide is of a black colour, and has a
sweet perfume : it is formed into square tablets of different
sizes, and is a very important object of commerce to the
town of Goa.        The European women, habituated to the
use of betel, and the Mogols, prefer it to crude cachou or
catecambre.      The Hindoos make no use of it : they employ
only the latter, alter having purified it with the betel, either
as a topic or internally.
    Catecambre is useful in many arts, and even in medicine,
in which it is employed on various occasions.
    The condensed juice of the areca inspissated with gum-
ben, furnishes a very good resin, which the fishermen em
ploy for the preservation of their nets and fishing-lines.      It
preserves wood from worms.
    It is used with astonishing success for burns, against
apthae, and in general all kinds of ulcers and fungous ex
crescences ; in a word, for deafness, by' diluting it with

   of this    remedy  lias been proved to me by repeated experi
   ments.      In a word, all the medical properties of this sub
   stance, when taken internally, are so well known to the
   Europeans that it is needless to enumerate them. The
   Hindoos, who ascribe to it the same virtues, apply it to the
   same purpose.
      Artists who paint cotton cloth, and dyers, employ it
   with great advantage for several purposes relative to' their
   arts.    The former use it as the base of the composition oi
   a gum varnish, which they
                                  apply to those parts of the cloth
   which are not to be painted. To explain this process it i*
   necessary to observe, that the painters of chintz do not use
   blocks for imprinting the colours ; they aid applied with a
   brush, nr the cloth receives the red and blue colours by im
   mersion ; a method of working very different from that oi.
   the Europeans, and of which we have no idea.         I am con
   vinced of what I advance, cither by visiting our manufac
   tories, or reading the works which treat of this art in our
   country, and which speak of the processes used in India.
   I have examined in particular the jlnnalai (hs Arts et des
'
   Maiuifacturef*, where it is said "that the Indians apply
   the red colour, by immersing the cloth first in a mordant,
  'Sec." This is not correct ; for this colour is always applied,
   as I have raid, by immersion, and warm.         It is very sur
   prising that we should have ideas so incorrect on the me
   thods and processes used in the arts bv these people, for
   more than three centuries that we have had an opportunity
   of being better acquainted with them.
       It is with the eatecanibre also that they compose the
   mordant which fixes on cloth the gold and silver leaf ap
   plied to it. This kind of chintz is made at MaZulipatnam ;
   and it is impossible to describe the richness, elegance, and
   strength of this work.      These cloths may be washed with-
   out hurt to the gilding, in the same manner as the other
   Indian stuffs are washed without iufnring the brilliancy of
   the colours.      This art is valuable, and we have not at
   tempted to imitate it. The dyers extract also from the eate
   cambre, combined with the juice of other plants, lilac mor-
   dore, puce, and maroon colours, which are employed for
   dyeing silk, woollen, and cotton stuffs.
       It is employed with such success in the art of tanning,
   that in five days leather is perfectly tanned and prepared.
   The English, for some years past, brinu' it from India for
   their tanneries : they use it with great advantage in order
   to simplify their labour and to improve their leather.

            Langev,      Esq. of tlit Islund of Guernsey *.
JEaklv         in March 1803, I observed my winter's stock of
potatoes, which I had dug in October 1802, sprouted from
the mildness of the weather in this island : it occurred to
me, that, by puttin>r them under ground, vegetation might
be retarded.         I accordingly took indiscriminately from my
pile    about    three  dozen, and in my court,yard dug a hole
two feet and a half deep, under the protection of a south
west wall, where the rays of the sun prevail for a few mi
nutes only during the day at any season of the year; then,
with three pantiles, one at bottom, I laid most of the po
tatoes in the hole, and placed the other two tiles over them
in form of the roof of a house: they not containing all, I
threw the remainder carelessly into the hole (having no great
 confidence in my experiment), covering the place over to its
 usual level.        Business calling me from home during part
 of the summer, I neglected looking after mv small deposit :
 but, on the 21st of January 1804, nearly eleven months
 after covering them, I had the curiosity to examine them ;
 when, to my astonishment, 1 found them (two or three
 excepted,        which were perforated by. the ground-worm,
 though firm) all perfectly sound, without having in the
 least vegetated, and in everv respect lit for the purpose of
 sets and the use of the table, as I have boiled a few, and
 found them similar in taste and flavour to new potatoes.                  I
 further pledge myself that they were perfectly firm.               I have
 still some ot them bv me, for the inspection of my friends,
  who all agree with me that they are so.

      I have      received the favour of your letter of the 7th inst.
 conveying the thanks of the society, for my experiments in
 the preservation of potatoes, which is highlv gratifying to
 my fcclinus. I avail myself of the opportunity of a friend
 going to Condon, to send three of the potatoes as a con
 firmation of their being fit for sets, as they are actually
 sprouting.         1 have still a few left, which I shall plant.
     The potatoes I send, I pledge myself to you are of the
 growth of 1602, when I first dug them out of the ground :

 XVIII.      Processes    for preparing Lake from Madder.             By
                   Sir H. C.     Knglefield, Bart.*
  -The want of a durable          red colour, which should possess
 something of the depth          and transparency of the lakes macie
 from cochineal, first induced me to try whether the madder
 root, which is well known to furnish a dye less subject to
 change by exposure to air than any other vegetable colour,
 except indigo,       might not produce something of the colour
 I wanted.
    Several of the most eminent painters of this country have,
 for some time, been in the habit of using madder lakes in
 oil pictures ; but the colours they possessed under this name
 were either a yellowish red, nearly of the hue of brickdust,
 or a pale pink opake, and without clearness or depth of
 tint, and quite unfit to be used in water-coloured, drawing,
 which was the principal object of my search.
    My first attempts were to repeat the process given by
 Margraf in the memoirs of the Academy of Berlin ; but
 the colour produced by this mode was of a pale red, and
 verv opake, although the eminent author of the process
 states the colour he produced to be that of " ie sang en-
famme," which probably means a deep blood colour. It
 may, however, be observed, that colours prepared with a
 basis of alumine will appear much deeper when ground in
 oil than they do in the lump, the oil rendering the alumine
 nearly transparent.          This advantage is, however, lost in
 water colours,        Qn examining the residuum of the madder

 root, after it had been treated in Margraf's method, it
 appeared tinged with so rich a red, that it was obvious that
 by tar the greater part of ths colour still remained in                 it,
and that the most powerful and beautiful part.           To extract
 this, several ineffectual trials were made, which           would
                                                               it
be useless to enter into   ;   but, on attentively examining the
appearances which took place on infusing the madder in
water,   f   began to suspect that the red colouring matter was
very   little,if   at all, soluble in water, and that     was only
                                                          it
mechanically       mixed   with  the  water when    poured on the
root, and suspended       in
                          it        the mucilage, with which the
                                   by
root abounds.
   A very small quantity, therefore, can be obtained           any  by
infusion or decoction, as the greater part sinks down on
the root, or remains with          iton the sieve, or in the bag,
through which the infusion or decoction         ispassed to render
it clear.     I therefore was induced to try whether,           by
                                                             some
merely mechanical means,           could not separate the colour
                                   I
ing matter from the fibrous part of the root. In this at .
tempt my success was fully equal to my hopes             and, after
                                                          ;
several trials,   I  consider the process   I  am now about to
describe, as the most perfect       Ihave been able to discover.
                               Process 1.
    Enclose two ounces, troy weight, of the finest Dutch
madder, known in commerce bv the name of crop madder,
in   a  bag capable of containing three or four times that
quantity, and made of strong and fine calico.          Put    into
                                                                it
a  large marble or porcelain mortar, and pour on             about
                                                               it
a  pint of cold soft water. The Thames water, when filtered,
is  as good as can be used     ; being verv nearly as pure as
                                   it
distilled water, at least when taken up         a very little way
above London.       With marble or porcelain pestle, pres9
                           a
the bag strongly in every direction, and, as        were, rub and
                                                     it
pound    itas much as can \s: done without endangering the
hag.     The water will very soon be loaded with the colour
ing   matter, so as to he quite opake and muddy.          Pour olT
the water, and add another pint of fresh water to the root,
agitating and triturating   it    the manner before described
                                   in                                    ;
and repeat the operation till the water comes off the root
very slightly tinged. About five pints of water,         will agi
                                                          if
tated and rubbed, will extract from the root nearly the
whole of its colour   ; and     the residual root be taken out
                               if
of the bag and dried,      itwill be found to weigh not more
than five drachms apothecaries weight       ;its colour will be          a
kind of light nankeen, or cinnamon, and             will have en-

bason, and an ounce troy weight of alum dissolved in about
a    pint of boiling soft water must be poured into                    it,
                                                                     and
 stirred until           thoroughly mixed.
                        it   is                    About an ounce and
a   half of saturated solution of mild vegetable alkali should
                a
 be gently poured in, stirring the whole well all the time.
A    considerable effervescence will take place, and an imme
 diate precipitation of the colour.              The whole should be
 suffered to stand till cold         and the clear yellow liquor may
                                        ;
 then be poured off from the red precipitate. A quart of
boiling soft water should again be poured on                     it,
                                                               and well
 stirred. When cool, the colour may be separated from the
 liquor        by
               filtration through paper in the usual way; and
boiling water should be poured on                   in the filter till
                                                        it                      it
 passes through of          light straw colour, and quite free from
                                  a
 any alkaline taste.       The colour may now be gently dried                   ;
 and when quite dry           will be. found to weigh half an ounce
                                   it                                           ;
just fourth part of the weight of the madder employed.
           a
     By analysis, this colour possesses rather more than 40
 per cent, of alumine.           If less than an ounce of alum be
employed with two ounces of madder, the colour will be
 rather deeper but      ;     less than three quarters of an ounce
                                   if
be used,    the   whole   of   the colouring matter will not be com
bined with alumine.             On the whole,        consider the pro
                                                        I
portion     of   an  ounce    of  alum   to   two ounces  of madder, as
the best.

   Tf, when the solution of alum        added to the water
                                                       is
loaded with the colouring matter of the root, the whole be
suffered to stand, without the addition of the alkali,  con            a
siderable precipitation will take place, which will be of                       a
dark dull red.   The remaining liquor,    again heated, will,
                                                        if
 by the addition of the alkali, produce   rose-coloured pre a

   This     the process recommended bv Mr. Watt,
               is                                          his             in

this Liter colour     what may, perhaps with propriety, he

excellent for many purposes, yet I consider the colour pro
duced by the union of the two colouring matters, as given
in the first process, as far preferable for general use, being
of a very beautiful hue when used thin, and possessing un
rivalled depth and richness either in oil or water, when laid
on in greater bod v.
   If but half an ounce of alum be added to the two ounces
ef the root, the first precipitate will be nearly similar to
that when an ounce is employed; but the second, or lake
precipitate, will be less in quantity, and of a deeper
and richer tint.   In this case the whole of the colouring
matter, as before observed, is certainly not combined with
the alumine ; for, on adding more alum to the remaining
liquor, a precipitate is obtained of a light purplish red. In
this process^ when two ounces of madder and an ounce of
alum are used,, the first precipitate has about 20 per cent,
of alumine, and the second, or lake precipitate, about 53
per cent. ; but these proportions will vary a little in repcti*
tions of the process.
                                       Process 3.
  If  the madder, instead of being washed and triturated
with  cold  water, as directed in the foregoing process, be
treated in exacily the same manner with boiling water, the
colour obtained will be rather darker, but scarcely of so
good a tint ; and the residuum of the root, however care-
fully pressed and washed, will retain a strong purplish hue ;
a full proof that some valuable colour is retained in      pro            it,
bably fixed in the woody fibre                   by
                                      the action of heat.  Mr.
Watt,    inhis excellent Treatise on Madder above mentioned,
observes, that cold water extracts the colour better than hot

 1 t2     Processes for preparing Luke from Madder.
 with cold water, &c. exactly as directed in the first process,
 the red colouring matter will quit the foot with much greater
 ease than before fermentation. It will also be equal in quan
 tity to that afforded by the first process, but of a much
 lighter red. This difference of lint appears to be owing to
 a destruction of a part of the lake by the fermentation of
 the root ; for if the colours from the fermented root be ob
 tained separate, as in Process 2, the first precipitate will
 not sensibly differ from that obtained from the unfermentcd
 madder, but the second, or lake, will be of a very light
 pink.   This process, then, is not to be recommended.
                 Spanish and Smyrna Madders.
    Spanish madder affords a colour of rather a deeper tone
 than the Dutch madder, but it does not appear to be of so
 pure a red as the Zealand crop madder.
    The Smyrna madder is a very valuable root. The colour
 produced from it by Process 1, is of a deeper and richer tint
 than any I have obtained from the Dutch madder. The
 quantity produced from two ounces is only three drachms
 twenty-four grains : but ibis is not to be wondered at; for
 as this madder is imported in the entire root in a dry state,
 and the crop madder of Zealand consists principally of the
 baik, in which probably the greatest part of the colouring
 substance resides, there is every reason to think that the
 Smyrna madder really contains a greater proportion of co
lour than the Zealand in equal weights of the entire root.
    The products of Process 2, prove that the lake of the
Smyrna madder is more abundant in quantity and of a
richer tone than that of the Dutch root ; for, from two ounces
of Dutch madder the first precipitate was two drachms, ai d
the lake was two drachms ana forty-eight grains; where
as, from two ounces of the Smyrna root the first precipitale
was one drachm and twenty-four grains, and the lake was
two drachms and twenty- four grains. The proportion of
the lake to the other colour is therefore much higher in the
Smyrna than in the Dutch root.
                         Fresh Madder.
    The colour may be prepared from the recent        root; and
it will be of a quality equal, if not superior,   to any other.
The difficulty or procuring the fresh root has    prevented me
from making as many experiments on it as I could have
wished.     I procured, however, a small quantity of the best
roots packed in moss from Hollaud, and the following
process answered    perfectly well.
                                                          Eight

            Processes      for preparing Lake from Madder.            1 23
   Eight outlets of the root, having been first well washed
and cleaned from dirt of all kinds, were broken inte small
pieces, and pounded in a bell-metal mortar, with a wooden
pestle, till reduced into an uniform paste. This paste being
inclosed in a calico bag, was washed and triturated, as de
scribed  in the first process, with cold water.  About five
       seemed to have extracted nearly the whole of the co-
 uur. To the water thus loaded with colour, and boiled a*
flints
before, one ounce of alum, dissolved in a pint of boilinir
water, was added, and the alkali poured on the whole till
the taste of the mixture was just perceptibly alkaline. The
colour thus obtained, when dry, was of a very beautiful
quality.
  The    success of this experiment, which was twice re
peated   with the same result, has led me to hope that it is
not impossible that the mode of obtaining the colour from
the fresh root here described, may be productive of advan
tages for more extensive use than I had in view when first I
attempted to obtain a pigment from madder.            Many tracts
of land in this country are as well adapted to the growth of
this valuable article as the soil of Holland can be; and the
cultivation of       it,
                     which has more than once been attempted
to a   considerable   extent, has been laid aside, principally
from the expense attendant on the erection of drying-homes
and mills, and the great expense and nicety requisite for
conducting the process of drying.        But should the colour
prepared in the mode just described be found to answer the
purposes of the dyers and calico-printers, the process           so is
easy, and the apparatus required for          so little expensive,
                                              it
that   it might be in the power of any grower of the root to
extract  the colour    besides which, another great advantage
                           :
would be obtained       the colour thus separated from the root
                            ;
niav he kept any length of time without danger of spoiling,
and its carriage would be only one-fourth of that of the
root,     Iam, moreover, thoroughly inclined to believe, that
in the present mode of usine; the root,         very considerable
                                                 a
part of the colour      left in
                            is   oy the dyers
                                    it           and, should this
                                                   ;
prove to be the case, an advantage much greater than any
hitherto adverted to may arise from the process here recom
mended.
   Should      be attempted to obtain the colour from the fresh
              it
root, on an extensive scale,        should recommend that the
                                         T
 root be first reduced to as uniform        pulp as possible,

grinding or pounding.        To this purpose       it    is
                                                     probable that
 the cider-mill would answer perfectly well and its extreme

  trituration, bags of woollen, such as are used in the oil-mill,,
  would probably answer as well as calico, and they would
  be much cheaper and more durable.          A large vat, with,
  stampers, would be easilv constructed, by those who are
  conversant in mechanics, for the holding them and pressing,
 them in water; and when the colour was boiled and preci
  pitated, the flues of the boilers might easily be formed into
 convenient drying-tables, without any additional expense of
 fuel.    The part of the process which 1 consider as of the
 greatest importance, and as being the essential advantage of
 my methods over all those which have comc to my know
 ledge, is the trituration or pressing of the root in water;
 and I believe that the colouring matter of the root has not
 been hitherto considered    as so nearly insoluble in water as
 I have reason to think it is.
     It were much to be wished that in the present advanced
 state of chemistry some skilful analyser would investigate
 the properties of this very useful root, in which perhaps it
 will be found that there are three, if not four, different co
louring suhstances.       Such are the processes and views,
which I have thought it not improper to submit to the con
 sideration of the Society of Arts, &c.
     I have only now to describe the specimens which accom-.
pany this paper; assuring the society that they have been
all prepared by my own bands entirely, and that I am
therefore responsible for their having, been produced by the
processes slated, without the addition of any foreign matter
whatever, excepting the cake ground up with gum, and
the bladder of oil-colour, which were prepared from the
colour which I gave him, by Mr. Newman, of Soho-square,,
whose skdl and fidelity are too well known to need any tes
timony in their favour.
    It may be proper to add, that all the colours produced,
from the Dutch madder were prepared from the same parcel
of crop madder, in order that the differences in them might
proceed from the processes, and not from a variation in the
qualities of the root, which, in different specimens, will
produce different shades of colour under the same mode of
treatment.

       DEAR SIR,
   I  havk the honour to inclose you the following remarka
   ble case cured by the inhalation of vital air.
         A   Deviation from the common Course              of Nature.
      Marv Tame,        aet.  16,    residing at No. 17, East-street,
   when fourteen years of         age, instead of being regular in the
   usual vvav, had a copious discharge of blood from both
   breasts.      These discharges, for nearly the space of two
  years   after,   came on regularly once a fortnight, or three
  weeks, attended with violent pains in the back and loins,
   and continued the regular period of three days.               The quan
  tity of blood so discharged was about the same as under the
  usual circumstances.          It distilled gradually from the nip
  ples as milk from an overloaded breast, but without pain.
  At this period the face appeared turgid with blood. I wit
  nessed mvself this discharge of blood from the breasts, and
  have no doubt of the reality of so extraordinary a pheno
  menon.       Having first invited the blood from the superior
  to the inferior parts by aloetic cathartics, I next ordered the
  inhalation of vital air with tonics ; and this phenomenon
  has not again occurred, it is now four months.
             Observations    on this Case     hj Dr. Thornton.
     1. Each part of the body obeys its adapted stimulus
 learned from experience. Thus the eye is stimulated by light,
 the ear by sound, the stomach by food ; and the most dif
 fusible stimulus is the oxygen in the arterial blood.                Thus,
 if the liquid in the bladder escape into the cavity of the
  abdomen, it excites the highest derangement, although a
 proper stimulus to that reservoir.              Thus, if water, or even
 milk, be injected into the veins in a small portion, accord
 ing to the quantity is the derangement of the frame; and if
jalap or emet*c tartar be injected into the circulation, each
will be determined to the respective organs, as though they
had been received into the stomach and bowels.                      Thus it
is, that rhubarb and aloes stimulate the lower parts of the
 intestinal tube, especially the rectum, inviting the blood to
 the aorta descenduns.
                                                                 .
                                                                    2.  Tbt

   2. The blood, being then properly propelled throughout
the whole frame, whose energies were increased by bark,
serpentaria, myrrh, and afterwards steel, — every organ re
sumed its proper functions, and the aberration ceased.
   3. Mr. Morton*, a gentleman whose mind rises much
superior to the delight of low persons, has certainly mis
understood the science of pneumatic medicine when he at
tempted to hold it forth to ridicule on the stage.  To wipe
away, as far as my voice reaches, the odium he would
attach to the practice, I shall beg leave to refer the philo
sophic world to what I published in the year 1 799. — Fide

   A  Case of Ulcerations in  the  Leg,  cured  hj Vital Air.
   Mrs. Mead,    tct. 45, living at Kinsbray, near Edgware,
had five large ulcers in the left leg, whicli extended along
the calf to the ancle, and had resisted cverv attempt made
to cure them for two vears. She was advised by Dr. Thorn
ton to inhale the vital air, and place herself under mv ma
nagement. He ordend her bark, steel, with myrrh, as
medicine, and the common unguents were employed to
the ulcers, and occasionally a weak solution of oxygenated
silver.   The ulcers in a few days, from an ichorous dis
charge, put on an healthy appearance, and the cure of the
ulcerations was perfected in less than three weeks. Her
limb has since remained sound ; it is now .upwards of six
months, and her health is completely re-established.

&XII.     Extract of a Memoir on the Temperature of the Water
     of the Sea, loth at the Surface and at different Depths,
     along the Shores and at a Distance from the Coast.   By
     M. F. Peron, Naturalist on the French Expedition to
     New Holland*.
 .   wf   all the experiments in natural philosophy," says
M.   Peron, " there are few the results of which are more
interesting ami more curious than those which form the
subject of this memoir. The meteorologist must derive from
them vaLuable data in regard to atmospheric observations
in the middle of the ocean : they may furnish to the natu
ralist knowledge indispensably necessarv in regard to the
habitation of the different tribes of marine animals ; and
the geologue and philosopher will find in them the most
certain facts in regard to the propagation of heat in the
middle of the seas, and of the physical state of the interior
parts of the globe, the deepest excavations of which can
scarcely go beyond the surface. In a word, there is no
science which may not derive benefit from the results of
experiments of this kind.    How much then ought we to
be surprised that they have hitherto excited so little atten
tion      l'f
   Proceeding then to an account of the observations which
may be made at the surface of the sea> and which he him
self pursued from lat. -1Q° north to lat. 44° south, repeating
them four times      dav, — at six in the morning, at noon, at
                               a
six in the evening, and at midnight, — M. Peron deduces
from them the following results — " The temperature of:
the surface of the sea, colder at noon than the atmosphere,
and warmer at midnight,        nearly in equilibrium with that
                                           is
of the morning and evening, in such            manner, however,
                                                              a
that the mean term of        given number of observations

more considerable for the water of the sea."
   By very happy application of these first results M. Peron
          a
easily proves, that the supposed heating of the waves                           is   a
mistake of sensation produced            the more considerable
                                                      by

as   it  incontestable.
          is              This prejudice, which        as old as     is
Aristotle, and which the incomplete experiments of Forsti;r.

 tirely proscribed ; and M. Peron substitutes in its stead this
 consequence of the experiments which he made on this
,subject.
   The relative tenfperature of the water of the sea increases
 during its agitation, but its absolute temperature always de
 creases.
      The serond section of M. Peron's memoir contains an
   account of experiments w hich may be rriade at great depths.
   The author here establishes a great distinction between ex
   periments of this kind made along the coasts, and those re
   peated in the ope:n sea at a great distance from the conti
  nents and large islandt.       From his examination of expert-'
   merits of the first kind, those msde along the coasts bv'
   Saussure and Marsigli in the Mediterranean ; by Donati in
   the Adriatic ; and by hims,eM in the sea which washes the
                                                                        ,
   western coast of New Holland, it results that, ccrtetis pa-
  ribus, the temperature of the sea along the coasts is greater
                                                                       '
  at' 'equal depths   than in the middle of the ocean ; that it
  seems to increase as one approaches           the shores ; and thai
  these writers themselves furnish objections against the uni-,
  {,orm temperature    of 10°, which has hitherto been admitted
  as the mean temperatnTe       or the interior part of the globe
  either in its solid or liquid part.
      For the above experiments, and those about to be men
  tioned, M. Peron emploved' an apparatus, invented bv hint-
  self, which appears indeed to be superior to all those hi
  therto employed for the sanic purpose.          J3y arranging suc
  cessivelv around     his  thermometer     a  stratum  of air, glass,
  charcoal, wood,     tallow,  and   resin,   he  was  able to unite
  under a very small volume' all those bedies which are the
 worst conductors of caloric, and in such an Order, that this
  propertv of being a bid conductor necessarily became still
 less; M. Peron bavins set out from this principle, that
 caloric, as well a , electricity, can with the greater difficultv
 penetrate a stratum of a given thickness, as the bodies
 which compose it arc nuirc different in their nature.           This
        of*the author's  labour  has  been  universally
 part                                                     approved.
     The author then proceeds to the temperature of the sea
 at' great depths —:
                       " We have now arrived," says he, "at
 the third and ninth part of the experiments which might be
attempted on the heat of the sea water.          It    also the most
                                                      is
delicate and the mo»t interesting, in consequence of the va
luable data   it inav furnish us in regard to the internal phy
sical state of the globe at depths which cannot be reache•d
in the solid part." bie then gives the rtsult of the experi
                                                               ments

 merits which he made successively in the neighbourhood of
 the equator at the depth of 300, 500, 1200, and 2144 feet.
    This consequence, which no doubt is new and very in
 teresting, results, namely, that the temperature of the water
 of the sea decreases in proportion to the depth. The dif
 ference obtained by M. Peron in his last observation at the
 depth of 2144 feet, was 19° of Reaumur between the tem
 perature of the surface and that at this depth.
    Having given the result of his particular observations,
 the author examines the experiments of the same kind
 which were made before. " If we except," says he, " the
celebrated traveller whose return has excited universal jov
.among all the friends of science, and who attended also id
 this object, but whose results and apparatus I am still un
 acquainted with *, three persons only have made accurate
 observations in the open sea on the temperature of the wa
 ters, viz. Irving, Forster, and myself.              By a very uncom
 mon accident, our experiments were repeated al three of the
 most opposite points of the globe;               By Irving, during the
 voyage   of the   honourable    Mr.    Phipps,    afterwards lord Mul-
 grave,  to the   North  Pole;   in   the expedition     of captain Cook
 to the South Pole, they were continued by Forstcr to the 64th
 degree south, beyond which no navigator had been able to
 advance; and I mvself, placed, as 1 may say, between the^e
 extremes, made all iny experiments in the neighbourhood
of the equator. It would certainlv be difficult to lind anv
 other fact in physics where so nianv points of coniparisoil
can be enumerated ; and yet we shall find the results of
 these different experiments reproduced, every where analo
gous to those which 1 shall here exhibit."
    In Forster's experiments; indeed, we find thdt the tem
perature of the sea decreases successively from the iCth of
 Rcaunutr to the term zero of the same thermometer, and
it continually decreases' the greater the depth.               The inge
nious experiments of Dr. Irving reproduce the same results
with still more interest, since at the depth of 3,900 feet he
obtained two degrees below zero of Reaumur's scale.
    M. Peron then takes a rapid view of the very incomplete
experiments of Lllis, Wal'is, Bradley, and Baldh, and the
anonymous ones collected bv Kirwan: he is satisfied with
observing, that they all concur to confirm the principal re-
Suits of his own experiments, and those of Forster and Ir
ving.     He concludes with a general view of the same re-
                •  Mr. H1W..0UI:    »¦« *til! 3: 3ouroc.iux.

             deduced from them.
                The temperature of the sea water decreases according to
             the depth. All the results of the observations hitherto made
         .   on this point, concur in proving that the deepest gulphs of
             the sea, as well as the summits of the highest mountains,
             are continually covered with ice, even under the equator:
             whence it must necessarily follow that a very small number
             of animals and vegetables can live there, if any exist at all.
             "  Analogous results have proved," continues the author,
             "  that a similar cooling existed at great depths in the prin
             cipal lakes of Swisserland and Italy.     The observations of
             Georgi,  Gmelin, Pallas, Ledyard, and Patrin, in Siberia,
             and  those of that accurate observer Saussure, prove that
             the case in regard to the boson) of the earth has always been
             the same when experiments have been made at the bottom
             of mines.     Similar results were obtained in America by
           Shaw, Mackenzie, Umfreville, and Robson.                 Ought not so
           many facts united to leave us in some uncertainty in regard
          to this theory, so generally admitted, of an interior central
           (ire which maintains a uniform and constant temperature
          of lo° in the whole mass of our globe, whether solid or
          liquid ? Shall we not one day be obliged to recur to this old
          principle, so natural, and so agreeable besides to all the phe
          nomena which daily take plare before our eyes? The only
          source of the heat of our globe is that irrca* luminary by
          which it is enlightened : without             it,
                                                          without the salutarv
          influence of its rays, the whole of our earth, soon congealed
          in every point, would be only an inert mass of ice. The
          history of the winter of these polar regions would then be
         that of the whole plane! ."

         it   a new degree of weight.
                                                                                 "This

         This consequence of M. Peron," say the commission
  ers   of the Institute, " appears to us the more probable, as
  k now proves the origin of those mountains of ice which
  hi the polar regions have hitherto impeded the progress of
  the European navigators : it makes us readily comprehend
  how masses of ice, detached from the depths of the sea to
  float at the surface, can constitute in these regions project
  ing mountains of ice which simple congelation could never
  etket under that form."
      This ingenious theorv, therefore, of an interior central
  Grc maintaining a uniform temperature of about 10 degrees
  throughout the whole mass, whether solid or liquid, ot our
 globe, experiences at present the fate reserved, soon or late,
  ior ajmost ail human theories. The calculations of Leib
 nitz, who first conceived it ; the eloquence of Buffon, who
 decided his triumph, ought however, it would seem, to
 have secured to it a louger and more peaceable existence.
      We shall terminate this extract with the opinion given
 on this subject by the commissioners of the Institute charged
 to give in a report upon it. " The memoir of M. Peron,"
 say they, " seems to us to deserve great attention from phi
 losophers : it is written with method, precision, and clear
 ness.      The experiments, of which the author gives an ac
 count, seem to have been made with that care and attention
 which are capable of ensuring the exactness of the results
 which thev have furnished.           We are therefore of opinion
 that this memoir' deserves the approbation and even the
 praises of the class, and that it ought to be printed among
 those des Sauuns Etrangcrs.           We will venture to add, that
 this is not the only claim of M. Peron to the gratitude of
all those who are fond of the sciences ; his labours during
his voyage will considerably tend to enlarge the boundaries .
of the natural sciences."

iron, commonly called martial pyrites; for the species and
varieties of this are found at all depths, and in all climates}
and soils, whether antient, or of alluvial and recent forma
tion. It is remarkable also, that, under certain circum
stances, this sulphuret is daily produced in the humid way:
an instance of which, a few years back, I had the honour,
in conjunction with Mr. Wiseman,- to lay before this so
ciety * ; and a'though, in           to pecuniary value, the
                                          regard
pyrites of iron may be considered as comparatively insig
nificant, yet there is every reason to believe, that in the
operations of nature it is a substance of very considerablp
importance.
                                      §    II-
     The       species and varieties of martial pyrites are, in general
so well         known, and have been so frequently and accurately
described, as to figure, lustre, colour, and other external
characters, that it would be totally superfluous here to give
any detailed account of them. One of the species, however,
merits peculiar notice, as possessing the remarkable property
of strong magnetic polarity; and, although it has been de
scribed hy modern mineralogists f. it does not appear to,
have been as yet subjected to any regular chemical exa
mination ; so that, whether it be a sulphuret of iron inhe
rently endowed with the magnetical property, or a sulphuret
in which particles of the ordinary magnetical iron ore are
simply but minutely interspersed, has to this time remained
undecided.
   This species is known by the name of magnetical pyrites,
and is called by the Germans magnet-kies, or J'errum viine-
ralhalum magnetico-pyritaceum.
   It is most frequently of the colour of bronze, passing
to    a pale     cupreous red.
     The lustre is metallic.                                           .•
     The fracture is unequal,         and
                                    commonly coarse-grained,
but sometimes imperfectly conchoidal.
   The fragments are amorphous.
   The trace is yellowish gray, with some metallic lustre.
   It is not very hard ; but, when struck with steel, sparks
are produced, although with wine difficulty.
   It is brittle, and is easily broken.
   This pyrites has been hitherto found only in some parts
of Norway, Silesia, Bavaria, and especially at Geier, Mef

some specimens from the right honourable Charles Grc-
villc, P.K.S., f was struck with their resemblance to the-
pyrites of Breitenbrunn, winch happened at that time to be
in my possession ; ami, upon trial, J found that they were
magnelical, and agreed with the latter in every particular.
Their magnetic power was such as strongly to affect a well-
poised needle of about three inches in length; apiece of
the pyrites, nearly two inches square, acted upon the needle
at the distance of four inches.
   The powder (which is blackish gray, with but little me
tallic lustre) is immediately taken up by a common mag
net ; but the pyrites does not act thus on the powder, nor
on iron tilings, unless it hits been placed for some time be
tween niagnotical bars; then, indeed, it acts powerfully,
turns the needle completely round, attracts and takes up
iron filings, and seems permanently to retain this addition
to its original power.
    In the specimens which I. obtained, the north pole was
generally the strongest.
   This pyrites was found in Wales, about the year 1"°S,
by the honourable Robert (Ireville, F. U.S., who sent the
specimens above described to his brother the right honoura
ble Charles Gccville, with the following account:
   " It is found in great abundance in Caernarvonshire,
near the base of the Ditn.uit.iiii called Moel Elion, or pro
bably with more accuracy Moel .Elia, and opposite to the
mountain called Mynvdil Mawr.           These mountains form
the entrance into a little clo-e valley, which leads to Cy-
wellin lake, near Snow don, a little beyond the hamlet of
Bettws.
   " The vein appears; to be some yards in depth and
breadth, and seems to run from north to south, as it is
tumid on Mynydd Mawr, which is across the narrow val
                                    '

   Mr. Robert Greville, in another pa.rt of his letter, states
that copper ore has been worked in several of the adjacent
places, and. that, many years ago, captain Williams, of
(Jlan vr Avon, employed some miners at the place where
this pyrites is found, but the undertaking proved unpro
ductive.    Yellow copper ore is certainly in the vicinity ;
for some portions of it were adhering to the specimens
which have been mentioned ; and I shall here observe, that
the stone which accompanies the magnetical pyrites is a
variety of the lapis o!lansx or pot-stone, of a pale grayish
green, containing smooth cubic crystals of common pyrites.

136             Analysis   of the  magnet teal Pyrites.
                                  § m.
    From the appearance of those parts of the magnetical py
rites which have been exposed to the weather, it seems tq
be liable to oxidizement, but not to vitriolization.
    The specific gravity, at temperature r!5° of Fahrenheit,
is 4518.
     When exposed to the blowpipe, it emits a sulphureous,
oJour, and melts into a globule nearly black, which is at
tracted by the magnet.
     500 grains, in coarse powder, were exposed, in a small
earthen retort, to a red heat, during three hours.               By this
operation     the   weight of the powder was very          little   dimi
nished ;     neither  was   there   anv   appearance   of sulphur in
the receiver, which, however, smelt strongly of sulphureous
 acid.
     500 gra;ns of the same were put into a flat porcelain cru
 cible, which was kept in a red heat, under a muffle, during
 four hours. The powder then appeared of a dark gray, with
 a tinge of deep red, and weighed 432,50 grains.               The loss
 was therefore G7'50 = 13-50 per cent.; but, upon examin
 ing the residuum, I found that only part of the sulphur had
 been thus separated.
     The magnetical pyrites, when digested in dilute sulphuric
 acid, is partially dissolved, with little effervescence, although
 there is a very perceptible odour of sulphuretted hydrogen.
     The solution is of a very pale green colour.
     Pure ammonia produced a dark g'cen precipitate, tending
 to black ; and ptussiate of potash formed a verv pale blue
 precipitate, or rather a white precipitate mingled with a
 small portion of blue. The whole of the latter, however,
 by exposure to the air, gradually assumed the usual inten
 sity of Prussian blue ; and the blackish erecn precipitate,
  formed by ammonia, became gradually ochraceous. These
  effects, therefore, fully prove, that the iron in the- solution
 was, lor the greater part, at the minimum of oxidizement,
  so as to form the green sulphate and white prussiate of iron* j
  and, consequently, that the iron of the magnetical pvrites is
  either quite, or very nearly, in the state of perfect metal.
     This pyrites, when treated with nitric acid of the specific
  gravity of 1-36, diluted with an equal quantity of water, is
  at first but little affected; but, when heat is applied, it is
  dissolved with much effervescence, and discharge of nitrous
  gas : the effervescence, however, is by no means so violent

as  when the common pyrites are treated in a similar man
ner.    It is also worthy of notice, that if the digestion be
not of too long duration, a considerable quantity of sul
phur, in substance, is separated ; whilst, on the contrary,
scSicelv any can be obtained from the common pvrites,
when treated in a similar manner; although I shall soon
have occasion to prove that the real quantity of sulphur is
much more finsiderable in the latter than in the former.
    As soon       muriatic ?eid is poured on the powcier of the
magnetical py riles a slight effervescence is produced, which
becomes violently increased by the application ol heat ; a
quantity of gas is discharged, which, bv its odour, by its,
inflammability,      by the colour of the flame, by the deposi
tion of sulphur when burned, and by other properties, was
proved to be sulphuretted hydrogen.
     During the digestion sulphur was deposited, which so
 enveloped a small part of the pyrites as to protect it from
 the further action of the acid.
     The solution was of a pale yellowish green colour. With
prussiate of potash it afforded a pale blue precipitate, or
 rather a white precipitate mixed with blue; and with am
 monia it formed a dark blackish-green precipitate, which
 gradually became ochraceous ; so that these effects corro
 borated the conclusions which were founded on the pro
 perties of the sulphuric solution, namely, that the iron con
 tained in the pyrites is almost, if not quite, in the metallic
 state.
     Other experiments were made ; but, as they merely con
 firm the above observations, I shall proceed to give an ac-r
 count of the analysis.
                                   § IV.
                Analysis of the magnetical Pyrites.
     A.  100 grains, reduced to a fine powder, were digested,
 ivith two   ounce-: of muriatic acid, in a glass matrass placed
 in a sand-bath.       The effects already described took place,
 and a pale yellowish green solution was formed.       The resi
 duum was then again digested with two parts of muriatic
 acid mixed w ith one of nitric acid ; and a quantity of pure
 sulphur was obtained, which, being dried, weighed 14
 grains.
     B. The acid in which (he residuum had been digested was
  added to the first muriatic solution ; some nitric acid was
  also poured in, to promote the oxidizement of the iron, and
  thereby to facilitate the precipitationof it byammonia, which
                                                              was

    was added after the liquor had been boiled for          considera      a
    ble time.      The precipitate thus obtained was boiled with
    lixivium of potash     ;    was then edulcorated, dried, made
                               it

    pletely taken up      by
                           a magnet, and, being weighed, amounted
    to 80 grains.
       C. The lixivium of potash was examined               muriate of     by
    ammonia, but no alumina was obtained.
       D. To the fdtrated liquor from which the iron had been,
    precipitated     by ammonia, muriate of barytes was added
    until  it ceased to produce any precipitate         this was then
                                                                  :
    digested with some very dilute muriatic acid        was collected,;
    washed,     and,  after  exposure to     low red heat for
                                                       a           few           a
    minutes    ina   crucible  of platina, weighed 155 grains.      If,
    therefore, the quantity of sulphur converted into sulphuric
    acid   by  the preceding operations, and precipitated by ba-
    rytes,  be   calculated according to the accurate experiments
    of Mr. Chenevis, these 155 grains of sulphate of barytes,
    will denote nearly 22- 5,0 of sulphur so that, with the addi

    tion of the 14 grains previously obtained in substance, the
    total quantity will amount to 3650.
       E. Moreover, from what has been stated             appears that    it
    the iron which was obtained in the form of black oxide
    weighed 80 grains; and,          adding these 80 grains to the
                                         by
    36-50 of sulphur, an increase of weight           found = 16*50.
                                                                 is
    This was evidently owing to the oxidizement of the iron,
    which,  in   the magnetical pyrites, exists quite, or very nearly,
    in the metallic state, but,        the operations of the analysis,
                                         by
    had received this addition.      The real quantity of iron mibl,

    on tlvis account, be estimated at 63-50.
       100 grains, therefore, of the magnetical pyrites yielded
                 Sulphur                                36-50 grains.

       This analysis was repeated in similar manner, excepting
                                                  a
    that the. whole was digested                  in
                                      nitric acid until the sul
    phur was entirely convened into sulphuric acid. To the
    liquor which remained alter the separation of the iron by
    ammoria, muriate of barytes was added, as before, and
    formed  a precipitate which weighed 245 grains.     Now, as
    the sulphuric acid in sulphate of barytes       estimated bv      is
    Mr. Chenevix at 23*5 per cent., and the sulphur which is

in the weight of the iron, arose, as have already remarked,
                                                  I
from the addition of oxygen          for the iron, as obtained
                                            ;                                                by

                                                     has been proved
by Lavoisier and Proust to consist of 100 parts of metallic
iron combined with 37 of oxygen, thus forming 137 of
black oxide       the exact proportion of oxygen
                    :                                       therefore         is
27 per cent., and 80 grains of this oxide must contain 21*6
of oxygen. But, in the above analyses of the magnetical
pyrites, the increase of weight did not amount to more
 than l6'5- and we may therefore conclude that, in all
probability,        quantity of oxygen = 5- was previously
                    a                                             1
combined with some part, or with the general mass, of the
 iron    in
         the pyrites.     A small part of the above-mentioned
increase of weight must likewise have arisen from another
 cause   ;for, although the true proportions of the black oxide                                    ¦
 of iron arc 27 of oxygen and 73 of iron, (so that 100 parts
 of the latter absorb 37 of the former,) yet, in actual prac
 tice,   it difficult to oblain
              is                    exactly in this state, and there
                                            it

                        in

 afford   aponderable quantity of coal or other residuum; but
 the real cause of the increase of weight appears to be the
 air, which can scarcely be completely excluded, and which,

after the wax is burned, combines with the superficial part
of the oxide, and converts a portion of it into the red or
peroxide ; so that the surface in the crucible appears brown
when compared with the interior.
    To this cause, therefore, I am inclined also to attribute
 a small part of the increase observed in the weight of the
 iron obtained by the preceding analyses.
                                §v.
    Before I make any observations on the nature of the sul--
 pliurct which has been proved to constitute the magnetical
pyrites, it may be proper to state some comparative analyses
which I have made of several of the common pyrites ; and,
as the method employed was precisely the same as that
which has been described, all that seems to be requisite is
to give an account of the results.
    In each analysis the' whole of the sulphur was converted
into sulphuric acid, which was precipitated bybarytesj and,
in the selection of the specimens, great attention was paid
to take the internal parts of the fragments, and not to make
use of any which exhibited an appearance of decomposition,
or of extraneous substances.
    The iron was, as before, reduced to the state of black
oxide ; and the addition of weight in each separate analysis
corresponded, within a few fractional parts, with the pro
portion of oxvgen requisite to form into black oxide a given
quantity of metallic iron, equal to that which in each pyrites
was ascertained to be the real proportion, by deducting the
quantity of sulphur from the total quantity of each pyrites.
    The iron, therefore, in these is completely metallic, and
as such is stated in the following results.

      Considering    the difference in the figure, lustre, and co
  lour of    these pyrites, I expected to have found a much
  greater difference in the proportions of their component in*
  gredients ; but, as the results are the average of several ex-
•
  periments, I have not any reason to doubt their accuracy.
      The pyrites crystallized in regular figures, such as cube*
  and dodecaedrons, according to the above analyses, contain
  less sulphur and more iron than the radiated pyrites, and
  perhaps than others which are not regularly crystallized.
  This difference, however, is not cousiderable ; for the do-
  tlecaedral pyrites* which afforded the smallest quantity of
  sulphur    of any of the regularly crystallized pyrites, yielded
   32-15;    and  the radiated pyrites, No. 5, gave 54-34: the
  difference, therefore, is only 2-19. So that the mean pro
  portion of sulphur in all the pyrites which were examined
  is 53-24 per cent.; and, taking the proportion of sulphur
  in the magnetical pyrites at 36-50 or 37, the difference
  between this and the mean of the common pyrites will be
   16-74 or 16-24.      The magnetical pyrites, therefore, is quite
  distinct, as a sulphuret of iron, from the common martial
  pyrites ; and in the following observations I shall prove
  that a sulphuret consisting of the proportions last men
   tioned has till now been unknown as a product of nature
                                  § VI.
      Although pyrites is one of the most common of mineral
   substances, vet the discovery of its real nature is compara
   tively of a late date; for it appears that even Agricola
   (whose knowledge of mineral bodies was certainly oreat,
   considering the state of science in his time) was not ac
   quainted with its characteristic ingredient, namely, iron.
   According to Henckel, this was first noticed by our coun
   tryman Martin Lister, a member of this learned society,
   who says,    " Pyrites p/trus putus Jerri metallum est."
       From the time of Henckel, pyrites seems little to have
   attracted   the notice of chemists, until Mr. Proust, the
                                                               learned

     142              Analysis of the       magnet icat Pyrites i
    learned professor of chemistry at Madrid, published HVrf
    memoirs, in which fie states that there are two sulphuret3
    of iron, the one being artificial and the other natural. The
    first is the sulphuret which is formed in laboratories, by
    adding sulphur to red-hot iron, or by exposing both of them
   to heat in. a retbrt. This is distinguished from the second
   sulphuret (which is the common martial pyrites) by its easy
   solubility in acids, especially in muriatic acid, by the form
   ation of sulphuretted hvdrogen gas during the solution of
   the sulphuret in the last-named acid, by its colour, and by
   its inferior density.
         According to Mr. Proust, the first or artificial sulphuret
   is composed of 60 pans of sulphur, combined with 100
   parts of iron ; whilst the second sulphuret, or common py
   rites, consist^ of 90 parts of sulphur and 100 Of iron.
         He fhoreover observes, that the sulphur of rhe first sril-
   phuret is difficultly separated ; but that the excess which is
   in the second sulphuret, or comninn pyrites, is easily ex
  pelled, and is that portion which is obtained by distillation,
  the residuum being then reduced to the state of the first sul
  phuret*.           100 parts, therefore, of this substance, are com
  posed      of  62*50    of iron and 37*50 of sulphur; and 100 parts
  of coriimon pyrites are, according ib this statement, com
  posed of 52*64 of iron and 47*36 of sulphur.
        These proportions Mr. Proust considers as the minimum'
  and maximum of the sulphurets of iron.                      For the latter he
  allows some variation j but the composition of the former
  he regards as fixed by the invariable law of proportions                    f j
  although he observes, that it has not as yet been discovered
  in the mineral kingdom
        In support of these assertions Mr; Proust states,
        1. That the pvrites found near Soria, when distilled in
 a retort heated to redness, afforded nearly 20 per qcnt. of
 sulphur.
       2. That the residuum of the above distillation had lost
 the external characters' and chemical properties of pyrites,
 and had assumed those of the artificial sulphuret of iron.

    3. That when    to this residuum a Quantity of sulphur wad
added,    and the whole    was distilled m a degree or heat not
too great, the 20 per cent, or' sulphur, which had been se
parated by the first distillation,    was by this again restored;
and the mass in the retort thus recovered nearly the original
colour, lustre, and chemical properties or" the pyrites.
   4. That, by adding sulphur to iron filings, or fine iroit
wire, heated to a low red in a retort, a compound is ob
tained, in which tHe proportion of sulphur amounts only
to about 20 or 30 parts; but, if this compound is again
treated with sulphur in a red heat, a sulphurct is formed,
which is readily dissolved in acids, and plentifully affords
sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
    This is the real minimum of the sulphurets of iron, fixed
by the invariable law of proportions (according to Mr.
Proust) at 50 or 60 of sulphur and 100 of iron, the former
being (as I have already observed) in the proportion of
37'50 per cent.
    5. and lastly, That when this sulphurct is again mixed
and distilled with sulphur, (due attention being paid to the
degree of heat,) the product is found to have assumed most
of the chemical and external properties of the natural com
mon pyrites, density alone beiiis excepted.
    The application of the above observations to the principal
subject of the present paper is sufficiently obvious ; for,*
when it is considered that the magnetical pyrites is so dif
ferent from the common pyrites in colour, hardness, solu
bility in sulphuric acid, and more especially in muriatic
acid, with the copious production of sulphuretted hydrogen:
gas; when, bv analysis, it has been found to consist of 36
or 3" of sulphur, combined with about C>3 of metallic iron ;
and, when the artificial sulphuret of iron which has been
lately described is proved to agree with the magnetical py-
ritrs in the nature and proportions of its component ingre
dients, and in every one of the above-mentioned proper
ties; it is evident that the magnetical pyrites is identically
the same with this sulphurct, which hitherto has remained
undiscovered in nature, and has onlv been known as a pro
duct of our' laboratories.     In order, however, more i'ullv to
satisfy myself, I made experiments on the artificial sulphu
ret, which I formed with sulphtu; and fine iron wire.
   This substance agreed, in all the properties which have
been noticed, with the magnetical pyrites ; and the precipi
tates obtained by adding prussiate of potash, and ammonia,
to the muriatic and sulphuric solutions, were precisely si

                                   §  VII.
  -   So far, therefore, as can be proved bv similarity in che
 mical properties and analysis^ the magnetical pyrites is in
 disputably a natural sulphuret, completely the same with
 that wbich till now has been only known as an artificial
 product ; but, that the mind may be perfectly satisfied, an
 other question must be. solved, namely, How far do they
 accord in receiving and retaining the property of mau-
 netism ? Common pyrites do not appear to affect the mag
 netic needle ; or, if some of them slightly act by attraction
 (which, however, I never could perceive, nor recollect to
 have read in works expressly relating to magnetism,) vet
 they do not possess, nor appear capable of acquiring, any
 magnetic polarity.        As, therefore, the iron of pyrites is un
 doubtedly     in  the metallic   state, and in a considerable pro-,
 portion,    the    destruction   of this characteristic property of
metallic iron must be ascribed to the other ingredient —
 sulphur.
     But we have lately seen, that a natural combination of
iron with 36'50 or 37 per cent, of sulphur, is in possession
 of all the properties supposed hitherto to appertain (in any
marked degree) almost exclusively to the well known mag
netic iron ore; and that the combination alluded to is strictly
chemical, and not (as at first might have been imagined)
 a mixture of particles of magnetic iron ore with common
 pyrites *.
     This is certainly very remarkable ; and it induced me to
examine the effects produced by sulphur on the capacity of
metallic iron for receiving and retaining the magnetic pro
perties.     I therefore prepared some sulphuret of iron by
adding a large quantity of sulphur to fine iron wire in a
moderate      red heat.
    The internal colour and lustre of the product were not
very unlike those of the magnetical pyrites; and, after the
mass     had been placed during a few hours between mag
netical bars, I found that it possessed so strong a degree
of polarity as to attract or repel the needle completely round
upon its pivot ; and, although several weeks have elapsed
    •
       This lias b en sufficiently proved by the facts which Have been
seated; I shall however add, thac upon digesting a mixtilre of ihe powder
of common pyrites and iron tilings in muriatic acid, I only obtained hy
drogen g;i5, exactly as if 1 hud employed the iron filings without the
pyrin.*:

since it has been removed from the magnetical bars, it still
retains its power with little diminution ; like the magnetical
pyrites, however, in its natural state, it is not sufficiently
powerful to attract and take up iron filing?.

the magnetical pyrites; I therefore mixed some of       reduced              it,
to powder, with       large quantity of sulphur, and subjected
                            a

146                 Analysis    of Ike   magneticat          Pyrites.
After  the distillation the pyrites weighed 51*50; conse
quently,    the addition of sulphur was o per cent., making
the total = 45*50 or 46 per cent. The powder was become
greenish yellow, verv like that of the common pyrites: it
did not afford any sulphuretted hydrogen when digested in
muriatic acid; but it nevertheless was partially dissolved,
and the solution, when examined      bv prussiate of potash,
and by ammonia, was not different from that of the crude
niatrnetical pyrites.
   The powder which had been distilled with sulphur, and
which had thus received an addition of 9 per cent. to its
original quantity, was still capable of being completely
faken up by a magnet.
   From the whole of the experiments which have been re
lated, it is therefore evident, that iron, when combined with
a considerable proportion of sulphur, is not only still capable
of receiving the magnetic property, but is also thereby ena
bled to retam         it,
                     and thus, as   have already remarked, be

like manner, does sulphur seem to act; for               has been        it
            by by
proved,      the preceding experiments, that the brittle mass
formed        the union of      certain proportion of this subf

 the remark of Mr. Pelletier, who says, that " the phos-
 phuret of iron is attracted by the magnet * ;" and therefore,
 although certain bodies may be thus attracted,                          without
 being capable of actually becoming permanent magnets,
 I was desirous to examine what might be the power, in this
 respect, of phosphuret of iron.
     I therefore prepared a quantity of phosphuret of iron in
 the direct way, viz. by adding phosphorus, cut into small
 pieces, to fine iron wire made moderately red-hot in a cru
cible.        The usual phaenomena took place, such as the bril
 liant white flame, and the rapid melting of the iron, which,
 when cold, was white, with a striated grain, extremely
brittle, hard, and completely converted into a phosphuret.
The fragments of this were powerfully attracted by a mag
net ; and, after I had placed two or three of the largest
pieces, during a few hours, between magnetical bars, I had
the pleasure to find that these had become powerful mag
nets, which not only attracted or repelled the rieedle com
pletely round, but were able to take up iron filings, and
small pieces, about half an inch in length, of fine harpsi
chord wire ; and, although they have now been removed
from the magnetical bars more than three weeks, I cannot
discover any diminution of the power which had thus been
communicated to them.
    The three inflammable substances, carbon, sulphur, and
phosphorus, which, by their chemical effects on iron, iri
many respects resemble each other, have now therefore been
proved alike to possess the property of enabling iron to re
tain the power of magnetism : but I shall consider this more
fully in the following section.

   The coal yielded about three grains and a half of ashes,
which consisted of alumina, iron, and silica, with a trace
of lime.
   B. The bitumen was not affected by being long digested
in boiling distilled water.
    C. By digesting 100 grains in lixivium of pure potash, a
brown solution was formed ; this was saturated with mu
riatic acidt and a brown resinous precipitate was obtained,
which weighed 21 grains.
    D. A portion was digested in nitric acid : at first much
nitrous gas was evolved, and, after the digestion had been
continued for nearly 48 hours,, a part was dissolved, and
formed an orangercoloured solution, which did not yield
any precipitate when saturated by the alkalis or by lime;
the colour only became more deep, and, by evaporation, a
yellow viscid substance was obtained, which was soluble in
water.      The above nitric solution poisesscd every property
of those nitric solutions of resinous substances which I have
 mentioned in a former paper*.
    E. The benzoic and succinic acids were not obtained from
 this substance by any of the methods usually emploved.
    F. Alcohol almost immediately began to act upon this
bitumen; and, being added at different limes, gradually
dissolved a considerable part of it.             The solution was red
dish brown, and had a resinous odour; by the addition of
water it became milky, and, by evaporation, afforded a dark
brown substance which had every property of resin, whilst
the residuum left by the alcohol possessed those properties
which characterize asphaltum.
    The following analysis was then made to discover the
proportions of the component ingredients.

 140               Observations  on the Change   of
               Analysis of the Bitumen from Bovey.
      A. 100 grains, reduced to a fine powder, were digested,
  during 48 hours, with six ounces of alcohol, the vessel
  being placed in sand moderately warmed. A deep reddish
  brown tincture was thus obtained ; and the operation was
  again twice repeated, with other portions of the same men
  struum, until it ceased to act upon the residuum.
      The whole of the spirituous solution (which had been,
  cautiously decanted) was then subjected to a very gradual
  distillation in an alembic, and yielded a brown fragrant resin
  which weighed 55 grains.
      B. The residuum, which could not be dissolved by al
  cohol, was digested in boiling distilled water; but this did
  hot act upon it : {he whole was therefore collected on a
  filter, was gradually dried, without heat, by mere exposure
 to the air, and then weighed 44 grains.
      These 44 grains consisted of a light, porous, pale brown
 substance, which, being melted, formed a black, shining,
 brittle mass.     It burned with the odour of asphalturn, but
 rather less disagreeable, owing most probably to a small
 portion of the resin which had not been completely ex*-
 traded by the alcohol.       It was insoluble in water and in
 alcohol, but was readily dissolved by heated fat oils ; and
 in every other particular was found to possess the properties
 of asphalturn.
      The 44 grains of asphalturn, when burned, left a resi
 duum, which weighed 3 grains, and consisted of alumina,
 silica, and iron.
      By this analysis it appears that the bitumen which ac
companies the Bovey coal is a peculiar and hitherto un
 known substance, which is partly in the state of vegetable
 resin, and partly in that of the bitumen called asphalturn,
 the resin being in the largest proportion;       as 100 grains of
 the above-mentioned substance afforded,
                     Resin       -      -    55
                     Asphalturn         -    41

                                             99.
      Thus we have an instance of a substance being found
 under circumstances which constitute a fossil, although
 the characters of it appertain partly to the vegetable and,
 partly to the mineral kingdom.

                                   §  VI.
    The powerful action which alcohol exerts on most of the
resins may justlv be regarded as forming a marked distinc
tion between those substances and the bitumens.                    But, as
some of the bitumens are acted upon by alcohol in a slight
degree, I was desirous to ascertain whether a small portion
Of resin was contained in any of these ; or, if that was not
the case, I wished to determine the nature of the substance
which could       be separated,    although wry sparingly, by this           ,
menstruum.           I therefore made the following comparative
experiments       on   the soft brown clastic bitumen from Derby
shire; on the genuine asphahum; on very pure cannel coal ;
and on the common pit coal.
     100 grains of each were digested with three ounces of
alcohol, in matrasses placed in warm sand, during five days,
some alcohol being occasionally added, to supply the loss
caused by evaporation.           After the above-mentioned period
had elapsed, the liquid contained in each matrass was poured
into Separate vessels.
     1. The alcohol which had been digested on the elastic
bitumen was not tinged, nor, when spontaneously evapo
 rated, did it leave any film or stain on the glass,
     2. From, asphaltum the alcohol had extracted a yelloty
 tincture, which, in some situations, appeared of a pale olive
 colour, and, being spontaneouslv evaporated, a thick brown
 liquid was deposited, in small drops, on the glass ; these
 drops did not become hard after two months, and possessed
 the odour, and every other propertv, of petroleum.                     The
 asphaltum had lost in weight about one grain and a half.
      3. The cannel coal had communicated a pale yellow tint to
 fhe alcohol, which, in the manner above described, was as
 certained to be caused by petroleum ; but, from the small-
 ness of the quantity, the weight could not be determined.
     4. The alcohol which had been digested on pit coal had
 not assumed any colour ; but, by spontaneous evaporation*,
 it left a film on the glass, which, by its odour, was also
 found to be petroleum.
      By these experiments we find that the action of alcohol
 An the bitumens is very slight ; and that the small portion
 which may thus be extracted from some of them is petro
 leum.       In these, the process of bhuminization (if I may be

a great measure, to be confirmed, although the causes which
operate these changes on, vegetable bodies are as yet undis
covered.
   Many facts indicate, that time alone does not reduce anir
mal or vegetable bodies to the state of fossils. In this coun
try, there are numerous examples of large quantities of tim
ber (even whoje forests) which have been submerged prior
to aqv tradition, and which nevertheless completely retain
their ligneous characters            *,

must perefprc have been reqqired to form the varieties of
coal and other bituminous substances.          In some instances
(as in  the fprmation     of  Bovey coal)   these causes seem to
nave acted partially and imperfectly, whilst, in the forma
tion of the greater part of the pit coajs, their operation h^s
been extensive arid complete.
   In the pit coals, the mineral characters predominate, and
the principal vestige of their real origin seems to be bitu
men for the presence of carbon
     ;                                    the state of oxide can-

pot alone be considered as decisive.
   Bitumen, therefore, with the exuviae and impressions so,
commoply found in the accompanying strata, must be more,
immediately regarded as the proofs in favour of the origin
of pit coal from organized bodies; and, ,considering the
general facts which have hpkn long observed, together with
those latelv adduced respecting the Bovev coal, and the suh,-

 part, however, of the above work where he speaks of the
 fossil wood of Iceland, called surturbrand, he evidently ap
 pears doubtful how far volcanic fire may have acted upon
 it; although he conceives that, in the formation of there                   it,
 has been some connection with volcanic operations.             His
 words are " Quid de ligno fossili Islandiae sentiendum sit,
              :

It    certainly was very natural that Bergmann should enter
  tain this opinion in respect to the surturbrand; and                             it   is
  remarkable    that the leaves contained in the schistus lately
'described are of the same nature, and are found          the same      in
  country.     The leaves also described by Mr. St. Fond are
  likewise found       incountry which, according to him, was
                            a
  formerly   volcanic.   Were these substances, therefore, never
  found but in' countries which either actually are or were vol
  canic, we should be aimpst compelled to believe, with the
  Swedish professor, that the operations of subterraneous fires
  have been concerned in the formation of these bodies, or
  rather in the conversion of them into their present state.
      But similar substances are found in countries where not
  the smallest vestige of volcanic effects can be discovered, and
  Devonshire most undoubtedly              such; yet, nevertheless,
                                                is

                                        forming regular strata*.
      Moreover? the half charred appearance of Bovey coal, and
  of surturbrand, cannot be adduced as any proof that the ori
  ginal vegetable bodies have been exposed to the partial ef
  fects of subterraneous     fire   for at this time we know that

ferent journals *, and particularly in my answers to Pre-
vast''t:, and in some letters written to professor Erugnatelli,
insisted on the real explanation of the phenomena of this
kind ; proving, by decisive experiments, that these move
ments, thought to be the effect of a repulsive power, arise
all from the same principle, that is to say, the attraction of
surface ; whence it results, that one fluid being attracted
more than another, retires from the surface on which it
had extended itself, and obeys its own cohesion or force of
aggregation, and concentrates itself.
    I have lately resumed this subject, and have exhibited it
in a clearer point of view, in the Transactions of the Italian
Society of the Sciences, proving, with the greatest rigour, that
it is the attraction of the surface which gives rise to the pre
 tended repulsions of some.fluids on the surface of fluids,
and of some fluids on the surface of solids.
    Professor Brugnatelli, extending my experiments on the
 attraction of surface, spoke of the repulsions recently ob
 served by M. Draparnaud ; for he remarked, that several
 fluids thrown in drops on the smooth surface of solids repel
oil, spirit of wine, oil of turpentine, and ether J.
    M. Draparnaud says that alcohol or spirit of wine expels
 water and other liquids from the bottom of vessels, because
 there is a continual emission of subtle particles, which,
 forming an atmosphere, produce the removal of the water,
 as Prevost said of odoriferous atmospheres : and, according
 to him, all volatile bodies are capable of doing the same at
 the common temperature of the atmosphere, since he is of
 opinion that they act mechanically, that is to say, by means
 of the impulsion of their emanations.
    But I snall beg leave to oppose to him some facts, and
 some reasoning to throw light on this truth.              Water, in
 deed, retires from the surface of the vessel to which' spirit
 of wine is applied ; but it is not true that it is expelled by a
 repulsive foice. It is equally false, that the space abandoned
 by the water, when the experiment is made, is perfectly dry,
 as M. Draparnaud says ; but the water is succeeded by a
 light stratum of spirit of wine, which soon evaporates.
 Water, as well as the other fluids, adduced by Draparnaud,
 retire, because they are obliged to give up the surface to the
 spirit of wine, which has a greater attraction for it than
 they, and seizes on it with mote energy : being thus aban-

136                         On the apparent Repulsion
doned     to themselves, they become concentrated. A drop
or two of spirit of wine, indeed, poured, in a gentle tem
perature, on a porcelain dish for example, is seen to extend
itself, and to cover the said surface like varnish ; which is
not the case on pouring out a drop or two of water, because
it has not the same attraction of surface.                The integrant
moleculae of the water, which have more affinity of aggre
gation or cohesion, than of attraction for the surface of the
supposed body, do ,not become flat, or dilate in the same
manner.
    It is so true, that spirit of wine or alcohol attaches itself
more strongly than water to the surface of vessels, that if
a drop or two of this fluid be thrown on a porcelain dish;
and     if,after   it has extended itself, forming as               were            it         a
disk, some drops of water be thrown on                     and forced to it,
take the place occupied          the spirit of wine
                                       by                    will be seen ;    it
that the water, not being able to detach the alcohol, will be
obliged to p3ss over             it,
                              and the alcohol will remain always
fixed at the surface of the dish.
    But I   can produce an easy experiment, which                  directly         is
opposite to the opinion of Drapamaud.                      fixed, in the I
middle of porcelain saucer,
              a                        small ball of soft wax, and
                                                 a

                   a                                large pin.      a  then              I
poured into the saucer such             quantity of water as to rise
                                                 a
above the edges of the cavity, but not to enter it.                     The
vessel being thus prepared,          dipped

which was around the drop of alcohol.                The water always
remained tranquil and motionless, as                     had been close,

to the surface of water on which float small bits of gold or
silver leaf, they are seen to recede.          These small bodies re
cede also sometimes from the surface of the water where
they are placed, on the approach of                small bit of cotton

 wine, or       ifa drop or two of the same fluid be poured over
 it,    the supernatant small bits of metal will not be seen to
 exhibit the same phenomena as before, because the spirit of
 wine traverses the surface of the water occupied                   anotherby
 fluid, which has         greater attraction for it.      The case        the       is
                         is a

  obliges them to concentrate themselves at the extremities of

                         2                                                         stratum

                 belween some Kinds    of Fluids^             1 5$
stratum of ammonia expels it around, and forms a circle.
This shows, according to Draparnaud, that the expansive
force of spirit of wine is greater than that of ammonia.
    But I remark that ammonia has no attraction of surface,
or at least very little with the bottom of vessels, and, on
the contrary, that alcohol has a great deal.        If a drop of
ammonia be poured on a porcelain saucer, or on a piece of
glass, and one of spirit of wine, the former remains con
centrated, and the other dilates itself.      This is the reason
why spirit of wine expels ammonia on the bottom of vessels,
and that ammonia does not expel spirit of wine.
    Moreover, if the expulsion of the ammonia depended on
the mechanical impression of the emanations of the spirit
of wine, it ought scarcely to manifest itself ; for the force
of the emanations of the spirit of wine ought to be weak
ened by the force of the emanations of the ammonia, but
it manifests itself with the same promptitude as that of
water.    It is observed also, that some fluids almost equally
volatile and odoriferous expel each other when applied in
succession to the same surface.      For example, essential oil
of turpentine expels naptha, and ether expels essential oil
 of turpentine.
    If the opposite forces destroyed each other, how could
 this happen ? But the case is so, because essential oil of
turpentine has more attraction of surface than naptha, and
ether more than essential oil of turpentine.
   But there is one observation of Draparnaud which de
serves to be discussed.      He has remarked that ammonia
expels oil from the surface of vessels, though it expels nei
ther water nor spirit of wine.      I have remarked also, that
the approach alone of a drop of ammonia to the surface of
oil, manifests there an evident commotion, as if it were
breathed upon.       It appears then that the emanations of
ammonia render themselves by these means manifest to the
sight, that is to say, in consequence of the expulsive force
or mechanical shock of the oil.
    I do not pretend, nor have ever pretended, that there
can be no emanations of volatile bodies capable of render
ing themselves sensible to the sight in this sense, but only
to show that several phenomena which are considered as
the effects of repulsion, occasioned      by the expansion of
volatile bodies, do not depend on that cause, but are the'
effects of attraction of surface,     and that there are no
means of rendering the emanations of odoriferous bodies
                                        ,
»ensible to the sight, as Benedict Prevost thinks.       But be

  1 60                On the apparent  Repulsion
  fore we    decide in regard to the effect of ammonia, let us
 pay.   attention  to the Following remarkable observations.
     Throw small bits of gold or silver leaf on the surface of
  oil contained in a goblet, and then bring near to it a drop
  of aulmonia, a commotion will be observed in the surface
 of the bili and in the small bits of metallic leaf which float
 on it : if the drop of ammonia be applied to the surface of.
 the oil, the small bodies will fly still more, and the fluid
 will be seen to spread itself over the surface of the oil in the
 most visible manrieri w hile it produces in it in agitation.
     If this operatioit be performed on water, that is to say, if
 after throwing on the surface of water contained in a similar
 vessel very light bodies, such for example as bits of metallic
 leaf or raspings of cork, a drop of ammonia be brought
 near or applied, no movement will take place.         The.samq
 thing will happen if spirit of wine, or any other fluid, ,not
 oily, be used in the place of water; but if instead of these,
 supernatant bodies there be on the water a drop or two of
 oil, the latter will experience a commotion.       On the drop
 of ammonia being brought near, in a perpendicular direc
 tion, to the oil which floats on the water, if the oil be en
 tirely in the form of a drop, it causes it to dilate, and if it
 be spread over the surface of the water; it divides and is
 dispersed.      If an orange skin be squeezed over the surface
 of the water, and if a drop of ammonia be then applied, a
 slight agitation will be manifested in all the oily points with'
 which the surface of the water is interspersed.
     It appears then from these experiments, that ammonia
 renders sensible to the sight the emanations on oil, not by
mechanical impulse, but by a physical action, because it
does not manifest itself on other fluids.
     It is beyond all doubt that the shock or expansive force
of ammoniacal emanations ought to act without distinction
on all bodies, and communicate to them all the same im
pulse when they can easily move ; and a drop of ammonia
brought near to the surface of spirit of wine ought to pro
duce in it a commotion equal to that which it communi
cates to the oil, because it is equally light, and may be also,
lighter than oil;      I have found also that ammonia applied
to the srrtoke of a candle, which bends itself on the least
breath of air, does not make it move in the least. The effect
of the ammonia on the oil cannot therefore be ascribed to a
mechanical action.
    But the following is a proof which admits of no reply : —
If raspings of cork dc thrown upon water, and if a drop of
                                                       ammonia

                      between some   Kinds of Fluids.                    161
    ammonia be then brought near, no movement is produced ;
    if a few    more raspings of cork be rubbed with the fingers
   dipped in oil, and then thrown on the surface of the water, in
   another glass, on approaching another drop of ammonia, all
   these small parts will move in a wonderful
                                                       manner.        If the
   farina of wheat be thrown into another                  of
                                                   glass        water, the
   approach of a drop of ammonia will not cause these small
   moleculae to move ; but if the farina of almonds, which is
   oily, be thrown into the water, it will cause them to move,
   and precipitate them in an instant to the bottom. The same
   experiment repeated a thousand ways, will always confirm
  my conclusion, that is to say, that the action of ammonia
   is rendered sensible only on oils, and on all
                                                            oily matters,
  or matters imbibed with oil.
       I think then have proved that the repulsion exercised
                       I
  by ammonia over oil is not the effect of the force of its va-
            or emanations ; and I am of opinion that it
                                                                  ought to
  Eours
     e ascribed to the
                          attraction of surface possessed By the
  ammonia in the state of fluid, as well as of vapour, with
  oil itself, together with a chemical attraction which
                                                                     results
  from the changes which the oil
                                           undergoes when exposed
  to the effluvia of ammonia.            This phaenomenon, in my
  opinion, may be explained like that of a drop of
                                                                  spirit of
 wine exposed in the middle of a stratum of water, that is
 to say, that the repulsive force which ammonia
                                                                 seems to
 exercise over oil, arises from the
                                         expansion of the ammonia,
 or from its vapours on oil
                                    by means of the attraction of
 surface.
      If a drop    of ammonia, indeed, be thrown on the bottom
 of a    vessel,   and if a very little oil be poured around it in
 such a manner as to surround the
                                            drop of ammonia, if the
 oil be extended with the finger, and ammonia
                                                              be applied,
 the oil will be seen to recede
                                     ; but when it touches it, the
drop of ammonia will then break its limits,
                                                            extend itself
over the oil, and disperse with
                                       surprising velocity.
      The antients would have ascribed it to an
                                                          antipathy be
tween the ammonia and the oil
                                        ; but these chimerical ideas
have been banished by the
                                 light of experimental philosophy.
It does not appear that now the repulsions between                 the dif
ferent fluids can be maintained, since have     I        established the
laws of the attraction
                            of surface, which I have observed*.

     XXVI. A         new   Electrical Phenomenon.      Communicated        by
                                   a Correspondent.
              To the Editor        of the Philosopldcal Magazine.
          SIR,
     4- he following remarkable result in electricity occurred
     some time since.         If
                            you think it worthy, of insertion in
     your excellent publication, it is at your service.
         Having accidentally placed a shilling between the ball of
     my discharger and the coating of a charged jar, I was sur
     prised to find, on making the discharge, that the shilling
     adhered to the side of the jar.       Imagining that this effect
     might have proceeded from some foreign matter lodged be
     tween the shilling and the coating, I removed            it,
                                                               and care
     fully wiped both. On repeating         the  experiment the effect
     was the same as before.        That part of the. coating where
     the piece was taken from sometimes had            asmall hole in      it,
     with bur protruding outwards, something similar to that
          a
     produced on card through which
                     a                          small jar
                                                   a         is
                                                             discharged.
     I  at first imagined this effect to have been an amalgamation,
     or rather   a fusion, of the two metals. Repeating the expe
     riment with two pieces instead of one, they both adhered
     as before, as did likewise three and four.          Trying     with
                                                                      it
     five, they fell.    The jar that was made use of for these ex
     periments did not contain more than               quart
                                                       a        and not
                                                                  ;
     having   a   much larger one at hand,        cannot tell what the
                                                   I
     effect would have been had        used one four or five times as
                                         I
     big.     The same experiment being repeated with gold, brass,
     copper, &c, the result was the same.              cannot however
                                                       I
     reconcile the idea of amalgamation or fusion taking place
     in the experiments with the two and three pieces, &c, and
     am therefore totally at       loss to account for this strange
                                     a
     phenomenon.        Some of your correspondents may, perhaps.

        SIR,
In     addition to my four communications, on the invention
 of the   telescope, &c., I intended to have offered you some
reflections on the adoption and execution of the methods
lately taken in France, for establishing a natural standard
of weights and measures.                    But, after a good deal of
thought,      and   a  careful   perusal of the Report of the Com
missioners in the Memoiresde I' Institnt for 1799, the sub
ject appears to me to present such ample scope for mere
 opinion, that I find it would be impossible for me to state
 my doubts, without exciting controversy.                       Those doubts
 arose in my mind, upon reading the third Dialogue in
 Galileo's Systema Cosmicum ; Jurin's annotations on the
 4th chapter of the Geographia Generulis of Varenius ; and
the 20th proposition of the 3d book of the Principia,
edition second ; not to mention the late correction of the
admeasurements           of Mavpertuis &c. by M. StvanLerg and
other Swedish astronomers, which I have not seen.
Having no wish to propagate my scepticism, or to render
it incurable by contestation, I shall content myself with
offering you the two following extracts ; leaving you and
your intelligent readers to compare them with the Report
just mentioned, and to draw your own conclusions.                              It
will also be amusing to bring that elaborate Report into
comparison with the performances of ingenious individuals
on the same subject ; for example, with Whitehwrst's At
tempt towards obtaining invariable Measures, London
 1788 ; Essai sur les Poids el les Mesures, par M. Ber-
thoud*, Paris 1793 ; and Sir G. Shuckburgh's Memoir 011
Weights and Measures, in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1798.         It has been said, that our great individual,
Johnson,      did  more for the English language, than some
   *
       Author of  a copious, and, at   I  am told, a very good, book on    clock-
 and watch-work,      lately published   at Paris, in  3 Vols. 410,

     The first extract I have to offer is taken from the 88th
 and 89th pages of Certain Errors in Navigation detected
 and corrected, by Edw. Wright, a work to which that
 science owes many of its best improvements.             This book
 was first printed in the year 1599, but " written, many
 years hefore*."      The second edition, in which I have also
 read the following passage, appeared in 1610, and the third,
 from which I now transcribe            in 165J. Of the value of

 Hutlon§, that Wright was the first undertaker of the canal
 called The New River, to which              great part of London

 owes that abundant supply of water, which excites the ad
 miration of strangers.      But the learned gentleman          mis                   is
 taken in reckoning among Wright's works, the Havenr
 finding Art, which he only translated from the Dutch.
This appears from the dedication of copy now before me,     a
 printed in 1599; from which we also learn that our coun
tryman, Robert Norman, had, some years before, disco
vered the magnetic dip.         In 1593 and the following year,
 Wright,        by
               observing    the greatest and least heights of the
pole-star,   with     brass aquadrant of six feet radius, deter
mined the true latitude of London to be 51° 3&, instead of
51° 45', which        had till then been reckoned.
                            it                          This was                             a
wonderful performance, at          time when instruments were

so imperfect, and when the refraction had been but just de

far as I know, in your whole kingdom, an instrument on
which I could depend, in taking the exact height of the
polef." Thus, Sir, your ingenious correspondent, the
Rev. Mr. Toplu%, appears to be perfectly in the right,
when he alledges that, if our neighbours have lately over
taken, for I would gladly hope they have not yet distanced,
us in the race of science, it can only be because they are
publicly encouraged and supported in their arduous pursuits,
and we are not.         But of this more, perhaps, on some future
occasion.       It is high time to come to the immediate ob
ject of this letter.
    The marginal title of this curious passage of Wright is,
 " A most exact way to find the quantitie                   of the earth's
 semidiameter." — The paragraph itself is as follows : " This
 angle" (the Dip of the Horizon, owing to the elevation of
the observer's eye above the surface of the sea) " may other
wise be found, the quantitie of the earth's semidiameter
being first known, which is to be done divers waies ; but
they may be all reduced to two heads or kinds, whereof the
 first requireth the certain measure of some. arch of the Me
 ridian to be first given,, which is also divers waies to be
 performed. But the best and perfectest way of all others
 (viz. of exactly measuring the size of the whole earth) is
 to observe so exactly as is possible the Summer solstitiall
Altitude of the Sun at two places, so farr distant asunder,
 and lying so neer North and South each from other, with
 so direct and faire a way betweene them as convenientlv
maybe chosen. Suppose, for example, Portsmouth and
 Barwick, or some other place in the furthest part9 of Scot
 land ; for the further these places are each from other, the
more perfectly may this businesse be performed.                     Then
 measure, and plat down so truly as is possible, all the way
betweene those two places, with all the turnings and wind
 ings, ascents and descents that are therein ; out of which

the arch of the great circle, or shortest distance betwixt
them, together with the angle of declination thereof from
the true meridian line truly found by observation at either:
of those places, may most exactly be knowne : whereby
 (with helpe of the doctrine of right angled sphasricall tri
angles) the difference of the latitudes of those two places,
in miles and fuTlongs, occ. may easily appeare ; which com
pared with the difference of the latitudes of the same places,
found by observation of the Sun, in degrees and minutes,
&c. will shew how many miles and furlongs answer to one
or more degrees of the meridian : and so the whole circum
ference, diameter and semidiameter of the earth, will easily
and more truly be found, then any other way yet used for
this purpose. But meanes convenient for the triall hereof
have hitherto been wanting, and so I must omit               till   it,
some better opportunity,      itany shall befall hereafter, by
the bounty of any such as are of more ability to bear the
charge hereof.

there be any certain rule or reason given how to know
which Ear to chuse rather then other for this purpose.
And   if any error be committed herein, though insensible
(which cannot be avoided) yet in going about to make
other greater measures      byoften taking this least, and so
proceeding   a  minimis ad maxima*      so often as you take
                                           ,

a maximis ad minima, so still dividing, and the more di
minishing this error, the further we proceed ; it will in the
end, when we come to our ordinary measures most in use,
 become very insensible, and not worth the regarding."
     A"    natural standard, or universal measure" is the only
 subject of my next extract,, which is taken from pages loi
 and   1 92 of the Rev. Dr. IVilkins's
                                                " Essay towards a real
 Character, and a philosophical Language*." This work was
printed in 1668, in which year the Doctor was appointed
Bishop of Chester, but written some time before ; for the
 truly learned and ingenious author, in his dedication to
 Lord Brouncker, President of the Royal Society, says that
 when it " was done in writing, and the impression of it
 well nigh finished, it happened (among many other better
things) to be burnt in the late dreadful fire," (in 1666)
 " by which all that was printed, excepting only two copies,
and a great part of the unprintcd original, was destroyed."
     " Measures of magnitude," says Dr. Wilkins, "do com
 prehend both those of length, and of superficies or area,
 together with those of solidity, both comprehended in that
which is adjoined, viz. the word capacitv, hold, contain.
The several nations of the world do not more differ in their
languages,       than in the various kinds and proportions of
these measures.         And it is not without great difficulty, that

      From La fie tie A7. Leibnitz, prefixed to that great man.s Essais dt
Tbeodicie, by the Cbcv.de Jaucotirt, Amst. 1747, p. 101. we learn that
the celebrated Dr. Hook was delighted with this work of Wilkins; but
that M. Leibnitz, was not very well pleased with it ; having had a plan of
his own, for a real or universal character, expressive of all languages,
but which never appeared. In the same place, we are told of a well
written anonymous paper, on the same subject, which appeared in the
vear 1720, in the id vol. of the "Journal Literaire.   Some other attempts
have bteii mailt ; the lait, I believe, by my ingenious friend Dr. James
Andersou, in the Manchester Transactions, J think, or in his miscellany,
the Bit, primed at Edinburgh, or perhaps in both.         It seems probable,
that the idea was sugtiested to Dr. Wilkins by " the art of short-hand,
which," as lie says in his dedication, " is in its kind an ingenious device,
and ot considerable usefulness, applicable to any language, much won
dered at by travellers, that have been the experience of it in England :
and yet though it be above three score years, since it was first invented,
'tis not to this day (for ought I can Icarn) brought into common practice
in any other nation,"     Mr. Locke also expressed his surprise, many years
afterwards, in his tract on education, that short,hand      had never come
into use on the continent ; in some parts of which, however, it is now
almost as much practised as it is in this island ; though it be no where
cultivated so much as it deserves.

168          Wright &c.      on an Universal Measure;
the measures observed by all those different nations, wtift
traffic together, are reduced to that which is commonly
known and received by any one of them ; which labour
would be much abbreviated if they were all of them fixed
to any one certain standard ; to which purpose, it were most
desirable to find out some natural standard, or universal
measure, which hath been esteemed by learned men as one
of the desiderata in philosophy.           If this could be done in
longitude, the other measures might be easily fixed from
thence.
   " This was heretofore aimed at and endeavoured after in
all those various measures derived from natural things,
though none of them do sufficiently answer this end. As
for that of a barley-corn, which is made the common
ground and original of the rest, the magnitude and weight
of it may be so various in several times and places, as will
render it incapable of serving for this purpose ; which is
true likewise of those other measures, an inch, palm, span,
cubit, fathom, a foot, pace &c. ; none of which can be de
termined to any sufficient certainty.
   "    Some have conceived that this might be better done
by subdividing a degree upon the earth ; but there would
be so much difficulty and uncertainty in this way as would
render it unpracticable.         Others have thought it might be
derived from the quicksilver experiment ; but the unequal
gravity and thickness of the atmosphere, together with the
various tempers of air in several places and seasons, would
expose that also to much uncertainty *.
   "   The most probable way for the effecting of this, is that
which was first suggested by Dr. Clvristopher Wren, namely,
by vibration of a pendulum ; time itself being a natural
measure, depending upon a revolution of the heaven or the
earth, which is supposed to be every where equal and uni
form.      If any way could be found out to make longitude                f
commensurable to time, this might be the foundation of a
natural standard ; in order to which,
    " Let there be a solid ball, exactly round, of some of the
heaviest metals : let there be a string to hang it upon, the

smallest, limberest, and least subject to retch : let this ball
be suspended by this string, being extended to such a length,
that the spaee of every vibration may be equal to a second
minute 01 time, the string being, by frequent trials, either
lengthened or shortened, till it attain to this equality : these
vibrations should be the smallest, that can last a sufficient
space of time, to afford a considerable number of them,
either 6 or 500 at least ; for which end, its passing an arch
of five or six degrees, at the first, may be sufficient. The
              being so ordered as to have every one of its vi-
   rations equal to a second minute of time, which is to be
Eendulum
adjusted with much care and exactness ; then measure the
length of this string from its place of suspension to the
centre of the ball ; which measure must be taken as it hangs
free in its perpendicular posture, and not otherwise, because
of stretching : which being done, there are given these two
lengths, viz. of the string, and of the radius of the ball, to
which a third proportional must be found out j which must
be, as the length of the string from the point of suspension
to the centre of the ball, is to the radius of the ball, so must
the said radius be to this third : which being so found, let
two-fifths of this third proportional be set off from the
centre downwards, and that will give the measure desired.
And this (according to the discovery and observation of
 those two excellent persons, the Lord Viscount Brouncker,
President of the Royal Society, and M. Hut/gens, a worthy
member of      it)  will prove to be 3,8 Rh inland inches, or,
which   is  all one, 39 inches and        quarter, according to our

    The above extracts contain, as far as know, the earliestI
 sketches of the ingenious methods therein proposed            and                 ;
 our neglect of such suggestions of our own countrymen, has

 out adding       few explanatory remarks, which historieal

 I    apprehend   that  few philosophers in this country, and
still fewer on the continent, know to whom they really are
indebted for the proposal of         subdivision of the meridian

here of the comparative merits of these methods, or of the
combination of both,         believe the following passage from

p.  151    and the Royal Society of London proposed to

                                                           adopt
it." The learned Encyclopedists then go on to mention
the similar proposal of Amontons                       in
                                          703, and others of1                                       a
later date, particularly that of M. Condamine, who in 174                                           7
very philosophically recommended the equatorial pendulum,
as preferable    to all others, for an universal standard.
M. Berthoud, in his late excellent piece above quoted, as
signs the same date (1673) to the proposal of Hut/gens, in
p. 151 and, in the title of his 2d article, which
        ;
                                                       "Moyens                    is
d'etal/lir, &c. Away to establish an universal and perpetual
measure,        by
                 pendulum, proposed
                    a                     Huygens in 1673."by
    Thus    itappears that Wright proposed the derivation of
an universal standard from the mensuration of the meridian
in 1599, and Mouton not till 1670; and that Sir Chris
topher Wren recommended the pendulum some years before
 1668; Mouton in 1670; and Huygens not till 1673.
How many years before 1668*,         cannot say; for Sir Chris
                                              I
topher   did not publish any of his numerous   discoveries him
self; but many of them were recorded or epitomized            the                            in
Philosophical Transactions, and in the works of Wallis and
others. Not having the early volumes of the Transactions
at hand,    Ihave searched in vain for Sir Christopher.s pro
posal, now in question, throughout the first seven volumes
of the old Abridgement, which for want of good index                         a
 (for it  has several bad ones)       mere " confusion worse
                                                  is
confounded."
    Thus the mere date of W dkins's " Real Character," though
a  reprint, carries Wren's claim decisively beyond those of
both Mouton and Huygens.             may add, as the book
                                              I                                                     is

  ham, (who wrote his
                             " Artificial Clock-maker     in his juve
  nile years f") were cotemporaries of Huygens, Wren, and
  Mouton, and appear to be very impartial, dispassionate
 writers.      Their testimonies, therefore, added to the date of
  Wilkins's book, establish, beyond all doubt, Wren's right
  to he remembered, as the first proposer of the pendulum for
 an universal standard.         Huygens's discoveries on the pen
 dulum,      were  numerous     and important ; but assuredly this
 was    not  one  of them.     The   truth   is,

 time, and often on the same subjects, that their claims are
 apt to be confounded, when, as in this case, they are per
 fectly distinct.
      But, as we must not love our countrymen and their fame

 recommends the decimal division of weights and measures,

important proposition.            John Muller, commonly called
Regiomontanus, or rather his master Purbach, actually in

   The reflection of heat from a concave mirror is acknow
ledged to be of very remote antiquity. Not so what is called
                        This discovery seems to be generally
ascribed to one of our cotemporaries on the continent : with
what justice the foregoing extract shows. The experiment,
indeed, was successfully repeated, seventy years alter Porta
had put it in print, by the Academy del Cimento; it being
the ninth of their Collection of Experiments, published at
Florence in 1666.      The reflection of sound from concave
mirrors, is also a very old discoverv. This was most pro
bably the principle of the talking brazen head, which po
pular tradition, m the southern part of this island, ascribes
to Roger Bacon, in the northern, to Michael Scot, and in
foreign countries, to other cunning men.         It was no doubt
the true secret of the enchanted head in Don Quixote, and
of the 88th of the Century of Inventions, published, almost
1 50 years ago, by the Marquis of Worcester, who was un
fortunately regarded by most of his cotemporaries as little
superior, m sobriety of mind, to the knight of La Mancha.

  Society in the Session 1804-5.
The     methods hitherto employed for bringing this metal
into a  malleable state, may be comprehended under one or
other of the three following processes.
     1. To dissolve the crude platina in nitro-muriatic acid,
precipitate by muriate of ammonia, wash and dry the preci
pitate, and then expose                   it,
                                  mixed with arsenic, to such                             a
degree   of heat as  may  volatilize   the latter, leaving the pla
tina in spungy form
        a                    which,                   by
                                          gentle hammering, and
repeated exposures to           a ;
                             high degree of heat,          at length         is
rendered solid and malleable.
     2. To mix the pure precipitate with twice its weight of
mercury, and bring the whole into the state of an amalgam,
which   is  then moulded into the form of bars, and                 ex              by
posure to heat freed from the mercury, and then ham
mered, gently at first, into       solid form.
                                            a
     3. To expose the precipitate per se in         crucible to such a
a heat as may agglutinate the particles, which are then
brought into closer union by gently pressing, and at last
hammering the mass.

XXIX.          Description            of       an   improved Mill for grinding
        Painters' Colours.                By        Mr. James Rawlinson, of
        Derby*.
   SIR'
T
A have     herewith sent a model of a machine for grinding
paint, hoping that the Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, &c. may not think their time entirely lost in exa
mining if it has any merit ; and if they should be of opi
nion that it has sufficient merit to recommend it to the
public, it cannot fail of receiving that attention, from the
sanction of their approbation, which my recommendation
could not procure for it.
    The hitherto very unmechanical, inconvenient, and highly
injurious method of grinding poisonous and noxious colours,
led me first to imagine a better might easily be contrived
for that purpose. It must be obvious to every person, that
the method hitherto adopted of grinding colours on an ho
rizontal marble slab, with a small pebble muller, requires
 the body of the person who grinds to bend over that slab,
and consequently his head ; which causes him constantly to
inhale the noxious and poisonous volatile parts of the paint,
which is not unfrequently ground with oil saturated with
litharge of lead ; and if we may judge from the very un
healthy appearance of these men, accustomed to much co
lour-grinding, it should seem the bad effects of this em
ployment require a speedy remedy.
    The machine, of which I now send the society a model,
has not only the advantage of being an effectual remedy of
this extensive and severe evil to recommend          but    ennds        it,     it
the colour much easier, much finer, and much quicker,
than any method hitherto adopted.         Having occasion for                               a
considerable quantity of colour-grinding       in the profession
in which am engaged, and that in the finest state possi
                 I
ble, and having made use of this machine for several years,
and being more and more convinced of its utility,         thought              I
    my duty to present      to the Society of Arts, hoping that
                                     it
it it
    might not be altogether unworthy of their attention. The
roller of the machine that use         sixteen inches and
                                           I              is  half                    a
in diameter, and four inches and          half in breadth.    The

concave muller that         works against, covers one-third of
                                     it
that roller       :therefore evident, that with this machine
                      it   is

         Improved  Mill for grinding   Painters' Colours.    t71
I  have seventy-two square inches of the concave marble
muller in constant work on the paint, and that I can bring
the paint much oftener under this muller in a given space
of time, than I could by the usual method with the pebble
muller, which is seldom more thart four inches in diameter,
and consequently' has scarcely sixteen square inches at work
on the paint, when my concave muller has seventy-two.
I do not mean to spy that a roller, the size of that which     I
now use, is the largest which might be employed ; for truly
I believe that a roller two feet in diameter, with a concave
muller in proportion, would not be hard work for a man ;
and then the advantage to the public would be still further
increased.
    This machine will be found equally useful for the colours
ground in water, as for those ground in oils ; and I doubt
 not but the great importance of this simple machine will
be very soon generally experienced in all manufactories
where colours are used.       The labour necessary with this
machine, in grinding colours exceedingly fine, is very easy.
 It is useless to enter into any minute description in this
 place, as a bare inspection of the machine must sufficiently
 explain itself.
    To the colourman it would evidently be an essential saving
 of labour, and consequently of expense, which will proba
 bly have some weight as a recommendation; and the ad
 vantages to the colour-grinder have been already stated.
                       I am, sir, your very obedient servant,

    I was   duly favoured with your letter of the 3d instant ;
 and in reply to the questions that the committee have pro
 posed, 1 have made a rough sketch of the machine, with
 letters of reference, as supposing this may better explain
 the process.    Plate IV. fig. 1. A is the roller or cylinder
 made of any kind of marble : black marble is esteemed the
 best, because it is the hardest, and takes the best polish.
 B is the concave muller covering one-third of the roller,
 and of the same kind of marble, and is fixed in a wooden
 frame I, which is hung to the frame E at ii.       C is a piece
  of iron, about an inch broad, to keep the muller steady,
  and is fixed to the frame with a joint at      f.  The small
  binding- screw, with the fly-nut, that passes through the
  centre of the iron plate at c, is for the purpose of laving
  more pressure on the muller, if required, as well as to keep

half an inch broad, and fixed similar to a frame saw in an
iron frame k, in an inclined position to the roller, and turn
ing on pivots at dd.    G is a slide-board to draw out occa
sionallv, to clean, &c. if any particles of paint should fall
from the roller, and which also forms itself for the plate H,
to catch the colour on as it falls from the taker-off.   F is a
drawer, for the purpose of containing, curriers shavings,
which are the best ihings for cleaning paint mills. E is the
frame.
   Previous to the colour being applied to the mill, I should
recommend it to be finely pulverized in a mortar, covered
in the manner of the chemists when they levigate poisonous
drugs *. This process of dry-grinding is equally necessary
for the marble slab now in use ; after which it should be
mixed with oil or water, and with a spatula or palette-knife
put on the roller, near to the top of the concave tuuller, and
the roller turned round, which takes the colour under the
tuuller without any difficulty, and very few turns of the
roller spread it equally over its surface. When it is per
ceived sufficiently fine for the purpose required, it is very
easily taken off by means of the taker-off described, which
must be held against the roller, and the roller turned the
reverse way, which cleans it very quick and very com
pletely ; and the muller will only require to be cleaned
when you desist, or change the colour.       It is then turned
back, being hung on pinions to the frame at             ii,
                                                   and cleaned
with   apalette-knife or spatula very conveniently.      After
wards,     handful of curriers shavings held on the roller,
            a
with two or three revolutions, cleans         effectually and

there  isless waste with this machine than with any marble
slab.
   As to the quantity ground at once on this mill,        must           it
be regulated    bythe state of fineness to which       required
                                                                  a is

to be ground.     If  it   wanted to be very fine,
                           is                           smaller
quantity  must  be  put on the roller at time; and as to time
                                             a
requisite for grinding     agiven quantity of colour, this will
also depend on the state of fineness to which          ground.
                                                            it    is
I  have observed that my colour-grinder        has ground the
quantity of colour which used to serve him per day, with
this machine, in three hours, and, as he said, with ease.

The colour    also was much more to my satisfaction than in
the former way, and attended with less waste.
    I have mentioned the pulverizing the colours in a covered
mortar, which would prevent waste, and prevent the dust
and finest parts of noxious colours from being injurious to
the grinder.    In some manufactories, where large quantities
of colours, prepared from lead, copper, and arsenic, arc
used, this precaution is particularly necessary.         I do not
mean to say that my machine is intended to supersede the
paint mill now in use for coarse common colours.               It is
intended for no such purpose ; but to supersede the use of
the very awkward and unmechanical marble slab now in
use, and on which all the colours for china manufactories,
coach-painters, japanners, and colour-manufacturers              for
artists, 8cc. &c. are now ground.
    Several of the colour-manufacturers have expressed tome
 their great want of such a machine ; and that I had no de
 sire of troubling the public with a machine that would not
 answer, is evident, from my having used it several years
 before I presumed      to recommend it to their attention.
 Being therefore now completely convinced of its utility,
 and hoping that it might relieve a number of my fellow-
 creatures from a dangerous employment, I have ventured to
 commit it to the protection of the Society of Arts, hoping,
 through their means, to see its ultimate success.            And,
 further to give the society the most complete assurance in
 my power, I have annexed the opinion of a very ingenious
 and mechanical friend of mine, who has frequently seen it
 work. If any other questions should occur to the commit
  tee, that may be in my power io explain, I shall gladly do so.

     P. S. When the colour is ground, I recommend the fol
  lowing mode of tying it up in bladders, in preference to the
  usual method.     Instead of drawing the neck of the bladder
  close, in the act of tying it insert a slender cylindrical stick,
  and bind the bladder close around it.       This, when dry, will
  form a tube or pipe, through which, when the stick is with
  drawn, the colour may be squeezed as wanted, and the neck
  again closed by replacing the stick.         This is not only a
  neater and much more cleanly mode than the usual one of
  perforating the bladder, and stopping the hole with a nail,
  *t more commonly leaving it open, to the prejudice of the

 peatedly for fresh quantities or colour.
    N. B. The barrel of a quill may be tied, in place of the
 stick, into the neck of the bladder, with its closed end out
 wards, which will keep the colour secure in travelling, and
 when used, the end of the quill being cut off, it may after
 wards be closed by a stick.

    On grinding indigo, or such substance, in a dry state, in
this mill, the muller being placed in the mortar, and se
cured in the oak pieces by the pins, the indigo to be ground
is thrown above the muller into the mortar ; on turning the
handle of the axis, the indigo in lumps falls into the groove
cut through the muller, and is from thence drawn under
the action of the muller, and propelled to its outer edge
within the mortar, from whence the coarser particles again
fall into the groove of the muller, and are again ground
under it; which operation is continued till the whole of it
is ground to an impalpable powder : the muller is then easily
removed, and the colour taken out.
    A wood cover, in two halves, with a hole for the axis,
is usually placed upon the mortar, during the operation, to
prevent any loss to the colour, or bad effect to the operator.

XXXI. A new     and most accurate Method of Ranking tho
   Balance of a Time-keeper.     By Mr. W. Hardv, of
   Islington *.
T
J. his
      SIRi
         letter is accompanied with a drawing, a description*
 and a model, of a more perfect mode of banking the balance*
of a time-keeper, than any that has yet appeared ; and its
application to a time-keeper is a matter of such real im
portance, that the most accurate, without this most ncces->
sary appendage, is liable to such derangement, that from
the most trivial cause it is in one moment rendered useless.
   To preserve the good qualities of the time-keeper, on.
which often the strength, the wealth, the grandeur, and
safety of this great empire depend, I deem it necessary that
my invention should be laid before the Society of Arts, as
the means of its being more generally known ; and I hope
that I show proper respect to the society, when I assure you
that I do not offer any crude idea, neither could I think of
giving you any trouble until I had fully verified the utility
of my contrivance by several years' trial,. As I can produce
the testimony of some of the most eminent watchmakers
in favour of my invention, I look forward with some degree
of confidence, in expectatios of obtaining the approbation
of the society.
   It was at first imagined that a banking to a watch with
a free escapement was quite unnecessary, as the limits of
banking were so great as to admit of almost twice 360, or
720 degrees ; but on trial the balance was frequently found
to exceed this quantity, and that a very slight motion given
to the time-keeper (particularly when the axis. of the balance
became the axis of that motion) was sufficient to alter the
strength and figure of the pendulum spring, and position of
the pieces in respect of the balance wheel, so as to change,
the rate of the time-keeper; and, what was worse, require
a new adjustment of the balance, to accommodate itself to
the changes made in the spring, and other parts connected,
with it. Hence it became necessary that some means should
be used to stop the balance at certain limits beyond its na
tural arch of vibration ; and various attempts have been made
to effect it.   One way         is,   by
                                    moveable piece on the axis
                                           a
of the balance, which banks against pin, yet so as to suffer

the balance to vibrate more than 360 degrees.             Another
method is to have a piece moveable on a centre in one of
the arms of the balance, and applying itself as a tangent to
the pendulum spring, which passes through a hole in the
piece. It has also a knee, which almost touches the plate,
and just passes free of a pin placed in it.        But when the
balance vibrates so as to approach its utmost limits, the ac
tion of the spring, while in a state of unwinding, throws
the piece outward, so as to fall in the way of the pin, and
stop the balance from proceeding further.         Another mode
is by a straight spring, screwed upon the plate, having ^
hook at the end of            it,
                          into which    pin placed in the balance

These are the principal modes of banking now in use, and
they do not differ materially from one another in principle.
But the weight and friction of so many pieces on so delicate
an organ as that of      pendulum spring, are perhaps nearly
                           a
as hurtful to thg^time-keeper      as the injury it may sustain,

                              Quarterly Court.
J.  me following Resolutions, on the authority of   public           a
institution, must serve to tranquillize many families dis
turbed bv prevailing ill-founded reports and the notice of
                                                        ;

J 84           Original  Vaccine Pock Institution.
the privilege of letters to and from the establishment must
be especially acceptable.
    Among the resolutions were the following :
    1 . Resolved, That it appears from the numerous reports
that have been transmitted or attested by the members of
the medical establishment from abroad, from our own
country, and from their own experience, that the propor
tion of failures in the cow-pock inoculation to give secu
rity against the small-pox, which have been published,
does not amount to more than 50 out of 250,000 vacci
nated persons.
    2. Resolved,   That it does not appear on examination of
the published reports of these failures, and the investigation
of many of them by the medical establishment of this insti
tution, that ten have been substantiated by admissible and
adequate evidence.
    3. Resolved, That it seems more than probable, that all
or many of even the admitted of failure, according to the
evidence produced, are liable to be deceptions, on the same
grounds as in the asserted cases of the occurrences of the
small pox, subsequent to the small pox.
    4. Resolved, That, considering that the cow pock inocu
lation has been the practice of producing an affection which
practitioners in the first instances in general had not previ
ously seen, and the history of which was so little known,
 and considering the greater deceptions than in the small
 pox inoculation to which practitioners are exposed, it was
 to have been expected that a much greater proportion of
 supposed failures would have occurred.
    5. Resolved, That it does not appear that a single instance
has occurred of the small pox, subsequent to the cow pock,
 during more than five years practice at this institution; for,
 on inquiry, two instances which were said to be such were
 found to be inadmissible cases : viz. one of them on ac
 count of the supposed cow pock preceding being only a
 local affection ; and in the other, that it was only proved that
 there was a local affection from the variolous inoculation.
     fl. Resolved, That the numerous instances of exposure of
 vaccinated persons to the small pox since the commence
 ment of the practice in January in 1799, and likewise of
 repeated re-inoculation with small pox matter at this insti
 tution, and which have been communicated, establish the
  fact, that a person who has really gone through the cow
  pock is incapable of the small pox, on as firm ground as
  the fact of variolous inoculation giving security against the
  small pox.
                                                           7- Re-

            Original    Vaccine Pock Institution,          1 85
  7. Resolved,   That considering  the novelty cf the practice
of vaccine inoculation, and that it has not been performed
in many instances, after such a mode as might give the
greatest chance of security ; it is advisable to take precau
tionary measures with many who have been inoculated, or
who shall undergo the practice in future.
    8. Resolved, That the tests of patients who have been
inoculated being secure, are, exposure to effluvia and con
tact with persons in the small pox; inoculation with small
pox matter, and re-inoculation with vaccine matter. But,
for reasons set forth in a memoir read at the quarterly meet
ing by Dr. Pearson, the repetition of re-inoculation with
vaccine matter is a preferable test ; for it does not appear,
 from abundant evidence brought forward by the experience
of Dr. Pearson, that a person who has gone through the
 cow pock is susceptible of it a second time.
    9. Resolved, That such practitioners as are desirous of
seeing proofs of the proposition last stated, that a second
 inoculation for the cow pock is an equally decisive test of
 the question of the susceptibility of a vaccinated person to
 take the small pox as inoculation with variolous matter, be
 invited to attend at the institution, for that purpose.
     10. Resolved, That although it is probable, from the
 amount of the deaths by the small pox in the bills of mor
 tality in two preceding years, viz. in 1803, of 1202; and
 in 1804, of 622, that the proportion of deaths by that
 disease has been diminished by vaccine inoculation ; yet it
 does not appear justifiable to draw this conclusion positive
 ly at present —because, in former years, previously to the
  new practice, even a still smaller proportion occurred by
  small pox, viz. in 1795, there were 1040; in 1797, there
  were only 522; and in 1799, there were 1111: therefore
that it will require at least five successive years of vaccine
practice to draw a just inference.
   11. Resolved, That Dr. Pearson be requested to allow
the memoir on the state of the practice of vaccination, and
on the conduct of      it,to be printed, in order to quiet the
minds of many families disturbed        by the late unfavourable
reports.
   12. Resolved, That the medical establishment continue
their practice of registering their observations, as the most
likely means to reduce to certainty the vaccine practice as   a
prophylactic of the small pox.
    13. Resolved, That although the conduct of this institu
tion, under the economical management of the treasurers,
Thomas Payne and John,Heaviside,Esqrs. and the trustees,

  has   been  such, that the subscriptions hitherto have been
  sufficient to defray the expenses, without requesting addi
  tional aid from the present supporters ; yet, to accomplish
  the objects of the institution to their full extent, it will be
  requisite that further contributions be requested from the
  public, and that the present subscribers particularly be re
  spectfully solicited to use their interest for that purpose.
     The number inoculated since the last report amounts to
  2337-
     Subscribers of ten guineas arc Life Governors ; of two
 guineas annually are Electors, and of one guinea annually

     All persons, with or without letters of recommendation,
  are admitted for inoculation every Tuesday and Friday, at
  one o'clock.
     Subscriptions will be thankfully received by Messrs.
 Devaynes and Co. Pall Mall, and by Mr. Sancho, at the

 dorsement— " On the business of the Broad-street Vaccine
 Institution."
                 By order,       William     Sancho,   Secretary.
                METALLIC NATURE OF OCHROIT.
     M. Gehlen, of Berlin, has received from Messrs,         Hi-
 singer and Berzelius, a memoir on the analysis of the
 ochroit of Klaproth.       They consider the new substance
contained in this fossil as a metallic oxide, and they give
 to the metal the name of Cerium, from the planet Ceres.
They have, however, judged of the nature of it only from
the phoenomena of the oxidation exhibited by the substance,
for hitherto they have not been able to obtain it in a me
tallic state.
                 CHARACTERS OF PURE NICKEL.
    M. Richter is employed in examining the nature of
nickel.     In its state of purity, this metal is exceedingly
nialleable ; it is also almost as brilliant as silver, and more
susceptible of attraction by the magnet than iron.       He as
                                                           serts,

serts, that in the purest state in which it has been hitherto
obtained it contains still a great deal of copper. M. Rich-
ter has discovered a sure method of freeing it from that
metal.
    Purified oxides of nickel are of a much livelier green co
lour than common oxides, and their solution in ammonia
is of a very pale blue colour.
   ALKALINE         METALLIC SOLUTIONS           PRECIPITATED        BY
             OTHER     METALS,      AND BY PHOSPHORUS.
     Klaproth has found that solutions of metallic oxides in
 alkalies are as easily precipitated in the metallic state, by-
 other metals soluble in the same salts, as also by phospho
 rus, as acid metallic solutions are.          He makes a very inge
 nious application to analysis of tin ores, according to a
 method which he indicates in his (Beitraege) collections.
 In this process, tungsten is separated by zinc from tung-
 state of ammonia, under the form of black flakes.
 DECOMPOSITION, BY BOILING WATER, OF SUCCINATE OF
                    IRON OXIDATED AT A MINIMUM.
     Bucholz, in examining M. Gehlen's method of separat
 ing iron and manganese by the help of succinate of potash,
  has found that succinate of iron, oxidated at a minimum, is
  entirely decomposed by boiling it with distilled water, so
 that the water dissolves the acid with an inappreciable
 quantity of oxide. The same chemist is employed in exa
 mining uranium and its combinations.
                               GALVANISM.
     Brugnatelli, in a letter to M. van Mons, says, Volta is
  still employed ou electricity.           He has lately constructed
  different pile's, composed merely of saline substances of a
  different nature, with solutions of which he impregnated
  disks of bone.
      I have lately, adds he, gilt in a complete manner two
  large silver medals, by bringing them into communication,
  by means of a steel wire, with the negative pole of a Vol
  taic pile, and keeping them, one after the other, immersed
  in ammoniuret oi gold newly made and well saturated*.
     •
        The result here detailed reminds me of one somewhat similar,
  which took place during some experiments performed some years ago
  at the Askeiian rooms.    Some gold leaf was put loose upon a new piece
  cf copper coin, which was then brought into the circuit of the pile ; a
  part of the gold was inflamed, and other portions adhered to the surface
   of the copper as completely as if they had been attached by any common
  gliding  process.   Edit.
                                                                     NEW

 J88              New Metal in Platina   *—- Astronomy.
                      NEW METAL     IN PLATINA.
   I have seen with pleasure, says Brugnatelli, in a letter to
the same, that Fourcroy and Vauquelin have found a new
metal in platina.   I must observe that I obtained separately
a long time ago the substance which gives colour to solu
tions or" platina. I enlarged, by eight or ten parts of water,
the solution of that crude metal, and added to it a solution
of muriate of ammonia. The mixture at first did not be
come turbid, but after same minutes, the sides and. bottom,
of the jar were covered with the red matter in shining
moleculae, and similar to that of whichT send you a spe
cimen.
                            ASTRONOMY.
     M. Harding, of Lilienthal,    near Bremen, has discovered
 a new   planet,  to which   he  has  given the name of Juno.
 While comparing with the heavens the fifty thousand stars
 observed by Messrs. Lalande, he saw one of the eighth
 magnitude, which appeared to him to have a motion or its
 own.     He observed it several days, and soon found that it
 was a planet.
   On the 5th of September, its right ascension was 1° 5&,
    Its north declination 0° 1 1'.
   M. Burckhardt observed it on the 23d of September, at
 359° 7', and 4° 6', and thence concluded that the duration
of its revolution is five years and a half.
   Its inclination is 21°.
   Its excentricity is a quarter of its radius.
   Its mean distance from the sun is three times that of
the earth, that is to say, it is about a hundred millions of
leagues ; it is consequently a little farther distant from the
sun than Ceres and Pallas, which are only ninety-six mil
lions of leagues.
   Its diameter has not yet been measured, but it appears,
like a star of the eighth magnitude.
   Its size appears nearly equal to that of Ceres, orof the pla
net discovered by Piazzi. As astronomers daily observe                 it,
more precise elements of     maybe obtained. Juno the 2th.

also two new satellites to Saturn; Piazzi discovered Ceres;
Olbers discovered Pallas and Harding has discovered Juno.
                            ;
 M. Piazzi,         the astronomer, of Palermo,       in   a   letter to
M. Delalande,        says, that he has observed  the fixed stars
                                                 in
a   change   of   one, two, and three seconds, according to the.

                           GEOLOGT.
   The following authentic account of an ascent to the
summit of one of the highest mountains in the Tyrol, has
been published in the Vienna court gazette : — " For some
years past, doctor Gebhard has been employed in exploring
the Tyrol in all directions by the order of his royal highness
the archduke John, who exerts himself with so much zeal
and makes so many sacrifices to promote the good of his
country.     One of the most interesting consequences of this
measure, which promises to furnish abundance of matter
to geology, botany, mineralogy, and natural history in ge
neral, is the late ascent to the summit of the Orteler, the
highest mountain in the Tyrol, which is covered with eter
nal snow and ice. By his highness's orders, Dr. Gebhard
proceeded to Glurus in the Vintschgau, and thence exa
mined all the valleys which obtain their water from the
Orteler, in order to ascertain the most favourable point for
ascending the mountain ; but he began to doubt of the pos
sibility of accomplishing this enterprise, when a hunter of
chamois goats, from the village of Passayer, a man habi
tuated to the dangers of these precipices, offered to become
his guide. Dr. Gebhard added to him as companions two
boors from the Ziller valley, who had attended him during
his excursions among the mountains, and one of whom
possessed sufficient knowledge to observe two barometers
which they carried with them.
    About two o'clock in the morning, September 27, they
set out from Drofui, and between 10 and 1 1 reached the
very summit of the mountain.         But they could scarcely
remain here four minutes.       These they employed in ob
serving the barometer ; and about eight in the evening
returned to Drofui half benumbed, and, at first, deprived
of the power of speech. Without resting more than the
above four minutes, they had wandered during seventeen
hours ever rocks, snow, and ice, in many places at the
hazard of their lives. Both the barometer? observed on the
$ummit were exceedingly good, and agreed. Corresponding
observations were made at Mais. The height of the moun
 tain above Mais is therefore known, but the elevation of
Mais above the sea has not yet been calculated. It may

  however be estimated, that the summit of the Ortelef is af
  least 19,200 Paris feet above the level of the Mediterranean.
     His royal highness has caused huts and places of shelter
  to be erected below and above the glaciers, roads to be cut
  out in the rocks, and ropes to be extended along them, in
  order to open a safe passage for the friends of geology, and
  those fond of the sublime beauties of nature, to the summit
  of a mountain, next to Montblanc, the highest in Europe.
     The ingenious and profound researches by which Cuvier
  was able to discover and restore entirely the fossil skeletons
  of several animals found in the quarries of Montmartre, and
 of whichan alogous ones exist, are well known. The method
  by which he effected this restoration has been confirmed in a
 striking manner, by the discovery he has made of a skeleton
 of the opossum, an animal the genus of which is now con
 fined exclusively to America. All the bones of this skeleton,
 and those in particular by which it is characterized in the
 most striking manner, were not at first discovered in the
 stone ; but the relations which M. Cuvier knew to exist
 between the different organs, and which be calls the zoolo
 gical laws, enabled him to judge from what he saw of what
 he did not see. Such is the certainty of these relations,
 that M. Cuvier was able to predict, that in searching further
 in the quarry the two characteristic bones of this species,
 those which serve to support the edges of the bag in which
 the opossum carries its young, would be found. Experience
 confirmed what theory had foreseen.
    This fact is no less curious than embarrassing to the
 gcologues. M. Cuvier observes, that it entirely overturns
 almost all their systems in regard to fossil animals : —
 " Hitherto," says he, " they would see in the fossil bones
 of the North the animals of Asia only. They allowed, also,
that the animals of Asia had passed over to America, and
had been there buried, at least in the north ; but it
                                                         would
seem that the American genera never quitted their
                                                         native
soil, and that they never extended to those countries which
form at present the old continent. This is the second proof
I have   discovered of the contrary."

   I am ignorant, says Giobert, whether you know, that ac
cording to the experiments of Spallanzani, it appears to be
proved, that snails absorb oxygen, not onlv by other organs
than the lungs, but also through their shells, and that this
absorption continues some time after their death : even
when the shell of a snail has been freed from the animal it
contained, it seems to continue to absorb oxygen.
                   INUNDATION      OF   THE TYBER.
  A   letter from Rome, dated February 21, says, Andrew
Vinci, hydraulic engineer,    has published the result of his
observations on the last inundation of the Tyber; whence
it appears that the waters rose this year forty-two Roman
palms above their usual level, and, on the whole, higher
than in all the inundations which have before taken place.
Monsiguor Naro, president of the department of waters,
has ordered that an inscription shall be placed on the shore
to transmit to posterity the remembrance of this terrible
inundation.     The greatest remembered was that of the year
 1750: the one this year exceeded it by four palms. On
the 3 1 st of January the water covered all the neighbouring
plains, penetrated to all the lower parts of the city, and in
undated a great portion of them : the Hue de la Cours, the
places Navone and Dc la Hotonde, the church in the latter,
and all the adjacent quarters, were covered with water: in
 that of the Jews, the water rose to the first stories.   The
 waters did not retire within their usual bed till the day of
 the Purification of the Virgin.

It is so constructed that it mav remain exposed to the open          •

meridian with a black horse-hair, which when it breaks lets
go the catch of a hammer which strikes on a bell.         When
the faintest ray of the sun appears, the hair crisps and
breaks : a ray less brilliant than that which makes the
shadow on a sun-dial appear distinctly,       sufficient for this

194             Account   of the Aerial   Voyage
was placed in me,      I embraced it with pleasure ; and, after
 the accomplishment of the excursion, I now have the ho
 nour of laying before the academy the following account of
 the experiments and observations I made.
    The experiments proposed by the academy, which were
 to be made at the greatest distance from the earth, have
 been already described by several aeronauts, but have been
 either doubted or entirely rejected : as for example, the
 faster or slower evaporation of fluids ; the decrease or in
 crease of the magnetic force ; the inclination of the mag
 netic needle ; the increase of the power in the solar rays to
 excite heat ; the greater faintness of the colours produced
 by the prism ; the existence or non-existence of the electric
 matter; some observations on the influence and changes
 which the ratification of the air occasions in the human
 body ; the flying of birds ; the filling with air, flasks ex
 hausted by Torricelli's method, at each fall of an inch in
 the barometer j and some other chemical and philosophical
 experiments.
    The instruments I carried with me for these experiments
were:
    1st, Twelve flasks in a box with a lid.
    2d, A barometer and thermometer.
    3d, A thermometer.
    4th, Two electrometers, with sealing-wax and sulphur.
    5th, A compass and magnetic needle.
   6th, A watch that beat seconds.
   7th, A bell.
   8th, A speaking-trumpet.
   9th, A prism of crystal.
    10th, Unslaked lime, and some other things for che
mical and philosophical experiments.
   But as no means have hitherto been found of ascertain
ing with certainty over what part of the earth a balloon is
hovering, and to what quarter it is driven by the wind,
especially when there are clouds below     it,   b'y
                                                   which means
terrestrial objects cannot be seen, and where the aeronaut
in his car (where he    is   not sensible of the motion of the
balloon)  cannot   discover the direction ofit for want of fixed
objects of comparison,  I    employed the two following me
thods to ascertain to which side it was impelled       the wind
                                                        by           :

  angles, fastened them wiih thread, and suspended it from
  the car with a piece of packthread. This light body showed
  me, as will be hereafter mentioned, better than I could have
  believed, all the variations in the direction of the balloon ;
  on which account I shall call it the way-wher.
     The balloon was filled with hydrogen gas in the Garden
  of the first corps of Cadets, whence it ascended in the pre
  sence of a great many persons of distinction, the members
 of the Academy of Sciences, and various men of science.
 The decomposition of the water was effected by sulphuric
 acid and iron filings, mostly from cast iron.             The che
 mical apparatus consisted of twenty-five vessels, from each
 of which a tin-plate tube was conveyed to a tub. For se
 parating the carbonic acid gas, unslaked lime was thrown
 into water. Into each vessel were put three pood of iron
 filings with fifteen pood of water, and three pood of sul
 phuric acid were poured over them. The balloon began to
 be filled at eleven in the morning ; and, though the opera
 tion was completed at four in the afternoon, the experi
 ments to serve as a point of comparison with those made
 in the higher regions of the atmosphere retarded our voyage
 till a late period. The balloon contained 9000 cubic feet of
 hydrogen gas.

     The balloon, which in order to try its strength was first
filled with common air, was thirty English feet in diameter,
and perfectly round ; but in the air, as it was not entirely
filled with hydrogen gas, but sufficiently so for the voyage,
it appeared to be elongated.
    1 he wind was north-east, and favourable for our purpose;
but, that I might ascertain the direction of it more accu
rately, we let off" a small balloon before our departure at
about seven o'clock.        At first it was driven by the north-

east wind      towards the land side ; but when it rose to a
greater height it appeared to change its direction, and pro
ceed straight towards the sea.         Nevertheless we did not sus
pend our aerial voyage ; but, having put into the car every
necessary,     placed ourselves in it.     But as one of the most
important experiments in my opinion was to collect air in
the exhausted flasks which I took with me, at different
heights, at each fall of an inch in the barometer, which
rendered a gradual and slow ascent of the balloon necessary,
we added so much ballast to that already taken in, after we
had seated ourselves in the car, that the balloon was not
able to raise us up.        About fifteen minutes after seven,
when     the   barometer   stood    at 30 inches English, and the
thermometer indicated 19 degrees of heat, we threw out a
handful of the ballast, which consisted of sand. The bal
loon immediately began very slowly to rise, but sunk down
again over the Neva after it had attained to a considerable
height.      The reason of this, in all probability, was, that
the balloon had been surrounded by a very warm atmo
sphere at the earth, by which means the gas in it occupied
more space, and was the cause of its greater lightness ; but
at a height where the air, particularly over the Neva, was
colder, where the matter of heat was absorbed by the wa
tery vapours which arose, and where the hydrogen gas, on
cooling, contracted, by which the balloon became smaller
and heavier in regard to the more rarified air, it must ne
cessarily lose some of its power to ascend, and consequently
fall a little. But after a small quantity of ballast was thrown
out, the balloon again rose.           The telescope, fixed in the
bottom of the car, clearly showed me the places over which
we were. The balloon, according to appearance, took its
direction towards the kind side.            About 31 minutes after
seven, when the barometer had fallen to 29 inches, and the
thermometer indicated 18 degrees of heat, I filled the first
flask with air; the second I filled at 37 minutes past seven,
the barometer being at 28 inches, and the thermometer at
 17 degrees of heat.      I filled the third flask at 42 minutes
past  seven,    at which time   the barometer stood at 27 inches,
and the thermometer had fallen to 15 degrees.                 At this
time,    or  at  this height,   I  experienced   a  heaviness  in my
ears,  but   in  conversing  I  heard   as well as before.    During
the continuation of our voyage the balloon turned round
several times.       This always took place gradually, slowly,
and almost imperceptibly.          The direct motion of the bal
loon during a perfect calm, and when there is no apparent
motion in the air, is not perceptible.           In consequence of
                                                                  the

doga, Cronstadt, &c.          I here threw out the paper way-
wiser I had made ; by means of which I observed, not only
here, but during the rest of the voyage, that it showed
much quicker than the barometer, the direction and also
the sinking and rising of the balloon ; for as soon as the
balloon fell, the way-wiser, as it was much lighter than the
balloon, and found more resistance in falling, flew up and
rose almost up to       it,  so that    was necessary to pull

manner, that       person habituated to such observations could
easily   determine    with    acompass, from the position of the
way-wiser,     the true  direction of the balloon. As we found
ourselves, with     a north-east wind, over the islands at the
mouth of the Neva, Mr. Robertson was afraid, in conse
quence of the changed direction of the small balloon which
was let off from the Garden of the Cadets, that the wind
might drive us out to sea for     ;      well known that in the
                                          it   is
atmosphere there are several currents of air which have                 a
contrary course, and which in all probability produced the
before-mentioned cruciform turning of the balloon.          Not
being accustomed to this cruciform movement,             was notI
able, by    the way-wiser, to determine the real direction of
the balloon, and on this account Mr. Robertson suffered to
escape a    considerable quantity of gas on which wc again

past seven.
  At this height    the heaviness in my ears went off, and            I
experienced   in them no more heaviness.   Having continued
our voyage along the coast     good way behind Katerinenhof,
                                      a

25 minutes past eight the barometer stood at 26 inches, and
the heat was equal to 14£ deirrees.   Here filled the fourth

selves over the water, at height where the barometer stood
                              a
at 25 inches, and the heat had decreased to 13 degrees.
At this height we could see the circles produced in the
water  by the fall of some bottles which  threw down. The
                                                        I

about 45 minutes past eight we found ourselves entirely
over the terra firma.    Here we could see at one view the
Newski islands at the mouth of the Yamelianof ka, and the
whole of that river. As wc were now at distance from        a

height where the barometer stood at 23 inches, and the
beat was 6+ degrees.      At this height I filled the seventh

a dove.    One of the canary birds, when let loose from the

perhaps of the air not being perceptibly more rarified. About
30 minutes past nine the barometer had fallen to 22 inches,
and the thermometer indicated 4-J- degrees of heat.              now I
filled the eighth flask with air. Before this          suffered the

    At this height we saw the sun, but only one half; and
 on account of the thick fog which took place,          cannot say

a   cloud.  The earth, covered with this fog, seemed to be
 involved    in  smoke-coloured atmosphere, through which
                  a
 objects could not be clearly distinguished             by

magnetic needle which I took with me for the purpose of
examining the inclination was spoilt, I was desirous of try
ing whether the magnetic power had as much influence over
iron as at the earth.      With this view 1 placed a common
magnetic needle on a pin, and, to my great astonishment,
saw the north pole of it rise considerably, while the south
      sunk down, making an angle of eight or ten degrees,

   repeated this several times        and, to be more certain,
                                            ;                              I
gave the needle to Mr. Robertson, that he might make the
same experiment.         The result, however, was always the
same.     The magnetic needle, which          have still in my pos

others,   1 was   not able to make. At this height           did not

experience     the  smallest  change   in regard  to myself;  except
that my ears seemed, as             were, benumbed. My pulse
beat as on the earth, that              is, it

was exceedingly tranquil and cheerful, and experienced no
change or uneasiness.       At that time there were white clouds
at   a great height    over  us, but the heavens in general were
clear and bright yet though the sky was so clear
                       ;                                       could   I
observe no stars.          now proposed to Mr. Robertson to
                           I
continue our voyage the whole night, in order that we
might sec the sun rise, and to make some other experiments;
but ignorance of the local situation of the country, the al- ~
most total consumption of our ballast, and the continual,
though slow, sinking of the balloon, prevented him from
acceding to my proposal. While wc were flying over se
veral villages and rivers,      took my speaking-trumpet, and,
                                    I
directing     ittowards the earth, called out as loud as could.    I
Contrary to expectation,           heard, after

I then called out again; and each time the echo repeated my
words.    I   observed that the sound was reverberated in ten
seconds   ;  but   I could not remark* the height of the baro
meter, because we had begun to make preparations for de
scending to the earth        and to effect this as slowly as possi
                                :
ble, for the sake of seeuritv, we tied all our instruments
and warm clothing into          bundle and let

                           rope. The balloon, which was driven
                            a
by  the wind with considerable force, and wich fell with great
rapidity, was so light when the bundle touched the earth,
that it  drew up the rope, and endeavoured again to ascend.

200       Aerial  Voyage undertaken  at Petersburgh.
In  the mean time Mr. Robertson gradually suffered the gas
to escape,   and the balloon descended slowly, and touched
the earth so softly, that we did not experience the least
shock ; though the contrary is for the most part the case
when balloons arc suffered to descend, and in consequence
of the violence with which they touch the earth great danger
is experienced.     We descended safe to the earth, at 45 mi
nutes past ten, on the estate of counsellor Demidof, in a
field almost opposite to his house; and his boors and servants
assisted us to arrange and pack up the balloon.          By the
bundle being dragged on the earth, the greater part of the
instruments were spoilt.     Of the eight flasks filled with air
brought    from  the atmosphere, four only were fit for being
subjected   to experiment; namely, numbers 1, 4, 6, and 7 ;
but I did not venture to examine them.        In the rest, after
the necks were inverted under the quicksilver, none of the
latter ascended ; from which it appears that they were not
sufficiently stopped.
   The aerial voyage, set on foot by the academVj being thus
ended, though I made experiments on the electric matter
and the magnet, filled the flasks with air at different heights,
made observations on myself and on the direction of the bal
loon during my voyage, I must confess that I am not able
from these first experiments to draw any certain conclu
sions ; because the small height to which the balloon rose,
contrary to my wish ; the consumption of the ballast by the
balloon's twice rising ; the lateness of the time ; the short
duration of the voyage, and other circumstances, were the
principal causes which prevented me from making all the
experiments appointed by the academy, and from making
them with that accuracy which is necessary to deduce from
them any well founded physical conclusions.
   But I hope I shall have an opportunity of repeating all
these experiments with greater accuracy.      For, since I have
experienced the nature of a voyage of this kind, I have no
doubt that 1 shall be able to direct a balloon; to make ob
servations in general on the filling of one, which may be
of great use to the aeronaut during his voyage in the air ;
and to make some improvement in the method of throwing
out ballast, or lightening the balloon ; and in making expe
riments.     But on this subject I shall have the honour of
giving the academy further information.

                 says this ore was discovered          in
                                                 these mines    Raspe,         by               a
German.     Mr. Nicholson,       his Chemical Dictionary, '7V5» remarks
                                 in
that this ore had not then been found, except at Catharineburgh,                          in   Si
beria.   I do not know that these two red lead ores have been ascertained
to be precisely the same, or that any difference between them has been
discovered.

 §    In this parish Mr. W.  Reynolds, about ten years ago, put       prac           in
tice an idea he had conceived some years before, of uncovering the strata
of ironstone and coal which lay near the surface, so as to get the whole of
                                                                        the

Broseley, and which
                                " promise a lasting and plentiful
supply
            * for the great iron manufactures in that neigh
bourhood, for domestic use, and as an export to other
counties by the river Severn, on or near the sides of which
they lie."         South of these works, and on the other side of
Bridgenorth from them, coal appears again. It may be
found in most parts of ihe hundred of Stottesden ; but the
 roads in general are an obstruction to its being removed.
 South again of these, and of the Clee hills, are very valua
 ble coal-works, in some of which the canal, or kennel coal,
 is found.       Mr. Pennant, in his Voyage to the Hebrides,
 remarks, that the name is probably candle coal, from givinc
 a light that supersedes, in poorer houses, the use of candles;
 and the bishop of Llandaff, in his Chemical Essays, has the
 same idea, supported by the circumstance,                      that in the.
 northern counties candles are called cannels.                   The south
 west parts of this county have not yet been proved to con
 tain coal ; and the inhabitants purchase, at a great expense
 of land carriage, coal from the Clee hills, or from collieries
 in the west parts of Shropshire : such there are west and
  south-west of Shrewsbury. Again, on the west and north
  west borders of the county, coal of a good quality is gotten.
  Out of fifteen hundreds, the following large proportion of
  ten are known to produce coal : viz. Oswestry, Ford,
  Shrewsbury, Bradford South, Brimstvy, Wenlock, Cun-
  dover, Munslow, Overs, and Stottesden.                       Mr. William
  Reynolds has favoured me with the following lists of strata
  in five different collieries in the eastern districl.            His name
  will add an interest and value to the communication in the
  opinion of all those who have the pleasure of knowing him.

     We   see then, that in the first-mentioned coal pit, no coal
  was found   within much    less than 30 yards of the surface, and
  that then three small layers of bad coal only were gotten :
  that after sinking near 24 yards deeper, three other layers
  of the same coal were procured, but that the first vein of
  good coal lay 92 yards beneath the surface : that this vein
 was 4 feet thick : that none of the veins appear to have been
 more than 5 feet thick : and that in 154 yards, and more,
 regularly worked, or above 254, taking in the whole expe
 riment, 13 yards 2 feet of coal were found.           In the second
 pit specified, the coal appears to have been met with in little
 more than 21 yards from the surface.               One of the veins
 proved 6 feet thick ; and in sinking somewhat less than 44
 yards, above 7 yards thickness of coal was discovered. In
 the third pit specified, the sulphureous or bad coal was met
with in* 16 yards from the surface, and good coal in les3
 than 28 yards ; no vein exceeded 3 feet ; and the aggregate
in almost 68 yards was not quite nine yards of coal. In
the fourth pit specified, the first unmixed coal was 50 yards
from the surface ; and in sinking above 1 1 6 yards, it does
not appear that here was any vein thicker than 2 feet ; and
the aggregate of unmixed coal measured only 5 feet 2 inches
in thickness.

XXXVI.       On Metallic Sulphur ets. By Professor       PnousT*.
JVLetals,      says Berthollet, may combine in proportions
exceedingly various with sulphur; and the combinations
they thus form have different properties, according to their
proportions, &c. Considering the generality with which
Berthollet establishes this opinion, there is reason to be
astonished that he should have neglected to lay before the
reader the facts on which it seems to rest. Silver, mercurv,
platina, copper, antimony, arsenic, lead, tin, bismuth, &c.

 do not,    however, afford one example of variable sulphura-
 tions.    Iron, hitherto, is the only metal which appears
 capable of being sulphurated in two proportions, and these,
 instead of having any thing variable, are on the contrary
 constant and fixed, as are those of its oxidation.
    " I am    in opposition to Proust, who pretends that sul
 phur has been fixed for iron, by the invariable law of pro
 portions, at 60 per cent."
    This result, however, is as certain as invariable, what
 ever be the number of times the trial is made : he himself
 gave this opinion, to which Berthollet refuses his assent.
    He says, <rPyrites may contain a variable surplus, as far
 as twenty parts and more, &c."
    I cannot discover a similar variation*.             Iron is either at
 60, or at 90, or 100.       The first sulphuret is that which we
usually make in our laboratories, for the decomposition of
water; and the second is pyrites itself. In a Avord, the
case with sulphuration of this metal is the same as with
oxidation.      The principle which presides at one of these
combinations, presides certainly at the other; and if neither             •
nature nor art exhibit to us any where intermediate states
between these terms, we ought not to be forward to admit
variable sulphurations.
    " If heat can more easily expel this sulphur, considered
as foreign, this is a common property, &c."
    Sulphur separated from iron by the action of fire cannot
be qualified with the name of foreign, because it is a neces-
sary element of a combination, which a high temperature
destroys, to reduce it to another which can support it.
The sulphur which we extract by distillation, from an argil,
a sulphate, a stony concretion, &c. is foreign to their es
sence, but the same cannot be said of a pyrites.                    If  I
made use of these expressions, it was contrary to my in
tention.
    " This chemist admits that black copper is sulphuret
dissolved by copper.        This solution exhibits in reality suc
cessive proportions of sulphur and copper, &c."
   This manner of speaking, employed by Berthollet, ought
to excite surprise : it tends to throw obscurity on distinc
tions which are however clear. When sulphur is prepared
in a copper crucible, a sulphuret of 28 per cent, is obtained,
and copper holding in solution variable quantities of that
sulphuret : the latter may be separated from the copper

without decomposing it. Is this then a simple solution of
sulphur in copper ? No one will suppose it.
    " He pretends that a dose of sulphur invariably fixed by
nature, attaches itself to antimony, and that man can nei
ther increase nor diminish it. He fixes this proportion at
25 per cent."
    It is not I, but nature, or whatever power you will,
which places a barrier between it and the efforts of every
chemist who might propose to make sulphuret of antimony
beyond or within this proportion : I have not therefore
assigned it any law of my invention ; I have only verified
it.    I have followed this precept, which Berthollet himself
traces out to us in his profound work.        When a substance,
therefore, says he, combines with another, we must deter
 mine the proportions, examine the properties, &c. Such
 indeed has been the constant object of the efforts of che
 mists since the time when they found that this determina
 tion was one of the most important bases of the history of
 combinations, and of the science of analysis.           No one,
 however, will doubt, that nature cannot abandon her com
 pounds to the chance of the variable proportions, which
 Jkrthollet has chosen as the basis of his system ; but it is
  no less true, that in proportion as the sphere of sulphurets
 extends,     we do not see that the new facts which each day
  accumulates are of a nature to strengthen it.
     " He has however found sulphurets of antimony which
  had an excess of sulphur.      Sulphurets of copper, of lead,
  &c., are also found mixed with a like excess." But if it
  can be taken away without changing their appearance, with
  out taking any thing from the characters and qualities
  which distinguish these sulphurets, I shall say that this
  sulphur is foreign to them. The same thing cannot be
  said of a pyrites, from which has been taken the sul
  phur, which makes the difference between sulphuret at a
  minimum, and that at a maximum. That there should be
  sulphur mixed with sulphurets, without making part of
  their constitution, is not surprising.       We see it every day
  mixed in the same manner with argil, alum, sulphate of
  lime, 8cc.
     " He has combined oxide of antimony with different
  proportions of sulphuret, and he had mixtures which may
  be represented by this formula : oxide +1 + 2+3, &c.
  of sulphuret of antimony : Has      it.  not thereby formed real
  combinations? 8cc."
  I     shall reply to this, that solutions begun, or which have
                                                               not

 not reached the term of saturation of which they are
 thought to be capable, ought to be considered otherwise
 than terminated combinations ; but to elucidate my idea, I
 have denoted these solutions as I should denote those of
 sugar and water : it is water         +1+2    + 3, &c. of sugar.
    I cannot sec, indeed, that one can form clearer ideas of
 the solutions of sulphurct of antimony in its oxide.           All
 chemists have hitherto thought that this glass, this liver,
 this crocus, were sulphurated oxides. The object of my
 labour was to undeceive us on this point ; to show that it
 was necessary to renounce these sulphurated oxides, which
we admit only on hearsay, in order to receive in their stead,
a new kind of combination, no doubt, but which is fully
proved to exist.     This combination indeed is repugnant to
the ideas of Berthollet : he endeavours to place it in the
family of the oxides simply sulphurated ; but it is no less
certain that it exists such as I have announced           it,
                                                           and that
it  has over that of sulphurated oxides, whose existence              is
now destroyed, the advantage of giving us the most na
tural solution of those thousand-and-onc antimonial pro
 blems, the ridiculous nomenclature of which maintained
the confusion of our ideas, and covered the history of an
timony with profound obscurity.          Berthollet adds, repeat
ing my expressions      :  " do not see how this saves the
                               I
oxides of that metal from the suspicion of being able to
unite with sulphur in all doses, and without regard to the
invariable laws of proportion       but he must however admit,
                                    ;
that these laws are not invariable, and must limit his apo
thegm, in regard to the proportions of the sulphurct of an
timony with its oxide."
   This paragraph requires that         should divide my answer
                                        I
into two parts.   I   will then first observe, that Berthollet,
 by  introducing here the solution of sulphur in an oxide,
when the question       ismerely that of       sulphuret, changes
                                                a
his subject: for the solution of sulphur, and that of the sul
phuret, in the same excipient, are no more comparable
than those of sulphur and sulphuric aeid              in the same
liquor.
 I    will next say in reply, that not only the solubility of         a
metallic sulphurct m its oxide saves the latter from the
suspicion of being able to unite with sulphur in all doses,
which among us, the old disciples of .Maci|Her,Rouelie,8cc,
was an error difficult to be eradicated         but
                                                ;     saves
                                                     it        also
                                                                it
from another, which      it  of
                              isno   less  importance  to  explain,
that of dissolving  a  metal, and       all sorts of proportions,

since indeed it  exists as such in crocus and ruby.           shall

therefore   beg Berthollet to make himself for a moment
author of the doctrine which he combats, and ask him
                                                                        1
what he would think of a chemist, who, for the good of
the contrary hypothesis, should employ himself in arran-
       on one side all the considerations which he could de
Sing
  uce from the metal which ought to throw light on the
nature of livers of antimony, to arrange then, exclusively,
the latter, on the sulphur they contain ? Why, would he
say, are you silent in regard to that metal which lies close
to sulphur, and which can so well remove whatever is diffi
cult to be conceived in the solution of the latter by an
oxide ? Each of us then resuming the hypothesis he de
fends, I will answer the objection ot Berthollet, by begging
him not to forget, that if in the crocus there is sulphur in
all doses, it is to saturate this sulphur that there is metal
also found in all doses.     This is what has obliged me not
to range in the same line the sulphurated oxides of anti
mony, if any remain, with oxides holding in solution sul-
 phuret, which will hereafter supply their place.
    In regard to the nature of these combinations, the aspect
under which I have presented them is far from furnishing
limits to my apothegm, to deduce from it arguments
against the law of proportions.           He ought to have deter
mined, that oxide ot antimony may attain the term of its
 saturation by dissolving sulphuret, and thus to have disco
vered, that he cannot thence adduce an appearance and
characters which warrant the constancy of this saturation, as
 generally happens to all thecombinations which range them
 selves under the law of proportions.         If the case with an
 oxide, in the power it has of dissolving, were the same as
that of an acid which retains its liquidity, nothing would
be easier than to resolve the question, and I should have
 employed myself on it. But when an oxide of antimony,
to which is added a little sulphuret, has assumed the colour
 and transparency we require in     it,  we stop it   there, without
paying attention to the weight and measure, because           it   is
in this state that we wish to have it. This glass of antimony;
                                           is
a  new dose of sulphuret makes     it   crocus
                                             ;   a  greater makes  it
hepar,   and  so on   that is to  say, the  old  chemists,   without
                 toa ;          the  knowledge    of which   was re
 paying  regard       theory,
served for posterity, broke down the solution of sulphuret in
its oxide, and extracted from the crucible, as one may say,
each of the fractions to fill the repositories of medicine with
their livers, their magisteries, their rubies, and their diapho
retics, from Basil Valentine down to Lemery.               Such, in
my   opinion, is  the whole   history   of antimony.     To

if you   add two and a thirds the case will be the same, and

must repeat to them, your arsenical potash hitherto has
been nothing but potash + 1 + 2 + 3 of arsenic ; but as
I have not yet had time to verify whether the combination
will obey, as there is ro reason to doubt, the law of rela
tions, we must not be too urgent to deduce from them con
clusions.     To conclude, these are results so variable, that
they    annihilate  your laws of proportion, and render your
               illusory.    Besides, Berthollet is too just not to
Xthegms

     2. That the component ingredients of it are sulphur and
metallic iron ; the former being in the proportion of 36-50
or 37, and the latter about 63-50 or 63.
     3. That the chemical and other properties of this sub
stance are very different from those of the common martial
pyrites, which, however, are also composed of sulphur and
iron, varying in proportion, from 52-15 to 54-31 of sul
 phur, and from 47*85 to 45-66 of metallic iron: the dif
 ference between the common pyrites which were examined
being therefore 2- 1 9j and the mean proportions amounting
 to 53-24 of sulphur, and 46*75 of iron; consequently, the
 difference between the relative proportions, in the composi
 tion of the magnetical pyrites and of the common pyrites,
  is nearly 16-74 or 16-24.

  results, as well as in all chemical and other properties, with
  that sulphtiret of iron which hitherto has been only known
  as an artificial product, there is no doubt but that it is iden
  tically the same ; and we may conclude that its proportions
  are most probably subjected to a certain law, (as Mr. Proust
  has observed in the case of the artificial sulphuret,) which
  law, under certain circumstances, and especially during the
  natural formation of this substance in the humid way, may
  be supposed to act in an almost invariable manner.
     5. That in the formation of common martial pyrites
  there is a deviation from this law, and that sulphur becomes
  the predominant ingredient, which is variable in quantity,
 but which, by the present experiments, has not been found
,to exceed 54,34 per cent. ; a proportion, however, that pos-
 siblv may be surpassed in other pyrites which have not as
 yet been chemicallv examined.
     6. That iron, when combined naturally or artificially
 with 36,50 or 37 of sulphur, is not only still capable of
 receiving the magnetic fluid, but is also rendered capable
 of retaining  it,   so as to become in every respect       perma

 nent magnet  ;     and the same may, in     a  great measure, be
 inferred respecting iron which has been artificially com
 bined with 45,50 per cent, of sulphur.
   7.    That, beyond this proportion of 45*50 or 46 per cent,
 of sulphur, (in the natural common pyrites,) all suscepti
 bility of the magnetic influence appears to be destroved;
 and, although the precise proportion which              capable of
                                                         is
 producing this effect, has not as vet been determined by
 actual experiment,   it   iscertain that the limits are between
 45,50 and 52,15; unless some unknown alteration has taken
 place in the state of the sulphur, or of the iron, in the com
 mon martial pyrites.

pliurets of iron may be regarded as bodies peculiarly sus
ceptible of strong magnetical impregnation.
    Having thus, for the greater perspicuity, reduced the
principal facts of this paper into a concise order, I shall
now make some general observations.
    It is undoubtedly not a little singular, that a substance
like the magnetical pyrites, which, although not common,
has been long known to mineralogists, should not hitherto
have been chemically examined, especially as mineralogical
authors have mentioned the analysis of it as a desideratum.
The result of this which I have attempted, proves that it is
 really deserving of notice; for thus we have ascertained,
that the sulphuret of iron hitherto known onlv as an arti
ficial product, is also formed by nature, and that the com
position of this last agrees with those proportions of the
artificial sulphuret which have been stated by Mr. Proust.
   But from this sulphuret or masinetical pyrites I have
not, by analysis, as yet been able to discover any regular
or immediate gradations into the common pvrites ; for the
least proportion of sulphur in these amounted to 52*15, and
the greatest proportion to 5-1*34 ; so that, between the mag
netical and the common pyrites, the difference is considera
ble, in the proportions of their component substances, as
well as in their physical and chemical properties ; whilst
 the difference which I have hitherto been able to detect in
the proportions of some of the common pyrites, (very dis
similar in figure, lustre, colour, and hardness,) has only
amounted to 2*19.
   Mr. Proust, in a general wav, considers common pvrites
to differ from the first sulphuret, or that composed of GO
parts of sulphur and 100 of iron, (= 37*50 per cent.) by
containing a further addition of half the above quantity of
sulphur, or 90 parts of sulphur and loo of iron, (= 47*36
per cent.;) but this opinion he appears to have formed in
consequence of results obtained by synthetical experiments
made in the dry way.      Now, when we consider how diffi
cult it is to regulate the high decrees of temperature, and
wliat a numerous chain of alterations in the relative order
of affinities most commonly result from alterations in these
degrees of heat, it seems to me that we cannot rely, with
absolute certainty, on synthetical experiments made in the
above way, unless they are corrected, and contrasted with
analytical experiments made on the same substances.       But
it does not appear, from the two memoirs published by
Mr. Proust, to which I have so frequently alluded, that
that gentleman did more, in respect to analysis, than distil
                             0  4                          the

the cubic and dodecaedral pyrites found near Soria, from
which he obtained about 20 per cent, of sulphur; and,
having observed that the residuum possessed the properties
of the sulphuret which has been commonly prepared in la
boratories, he concluded that the sulphur obtained from the
pyrites is the excess of that proportion which is requisite to
form the sulphuret, the proportions of which, therefore, he
by synthesis ascertained to be, as            I have above stated, =
 37-50   of sulphur,   and   62-50    of  iron, or 60 of sulphur com
bined with 100 of iron; and lastly, having formed 318
grains of this sulphuret from 200 grains of iron filings, he
distilled the sulphuret with an additional quantity of sul
phur in an inferior degree of heat, and obtained 378 grains
of a substance which, excepting density, was similar to the
common martial pyrites *.
    It is however to be regretted, that Mr. Proust did not
make a regular analysis of the pyrites of Soria, and of the
residuum after distillation ; for (unless these pyrites are very
different from those which I have examined) he would most
probably have found the proportion of sulphur greater than
that which he has assigned to natural pyrites in general.
This, at least, there is great reason to suppose, if we allow
that most or all of the pyrites have been formed in the humid
way, by which, we may conceive, a larger proportion of
sulphur may be introduced into the compound than can
take place in high degrees of temperature.                And this opi
nion is corroborated by the results of my analyses; for, in
stead of finding the general proportions to be 47*36 of sul
phur and 52-64 of iron, the mean result of these analyses
is very nearly the reverse, being 53-24 of sulphur and 46-76
of iron.
   Mr. Proust is also of opinion, that the pyrites which
contain the smallest quantity of sulphur are those which
are most liable to vitriolization ; and, on the contrary, that
those which contain the largest proportion, are the least
affected by the air or weather f. This opinion of the learned
professor by no means accords with such observations as I
have been able to make ; for the cubic, dodecaedral,                and
other regularly crystallized pyrites are liable to oxidizeuient,
so as to become what are called hepatic iron ores, but not
to vitriolization ; whilst the radiated pyrites (at least those
of this country) are by much the most subject to the latter
effect ; and therefore, as the results of the preceding ana-

               Analysis of the magnetical Pyrites.            217
lyses show that the crystallized pyrites contain less sulphur
than the radiated pyrites,     I might be induced to adopt the
contrary opinion.      But  I am  inclined to attribute the effect
of vitriolization   observed   in  some of the pyrites, not so
much to the proportion, as to the state of the sulphur in
the compound; for I much suspect that a predisposition to
vitriolization in these pyrites is produced by a small portion
of oxygen being previously combined with a part, or with
the general mass of the sulphur, at the time of the original
formation of these substances, so that the state of the sul
phur is tending to that of oxide, and thus the accession of
a further addition of oxygen becomes facilitated.        We have
an example of similar effects in phosphorus, when (as is
commonly said) it is half burned, for the purpose of pre
 paring the phosphorus bottles ; and the propensity to vitriol
 ization, observed in many of the half roasted sulphureous
ores, appears to me to arise from this cause, rather than
 from the mere diminution of the original proportion of
 sulphur, or the actual immediate conversion of part of it
 into sulphuric acid; nevertheless, I offer this opinion, at
 present, only as a probable conjecture, which may be in
 vestigated by future experiments and observations.
     The magnetical properties of the sulphuret of iron, which
 forms the principal subject of this paper, must be regarded
 as a remarkable fact ; for I have not found, in the various
 publications on magnetism which I have had the means of
 consulting, even the most remote hint, that iron, when
 combined with sulphur, is possessed of the power of receiv
 ing and retaining the magnetic fluid ; and, judging by the
  properties of common pyrites, we might have supposed that
 sulphur annihilated this power in iron, as indeed seems to
 have been the opinion of mineralogists, who have never
  enumerated     magnetical attraction amongst the physical
  properties  of those bodies ; and, although Werner, Widen-
  matm, Emmerling, and Brochant, have arranged the mag
  netical pyrites with the sulphurets of iron, yet the mag
  netical property could not with certainty be stated as inhe
  rent in the sulphuret ; for, at that time, this substance had
  not been subjected to a regular chemical analysis, and the
  magnetical property might therefore be suspected to arise
  from interspersed particles of the common magnetical iron
  ore. This probably has been the opinion of the abbe Haiiy;
  for, in his extensive Treatise on Mineralogy, lately pub
  lished, I cannot rind any mention made 6f the magnetical
  pyrites, either amongst the sulphurets or amongst the other
  eres of iron.

218                 Analysis    of the   magnet leal Pyrites.
   In      mineral kingdom a great variety of substances,
           the
and even somc of the gems, exert a feeble degree of attrac
tion on the magnetic needle, and sometimes also acquire a
                              *
slight degree of polarity ; but, as this wonderful propertv
has only been observed conspicuously powerful in one spe
cies of iron ore, this has been always emphaticallv called
the magnet f, and is said to consist of metallic iron com -
bincd with from 10 to 20 per cent. of oxygen.
    From the facts, however, which have been recently stated,
we now find that there is another natural substance, appa
rently very different from the magnet in chemical composi
tion, but nevertheless approaching very nearly to it in
power, which is found in several parts of our globe, and
particularly in a province of this kingdom, where it consti
tutes a vein, running north and south, of considerable ex
tent, and several yards in width and thickness.
    From the experiments also which have been made on the
artificial preparation of this substance, we find that it is
capable of receiving the magnetic properties when the pro
portion >>f sulphur amounts to 37 per cent., and is still
powerfully attracted when a much larger quantity of sulphur
is present.     There          is,
                            however, some point at which all
tliese effects cease    and this point appears to be when the

the power of becoming a magnet to             very remarkable de

which are more or less brittle, soluble in muriatic acid, and
more or less susceptible of magnetical impregnation, some
of them form the most powerful magnets hitherto discovered.
    Sulphur, in like manner, combines with iron in a large
proportion, forming the common pyrites, which are brittle,
almost or quite insoluble in muriatic acid, and devoid of
magnetical properties.           Sulphur, in smaller proportions,
forms sulphurets, which are also brittle, but are soluble
in muriatic acid, and strongly susceptible of magnetical
impregnation.
    Phosphorus also, when combined with iron, makes it
brittle, and enables it powerfully to receive and retain the
magnetical properties ; so that, considering the great simi
larity which prevails in other respects, it may not seem rash
to conclude, that phosphorus, (like carbon and sulphur,)
when combined with iron in a very large proportion, mav
form a substance incapable of becoming magnetical, al
though, in smaller proportions (as we have seen,) it con
stitutes compounds which are not only capable of receiving
but also of retaining the magnetical properties, even so far
as, in some cases, to seem likely to form magnets of great
power ; and, speaking generally of the carburets, sulphu
rets, and phosphurets of iron, I have no doubt but that
by accurate experiments we shall find that a certain propor
tion of the ingredients of each constitutes a maximum in
the magnetical power of these three bodies. When this
maximum has been ascertained, it would be proper to com
pare the relative magnetical power of steel (which hitherto
has alone been employed to form artificial magnets) with
that of sulphuret and phosphuret of iron ; each being first
examined in the form of a single mass or bar of equal
 weight, and afterwards in the state of compound magnets,
 formed, like the large horse-shoe magnets, by the separate
coal which disappeared during the conversion of iron to the different va
rieties of subcarburct known in commerce.

     The effects of the above compound magnets should then
  be tried against others composed of bars of the three dif

  arrangement ; and, lastly, it would be interesting to make
  a series of experiments on chemical compounds, formed by
  uniting different proportions of carbon, sulphur, and phos
  phorus, with one and the same mass of iron.           These qua
  druple compounds, which, according to the modern che
 mical nomenclature, may be called carburo-sulphuro-phos-
  phurets, or phosphuro-sulphuro-carburets, &c. of iron, are
 as yet unknown as to their chemical properties, and may
 also, by the investigation of their magnetical properties,
 afford some curious results.       At anv rate, an unexplored
 field of extensive research appears to be opened, which pos
 sibly may furnish important additions to the history of mag
 netism, a branch of science which of late years has been
 but little augmented, and which, amidst the present rapid
 progress of human knowledge, remains immersed in con
 siderable obscurity.
 XXXVIII. Account of an Aerostatic           Voyage performed by
    M. Guv-Lussac, on the                 of  Fructidor, Year 12;
    and read in the National        Institute, Vendemiaire 9th,
    Year 13*.
 The author, after giving an account of the instruments
 he took with him for his observations, and the changes
which he introduced in them in consequence of the obser
vations made during his first voyage, says : All our instru
ments being ready, the day of my departure was fixed for
.the 29th of Fructidor.     I, indeed, ascended that day from
the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, at 40 minutes past
nine, the barometer being at 76,525 centimetres, the hy
grometer at 57*5°, and the thermometer at 27,75°. M. Bou-
vard, who makes meteorological observations every day at
the observatory of Paris, thought the atmosphere full of
vapours, but without clouds.        Scarcely had I risen a thou
sand metres when I indeed saw a light vapour dispersed
throughout the whole atmosphere below me, and through
which I observed distant objects confusedly.
                   •
                     From the Journal dc Pbyiique.

                  Account    of an Aerostatic     Voyage.              221
     When     I reached the height of 3032 metres, or 1 555 toises,
I   began   to   make my horizontal needle oscillate, and I ob
tained 20 oscillations in 83", while at the earth, under the
same circumstances, 83*33" would have been necessary for
the same number*. Though my balloon was affected by the
rotary motion which I experienced in my first voyage, the
motion of the needle allowed me to count twenty, thirty,
and even forty oscillations.
     At the height of 3863 metres, or 10,821 toises, I found
that the inclination of my needle, taking a mean of the am
plitude of the oscillations, was sensibly 31°, as at the earth.
A great deal of time and patience was necessary to make
this observation, because, though carried away by the mass
of the atmosphere, I felt a light wind, which continually
deranged the compass ; and, after several fruitless attempts,
J was obliged to renounce making any more observations.
 \ am of opinion, however, that the observation I here pre
sent deserves some confidence.
     Some time after I wished to observe the dipping needle ;
the following was the result :—The dryness, favoured by
 the action of the sun in a rarefied air, was so great, that the
 compass was so far deranged as to make the metallic circle
 on which the divisions were traced out to bend, and
 become warped.            The motions of the needle could not be
 performed       with    the  same freedom ; but, independently of
 this disappointment, I remarked that it was very difficult
 to observe the declination of the needle with this apparatus.
 It happened, indeed, that when I placed the compass in
 such a manner as to make the shadow of a horizontal thread,
 which served as a style, coincide with a fixed line, the mo
 tion I gave the compass communicated one to the needle,
 and, when the latter had attained nearly to a state of rest,
  the shadow of the style no longer coincided with the fixed
  line.    It was still necessary to put the compass into a ho
  rizontal position ; and during the time which this operation
  required, every thing was again deranged.                Without per
  sisting to make observations in which I could place no con
  fidence, I gave them up entirely; and, free from every other
  care, I directed the whole of my attention to the oscillations
  of the horizontal needle.           I am, however, convinced, in
  acknowledging the faults of my compass, that it is possible
     •
        Though   I here indicate hundredth parts of a second, it may be rea
  dily conceived that 1 was not able to     observe fractions so small ; but
  they were given to me by division, because at the earth       I made  com
   monly thirty oscillations which required 126,5".
                                                                          to

    to employ one fitter for the purpose, which would deter
    mine the declination with more precision.      I shall observe,
    that to attempt this experiment I had let down other needles,
    separately, in linen bags to the distance of fifteen metres
    below the car.
        That the whole of the results I obtained may be better
    seen at one view, I have collected them in a table added to
    the end of this memoir ; and they are such as they occurred
    to me, with the corresponding indications of the barometer,
    the thermometer, and the hygrometer.        The heights were
    calculated, according to the formula of Laplace, by M. Gou-
    illy, engineer of bridges and causeways, who was so kind ,
    as to take this trouble.    As the barometer 'did not sensibly
    vary on the day of my ascent, from ten o'clock till three,
    to calculate the different heights at which I made observa
    tions, we took the height of the barometer, 76*568 centi
   metres, which was the height at the earth at three o'clock;
    a height which, agreeably      to the observations made by
    M. Bouvard at the observatory, is greater by 0*43 milli
   metres than that observed at the moment of our departure.
   The heights of the barometer in the atmosphere wece re
   duced to those which would have been indicated by a baro
   meter at a constant level placed under the same circum
   stances, and for each height was taken the mean between
   the observations    of two barometers.     The temperature at
   the earth, having varied between ten and three o'clock, it
   was supposed constant and equal at 30, 75° of the centi
   grade thermometer.
       If we now cast our eyes on the table it will be seen that
   the temperature     follows an irregular law in regard to the
   corresponding heights ; which no doubt arises from this, —
   that, having made observations sometimes in ascending and
v  sometimes in descending, the thermometer must have fol
   lowed these variations too slowly.     But if we consider only
   the degrees of the thermometer which form a decreasing
  series, we shall find a more regular law.      Thus the tempe
  rature at the earth being 27*75, and at the height of 3691
   metres 8*5", if we divide the difference of the heights by
  that of the temperatures we shall first obtain 191.7 metres,
  or 98*3 toises, of elevation for each lowering of tempera
  ture.     Performing the same operation for the temperatures
  y 95° and 0,5, as well as for those of 0,0° and — 9,5°, we
     'nil fmd in both cases 241*6 metres, or 72*6 toises of ele
  vation for each degree of lowering in the temperament,
  which «*ems to indicate, that towards the surface of the
  . >' uv the heat follows a less decreasing     law than in the
                                                            upper

                 Account  of an Aerostatic  Voyage.            SC3
vipper parts of the atmosphere,         and at greater heights it
follows a decreasing arithmetical progression.          If we sup
pose that from the surface of the earth,        where the  thermo
meter was at 3,75°, to the height of 6977 metres, or 3580
toises, where it fell to — 9" 5 , the heat decreased as the
heights increased, an elevation of 173*3 metres, or 88,9
 toises, will correspond to each degree of the lowering of
 temperature.
       The hygrometer had a very remarkable progress.            At
 the surface of the earth it was only 57'5°, while at the height
 of 3030 metres it marked 62°. From this point it conti
 nually fell till the height of 5267 metres, where it indicated
 only 97*5°, and thence to the height of 6884 metres it gra
 dually rose to 34* 5°. If we wish from these results to deter
  mine the law of the quantity of water dissolved in the air
  at different elevations, it is evident that attention must be
  paid to the temperature, and by adding this consideration
  it will be seen that it follows an exceedingly decreasing pro
  gression.
        If we now consider the magnetic oscillations, it will be
  remarked, that the time for ten oscillations, made at dif
  ferent heights, is sometimes above and sometimes below
   that of 42* 16", which they require at the earth.       Taking a
  mean of all these oscillations made in the atmosphere,         ten
  oscillations will require 42*20", a quantity which differs
   very little from the preceding ; but if we consider only the
   last observations made at greater heights, the time for ten
   oscillations would be a little below 42-16", which would
   indicate, en the other hand, that the magnetic force has a
   little increased. Without wishing to draw any consequence
    from this slight apparent increase, which may arise from the
    errors committed in experiments of this kind, I must con
    clude that the results I have presented confirm and extend
    the fact observed by M. Biot and myself, and which, like
    universal gravitation, proves that the magnetic force does
    not experience any sensible variation at the greatest heights
    to which we can attain.
         The consequence we have deduced from our experiments
    may appear a little too precipitate to those who reflect that
    we were not able to make experiments on the inclination of
    the magnetic needle.     But if it be recollected that the force
    which makes a horizontal needle oscillate, necessarily de
     pends on the intensity and direction of the magnetic force
     itself, and that it is represented by the cosine of the angle
     of the inclination of the latter force, no one can help con-
'
     eluding with us, that, since the horizontal force did not
                                                                vary,

 224            Account   of ait Aerostatic Voyage.
   vary, the magnetic force ought not to have varied either,
   unless we choose to suppose that the magnetic force could
   vary exactly in a contrary direction, and in the same ratio>
  as the cosine of its inclination; which is in no manner pro
  bable. We should have besides, in support of our conclu
  sion, the experiment of the inclination made at the height
  of 3863 metres, or 1 982 toises, which proves that at this
  height the inclination did not vary in a sensible manner.
      When we reached the height of 45 11 metres, I presented
  to a small magnetic needle, and in the direction of the mag
  netic force, the lower extremity of a key. The needle was
  attracted, and then repelled by the other extremity of the
  key, which I made to descend in a direction parallel to it
 self.    The same experiment, repeated at 6107 metres, was
 attended with the same success ; a new and very evident
 proof of the action of terrestrial magnetism.
     At the height of 6561 metres, or 3353 toises, I opened
 one of my two glass balloons, and at that of 6636 metres,
 or 3405 toises, I opened the second : the air entered into
 both with a hissing noise. At length, at 1 1 minutes after
 three o'clock, the balloon being completely full, and having
 no more than 15 kilogrammes of ballast, I resolved to de
 scend.     The thermometer was then at 9*5° below the tem
 perature of melting ice, and the barometer at 32*88 centi
 metres ; which gives for my greatest elevation above Pans
 6977*37 metres, or 3579*9 toises; or 7016 metres, that is,
 3600 toises above the level of the sea.
    Though well clothed, I began to feel cold, especially in
the hands, which I was obliged to keep exposed to the air.
My respiration was sensibly confined, but I was still far
from experiencing any uneasiness so disagreeable as to
oblige me to descend.       My pulse and respiration were very
much accelerated : breathing, therefore, verv frequently in
very dry air, it need excite no surprise that my throat
should be so dry as to make it painful for me to swallow
bread.     Before I set out I had a slight head-ache, arising
front the fatigue of the preceding day, and being up         ail
night, and it   continued the whole day without its appearing
to increase. These are all the inconveniences I     experienced.
  A    phtr,nomenon    which  struck  me  at this height  was to
see clouds above me, and at      a   distance which appeared to
be considerable.      In our first ascent the clouds were not
•ustained at greater height than

nee clouds below me.       The sky was much filled with va

neighbouring village soon ran up to me; and while some of
them took pleasure in drawing towards them the balloon,
bv pulling the rope to which the anchor was fixed, others,
placed below the car, waited with impatience till they could
reach     with their hands, in order to deposit
         it                                        on the earth.               it

   When arrived at Paris, my first care was to analyse the
              I
air had brought back. All the experiments were made at
  I
the Polytechnic School, under the inspection of Messrs.
Thcnard and Gresset       and     depended as much on their

judgment as on my own.         We observed, in turn, the divi
sions of the eudiometer without communicating with each
other; and we did not write them down till we perfectly
agreed.    The balloon, the air of which was introduced at
the height of 6636-5 metres, or 3405 toises, was opened
under water, and we all judged that       had filled at least the
                                                              it
half of it? capacity; which proves that the balloon had well
preserved its vacuum, and that no foreign air had entered
it. We intended to weigh the quantity of air which re
mained in the balloon to compare its capacity; but, as we
could not at that time find what was necessary, and being
very impatient to ascertain the nature of the air contained
m it, we could not make the experiment.            We first em
ployed Volta's eudiometer, and analysed           comparatively            it
with atmospheric air collected       the court before the Poly

     Atthe same time a measure of very pure oxygen gas re-
         2-0-1 measures of hydrogen gas- ; and as this result
auired
 iffered only 0-0 1 from that found by experiments made on
a very large scale, and with a great deal of care, on the
 composition of water, it appears that great confidence may
 be placed in our results.        They prove, then, that atmo
 spheric  air, and  air  taken   at the height of 6636-3 metres,
 are exactly the same, and that they contain each 02 149 of
 oxygen.     In analysing the last air by hydro-sulphuret of
 potash, we found 0-2163 of oxygen.           I cannot present the
 result of the comparative experiment made on atmospheric
 ajr, because we were' not able to collect it ; but the propor
 tion of oxygen I have indicated is still a little greater than
 that given by the combustion of hydrogen gas, and it \s
 comprehended between the limits of the variations which
 have been found for the composition of the atmosphere at
 the surface of the earth, and which have not prevented us
iron) considering it as constant.
    The identity of the analyses of the two airs made by hy
 drogen gas proves directly, that the air I brought back con
 tained none of the latter gas.       I, however, stdl ascertained
in    it,   by
            burning   with  the  two    airs,
                                          a     quantity of hydro
 gen gas,   smaller  than  that  which    would  have been neces
 sary  to absorb the  whole   of  the  oxygen gas for
                                                ;    I     saw that
 the residuums of the combustion of the two airs with           hy
 drogen gas were exactly the same.
    Saussure junior found also,    by   making use of nitrous gas,
that air collected on the Col-du-Geant contained, within a
hundredth part, as much oxygen as that of the plain and    ;
his father confirmed the presence of the carbonic acid on
the summit of Mont Blanc.             Besides, the experiments of
Messrs. Cavendish, Macartney, Berthollet, and Davy, have
 confirmed the identity of the composition of the atmosphere
over all the. surface of the earth.        We may therefore con
clude,      general, that the constitution of the atmosphere
            in
is   the same from the surface of the earth to the greatest
heights to which     it   possible to attain.
                          is
    Such are the two principal results of my last voyage*
M. Biot and myself confirmed the fact we observed in re
gard to the sensible permanence of the intensity of the mag
 netic force as one recedes from the surface of the earth and
                                                            ;
I  think, also, have proved that the proportions of oxygen
                 I
and azote, which constitute the atmosphere, do not sensibly
 Vary in very extensive limits.        There still remain a   great
inany things to be cleared up in regard to the atmosphere,
 and we wish the facts we have collected may prove suffi
ciently interesting to the Institute to induce      it  to make us

       XXXIX.       On disclosing the Process    of Manufactories.
                             To  Mr.  Tilloch.
         SIR,                                Newcastle, Feb. 17, 1S05.
   JC  ermit me to entreat the attention of some of your nu
   merous correspondents towards a question which must
   certainly be interesting to every manufacturer, but of which
   no regular discussion nas yet been offered : — " Is it proper
   or improper to lay before the public a full and impartial
   statement of the various processes of our manufactories ?"
  I   shall state such reasons as have offered themselves to me
  why thdy should be displayed; but I am principally anxious
  to receive further information on a subject that appears to
  me peculiarly interesting. — The first argument I shall
   adduce is that of Mr. Boyle, as quoted by Dr. Johnson in
  the 201st number of the Rambler.              " The excellency of
  manufactures, and the facility of labour, would be much
                if the various expedients and contrivances which
    ie concealed in private hands were by reciprocal communi
 f>romoted
  cation made generally known ; for there are few operations
  that are not performed by one or another with some pecu
  liar advantages, which though singly of little importance,
 would by conjunction and concurrence open new inlets to
 knowledge, and give new powers to diligence." — The second
 is the very considerable improvements that have taken place
 in the few manufactories which have yet been under the
 influence of chemical inquiry ; thus realizing, but on a very
 extensive scale, the suggestions           of Mr. Boyle : so far,
 therefore, as we are to be guided on the one hand by ex
 perience, and on the other by the influence of scientific
 inquiry, on liberal display, will the argument be in our
 favour. — In the third place, I would observe, that as many
 very valuable discoveries are owing to chance, those with
 whom they originate are frequently, perhaps, incapable of
improving them to the extent they would admit of in the
 hands of men of Science ; and thus by a spirit of monopoly,
 preclude even themselves from the advantageous cultivation
of such discoveries, merely lest others might enjoy them also.
If, again, we consider the rapid progress that has been made
of late years in every department of useful and practical
knowledge, we must attribute it entirely to those liberal
communications that have been made by men whose atten
tion has been immediately directed to the promotion and
improvement of every thing valuable to the public. Again,
The profits of every business depend on the regularity and
               S                                           knowledge

           On disclosing the Process of Manufactories.        299
 knowledge with which it is conducted : but how is the last
 to be enjoyed without resources to apply to? and how much
 more easily would it be obtained if science could regulate
 and simplify the combinations of the manufacturer \- — To
 these may be added, that if to accomplish by every thing
 employed its utmost possible use, nay, if even to draw
 advantage from the very waste and refuse of every manu-.
 factory be a favourite principle with the conductors of each,
 to take the most accurate and powerful mean to effect it
 ought certainly to be as strong an object with them.       Is it
 not also obvious, that to discard all mystery and quackery,
 and fairly to disclose each process, is to invite the attention
 of men of science and research to extend any advantage
 gained by chance or otherwise, and discover yet greater
powers of utility, in the various substances employed ? —
 JTie origin, progress, present state, and hints for the im
provement of our " arts of life," would certainly be worthy
the contemplation of our most able chymists, and are sub-
       that have appeared of such importance to a neigh-
  louring nation, that many of their most eminent men have
{"ects
been employed in such a work ; and some volumes of the
Encyclopedic Methodique are dedicated to such infor
mation, with plates too, in many cases, displaying even
the most minute work-tools employed in each.
    The history and detail of manufactories conducted in
each place, ought, I presume, to form a principal object
with the writers of local histories ; yet very few of these
             are enabled to obtain such accounts as they can
   epend on, from the selfish and monopolizing spirit of ma
Sentlemen
nufacturers in general.
    To these various advantages an objection may be offered,
that display is placing objects of taxation in the hands of
ministers. — Be it so. —Display will make it easier to collect
the tax ; — will make it more certain, and, it may be, less
oppressive.    If to these be added the above advantages, it
may fairly be presumed that discovery, which may lead to
improvement, is the most advantageous track to be pursued.
—But, my dear Sir, I beg your pardon: on this subject I do
not mean to offer my own opinion, so much as to solicit
information from that of others.
                                I am truly yours,
                                           John Clenkel.
    P. S. How far literary pursuits are compatible with the.
duties of the commercial man, or the manufacturer, seems
a question so completely decided in the affirmative, in the

XL. An          Essay on Medical Entomology.                 By F.  Chau-
                   MKTON, Physician to the Army*.
        In his tarn parvis tamque nullis qua; ratio ? quanta vis ?  Pi. in.
   W    hen we cast our eyes on the immense quantity of vo
 lumes which have entomology for their object, one is in
 clined to believe that insects have been sufficiently consi
 dered under every point of view.             Naturalists, philosophers,
 and physicians, seem to have united their efforts to give a
 most complete history of them. Some have endeavoured
 to trace out their elegant forms and varied shades, and
 others have carefully studied and described their wonderful
 metamorphoses. The latter have exhibited the interesting
 view of their habits and manners, and have presented us
 with some of them as models ; the former have acquired
 more right 10 the public gratitude, by pointing out those
 insects which it is necessary to destroy, either because they
 contain a poisonous liquor, or on account of the destruction
 which thev occasion.            It must indeed be confessed, that
 useless and hurtful insects are far more numerous than those
 from which society derives real advantages.                 We must not,
  however, forget, that the class of insects furnishes us with
  honey, silk, cochineal, &c., and that medicine obtains
  from it efficacious aid against human infirmities.                     It is
  under the latter point of view that 1 propose, in this essay,
  to e amine entomology.
     The antients were satisfied with distributing insects into
  different groupes, according to the diversity of their resi
  dence ; and as they did not assign precise characters to the
  species they described, it is very difficult, and often impos
  sible, to form exact ideas of them.
      It was not till towards the middle of the sixteenth cen
  tury that the learned Conrad Gesner endeavoured to clear
  up the confusion which prevailed in zoology ; and his la
   bours have been a fruitful mine to his successors.                Aldro-
   vandus, Swammerdam, Ray, and Lister, followed worthily
   in his steps ; but it was ieserved to the immortal Linnaeus
              *
                 From the Jaanal   de Pbyrique,   Fructidor,  an n.

                   On Medical Entomology.                    231
to place entomology, as well as all the other branches of
natural history, on an unshaken base. Attempts have been
made, but in vain, to correct, reform, or improve his me
thod, or to establish an opposite one. This frail structure
broke to pieces against the sublime monument raised by the
celebrated naturalist of Sweden.
   Among the entomologists who have modified the system
of Linnaeus, Geoffrey perhaps is the only one who can be
excused, probably because he has the least deviated from it.
He thought it necessary to unite the neuroptera and the
hymenoptera under the name of tetraptera, with naked
wings, and he founded one of his principal divisions on the
number of the joints of the tarsi. In reading bis work,
which is valuable on manv accounts, it was regretted that
specific names were not found in it.          Fourcroy has com
pletely "supplied this deficiency in his excellent Parisian
Entomology.
   Olivier introduced some modifications in the system of
Linnaeus, and added to it an order, the orthoptera, which
it might have done very well without.
   Fabricius has struck out a new route, and asserted that it
k the only real one. To hear him, one might say that na
ture has revealed to him her most secret mysteries. His
classification, which is founded on the organs of manduca-
tion, requires that one should be always provided with a
good microscope and a compass, to observe and measure
the number, figure, proportion, and situation of all the
parts of the mouth of insects, which in several circum
stances it would even be ridiculous to attempt.       The insur
mountable difficulties which almost always accompany this^
method, are, however, only its least fault. There are seen
in it,  at every step, forced relations ;    and winged insects
are confounded   in   astransrc manner with the aptera.
   Though Latreillc has still increased the difficulties with
which entomology has been filled       by  Fabricius, one cannot
refuse to this modest naturalist the tribute of homage due to
his knowledge, and desire to communicate it.
  It   would be superfluous to accumulate proofs to show the
infinite distance which separates Linnaeus from those who
have pursued the same career.      I   should be afraid that the
comparison     would  be injurious to  him.    Filled with admi
ration for tiiis great man,I    shall follow, with religious re
spect, the plan he has traced out.
   Insects are small animals, which are indebted for their
name to the divisions or rings of which their bodies are
composed. At the anterior part of the head they have two        i
                            P  4                      articulaud.

 articulated filaments, endowed with great mobility and ex
 quisite sensibility : they are called antennae.
    The greater part of insects arc winged ; and in this case
 they have always six legs attached to their breast or thora*,
 and are subject to metamorphoses.          Among the aptera
 there are some which have several hundreds of legs affixed
to the whole length of their bodies, and they are not subject
 to transformation.
    Insects respire by means of vessels with elastic sides,
named tracheae, which open outwardly by holes called
stigmata, placed on the sides of their bodies, and which,
according to Dumeril, may at the same time be the organs
of smell.
    They have no interior skeleton. Their skin, which per
forms the functions of          it,
                                generally hard, corneous, and

often very strong.
   Thev have no real heart, nor apparent vascular system.
The different parts of their bodies are moistened      by
                                                        awhitish
serous matter, the temperature of which      is  equal to that of
the medium wherein they reside.
   The presence or absence of wings, their number and tex
ture, furnish simple and precise characters,      by the help of
which the class of insects        naturally divided into seven
                                      is
orders.
  The   first order contains the insects which have four
wings,  the   lower two of which, thin and transparent, are
covered      ihe upper ones, thick and strong, which envelop
            by
them like    a sheath  on this account they have been called
                       :
elytra, and the insects which bear them are distinguished
by  the name of coleoptera.
  The   second order comprehends insects with four wings,
the two upper ones of which, shorl and semi-coriaceous, are
covertd     bytheir interior edge, while the elytra of the
coleoptera are merely brought together, and form       longia
tudinal suture at their point of contact. These insects have
no jaws, and their beak     turned back on the breast.
                                is                      They
are called fitmiptera.
   In the third order are ranged insects the four wings of
which are coloured         by
                        scaly dust, and which have    trunk a
of greater or less length folded back in       spiral form.

On account of the shining tints with which these insects
are generally ornamented, they are distinguished         the    by
name   of   lepidoptera.
  The insects comprehended in the fourth order have four
paked reticulated wings, and no sting in the anus   they,   :
                                                                 have.

iiave several traits of resemblance with the neuroptera, and
are distinguished by the name or' hymenoptera.
   The sixth order is composed of the diptera, or insects
with two wings.
   The seventh order contains the aptera, or insects without
wings.
                      FIRST ORDER.
                          COLEOPTERA.
   Scarabeus — The      Beetle. — -Of the numerous species of
this genus, those are most useful which live in dunghills
and teed on excrements.        Of this kind are the jimetarius,
the stercorarius, the pilularius, and compurcatm.         If eight
ounces of these insects be digested in a pound of laurel oil,
there will be obtained an ointment, or oil of beetles, the use
of which is recommended in the treatment of sprains and
contusions.     If the virtues of this preparation be not en
tirely imaginary, I think they are very little superior to
those of oil of laurel, the inutility of which is now univer
sally admitted.
   Coccinella — The Lady-bird. —These small insects art
distinguished by the form of their body, which is hemi
spherical. Their thorax, as well as their elytra, which are
smooth, is ornamented with beautiful colours, and often
spotted or striped. Their antennae are truncated, and termi
nated by a solid mass.       They arc less apparent than the
maxillary feelers.
   It is pretended that several species of coccinella, and
particularly those with seven points, are a specific for the
toothache.    It is sufficient, it is said, to bruise the insect
between the fingers, and 10 touch with them the gums and
tooth of the patient. What is most wonderful         is, that the
fingers retain their anti-odontalgic property.         Does not
this ridiculous process bring to remembrance the cure of the
king's-evil    by
                the simple touch of kings and emperors, the
magnetism    of Mcsmer,    the metallic tractors of Perkins, and
other juggling tricks, which are disgrace to the noblest of
                                   a
sciences   ?
  Chrysome-la — Cltrysomela. — The same virtue ascribed
                                                      is
to some of the Chrysomelae, and particularly that of the
poplar, but with as little foundation.
   Curculio — The Weevil. —We were acquainted with-
this insect only from its ravages (C.frumentarius, grana-
rhis, paraplectiais), till RanTeri-Gerbi published       very
                                                           a
verbose and turgid description of    a new species, to which
he gave the title of Curculio anti-edonlalgicus.   The thistle.

   which nourishes this valuable insect          was not forgotten by
   the doctor.
      To say that this discovery has given birth to, and served
   as a basis for, every thing written on the odontalgic pro
   perty of the coccinella?, chrysomelae, weevils, and beetles,
   is sufficient to show the value that ought to be attached
   to it.
      Meloe —Meloe.            The insects which constitute this
   genus have moniliform antennae, the last joint of which is
   ovoid : the thorax is rounded ; the elytra are soft and flexible ;
  the head is bent and gibbous, and the claws double.
      The    Meloe Proscarabeus             and the Meloe maialis
   are both     of  a  blackish   blue colour.      The latter has the
  edge of the segments of the abdomen of a copper colour.
  Both have the elvtra short, and without wings. The an
  tennae of the males are swelled in the middle, and irregu
  larly bent. These insects, which are seen creeping in the
  spring-time among the grass, feed chiefly on ranunculuses
  and hellebore, and diffuse over all their articulations, when
  touched, a yellow fcetid oil. They were considered by the
  antients as infallible remedies for the hydrophobia.             They
 have even been much extolled by some of the moderns*.
 Unfortunately the praises so liberally bestowed upon it have
 not been justified by experience ; and notwithstanding the
 multitude of recipes which have been boasted of for the cure
 of the bite of a mad dog, we scarcely know the means of
 palliating the dreadful symptoms of this horrid malady.
     In consequence of the irritating quality possessed by the
 proscarabea and the may-bug, a place has been assigned to
 them in the materia medica. They are employed with suc
 cess as rubefaciento : they might even be made a substitute,
 though a weak one, for the interesting species of which I
 am about to speak, in cases when it is impossible to pro
 cure the latter.

they copulate,         ttiat they are collected, by shaking the trees
on which they exist. They are killed by the fumes of vi

      We have a multitude of treatises on cantharides *, and
   et there is no good analysis of these insects. Thouvenel
I   as touched on this subject in a memoir on the nature of
animal substances used in medicine, which would be a
master-piece if the illustrious author had completed the in
teresting view he has so well sketched out. It results from
 bis experiments, that an ounce of cantharides, treated in
succession with water, alcohol, and ether, furnish three
         of a reddish yellow and very bitter extract, and give,
frosy distillation, an acid liquor ; twelve grains of an oily yel
 low matter, which seems to be the colouring principle of
 these insects ; sixty grains of a concrete, oily, ceraceous,
 green substance, of an acrid savour, on which the odour of
 the cantharides seems to depend, and which is the principal
 seat of their virtues; in the last place, the half of their
 weight consists of a solid parenchyme, insoluble in water
 and alcohol      f.
      Cantharides are employed in medicine under different
 forms.       Hippocrates administered three or four for a dose,
  after being deprived of their heads, feet, and wings, as not
  being of much efficacy. Cantharides whole are, a medicine
  not very certain, the action of which varies according to the
  quality of the juices contained in the stomach.                It is there
  fore infinitely better to reduce them to an impalpable pow
  der, and to give the patient at first only one grain, and ad-
  bere to that Hose, or repeat it as found necessary, as recom
  mended      by Werlhof.
       The spirituous tincture of cantharides              may be rendered
  more or less active, according as it is prepared with pure al
  cohol, or mixed with an equal quantity of water. In the first
   case, the liquor contains only the green caustic oleo-ceraceous
  matter; in the second process there is obtained an alco-
  holico-aqueous solution, less energetic than the preceding
  in the ratio of the extract found dissolved in it.

      t It is observed that dried and whole cantharides arc frequently de-

        It is to cantharides that the vesicatory or blistering plaster
    is indebted for its properties. It is astonishing that a com
    position, in which the greater portion of the cantharides is
    enveloped and rendered inert by fat and resinous bodies,
   has not been long ago renounced.                 Being an enemy to all
   polypharmic       mixtures,    I am   satisfied  with disposing, in the
   Form of plaster, a certain quantity of good leaven, which'
   I besprinkle more or less with cantharides, according to the
   indication I » ish to fulfil ; and I take care to rub strongly
   the part on which I intend to apply this topic, after having
   moistened it with strong vinegar.                 This method is un
   doubtedly the best; nothing in it        it is.

  medicas and pharmacopoeias are filled, without exclaiming
  ironically, with the immortal Rousseau, That             it   is  entirely
  malicious in men to be sick           ?     Let us, however, confess,
  that there really exist noble remedies.                  There are three     •
  which
      I       could mention  ;   and cantharides certainly are among
  the number.         To prove   it,  nothing       necessary but to take

  of them      isrequisite. To proceed with order in this exa
 mination      I  shall take as my guide the Nosographie Philoso-

 celebrated author, whom         I    have always seen to unite pre

                    ;
 the first place. The regular course which nature follows in
 the development, progress, and termination of these fevers,
 announces beneficent effort, which tends to remove some
                a
 obstacle and restore interrupted equilibrium.                We must be
 cautious, therefore, of perverting this salutary movement,

stead    :   they are even the surest   touchstone for distinguish
ing and measuring the vitality of our organs.
   The yellow fever of America exhibits numerous relation*
with the jail and hospital fever, which is itself a complica-»
lion of adynamic with ataxic fever *. In both, many pa
tients have been indebted for their lives to vesicatories ap
plied to the head, breast, abdomen, and limbs.
   The eruption of the parotids in adynamic and ataxic fe
vers has been commonly considered as a metastasis, which
must be favoured. Bang and Pinel think, on the other
hand, that these tumors are almost always fatal, as they
determiue a sort of congestion towards the head.         They
endeavoured, therefore, to prevent or to dissipate them.
Though the Danish physician employed several internal
and external remedies, it may be easily perceived that vesi-
catories contributed, in a powerful manner, to the success
he obtained.
   The pernicious intermittent and remittent fevers, so well
described by Torti and Alibert, have been classed among
the ataxic by Pinel, who sees in their periodicity nothing
but a generic character.   Among the numerous varieties of
these fevers the comatose is the only one which 1 have ob
served several times.    The application of vesicatories at the
moment of attack, lessened considerably the soporific state
of three patients, and disposed them to take cinchona, to
which they were indebted for their cure. The fourth was
less fortunate : the coma, which produced a sudden exa
cerbation of a simple tertian fever, of which he had been
ill ten days, approached near to a catalepsy, since the limbs
preservea very exactly the situation which I gave to them.
J  applied large vesicatories to the thighs, and sinapisms to
the soles of the feet.    Neither of them made scarcely any
impression ; which destroyed all hope of my being able to
administer cinchona, and consequently to save the patient.
There was not, indeed, the slightest remission : the sym
 ptoms, instead of being mitigated, became more and more
 alarming, and in twenty-seven hours after the attack ter
minated in death.      The lateral ventricles of the brain were
 distended by a great quantity of coagulated lymph.
    The plague announces itself, like ataxic fever, by a pro*
found lesion of sensibility : it would not even be distin
 guished from           it,

tain, that the plague may be considered as a very severe
ataxic lever complicated with an affection of the glandular
system.     It is indebted to this double character for the de
nomination of adeno-nervous.          It is here in particular that
the organs which have fallen into a state of stupor and in
sensibility must be strongly excited. With what prompti
tude ought we not then to have recourse to vesicatones>
sinapisms, and friction, with alcoholic solution of cantha-
rides or with ammonia !
     Ought we to unite phlegmasia? with angiotenic fevers,
or establish between them an immense line of demarcation,
by placing them in different classes, as Pinel has done?
The fear of losing sight of the principal object prevents me
 from discussing this interesting question, which does not
appear to have been fully resolved.
     To form an exact idea of phlegmasia?, it is essential to
 fix our examination on those which attack the surface of
 the bodv, and the progress of which can therefore be very
 easily observed.
     The prodigious quantity of nerves which spread them
 selves  in the tissue of the skin communicate to it extreme
 delicacy, and such sensibility, that the slightest touch can
 excite in it the sweet emotions of pleasure or the acute sen
 sations of pain.     The nervous fibres, irritated by any cause,
 soon re-act on the ramifications of the sanguine and lymph
 atic vessels with which they are interwoven, and determine
 a considerable afflux of these two fluids.         Do we not see
 all the symptoms which characterize inflammation succes
  sively develop themselves in erysipelas ? and does not the
  action of vesicatories effect in a few houre what erysipelas
  effects more slowly : pain, redness, heat, tension, and ac
  cumulation of limpid serosity beneath the epidermis?           Do
  not these effects announce a salutary effort of nature in the
  erysipelas as in angiotenic fevers ? and ought they not to
  render the practitioner very circumspect in regard to the uso
  of topics, and particularly repcrcussives? Do they not throw
  light also on the use of vesicatories, and prove the utility, and
  often the indispensable necessity, of attracting to the surface
  a phlegmasia which threatens an important organ?             This
  simple, and, as I may say, mechanical explanation is
  founded on multiplied and incontestable facts. It embraces
  almost the whole of the doctrine of epispastics and con
  sequently frees mc from the necessity of entering into
  longer details on the employment of them in phlegmasia!.
      If the small-pox always passed regularly through their
                                                             periods

    240                 On Medical Entomology.
   periods they would be attended with no danger, and, in the
   severest cases, would leave nothing behind them but a slight
   alteration in the features ; but the adynamic and ataxic
   symptoms, which frequently render them complex, con
   vert them into so destructive a malady, that they often re
   sist the most active and best administered medicines. Ino
   culation had much lessened the ravages of this destructive
   scourge, and the immortal discovery of Jenner will extir
   pate the last roots of them.
      The distinguishing signs of peripneumony and pleurisy
  are so uncertain that they have been doubted by some cele
  brated physicians * ; they have been so often belied by ca
  daverous autopsia, my own experience has so many times
  proved their insufficiency, and the principles of the treat
  ment are so identic, that I consider these two affections as
  inseparable, and I unite them, after the example of Cul-
  len f, under the name of pneumonia.
      In acute rheumatism nature is endowed with great energy,
  which it is sufficient to moderate by diluents and severe
  diet in order to obtain a speedy and happy termination. On
  the other hand, in chronic rheumatism the re-action is
 very weak ; the limbs are in such an inert state that it is
  necessary to combat it by tonics given internally, and ap-.
 plied to the suffering parts : vesicatories, and friction with
 alcoholic solution of cantharides, have justly acquired the
 pre-eminence.        The same means have sometimes produced
 excellent effects in white swellings of the joints, which
 often baffle the art of surgery.
     Hemorrhages occupy the third class, and are distinguished
into active and passive.        Vesicatories are rarely indicated in
either ; and it is allowed to employ them only as revulsives
 in certain cases of obstinate hemoptysia.
     Of all diseases neuroses are those which present to the
philosophic physician the most afflicting spectacle, and that
most worthy of his meditation.             He rejects with disdain
hypotheses      more   or less ingenious,  and   the arguments more
or less, captious, of the subtle metaphysician enlightened
by the flambeau of analysis ; he seeks only in the nervous
system for the source of our mental faculties, since a slight
wound of the organ of the brain is sufficient to render the
mildest' man furious, and to plunge the man of genius into
the most deplorable state of idiotism.

    The first order of the neuroses consists chiefly of those
 moral affections which under the name of vesanue torment
 the patients and excite despair in the physician.           Spasms
are classed after vesaniae. The prognostic of them is equally
fatal, and the cure equally doubtful.          We are acquainted
with no remedy for epilepsy, and tetanus kills almost all
those whom it attacks *. Means, however, have been found
to cifre the tetanus of wounds arising from the sudden sup-
           of the puriform flux, by calling back suppuration
  y multiplied incisions, the affusion of warm oil of turpen
Eression
tine, cupping, or the application of vesicatorics             to the
wound f.
   Besides the universal empire which the nerves have over
the animal economy, they exercise a particular influence
on each function, which may be singly altered ; and these
local anomalies constitute the third order of the neuroses.
    One of the finest attributes of the nervous system                                    i=j
without contradiction, that of presiding over the act of re
production.       Ishall not here trace out         list of the pre  a
tended aphrodisiacs, the remembrance of which                  could            I
wish to efface.        will be sufficient for me to observe that
                        It
cantharides form the principal ingredient.
   The premature death of Lucretius           ascribed      his bio
                                                              is               by
graphers   to an  amorous philtre.     The   learned   Pare  relates,
that a  courtesan, having given         ragout, besprinkled with
                                                       a
cantharides, to       young
                        a     man   she  had invited to sup with
her, he soon after experienced symptoms which terminated
in his death.'
    In comatose affections, which form the fourth order of
the neuroses, nature        oppressed but not exhausted.

   Zjinc,     known in China and India under the name of hi*
   tenag,   is employed there not only for alloying with other
   metals, but also by itself for making coin, as I have had
   occasion to ascertain, by trying a piece given to me by
   M.   de Tersan.         This com was of the size of a franc, but
   not so thick.        The centre exhibits a square hole three lines
   in diameter. On the two opposite sides there are Tartar cha
   racters. The two other sides have none. The reverse of
  this piece exhibits Chinese characters on the four faces of
   the square.
      Having attempted to cut this            piece with a pair of scissars,
  it broke : its fracture exhibited           the colour and metallic fa-«
  cets of zinc :      it  showed also,     like zinc cast into thin plates,
  a line which           separates   in   two   the plate of that metal.
  This stroke or line arises from the colour occupied by the
  centre of the cast zinc.          This fracture of the coined zinc of
   China makes known that this semi-metal has been cast in
  order to be converted into money ; for when the grain is
  compressed by the gradual pressure of the roller it ceases
  to be brittle, and exhibits no longer any grain.                 Zinc re
  duced to plates ceases also to emit the creaking noise of
  tin when an attempt is made to break it. This semi-metal,
  instead of breaking by the pressure of the roller, becomes
  more ductile the thinner the plates to which it is reduced.
      The zinc of which this Chinese coin is made is exceedingly
  pure, and burns with the greatest activity at a degree of nre
  proper for fusing it and bringing it to a red heat : it is suf

                          B. G. Sage*.
The      antients, according to Pliny, made incombustible
cloth of the amianthus. In the library of the Vatican there
is shown a handkerchief said to be made of this cloth.       As
to the moderns, I do not know that they make any use of
the amianthus. ; but I saw, twenty years ago, paper made
 of this fossil flax by Mi Levrier de Lisle, proprietor of the
 paper manufactory of Moritargis.       This paper, of which              I
 still have a sheet, has cohesion enough, but it is not so
 smooth as paper made of hemp. It does not yield under the
 pen, and, if the ink is well gummed, one may write on it
with ease and neatness. This paper placed on burning coals
Is not destroyed : it assumes there a brightgray colour,
 Which arises from the size being charred. The characters
 traced out with ink on amianthus paper appear red after
 they have been thus exposed to the fire.        If mucilage of
 gum adraganth had been used instead of size to reduce into
 paste the amianthus which has been subjected to the mill,
 the paper resulting from this process would have more co
 hesion, and be more proper for resisting the action of the
 fire.  It is to be wished that M. Levrier de Lisle had been
 encouraged ; for paper of amianthus might be of great utility
 for preserving deeds, as it resists the activity of the fire,
 from which they would be completely protected were they
 put into cases made of amianthus pasteboard.
     The Chinese know, as well as we do, that the most vio
 lent fire is necessary to vitrify      it,
                                        and that    does not be

 for making furnaces.       One which     saw represented a cy

 grate : there were two doors to the ash-holc.            This fur*
 nace was supported hy a kind of round dish with octa
 gonal edges, and raised on four small cubes.          These edges
 were ornamented with a design exceedingly simple : it con
 sisted of a continued series of circles, with small elevated
 points in the centre.
     The outside and inside of this furnace were as smooth as
 a card : its fracture was like that of pasteboard.           M. de
 Tersan, in whose possession I saw the remains of this fur
  nace, said to me therefore,     "  I do not know how the Chi
  nese can make furnaces of pasteboard to withstand fire."
  Having examined a fragment of this furnace, I found that
  it was entirely amianthus. But in what manner are the
  Chinese able to give it cohesion ? There is reason to pre
  sume that they lcnow, as well as we do, that mucilage of
  gum adraganth has the property of giving body to stony
  rrioleculae, and of contracting with them such union that
  even fire is not able to destroy it.    We have a proof of this
  in the cakes of ponderous spar, or sulphate of barytes, which
  form the Bologna phosphorus, after it lias been calcined
  for several hours among coals, which destroy neither it»
  form nor its solidity.
      To foritl these cakes the ponderous spar is pulverized,
•
  and sifted through a silk sieve : it is then formed into a
  paste, with mucilage of gum adraganth, and made into halls,
  which being flattened are converted into cakes.
      The amianthus, of which the Chinese furnaces are made,
  has been reduced to small parcels in a mill, and then mixed
  with a mucilage to form a paste. This paste the Chinese
  introduce into moulds, the form and polish of which it as-
   surnes, whilst its outside plainly exhibits the parcels of
   which it is composed. This furnace is of a gray colour
   inclining to red : it unites solidity to lightness, arid becomes
  white by fire.     In examining some Chinese productions
   I saw a kind of stuff resembling ouf drugget: its' woof is
   only slips of paper.   This stuff has pliability and strength,
   as may be easily perceived.        As the Chinese have the art
   of making sheets of paper eighteen feet in length, it is not
   astonishing to see stuns of this kind in pieces like the silk
   Stuffs made in other countries.

 XLIII.       On the Property ascribed to Quicklime of increasing
     the Force   of Gunpowder. By M. Lemaistre, Inspector-
     General of Gunpowder and Saltpetre*.
 JL here was published, about eighteen months ago, in the
fifst volume of the Bibliotheque Physico-Economique, a note
announcing that Dr. Baini, a physician of Fojano in Tus
 cany, had found means to increase the strength of gun-
            one third, by adding three gros of pulverized quick-
  ime to each pound of powder.
fiowdcr                                        It was asserted that the
superiority of this gunpowder was attested by the Tuscan
hunters.
    This assertion has been again brought forward in the
tame journal fj and in a manner still more decisive.                    An
anonymous subscriber, in a letter to the editor .enters into
some details calculated to excite the attention of those em
ployed in the manufactory of gunpowder to this subject.
    The first notice of this circumstance had engaged my at
tention a year before; but in trials carefully made with
Regnier's spring proof, the best then known, I did not
obtain a satisfaptory result : I even observed an inferiority
jn the. charges mixed with quicklime in the proportion
above indicated.
    On account Qf certain pjreumstances I was obliged to
defer any further experiments at that time, till the letter
before mentioned induced me to resume the subject, and
give my experiments all the extent possible; which I could
easily do at Latere, the place of my residence.               As we have
here a school of artillery,               engaged    captain  Charbonel,
                                       |
commandant of the sixth regiment of light artillery, in gar
rison here, to take a share in these trials along with me.
Of eight pounds of very dry gunpowder, from the same
barrel, four pounds were exposed for six days on the floor
of a magazine in the polygon w:here we made our trials.
The half of the remaining tour pounds was mixed, as ex
actly as possible, with about a forty-third part of its weight J
of very fresh quicklime, speedily pulverized and sifted, in
order to preserve it from the action of the air, always a little
damp.

846          On the Property ascribed to Quicklime
     The half of the four pounds which had been exposed
to moisture was also mixed with the same quantity of
 quicklime.
     Our intention in regard to these different preparations of
    unpowder was to ascertain whether the presence of quick-
 f,ime added to its strength either as a fourth component
 part, and by a chemical action, or as an absorbent, by
 taking from the powder the humidity it might contain,
 which appeared to us much more probable.                 This we
 hoped    to  discover, on the  one  hand,  by   the  comparative
 employment of the dry and pure powder, and of the dry
 powder mixed with quicklime : on the other, by the pure
 damp powder, and the same powder mixed with quick
 lime.
     We used for our experiments an old brass mortar which
 had formerly served for trying pommon gunpowder. It was
 7 inches 6 points in diameter, and had a cylindric chamber
 the charge of which was three punces, and the globe 60
 pounds.
     The charges were weighed with the greatest exactness :
 the mortar, being pointed at an elevation of 45 degrees, was
 directed each time with such regularity that it deviated very
 little from the line of firing.    The mean ranges given at
 each time of firing were as follows :

     Not contented with these trials, wc were desirous of re-:
  peating those I had made, eighteen months before, with
  Regnier's spring proof; and every thing was arranged for
 that purpose j when, on the first discharge with fine hunting
 gunpowder, or that from one of our powder manufactories,
 the spring broke, and consequently rendered the proof un
 serviceable.     This accident, which took* place when the
 spring was compressed to the 28th degree, as announced by
 z   e index, gives reason to suppose that it would have been
                                                             much,

  much more so by this powder had it not broken, and fur
  nishes a new proof of the superiority of the French gun
  powder to the English, which, when tried several times by
  the same proof, gave only from 15 to 18 degrees.
     Though the results of these proofs seem to indicate that
  in both cases the presence of the quicklime hurt the strength
  of the gunpowder, we are far from wishing to employ them
  to refute what has been announced on this subject.                        We
 are of qpinion that it is too much connected with the public
 and private interest to be combated by our proofs alone,
 whatever care may have been employed in making them.
 We do not know whether we have omitted in these trials
 any circumstances necessary for obtaining the favourable
 results of Dr. Baini ; but we are certain that we followed
 exactly the proportions and processes indicated in the notes
 before mentioned.
     We therefore request all those to whom this point is of
 importance, and it must be so, no doubt, to a great num
 ber, to. repeat and vary these trials, as we propose to do, in
 order that we may attain, if possible, to the results of the
 two philosophers here quoted, and to induce them to give
 some further details in regard to their experiments, by the
 help of which we may attain to the proposed end : they
 seem to be too much animated with a desire to promote the
 public good, to refuse it*.
     These proofs induced me to try others, to ascertain whe
 ther the whole quantity of the charge of cannon, supposing
 it inflames entirely before it issues from the piece, is neces
 sary for producing the greatest effect ; and if it would not be
 possible, without hurting that effect, to substitute for the
    • We
          think it our duty to, quote here a passage from the numerous
additions which M. Eurnot, captain of artillery, had made to his. trans-?
lotion of Henry's Manual of 'Chemistry >
                  "   Mixture of gjticiUmt -mitb Gunpowder.
    " M   Giiffith has confirmed, by a great number of experiments, that
a mixture of gunpowder and quicklime, well dried and pulverized,               in
the proportion of two parts of gunpowder and one of quicklime, produced
a* much effect on blocks of granite as three parts of powde*.         A mixture
in equal pans makes also an explosion, and may serve to establish the
communication between the match and the charge, which is already a
considerable saving.       Dr. Baini has found means to increase a third the
force of gunpowder by adding to it three gros of pulverized quicklime
per pound.      It is sufficient to stir the whole in a vessel until the surface
no longer appears white." — Note of the French editor.

     Portland-street f.
        SIR,
X have herewith sent, for                the inspection of the society,
an improved drawback lock for house doors, &c. which
improvement is in latching the door j for it is well known,
particularly in damp weather, that the air drawing through
it  rusts the head or bevel of the bolt, by which means it
requires great force to shut the door, and occasions a dis
agreeable noise, besides shaking the building.
     It has frequently happened that the house has been ex
posed to robbery trom the door being left unlatched, when
supposed to be fast.              This improvement removes all those
inconveniences, as it lets the bolt shoot into the staple
immediately when the door closes, but not before ) and the
reliever works so very easy, that the door is made fast with
one twenty-fourth part of the force required with locks upon
the common construction.
     By an experiment with the lock sent herewith, it will be
proved that two ounces added to the reliever, will shoot
the lock with more ease than three pounds will do applied
to the bevel bolt; and if the lock is rusty, the advantage
will be much more in favour of the new method. I flatter
nryself it will be of great utility to the public, as its con
struction is simple and cheap. It may be added to any old
lock, as may be seen from that now sent.                     It may be ad
 vantageously applied to French windows and glass doors,
 as it prevents        the door from being strained, or the glass
broke, by the force applied to shut them.                      I have fixed

 equal action on the   body on which it is placed. This, in
 cheese-making, will be found peculiarly advantageous ; fo?
 it is from this very cause of want of sufficient pressing that
 cheeses are frequently so very bad.   Were the curd entirely
 separated from the impure and contaminating mixture of
 the whey, which must he effected by the regular action of
 this machine, we should always have the cheese firm and
 wholesome ; and, I have not a doubt, the press will be
 found equally useful in all other cases, and answer every
 purpose, even beyond expectation, to which it is adapted.

Charles Taylor, Esq.
      It   appears       matter of much importance to the
                          to be   a
people          of any country,
                           at all times, whether in war or
peace,   to possess  complete knowledge of its surface. In
                              a
war, such knowledge         absolutely necessary for defence
                                       is                                                   j
in peace, for improving the country to the best advantage.
    Now, since geography may be improved, an easy and
accurate method to lay down maps of mountainous coun
tries and hilly estates will perhaps prove useful, as     will                        it
show at single view the true shape and comparative height
                a
of the ground without the art of painting.
    As mountains are apt to eclipse each other, perspective               a
view      seldom very extensive, the rules of which fall short
           is
of giving an accurate idea of any hilly country because                        ;

is  not so    any other.
                 in       The altitudes of mountains appear
in proportion to the distance from the eye, and no rule in
geometry has been found sufficient to determine distances
from any single station.    Neither can     bird's-eye view of   a
an estate ascertain the depth of valleys or the height of
mountains.      But the method here proposed will be found

 equally capable of giving the true shape of any ground above
 or below water. It inayte successfully applied to se^i charts,
 and will prevent much confusion, arising from the tedious
method of distinguishing soundings by a multitude of
 figures.
                            Explanation.
    Suppose a full description is required of any island in the
ocean.     First, let an accurate map be laid down in the com
mon way ; and let the perpendicular height between the
 highest point of land and the ocean be divided into any
number of equal parts.         Suppose these'equal divisions are
 100, 200, 300, 400 feet above the low-water mark.         From
 the different points of these several divisions let horizontal
 lines be run with a good theodolite, and spirit-level an
nexed, all rouhd the island. If the work is well done, each
line will end where it began; and if the bearings and di
stances of these several lines are truly laid down on the
map, the crooked courses of them will clearly show the
sh^pe of the ground over which they pass.         For example :
 if any horizontal line passes by the side of a steep hill, it
will incline towards the ocean, or approach the next hori
zontal line below it.      When the same line crosses a stream
of running water or a valley, it will naturally bend up the
side of the said stream until it can cross it without losing
the level ; or, in other words, it will bend towards the cen,tr«?
of the island. Hence, by a little practice, the shape of the,
several horizontal lines on the map will give as clear an
idea to the mind of the shape of any country over which
they pass, as a sight of the country itself can convey, to the
eye.     But to obtain a mathematical and true knowledge of
the altitude and declivity of any part of the country, we.
have the following proposition :
    As the perpendicular height of any one, horizontal line
above another is to the radius, so is the horizontal di
stance between the horizontal lines measured on the map
at any particular place, to the co-tangent of declivity at
that place.
    Able : If the horizontal distance between any two hori
zontal lines on the map is equal to the perpendicular height
of any horizontal line above another, the angle of altitude,
or declivity, of any hill will be 45 degrees.
    The present improvement, which I believe to be entirely
new, will be found to possess the following advantages :
    1st. Military men ale well acquainted with the many
advantages always to be gained from the exact representa
tion ol high grounds.       By this method wc are able to give
                                                            'the

        Geographical and Topographical Improvements.                253
the angle    of altitude, the angle of declivity, and perpendi
cular height of every hill ; likewise the comparative height
of different hills, the best route by which the high grounds
may be gradually ascended, and where heavy burthens can
be drawn up with most ease. *
    2dly. Experience his sufficiently shown that the inhabi
tants of low grounds are subject to different kinds of sick
ness, from which those living at places elevated to a certain
degree are exempt. A map on this improved plan will point
out the most proper situation for building dwelling-houses.
It will be useful in b< tany, in discovering or cultivating
some kinds of plants which flourish best at particular di
stances above the level of the ocean.           It will trace the line
of vegetation on the sides of lofty mountains whose tops
 are covered with eternal snow.
    3dly. Some high lands are known to produce good grain,
 while low lands afford grass more abundantly ; but most
 grounds produce good grass over which a moderate quan
 tity of running water is conveyed. A plan of any country
 in this way will show all the ground that can be irrigated ;
 where water-works may be erected ; where navigable canals
 may be cut ; and where highwavs and rail-roads may be
 laid out on the best and most level ground.
     4thly. The subterraneous treasures of the mineral and
 fossil kingdoms are generally found in strata ; and, if they
 are not truly horizontal, they make a certain angle with
  the horizon.      A map on this projection may enable the
  mineralogist    to  follow any one stratum at places even far
  distant from each other.

XLVIL        Description of a Safety Valve, containing a Vacuum
              Valve in the same Hole of the Boiler*.
In    large boilers or eoppers, where boiling fluids are in
closed, a safety valve is generally used to prevent their
bursting, from an unexpected excessive forte of the elastic
steam, and, besides, a vacuum valve, to prevent their being
compressed or crushed by the weight of external air, in the
case of a sudden condensation of the vapours.                 These two
valves are commonly fitted in two different holes in the
boiler ; but as a more simple, and consequently more eligi
ble method, seems to be that of joining them together, I
take the liberty to submit to the Society for the Encourage
ment of Arts, &c. the following contrivance for that pur
pose   :

the vacuum valve, consisting in         plane circular plate, with
                                                     a
a  brass tube sliding along the rod, and pressed              spiral             by   a
spring to the safety valve ah (against which              has been             it
well ground in making it), closing in that situation the
 openings tt.
    Such being the construction of the whole,              evident,        it    is
that when the elasticity of the steam increases, the two
valves, joined together, with the holes           shut, make but  it
one, opposing to the elasticity of the steam an united re
sistance, which        regulated by the weight kk, in the com
                            is

and opens to itself      passage into the boiler.

  XLVIII. An        Account      of the Tea Tree.        By Frederick
                                Pigou, Esq.*
   JL he Chinese all agree there is but one sort or specie's of
  the tea tree ; and that the difference in tea arises from the
  soil and manner of curing f.
      Chow-qua, who has been eight times in the bohea coun*
  try, and who has remained there from four to six months
  each time, says, that many people, among their tea leaves,
  especially at Ankov, near Ainoy, put leaves of other trees^
  but that of these there are but two or three trees the leaves
  of which will serve that purpose } and they may easily be
  known, especially when opened by -hot water, because they
  are not indented as tea leaves are.
      He says, that bohea may be cured as hyson, and hysori
 as bohea, and so of all other sorts ; but that experience
 has shown, the teas are cured as best suits the qualities
 they have from the soils where they grow ; so that bohea
 will make bad hyson* and hyson, though very dear in the
 country where it grows; bad bohea.       However, in the pro
 vince of Tokyen, which may be called the Bohea province,
 there has since a few years some tea been made after the
 hyson manner, which has been sold at Canton as such.
     The bohea country, in the province of Tukyen, is very
 rlilly, and since some years greatly enlarged ; the length of
it is four or five days journey* or as much again as it for
merly was. The extent of the soil tha\produces the best
bohea tea is not more than 40         or aboutli,    miles in

also   ; the hilU, however, are reckoned to produce the best
tea; on them grow congo, peko, and souchong, in the
Valleys or rlat parts of the country bohea.    As to the tnie
souchong, the whole place does not yield three peculs                  j

Youngshaw says, not more than SO catty. The value of it
on the spot is i^ or two tales the catty, about ten or twelve
shillings the pound.             What is sold to Europeans tor
souchong is only the first sort of congo, and the congo they
buy is only the first sort of bohea. Upon a hill planted
with tea trees, one only shall produce leaves good enough
to be called souchong, and of those only the best and
youngest are taken ; the others make congo of the several
sorts, and bohea.
   There are four or five gatherings of bohea tea in a year,
according to the demand there is for                       it,
                                                        but three or at

one gathering, viz. of the first and youngest leaves                  all    }
others make inferior tea.
   The first gathering         iscalled tow-tchune, the second curl,
or gee-tchune, the third san-tchune.                 If the first leaves
are not gathered, they grow large and rank, and are not
supplied     by  the second leaves, which oniy come in their
room or place, and so on.
   The first gathering          is  reckoned fat or oily, the second
less so, the      third   hardly at all so, yet the leaves look young.
The    first gathering    is  from about the middle of April to the
end   of  May,     the   second   from about the middle of June to
the   middle    of  Julv,   the   third   from about the beginning of
August       to   the   latter  end    of   September.    Tea      neveris
gathered      in   winter.      The    first  gathering  or  leaf, when

   The method of curing bohea tea of these three growths                         is,

 they are tatched in larger quantities, and over a cooler of
  slower fire, and then put into baskets over a charcoal fire,
 as is practised on some occasions at Canton.         When the
 tea is fired enough, which a person of skill directs, it is
 spread on a table, and picked or separated from the too
 large, leaves, yellow leaves, unrolled, broken or bad leaves.
     Youngshaw says, bohea tea is gathered, sunned in
baskets, rolled with the hand, and then tatched ; which
  completes it.
     Another says it is gathered, then put in sieves or baskets,
 about a catty in each, and those put in the air till the leaves
 wither or give, after which they are put into a close place
 out of the air, to prevent their growing red, until the even
 ing, or for some hours ; the smell then comes out of
 them. They are after this tatched a little, then rolled, and
 then tatched again ; and about half a catty is tatched at one
 time.                                                         •
     Congo, says Chow-qua, is tatched twice, as is souchong;
 but Youngshaw says souchong and congo are not tatched,
 but only fired two or three times.      The latter is most pro
 bable, but yet the former may be true ; for as tatching
 seems to give the green colour to the leaves of the tea trees,
 so we may observe something of that greenness in the
 leaves of congo and souchong teas.         Youngshaw further
 says, that the leaves of souchong, congo, hyson, and fine
 .singlo trees are beat with flat sticks or bamboos, after they
 have been withered by the sun or air, and have acquired
 toughness enough to keep them from breaking, to force out
 of them a raw or harsh smell.
     Souchong is made from the leaves of trees three years
old, and where the soil is very good ; of older, when not
so good, congo is made.        The leaves of older trees make
bohea. The tea trees last many years.            When tea trees,
grow nld and die, that    is,  when the bodies of the trees fail,
the roots produce new sprouts.
     Peko  is made from the leaves of trees three years old, and
from the tenderest of them, gathered just alter they have
been  in   bloom, when the small leaves that grow between
the two first that have appeared, and which altogether make
a   sprig, are downy and white, and resemble young hair or
down.       Trees of four, five, and six years old may still
make peko       ;but after that they degenerate into bohea    if
thev grow on the plains, and into congo          ifthey grow on
the hills.
    Lintsessin seems to be made from very young leaves rolled
up, and stalks of the tree      ;the leaves arc gathered before

   The worst sort of Ankoy is not tatched ; but An<coy
congo, as it is called, is cured with care, like good bohea
or congo: this sort is generally packed in small chests.
There is also Ankoy-pekaj but the smell of all these teas
is much inferior to those of the bohea country.             However,
Ankoy congo of the first sort is generally dearer at Canton
than the interior growths of bohea.
    As tatching the tea makes it sweat, as the Chinese term
it,  or throw out an oil, the tatche in time becomes dirty,
and must be washed.
    If bohea tatched only twice, will be reckoned slovenly

   Tunkey singlo tea is the best, which is owing to the soil :
it grows near the hyson country.     Ordinary singlo tea is
neither so often tatched or picked as the above described.
   There are two gatherings of the singlo tea, the first in
April and May, the second in June ; each gathering is
divided into three or more sorts ; the leaves of the first are
large, fine, fat, and dean ; of this sort there may be col
lected from a pecul, from 40 to 55 catties, usually 45. The
second sort is picked next, and what then remains is the
third or worst sort. •
   Tunkey, like other singlo tea, is made into two or three
sorts ; the best is sometimes sold for hyson of an inferior
growth.
   Of hyson there are also two gatherings, and each gather
ing is distinguished into two or more sorts ; but as great
care is taken in gathering              it,
                                 60 catties may be chosen from
one pecul, when only 45 catties can be chosen from singlo.
   Hyson-skin, as           called, has its name from being
                             it   is

                   by
   Gomi (or Gobee) and Ootsicn, are also leaves picked
from the hyson leaves.       Those called gomi are small and
very  much    twisted,  so that  they appear like bits of wire.
The ootsien are more like little balls.
   There are many different growths of singlo and hyson
teas, and also some difference           the manner of curing

occasions difference of quality in the teas, as does also                     a
good or bad season.      A rainy season, for instance, makes

The leaves of bing are long and thin, those of singlo are
short and thick.

them through boiling water, then cure them as other leaves
are cured    after which they pound them, and mix them

                                                  ;
which they are mixed make combinations without end.
The differences to be observed in teas arise from the soils.

fires; wood, and that green, instead of charcoal; some
times straw or broom for bad teas and to the seasons,     ;
which should not be too wet or too dry, too cold or too
hot.    The Chinese also sell at Canton all sorts of old teas
for new, after they have prepared them for that purpose,

    Loot-sitn, true sort, is what really grows in the Loot-
sien country.      Some tea is planted near Loot-sien that
passes for that tea, and that is the case in all the countries.
    Besides the teas before enumerated, many other teas are
planted, as in the Honan country, &c. the quantities they
produce cannot be easily ascertained ; but upon the whole,
it is reckoned, that in ten parts, not above three are ex
ported.
    In one hundred Chinese, it is reckoned forty only can
afford to drink tea ; the others drink water only. Many,
when they have boiled their rice, put water into the tatche
in which the rice was boiled, to which some grains always
adhere ; the water loosens them, and is browned by the
 rice : that water they drink instead of tea.
    The tea sent into Tartary is mostly green, perhaps in the
proportion of seven to two.
    Old bohea is reckoned good by the Chinese; in a fever
they use it to cause perspiration, and put into it a black or
coarse sugar, with a little ginger.
    Old hyson, one or two cups made strong, removes ob
structions in the stomach, caused by over-eating or indi
gestion. It is to be used if a weight is felt some hours after
eating, and it will remove it.

      Amongst the natives of India, the transitions from one
  stage of improvement to another are so exceedingly slow,
  as scarcely to deserve the name, except it be the few who
  have benefited by the example of Europeans : they naturally
  possess a strong disinclination at departing from the beaten

practices. We ourselves ought more generally to keep in
view, and to instil into their minds, this maxim, that every
new proposition, merely on account of its novelty, must
not be rejected, otherwise our knowledge would no longer
be progressive, and every kind of improvement must cease.

 I    believe there are tew districts          in

 therefore where we find     province or district in which the
                                a
 culture of the cane and making of sugar have been in prac

 much exertion, to be able to increase the culture, and im
 prove,    if,
             necessary, the quality.  .
     In the northern provinces, as well as in Bengal, Cadapah,
  &c. large quantities of sugar and jagary are made;        it
                                                            is
  only in the Rajahmundry and Ganjam districts of these
  northern provinces where the cane       cultivated for making
                                               is
  sugars.  I  will confine my observations to the first, where
I     have resided betweenten and eleven years.
      This branch of agriculture,      in
                                   the above-mentioned sircar,
is  chiefly carried on in the Peddapore and Pettapore, along
 the banks of the Elyseram river, which, though small, has
a  constant flow of water in     the whole year round, suffi
                                      it
 ciently large, not only to water the sugar plantations during
 the dryest seasons, but also    great variety of other produc

 tions, such as paddy, ginger, tiirmcrick, yams, chillies, &c.
 This stream of water, during the dryest season, renders the
 lands adjoining to this river of more value,     presume, than
                                                        I

     But to return to the        culture of sugar : in         these two ze-
 mindaries from 350 to 700 vissuras, or from 700 to 1400
 acres of land (the vissum being two acres) is annually em
 ployed for the rearing sugar cane, more or less, according
 to the demand for the sugar ; for they could and would
 with pleasure, if they were certain of a market, grow and
 manufacture more than ten times the usual quantity ; for
 it is very profitable, and there is abundance of very proper
 land : all they want is a certain market for their sugar.
    Besides the above-mentioned, a third more maybe made
 on the Delta of the Godavary.
     From the same spot they do not attempt to rear a second
 crop oftener than every third or fourth year ; the cane im
poverishes it so much, that it must rest, or be employed
during the two or three intermediate years for the growth
of such plants as are found to improve the soil, of which
 the Indian farmer is a perfect judge: they find the legumi
nous tribe the best for that purpose.
    The method of cultivating the cane and manufacturing
the sugar by the natives hereabouts              is,  like all other works,
exceedingly simple; the whole apparatus,                      a few pairs of
buffaloes or bullocks excepted, does not amount to more
than   a  few  1
               (   5 or 20) pagodas    ;      as many thousand pounds
is  generally, I    believe, necessary to set out the West India
planter,
    The soil that suits the cane best in this climate,                    rich
                                                                             is   a
vegetable earth, which, on exposure to the air, readily
crumbles down into          a very fine mould        :   it   also necessary
                                                              is
for  it  to be of such      a   level as allows of its being watered
from the river         by
                        simply damming          it  up, (which almost the
whole of the land adjoining to this river admits of,) and yet
so high as to be easily drained during heavy rains.                      Such
a  soil, and in such        a  situation, having been well melio
rated     byvarious crops of leguminous plants, or fallowing,
for two    or  three years,      is slightly manured, or has had for
some     time    cattle   pent    in   it: a   favourite manure for the
cane   with   the   Hindu     farmer,      is  the rotten straw of green
and    black    pessaloo (phaseolus mingo max)                .  During the
months of April and May,              it   is   repeatedly ploughed with
the common Hindu plough, which soon brings this loose
rich soil into very excellent order.               About the end of May
and beginning       ot June   the    rains   generally set in, in frequent
heavy    showers:      now      is the    time    to plant the cane: h\\\
should the rains hold back, the prepared field                      watered,
                                                                        is
flooded    from    the   river,    and     while   perfectly  wet,   like soft
mud,    whether    from    rain   or  the   river,  the  cane     planted,
                                                                   is

                nf cultivating   the Sugar Cane.                 267
  The method is most simple : — Labourers, with baskets of
the cuttings, of one or two joints each, arrange themselves
along one side of the field ; they walk side by side, in as
straight a line as their eye and judgment enable them,
dropping the sets at the distance of about eighteen inches
•sunder in the rows, and about four feet row from row :
other labourers follow, and with the foot press the set about
two inches into the soft mud-like soil, which, with a sweep
or two with the sole of the foot, they most easily and readily
cover : nothing more is done. If the weather is moderately
shower)', till the young shoots are some two or three inches
high, the earth is then loosened, for a few inches round
them, with a small weeding iron, something like a carpen
ter's chisel : should the season prove dry, the field is occa
sionally watered from the river, continuing to weed, and to
keep the ground loose round the stools.          In August, two
or three months from the time of planting, small trenches
are cut through the field at short distances, and so contrived
as to serve to drain off the water, should the season prove
too wet for the canes; which is often the case, and would
render their juices weak and unprofitable : the farmer there
fore never fails to have his field plentifully and judiciously
 intersected with drains, while the cane is small, and before
 the usual time for the violent rains. Should the season
 prove too dry, these trenches serve to conduct the water
 from the river the more readily through the field, and also
 to drain off what docs not soak into the earth in the course
 of a few hours ; for they say, if water is permitted to remain
 in the field for a greater length of time, the cane would suffer
 by  it, so that they reckon these drains indispensably neces
 sary; and upon their being well contrived depend, in a
 great measure, their future hopes of profit.        Immediately
 after the fieldis  trenched, the canes are all propped this is
                                                         :
 an operation I     do not remember to have seen mentioned
 by any writer on this subject, and          probably peculiar to
                                             is
 these parts.  It    isdone as follows   :
     The canes are now about three feet high, and generally
 from three to six from each set that has taken root, and
 form what we may call the stool     :  the lower leaves of each
  cane are first carefully wrapped up round       it,
                                                    so as to cover
it  completely in every part;    asmall strong bamboo (or two),
  eight or ten feet long,
                          is  then stuck into the earth, in the
 middle of each stool, and the canes thereof tied to      it ; this
  secures them in an erect position, and gives the air free ac
  cess round everv. part.    As the canes advance in size, they
  continue wrapping them round with the lower leaves, as

   •26s            Account   of tlte Hindu Metkod
  they begin to wither, and to tie them to the prop bamboos
  higher up, during which time, if the weather is wet, they
  keep the drains open ; and if a drought prevails they water
  thein occasionally from the river, cleaning and loosening
  the ground every five or six weeks*       Tying the leaves so
  carefully round every part of the canes, they say, prevents
  them from cracking or splitting by the heat of the sun,
  helps to render the juice richer, and prevents their branch
  ing out round the sides : it is certain you never see a branchy
  cane here.
     In January and February the canes are ready to cut,
 which is about nine months from the time of planting ; of
 course, I need not describe it. Their height, when stand
 ing in the field, will now be from eight to ten feet (foliage
included), and the naked cane from an inch to an inch and
 a quarter in diameter.
     A mill or two, or even more, according to the extent of
 the field, is erected, when wanted, in the open air, gene
 rally under the shade of large mangoe trees, of which there
 are great abundance hereabout : the mill is small, exceed
 ingly simple, and at the same time efficacious. The juice,
 as fast as expressed, is received in common earthen pots,
 strained, and put into boilers, which are, in general, of an
 oval form, composed of ill-made thick plates of country
 iron riveted together.
     These boilers hold from 80 to 100 gallons ; in each they
 put from 24 to 30 gallons of the strained juice ; the boiler
is placed over a drart-fumace, which makes the fire burn
with great violence, being supplied with a strong draft of
 air through a large subterranean passage, which also serve9
for an ash-hole.      At first the fire is moderate, but as the
scum is taken off, a point they are not very nice about in
these parts, as they look up to quantity more than quality,
the fire is by degrees increased, so as to make the liquor
boil very smartly : nothing whatever is added to help the
scum to rise, or the sugar to gain, except when the planter
wants a small quantity for his own or a friend's use : in
this case they add about 10 or 12 pints of sweet milk to
every 24 or 30 gallons, or boiler of juice, which no doubt
improves the quality of the sugar ; the scum, with this ad
dition, comes up more abundantly, and is more carefully
removed.                                                         ,
     The liquor is never here removed into a second boiler,
but is in the same boiled down to a proper consistence,
which they guess at by the eye and by the touch } the fire
is then withdrawn, and in the same vessel suffered to cool

a little   :when it becomes pretty thick they stir it about
with stirring-sticks for some time, till it begins to take the
form of sugar ; it is then taken out and put on mats made
of the leaves of the palmira tree (borassus flabelLiformis) ,
where the stirring is continued till it is cold : it is then put
up in pots, baskets, &c. till a merchant appears to buy it.
     The Hindu name of this sugar is pansadarry ; its colour
is often fairer than most of the raw sugars made in our
West India islands, but it is of a clammy, unctuous nature,
 absorbing much moisture during wet weather, sometimes
 sufficient to melt a great deal of it, if not carefully stowed
 in some very dry place where smoke has access to it.
     Many of the planters prefer that sort of sugar which thev
 call bellum, and Europeans jagary, because it keeps well
 during the wet weather if kept from the wet.         It generally
 bears a lower price ; yet they say this disadvantage is often
 overbalanced by their being able to keep              it,
                                                      with only               a
 trifling wastage, till market offers, particularly when the
                             a
 planter has not an immediate market for his sugar          besides,
                                                                ;
 sanes of inferior quality answer for jagary when unfit for
 sugar.
     The process observed for making jagary differs from the
  above described, in having       quantity of quicklime thrown
                                         a
  into the boiler with the cane juice; about spoonful and
                                                      a                       a
  half to every six or seven gallons of juice, or nine or ten
  spoonfuls in the boiler.      Here they do not remove the
  scum, but let it   mix with the liquor, and, when of proper           a
  consistence, about four or five ounces of Gingeley oil (oil
  of the seeds of sesamum orientale,) are added to each boiler
  of liquor, now ready to be removed from the fire, and very
  well mixed with    it  :    then poured into shallow pits dug
                             it    is
 in the ground they are generally about three feet long, one
                ;
  and a    nalf broad, and three inches deep, with mat laid         a
  at the bottom, which         slightly strewed with qufcklime^
                                   is
  ina    short time the liquor incorporates into         firm solid
                                                               a
  mass     these large cakes they wrap up in dry leaves, and

      Their jagary  is of darker colour than their sugar, and
                             a
                             .
   contains more impurities, owing to the careless manner in
   which they prepare        it,    by
                               allowing all the scum to reunite
 with the liquor.*
   The half vissum, or one acre of sugar cane,     tolerable   in   a
 season,  yields about ten candy of the above-mentioned
 sugar, or rather more     made into jagary
                                   if           each candy :
 weighs about 500 lb., and   worth on the spot, from 16 to
                                         is
 24 rupees, according to the demand.    In the West Indies,
                                                         the

  270             Account  of the Hindu Method
 the acre (so far as my information goes, and it is chiefly
 from Mr. Beckford's History of Jamaica,) yields from 14
 to 20 cwt. of their raw sugar, worth on the island about
 20l. currency: here the produce is more than double, but,
 on account of its interior quality, and the low price it bears
 on the spot, the produce does not yield a great deal more
money than in the West Indies : however, as here labour
is incomparably cheaper, the Indian planter must make
 much larger profits.
    The situation of all the sugar lands hereabout is exactly
 alike, being the middle of an extensive plain, adjoining to
 the aforementioned river ; the soil in all is also much alike,
 so that the produce is nearly equal in all, when no unfa
vourable circumstances happen : this is further proved by
 the quantity of sugar a measure of juice will yield : here it
is almost always, except in a very rainy season, or in laid
down or wormy canes, about one-sixth part ; that is, every
 six pounds, or three quarts of juice, yield one pound of
 sugar. In Jamaica, Mr. Beckford says, that, on an ave
 rage, 1800 gallons of juice may be reckoned to yield an
 hogshead of sugar, weight 16 cwt., which is, within a trifle,
 one of sugar from eight of juice : this proves our juice to be
 one-fourth part richer than theirs.    From the above calcu
lations it is evident that our lands hereabout are better
adapted for this species of culture than the lands in Jamaica :
for here they not only yield a larger crop of cane*, hut the
juice thereof is also richer ; and were our planters here to
"bring the molasses, &c. into account, employed in the
West Indies for the distillation of rum, their profits would
be still greater ; for at present such refuse they give to their
cattle, or let their labourers carry away, or use as they
think proper ; and, by being so employed, I have no doubt
but it is productive of more real good than if converted into
ardent spirits : let it continue to be so employed, is my sin
cere wish ; for the longer they arc ignorant how to convert
what is at present wholesome into a poison, the better it it
for them ; they have already too many ways of furnishing-
themselves with spirits, particularly near the residence of
Europeans.
    Here the canes, while growing, seem also subject to
fewer accidents than in the West Indies.         I will mention,
them briefly.
    1st. A very wet season is the worst; it injures the canes
greatly, rendering them of a reddish colour, yidding a poor
unprofitable juice: here they reckon the small heavy pale
yellow canes the best.
                                                    2d. Storms,

               of cultivating       the Sugar Cane.                 2/1
    2d. Storms, unless they are very violent, do no great
harm, because the canes are propped ; however, if they are
once laid down, which sometimes happens, they become
branchy and thin, yielding a poor watery juice.
    3d. The worm is another evil, which generally visits them
every few years.     A beetle deposits its eggs in the young
cane ; the caterpillars of these remain in the cane, living on
its medullary parts, till they are ready to be metamorphosed
into the chrysalis state.     Sometimes this evil is so great as
to injure a sixth or an eighth part of the field : but, what
is worse, the disease is commonly general when it happens,
few fields escaping.
    4th. The flowering is the last accident they reckon upon,
although it scarcely deserves the name ; for it rarely hap
pens, and never but to a very small proportion of some very
few fields : those canes that flower have very little juioe
left, and it is by no means so sweet as that of the rest.
    Say the average quantjty of land employed for the growth
of sugar canes in these parts, the zemindaries of Peddapore
 and l'ettapore, independent of what is made on or about
 the islands formed by the mouths of the Godavary, is 550
vissums, equal to 110 acres, and to produce at the rate of
 10 candy, or about 44 cwt., equal to 2£ hogsheads per
acre: the whole produce in hogsheads will annually be
 27,500 of 18 cwt. each, which is fully one-fourth part of
 sugar produced in the island of Jamaica ; and I know well,
 that the quantity might, with advantage to government, I
was going to say,— but that must be left to T>e determined
 hereafter, — 1 will therefore say, with advantage to the ze
 mindar, farmer, and labourer, be increased to any extent.
 All the security the planter wants, is a strict adherence to
 the agreement he makes with the zemindar for the land,
 and a certain market for his sugar, at even the lowest price
 stated.   I observe that the farmer would require to have the
 agreement he makes for the rent of the land strictly adhered
 to, because the zemindar raises his demand if the crop is
 good; so that be will often, in a favourable season, make
 farmers of all denominations pay probably a fourth more
 than the original agreement.         Such injustice they are
 obliged  to put up  with,  as custom  has rendered it common,
 and they have no idea of applying for redress ; vet it no
 doubt damps the spirit of industry, and prevents the soil
 from any further improvement than the bountiful hand of
 Nature has bestowed on       it,which, in these parts,    great
                                                               is
indeed.
   The planters   in   these parts very   rarely take   a   second, or
                                                                 what

what they call carsy crop, from the same field ; they say he
is either'a very poor or a very lazy farmer that does, be
cause those canes yield less juice, and of an inferior quality,
than plant canes : however, poverty obliges some to do so.
This catsy crop is cut and manufactured in November,
which is a busy season in the paddy fields, 8cc. as this is
the time for reaping the coarseor early paddy and natcheny,
and for sowing various sorts of small grain, consequently
attending to the sugar works at that time of the year is in
convenient : besides, the rains are frequent during this
month, which is another very great drawback attending
this crop. The grand sugar crop fortunately happens during                   ¦
that time of the year (February, March, and April) when
there is. scarce any other sort of work in the field : conse
quently both humanity and policy plead in favour of an ex
tended scale to this, or such other branches of agriculture
as employ the labourers at a season when there is little or
nothing else to do.
    I could never learn that any one had ever depended on a
third crop from the same field ; for they say, if the second
is so much inferior to the first, a third must be still worse;
here hands are, or rather were, so numerous, and labour
so cheap, that they find it much more profitable to plant
every year.
    In the Ganjam district, about Aska               and Barampore, the
natives make       most    excellent    sugar   and  sugar-candy, but in
small quantities.         The    sugar   is  in loaves,   of a large grain,
tnd often      as  perfectly     white    as  what  is  called in England
single   refined    sugar,    and   the  sugar-candy     is superior to any
thing of    the   kind   I  ever  saw.
    Mr. Alex. Anderson, surgeon of the Madras establish
ment, when with the committee of circuit up there, was
so obliging as to send me a very part icular account of the
method they follow in manufacturing their sugar and sugar-
candy, of which the following is a copy :

    "  After   the cane is ready, it is cut in pieces of a foot or
eighteen     inches   long, and on the same day it is cut, these
 pieces  are   put  into   a wooden mill, which is turned round by
 bullocks ; on one side of the mill is a small hole sufficient
 to let the juice pass through, which is received in an
 earthen pot placed for the purpose.                    The juice is then
                                                                   strained.

strained into other pots, containing about 24 quarts, and
to each pot of juice is added about three ounces of quick
lime.    It is then boiled for a considerable time, till, on
taking out a little, and tubbing it between the fingers, it
has a waxy feel, when it is taken off the fire, and put intd
Smaller pots With mouths six inches in diameter.        The mass
may now be kept iii this state for six or eight months or
more, and it is necessary at any rate to do so for a month
Or six weeks.      When the process is intended to be conti
nued, a small hole is made in the bottom, through which
the syrup drains off.      It is then taken out of these pots and
put into shallow bambdo baskets, that any remaining syrup
may exude ; after which it is put in a cloth i and the syrup
is squeezed through the cldth, adding a little water to it
occasionally; that it may be more perfectly removed ; the
sugar is then dissolved in water, and boiled a second time
in wide-mouthed pots, containing only three seers, with
not too fierce a fire, adding from time to time a little milk
and water, and stirring it frequently; which is used by these
beople to clarify        instead of eggs, which their religion
                       it,
forbids them to touch. The sciim is removed as        itis thrown
up, and when     it  resumes the waxy feel on rubbing         little

of draining off any little quantity of syrup that may still
exude.     The outside of the pots arc now covered with cow-
dungi and, for the purpose of making the sugar white, or
removing any syrup or blackish appearance, the creeping

         " Here we see a very superior sugar, and sugar-candy
      of the first quality, manufactured, in a simple but tedious
     manner, and at a most trifling expense j a few earthen pots
     are the only vessels or boilers they require s but it is not to
     be imagined that such would succeed if the work was car
     ried on to any great extent.         The iron boilers employed
     hereabout might be laid aside for those of copper*,or of cast
     iron, from Europe, or not, as they like themselves, for it
     seems of no great consequence : but by having a greater
     number of them to pass through and be well clarified in,
     would render unnecessary the second process mentioned by
     Dr. Anderson, which, on account of its tediousness, must
     become very inconvenient : consequently, all that seems to
     be wanted to render the sugars made thereabouts fit for any
     market, is a boiler, or two or three more in each set, with
     wooden coolers, instead of losing time to let it cool in the
     boiler, as is the practice here at present, the addition uf
     some quicklime, and probably alum, to the cane juice, and
     the subsequent claying of it in conical pots, as is done in
     the West Indies j for which process the natives1 of the
    CJanjam district substitute moist conserva for covering the
    sugar in the pots with, and wrapping the loaves,' when
    not sufficiently white, in wet cloths, to extract the
    molasses.
        "   The rate of freight from India to England being so very
    high, renders it the more necessary to make the sugars for
    that market of a good quality, which can be done here at
    infinite less expense than in the West India islands, where i
    labour is so exceedingly high.                             _ ;.

             If the sugar cane can be cultivated with so much ease,
    and to such perfection, in this climate (which is consider
   ably hotter than the West Indies), by simply burying the set
   about two inches in the level ploughed field, by which prac
   tice the superficial or horizontal roots must be near the sur-
   face, of course subject to great heats j 1 say, if this practice
   succeeds so well here, it may be presumed it would succeed
   equally well, if not better, in the West Indies, where the
   heats are never so great, of course the superficial roots of the
   cane less subject to be scorched.
    : '•' The present practice      of digging large square holes to
   put    the   sets in, is, I am  told, exceedingly laborious, and
   does not stand the planter in less than 101. per acre, which is
   nearly double the whole expense of cultivating, from first to
                                                                 last,

emancipate the slaves on those islands, the planter there
may then be obliged to cultivate and plant his lands in the
manner practised here, or as potatoes are planted with the
plough in thse fields in England ; and there is scarce a doubt
but that they would in either way succeed fully as well as
by planting m holes.

East India sugars into England, it is even then of infinite
irnportance:to theGbitipany's territories to have the qualities
of their sugars improved, so as to render unnecessary the
importation of those of China and Batavia, large sums
being annually thrown into those places for this commodity ;

making this necessary article of the best quality, to the full

 On    Saturday the 23d of March, tbey got the main band
seam of Coal, about 1 1 feet thick (on the same day, coals
were shipped at the North Wall) of very excellent quality*
and at about 92 fathoms from the surface to the bottom of
it. The coal lies immediately under an excellent reef of
very hard white post, or freestone; containing little water.
A   considerable quantity of hydrogen gas (generally termed
 inflammable air) issues from it : but, from an excellent
ventilation of atmospheric air, from the surface, improved
by the rarefaction of a large fire or lamp, the inflarmnabk

matter is happily carried off*.                         •
    In sinking through different posts of . this freestone,
 several very strong seeds of such gas vented through the
joints of the stone, which, when lighted by a candle, burnt
 very violently, and exploded to a large flame of fire; and
would have continued so, if suffered.        In pricking one of
 these seeds, the noise resembled that      of a great waterfall ;

and the strength of the inflammable air made the water                    ny
up the pit for several yards.
  This pit commands a most extensive field of coal,                       in
three different workable seams (see following thicknesses) ,•
and when opened out, even by a consumption, from this*
 pitalone* of   thousand waggons per week
                 a                            quantity that (a
is capable of being far exceeded), will last for      great           a
number    of years almost incalculable
                      ;                     circumstance of
                                                    ;   a
the greatest consequence to the possessor and the puWie in
general.
   The diameter of the             pit
                              15 feet; hollow, and formed
                                         is
into three divisions  two for drawing coals at the same in
                           ;
stant of time, and one for pumping water.
   The regular sinking of this pit was only begun in May
fast; and, in 46 weeks,             has been sunk 92 fathomsy
                                         it
although eight     weeks   of that time  were occupied in walling
ihe pit sides with freestone and other casual things so that     ;
only 36 week? were employed regularly in sinking for the
above distance; besides passing through from 20 to 3»
fathoms of white post, and other metals almost equally hard.
   The same sinkers, 20 in numbei1 (except one or two)*
have begun and ended the undertaking.             The regularity,
sobriety, and good order, that have throughout prevailed
amongst them (so highly creditable to themselves) are un
precedented in this quarter; for every man has uniformly
been ready for his work, at the tim« appointed, viz. to be
6 hows oit, in 24 divided into sets*

their labour, as      further incitement to industry, four dif
                      a
ferent premiums, of 161. 20l. 24l. and 40l. were promised*
them, for sinking given distances in given time; the three
last of which they have fully acquired, and received; and*
as  a proof of their having used their best endeavours, Lord
Lowther ha3 generously promised to pay the fipst also,
when the pit     isdown      particularly as that fell short under
                               ;

very heavy water intervening.

  PRODUCTION OF MURIATE OF SODA BY THE GALVANIC
                 DECOMPOSITION OF WATER.
Our     philosophical readers will agree with us in opinion,
that the following interesting communication promises to
Jead to most important consequences :

                                       Cambriilge, April 13, 1805.
   u  I take this opportunity of laying before the public,
through the medium of your Magazine, if you think it
worthy a place in that work, the following experiment :
   "  I took about a pint of distilled water, and decomposed
one half of it by means of galvanism ; the other half           I
evaporated, and I found to remain at the bottom of the glass
a small quantity of salt, which upon examination proved
to be muriate of soda, or common salt. — What induced me
to try the experiment was this : I knew that when water
was decomposed by means of galvanism, the water near one
of the wires had alkaline, while that near the other had
acid properties. This being the case, I inferred, that if an
alkali and an acid were really produced, I should by decom
posing a large quantity of water obtain a small quantity of
                              S 4                           some

 fome kind of neutral salt — as was actually the case on trying
 the experiment. The salt could not have been contained
 jn the water before I made the experiment, because I used,
 every precaution to have it free from impurities.                   I even
 took the trouble \o repeat the experiment, though a tedious
 ppe, and I again obtained the same result.
     " Should you think the above worthy of being laid be
 fore the public, J shall send you some more' experiments
 which I am now tryjng on galvanism, together with some,
  remarks on this; apa which', I hope, will throw some
  light upon the subject. In the Piean time I remain

     Thomas Jeffersop,        Esq. President of the United State*

     "   A journey undertaken for the purpose of making dis
 coveries in this country, will probably procure us some new
 information ip regard to the piegalonix and other animals,
 either !o*t or now existing.            The pumediate object of it is
 to; explore the river Missouri as far as its' source; then to
visit the nearest ri\»er situated to the west, and to descend
 thence to ^he Pacific Ocean 5 to give at the same time ap
exact geography of that interesting channel of communica
tion across our continent.            The labours 'and dangers of this
            ; the strength of body and mind it requires ; the
   knowledge of the manners of the savages, and the address

                                       from Mr. Peel the communications
which he has cHcouTaj>e'd us to hope for.       His interesting experiments"
may, perhaps, lead to some knowledge of the 'composition of soda, and
the base of muiiatic acid, discoveries which could not fail to prove
JrgMv u>efol. We woujd, suggest to Mr. Pee], that lie may perhaps
add to the interest of his invpstigatio'n if he would, take the trouble, alsct
to compose from its elements, hydiogen arid oxygen, the wa:er to be'
made me of in one of his experiments.       In this case, from the difficulty
of hitting exderly'the due proportion of the two gases, it is probable the
water so obtained would prove acidulous (we have never jeen it other-
vise in this experiment):      if so, ic might he advisabje tp neutralise,
wjth, great care, thp free acid, employing for this purpose some other

         FORMATION OP WATER BY COMPRESSION.
  In  the late sitting of the National Institute, M. Biot
read  a paper on the formation of water by compression
alone. It is known that water is composed of two kinds
of gas, oxygen and hydrogen, which may be combined to
gether by means of the electric spark.   M. Biot has suc
ceeded in making this combination, independent of elec
tricity, and  irj
                 rapidly compressing      mixture of the two
                                                    a
kinds of gas, inclosed in an air-pump.       The compression,
by  bringing the  particle* of gas into intimate union, makes
them throw out quantity of heat sufficient to set them on
                    a
fire. Some precautions must be taken in repeating this
experiment, as   cannot be tried without danger. Out of
                    it
three experiments which M. Biot made, there were two in
which the tube of brass, which forms the pump, and the
pump itself, which was of iron, were burst    the force of      by
the explosion.

                                           by                                 if
it  be pretended that the fluia transmits hydrogen from the
pne tube to the other, why not admit also that            transmits  it
Oxygen?     And      this
                    in    case, the gases  come  from  the pile, and
are not formed at the extremity of the wire where they are
disengaged.      In this case, the decomposition of water                     is
effected in the pile,      means of the zinc
                                 by               and this circum
                                                        ;
stance may be classed among the chemical phenomena best
known. It can be easily ascertained that the gases may cir-
pulate along the wires of communication of the pile,                          by
 impregnating the interposed pieces with pure ammonia,
 ana immersing the wires, and particularly that of the nega
 tive pole, ina   solution of alum, which will be immediately
 precipitated     bythe ammonia, which will be conducted by
 the wire.    In some experiments,          caused even indigo to
                                                I

  lution of that substance       sulphuric acid.
                                      in
  I    found that the fluid of the pile burns atmospheric air,
 giving birth to the nitric acid.           burns also
                                                 It      mixture of  a

      Amoncj the many curious facts      which the celebrated
 Humboldt   collected in the course of his travels, one of tho
most surprising is that which he lately communicated to
the National Institute.     Several of the volcanoes in the
Andes throw up, from time to time, a muddy substance
mixed with large quantities of fresh water; and what de
serves to be particularly remarked                      is,
                                        an astonishing number
of fish. The volcano of Imbaburn, near the town of Ibarra,
threw up once such       quantity that the putrid effluvia pro
                                 a
ceeding from them produced diseases. This phenomenon,
however,        is   not singular.              The most remarkable circum
stance    is,
            that the fish are not injured. Their bodies appear
to be very soft, but do not seem to have been exposed to                             a
great heat.    The Indians assert that fish still alive are found
at the bottom of the mountain.        These animals are ejected
sometimes from the crater of the volcano and sometimes
from lateral apertures but they always pome from the height
                                  ;
of from twelve to thirteen hundred toises above the level of
the plains. Humboldt         of opinion {hat these fish are bred,
                                       is
jn lakes in the interior of the crater,    As fish of the same
kind are found in the rivers and streams which flow at the
bottom of the mountain, t)iis circumstance            strong con   is   a
firmation of this opinion.      They are the only animals in
the  kingdom of Ouito which live at the height of 140Q
toises. This species arc entirely new to naturalists. Hunr-
boldt has assigned to them       place in the system, and call*

water.     It  did not become hot, remained perfectly clear^
and   floated   on the water, without decreasing sensibly in
quantity.      It   was consequently ether.         As this liquid had
a very acid odour and taste, I added to it a diluted solution
of caustic soda, till the acid was saturated ; in consequence
of which, the ether, by the large quantity of silex which
was separated, formed itself into a consistent jellv.                 It is
singular,   that  the water  did  notdecompose       this, combination,
while it separated so easily the silex of the fluoric acid*.

The distilled fluid had a smell approaching near to that of
sulphuric ether, and weighed 0*720) but its taste was bit
ter, and very much analogous to that of bitter almonds,
though muen weaker. I shall repeat this experiment, with
the necessary precautions, to remove all suspicion that the
sulphuric acid may have had an influence on (he formation
of the ether ; and I confess that this suspicion, in my ex
periment, is not without foundation, considering the smalf
space, in regard to its great weight, occupied by the fluated
hme in the mixture of alcohol and sulphuric acid.

    There appeared, a few days ago, on tnc sun, a large spot
with two nuclei, which I observed nine degrees to the north
of the solar equator.        It differs little from the spots w hich
enabled me to determine the time of the sun's rotation, in
 the Memoirs of the Academy for 1 776 ; and it seems to me
to confirm the discovery I then made, by proving that there
 are in the sUn points where large spots arc formed, rather
 than in others. They are perhaps mountains, which attract
 and retain the scoriae of that immense furnace f.                     The
 parallel, which is at nine degrees south from the solar
 equator, is the most fertile in large spots.              These spots,
 with two nuclei, which have appeared at different periods,
 seem to me to destroy the system of volcanoes proposed by
 Dr. Herschel : there cannot be two volcanoes so near sub
 sisting without mixture, and always separated by a line of
 light.                                                    Delalande.

Word, when I said that the Academy del Cimento had
successfully repeated Baptista JPorta's experiment on the
reflection of cold. The fact       is,  that4 not having had the

of correcting the mistake, will be to subjoin their own
brief account of the experiment.

cold were more efficacious. Upon this account, we thought
of covering the glass, and (whatever be the cause) the
spirit of wine did indeed presently begin to rise. For all
this, we dare not be positive, but there might be some
other cause thereof, besides the want of reflection from the

   Lit I.   Essay on the Phaenomena          of the Electrophoriis     ; with
      an Attempt       to reconcile   them with      the Principles    of  the
      Ffanklinian Theory.         By Samuel Woods, Esq.                  Read
      before the Askesian Society        in the Session 1803-4.
   In    the paper which during the last sessions I submitted
   to the society *, I endeavoured to offer a general view of the
  phenomena occasioned by the passage or accumulation of
   the electric fluid, arranging and comparing them with cer
   tain propositions which appeared to me to combine and in
   clude the leading principles of what is usually termed the
   Franklinian theory of negative and positive electricity.                 In
   this essay an examinatioh into the appearances exhibited
'
   by the electrophorus was purposely omitted, both because
   the experiments recited by different observers were not
   perfectly consistent with each other, and involved the sub
  ject in considerable obscurity, and because the singularity
   of those appearances, in which all concurred, seemed to
   merit and demand a separate investigation : the present
   attempt, therefore, to collect, arrange, and explain them,
   may be deemed a supplement to the Former paper.
      The electrophorus is an instrument invented by an Italian
   philosopher, M. Volta, of Como, and consists of three
   parts j of two plates and an electric substance.
       1st, The inferior plate ; which at first was made of glass,
   but is now usually of metal or wood, covered with tinfoil,
   of a circular form, and carefully freed from points or edges.
      2d, The electric substance t; which may be constructed
   of glass, or varnish laid on the inferior plate, or sealing-
   wax, or sulphur, or mixed substances yielding the negative
   electricity. Resinous electrics are best adapted for this pur
   pose, because they are less rapidly affected by the humidity
   of the air, and retain their electricity much longer than glass.
  This substance most commonly is made to adhere to the
   surface of the plate ; but it is much more convenient to
   have an independent cake, capable of entire separation.

        See Philosophical  Magazine,   vol. xvii. p 57.
     +  The composition is usually   equal parts of resin, shtli-lac, and «ul-
  phur. M. Cavallo recommends        the second son of sealinn-uax : others
  prefer a coating of sealing-wax dissolved in spirits of wific, nr resin dis
  solved in oil of turpentine.   The one I use is a cake s:>r.ut lidlf an inch
  in thickness and twelve in diameter, made principally of sheli-lxr, with
  a small portion of Venire turpentine to assist its fusion, which is effected
  in an earthen vessel over, a slow fire or sand heat, aid then poured into
  an iron hoop resting upon a perfectly flat surface.    This has the advan
  tage of lieing reiy tough, anil not casi'y broken.

C£}d         On tfie Vhevnomcna   of the Mlectrophortif,
   3d, Another plate of a circular form ; made either ftf
brass  or of wood, or even pasteboard covered with tinfoil :
this should be nearly of the same size, but rather smaller
than the inferior plate, and must be furnished with a glass
insulating handle, which by means of a brass or wooden
socket is screwed into its centre.
   For the sake of perspicuity it will be desirable to adopt
some short and appropriate appellation to distinguish each
of these parts from the others without circumlocution, as
they must frequently recur in the course of our inquiry ;
and it will not perhaps be easy to improve the nomencla
ture of professor Robison in the Supplement to the Ency-
clopcpdiaBritannica :
   1.The inferior plate, which constitutes the bottom or
support of the rest, and which in my apparatus is a flat
brass plate, 12 inches in diameter, made to screw upon a
glass insulating stand, we shall denominate — the sole.
   2. The electric substance to be excited,- — the cake.
    3. The superior plate, 10 inches in diameter, with a glass
handle attached, for the purpose of imposing it upon and
removing it from the cake,- — the cover.
    To each of these plates a small wire is made to screw in>
adapted to suspend a pair of pith balls, by which means
the state of both sole and cover may be ascertained at the
same time, and in favourable circumstances very minute
changes may be detected.
    The most obvious phaenomena exhibited by this instru
ment are the following :
    The cake in contact with the sole must be excited by
friction, either with new flannel or dry warm silk, pre
viously taking care to make the surface of the cake as dry
as possible : then, by means of its insulating handle, impose
the cover; then offer a conductor to the cover, and a spark
will pass between them ; after which if {he cover be elevated
or removed, by the extremity of its glass handle, from the
electric cake, it will yield a strong spark to any conducting
body.    If the cover be replaced, a communication afforded
with the ground, by touching it with the finger or other
wise, and again separating        it, second spark may be ob
                                        a
 tained. And this process, with fresh excitation, maybe re
 peated for hours,    ifthe apparatus be kept perfectly free
 from dust and moisture    : and .if these sparks be given to
 the knob of jar,
                a      will become charged with positive elec
                      it
tricity.
   It   isevident, however, that these indications are not suf
 ficiently decisive to -furnish an accurate knowledge of the
                                                       different

undergo, or to afford data upon which to Duild an account
of the rationale of its mode of operation : recourse must he
had to more delicate tests, and the most convenient method
is, to attach a pair of pith halls upon a projecting wire to
each plate, hy which means the state ef both may be ob
served and ascertained at the same time.                  I shall now en
deavour to exhibit a general view of all these changes, ar

             On the Phcenomena    of the Electrophoms.       293
     These experiments are the    result of my own observation,
and, I flatter myself, may be depended upon : they have all
been repeated more than once ; and indeed a considerable
degree of care is requisite in ascertaining the kind of elec
tricity indicated by the divergency of pitnballs, as a stronger
electricity in glass or wax will frequently attract a weaker
of the same sort in these light bodies. I have found it most
convenient to apply an excited stick of wax and glass alter
nately to the plate at some distance from the electrometer,
and never to rest satisfied till both of these tests concurred
in their results.     By the use of two similar electrometers I
have had great advantage in perceiving the changes produced
in each of- the metallic parts : and perhaps it may be in
some measure owing to the employment of only one elec
trometer in experiments upon this instrument that so much
uncertainty has prevailed, as I do not recollect to have met
with any account where the state of sole and cover were
ascertained by the same means and at the same time.
     I now proceed to offer a general view of the observations
I have met with on this subject.
     The general result given by Adams (Essay on Electricity,
p. 358,) is the following :
     '•'
         By examining with pith balls it appears,
     "   1. That the cover acquires a weak positive electricity
when imposed on excited cake. (See preceding experiment,
No. 7.)
     " 2, That when the cover is touched by the finger it
 loses all its electricity, (See No. 17.)
     " 3. When the cover is touched by the finger, and re
moved from the cake, it becomes strongly positive.          (See
 No. 8.)
     In order to account for these appearances he offers the
  following considerations :
     " The cake may be conceived to consist of several hori
 zontal strata, so that the upper stratum, when excited, is
insulated by the inferior strata.        Now, insulated electrics
 produce the opposite electricity on bodies brought within
 the sphere of their action ; t. e. insulated and excited glass
 produces negative, and wax positive, electricity on other
 insulated bodies : therefore the surface of the electrophorus
 cake should produce positive electricity in the cover, con
 formably to experience." But as it is not very obvious how
  the electricity should become stronger by removal out of the
 sphere of action of the excited electric, he adds :
                                                       " electric
 bodies do not put the fluid in that degree of motion which
  is necessary to produce the spark, or exhibit the phenomena,
                                T  3                            of

294            On the Phenomena     of the    Electroph6ru>.
of attraction      and repulsion, while they are in contact with
 conducting substances ; which is the reason why the upper
 plate, i. e. the cover, exhibits no signs of electricity while
 it remains in contact with the under one, though they he-
 come sensible the instant it is removed from it."
      If any one can understand or apply this confusion of
 ideas to elucidate the point in question, he must possess a
 larger portion of skill than I can pretend to claim.                 M.
 Cavallo observes, (Complete Treatise, vol. ii. p. 55.) that
if the cake be accurately insulated, the cover acquires so
 little electricity that it can only be deteoted by the electro
 meter. This, however, as the editor of the Encyclopcedia
 Britanniea observes, is manifestly untrue; and' it is diffi
 cult to imagine how so great a mistake should have oc
 curred.
     Other experiments mentioned by M. Cavallo accord
with No. 1, 4f and 5, in imposing the cover, the sole
 electrometer before diverging with negative electricity closes,
but again becomes negative.            Comparing this with No. 9,
it will appear to be correct, but not to represent the whole
truth.       In the results of No. 12 and 13, I am also con
 firmed by Cavallo.        The theory of this author is comprised
in a short compass, and, I believe, is not far wide from the
truth : it does not, however, include the whole of the phae-
nomena, and requires a more detailed application. He says,
*.*  the action of these places depends upon          a principle long
ago discovered, viz. the power of an excited electric to
induce    a    contrary electricity in"   a  body brought within its
sphere     of  action.  The   metal   plate therefore,  when set upon
the excited electric, acquires      a  contrary electricity        by
                                                                  giving
its electric fluid to the hand or other conductor, which
touches       itwhen set upon   a   plate electrified positive, or ac
quiring     an  additional  quantity   from the hand when upon
                                                                        a a
plate electrified negative."        It   isnot, however, true, that
conductor in contact with an excited electric exhibits, while
in contact, signs of the opposite electricity. The fftneral
appearances are thus recited and arranged in the Supplement
to the Encyclopcedia Britanniea, article Electricity.
      " I.If    the sole has been insulated during the congela
tion of the electric      (i.e. where the cake      is melted into the

to remain in this situation its electricity s;row9 gradually

   Observation. —This last remark is not true, as will be
seen by reference to experiments No. 9 and 10: it is true,
indeed, that the electricity is seldom strong enough to yield
a spark.
   "  2. But      if the cover be touched while on the cake, a
sharp pungent spark is obtained from it ; and if at the same
time the sole be touched with the thumb, a very sensible
shock is felt in the finger and thumb. (See No. 12 and 13.)
   "  3. After this the electrophqrus appears quite inactive,
and is said to be dead, neither sole nor cover giving any
sign of electricity.'""     (See No. 15.)
   This     state   of death or neutrality lasts, however, but a
short time, especially in the cover, which soon occasions
the pith balls to diverge negatively.
   t( 4. When the cover is raised to some distance from the
cake (keeping it parallel therewith),        if it be touched while
in this situation a smart spark flics to some distance be
tween it and the finger ; more remarkably from the upper
side, and still more from its edge ; which will even throw
off sparks into the air if it be not rounded off. As this di

rounded. This spark is not so sharp as the former, and
resembles       that from any electrified conductor."          (See
No.   13.)
   Some importance seems attached to the preservation of
a parallel direction in elevating the cover ; but I have never
found any diminution of effect by removing the cover late
rally, or in any other direction : I may remark, that the
sensation occasioned by the passage of the spark is too in
distinct to enable the operator to judge satisfactorily of the
quality or kind of electricity.

 charging      like the prime conductor of an ordinary electrical
machine,        and when set on the cake charging it like the

 the name      of  electropkorus.

 the spark obtained from the cover is not of that cutting kind
 that it was before ; but the same shock will be felt if both
 cake and cover be touched together."
     I understand this to imply, that when insulated the elec
tricity of the cover becomes positive, or, instead of receiv
 ing a spark from the finger, yields one to it : if this be
 meant, it is contrary to fact. (See No. 9, in table of expe
 riments.)        If the sole be not insulated, the cover after im-
           becomes weakly positive, (see No. 7,) and the spark
 Eosiiig
   etwetn the cover and finger is scarcely perceptible.
    "   9.  If   the cover be raised to a considerable height, the
 sole will be found electrical, and its electricity is that of
 the. cake, and not the same as the cover. (See No. 10.)
    "   10. After touching both sole and cover, if the cover
 be raised and again set down without touching it while aloft,
 the whole is again inactive.
    "11.      If  both sole and cover be made inactive when in
 contact    with    the cake, they show opposite electricities when
 separated,      the  sole having the electricity of the cake.
     "  12.   If  both sole and cover be made inactive when se
 parate, they both show the opposite to the electricity of the
 cake when joined."
     I have sometimes observed each plate when thus situated
 assume the same electricity as the cake, but never both of
 them the opposite state.
    These are the material facts upon this subject slated in
 the Supplement to the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is
 followed by an ingenious attempt to account for them in
 conformity to the principles of the ^Epinian theory. Some
 of the data appear to me to be assumed without sufficient
 proof: but as in my former paper, to which this is a sup
 plement, I declined the consideration of that theory, and
 confined myself to what is called the Franklinian hypothesis,
 I  shall pursue the same course on the present occasion,
 especially as the theory above alluded to is involved in a
 great deal of mathematical and algebraical formula? ; and           I
 cannot pretend to have studied it with sufficient attention
 to do justice to the reasoning brought forward in its sup
 port, or represent with perspicuity the explanations which
 it offers.

and cover with an insulated discharging-rod.

nication between itself and the sole is continued to the
ground : the sole electrometer does not separate till the
cover is raised : remove the cover and the pith balls di
verge ; replace the cover undischarged, they instantly close,
but when the cover is discharged and then replaced, the di
vergence is continued."
  This   is not consistent with experiments No. o, in,      II.
   In attempting   the explanation of these phenomena it is
necessary to keep in mind that the effects are of a compound
nature, combining the double operation of an electric, both
excited and charged : it will therefore be desirable to con
sider the appearances separately of charged and excited elec
trics ; and in the investigation of the first of these I avail
myself of the observations of Mr. Milner, — in the second
of Mr. Morgan.

     "  2. The glass being thus furnished with a metallic coat
 ing on each side, and having a proper communication with
 the ground, will admit of being charged ; and both coatings
 may be separated and examined apart without destroying
 the insulation of either.
     "  3. The apparatus being thus disposed, communicate a
 strong charge to the glass by means of the bent wire ; then
 remove the charging wire and the chain connected with the
 lower plate. On the approach of a finger to the upper coat
 ing a small spark will pass, and the same will happen to
 the under coating.         This effect cannot be produced twice
 by two succeeding applications to the same coating ; but
 in a favourable state of the atmosphere may be repeated
 some hundred times, by alternate applications to the two
 coalings, till the charge of the glass is gradually exhausted.
     "  4. Let the glass be again fully charged; touch the
 upper coating with the finger, and then, by its insulating
 stem, separate it from the upper and positive surface of the
 glass : this coating will then be found negative; t. e. oppo
site to the side of the glass with which it was in contact.
 This effect, on repetition, gradually diminishes; but on
touching the coatings alternately two or three times, the
negative power of the coating when separated is greatly in^
creased, so as to yield strong negative sparks.               The same
circumstances will happen to the under coating; substituting,
however, the positive for the negative effects.
     " 5. Each surface of the charged glass therefore, in con
sequence of a momentary interruption of the insulation, has
the power of producing a contrary electricity in the coating
in contact with it : more electrical matter must have passed
away from the upper coating at the time of touching it than
the same coating could receive from the upper surface of
the glass, and therefore the upper coating, by losing some
of its natural quantity, becomes negative : more electric
matter must in the same manner have been added to the
under coating, which becomes positive.                The greatest de
gree of this    influential  power  will be  produced in either coat
ing by taking       care  at  the  same   time   to bring the opposite
coating     into  a like state  of influential  electricity.
     " 6. The glass being well charged, let a bent wire in the
form of a staple be brought into contact with the upper
and lower coating at the same time : by this a discharge
will be effected, but the equilibrium will be only in part
                                                              restored ;

               On the Phanomena          of the Elect rophotus.        sgg
restored   ;  for a considerable degree of attraction may be
observed       between    the upper coating and the glass, which
is frequently strong enough to lift a piece of plate glass
weighing ten ounces. Neither coating will now show the
least external sign of electricity when in contact with the
glass ; but on separation, carefully preserving the insula
tion, the upper coating is strongly negative, the under po
sitive.     Let both coatings be restored to their natural state
by    contact   with a conductor, and then replace the glass
between them : if the upper coating be touched and sepa
rated it will give no spark, but on touching the coatings
alternately several times it will give a weak spark; and this
may be repeated several times by only touching the upper
coating.       On a second application of the bent wire to
both eoatings, a second though much slighter discharge
is perceptible, and the coatings are brought into the same
electrical state as immediately after the first discharge.
This may frequently be repeated, and a considerable
number of strong negative sparks taken from the coating
when separated from the positive surface of the glass. If
 the glass in replacing it between the coatings be reversed,
 the electrical powers of both coatings will be changed by
 the next application of the discharging-wire,         and a succes
 sion of strong positive sparks obtained from the negative
 surface of the glass.
     *' 7. Hence it may be inferred that the charged glass was
 not restored to its natural state by the completion of the
 circuit, but that it had acquired a degree of permanent elec
 tricity.
     " 8. The whole quantity of electric matter added to the
 glass in charging         it,   evidently distinguishable into two
           the  first  part,     by is

 other; the second part appears more permanent, and re
 mains still united with the glass.               It
                                                  appears, therefore,

                          by
  I     should observe, that the above account of Mr. Milner's
  investigation       extracted from the Encyclopedia Britannica}

  ing to  a  verv considerable length, has been condensed and
  abridged, but,      I  trust, without any misrepresentation of
  roeanmg.       Let us now proceed to Mr. Morgan's examina
  tion of an excited substance.
                                                                       " Let

300        On the Pkcenomena   of the   Electrophorus^
     "Let a cushion be prepared with a metallic covering
at the back, and insulated by a glass stem ; then excite the
cylinder by means of this cushion, pursuant to the common
method : no electrical signs will be discovered while the
insulation is complete. Stop the motion of the cylinder,
placing the finger in contact with the cushion ; then remove
the cushion from the excited cylinder, and it will give a
spark : return it to the cylinder, and on removal it will re
peatedly give a spark without any additional friction, at
tended by the same circumstances as have been described
to take place in the electrophorus : now, by substituting a
glass plate for the cylinder, and supposing the cushion to
cover that plate, you form an electrophorus, without one
circumstance of diversity from the common cylinder.
Again, if after exciting the electrophorus you remove the
cover and apply a number of metallic points connected with
the ground to the excited surface, and afterwards replace
the cover, no more sparks can be obtained without a fresh
excitation. This is precisely similar to what is observed in
working the cylinder j for as soon as the excited part passes
the cushion, and is exposed to the action of a multitude of
points, it is rendered incapable of producing electrical signs
till it again comes into contact with the cushion."
    It is obvious that the phaenomena described, both with
respect to charges and excited electrics, bear a striking si
milarity (as indeed might be expected) to those of the elec
trophorus.     We will now endeavour to explain the process
detailed in the table of phaenomena.
     I
     agree with Mr. Morgan that the general principle to
which these phaenomena ought to be referred is an increase
or diminution of attractive force hetween the particles of
bodies and particles of the electric fluid; or, in other words,
an alteration of the capacity of bodies for the electric fluid,
in consequence either of excitation or contact with an ex
cited substance.    If I were asked for the cause of this'
change   of capacity, I should freely confess my ignorance ;
for I cannot easily suppose a chemical change to be pro
duced, or any new arrangement of the parts created, by the
mere contaot of bodies.     It will be necessary to recollect,
what I believe was satisfactorily shown in my former paper,
that the divergence of pith balls can only be depended upon
as indicating a disposition to receive or to part with a por

he considered   as any criterion of the absolute capacity of
bodies,,

             Oft the PhcenoMena      of the Eleclrophorlis .     30
    When      the cake is excited by friction, a change in its
 capacity may be conceived to take place, and it acquires
 through its whole substance a stronger attraction for the
 electric fluid than it had before, and of course will become
 disposed to receive an additional quantity.             The sole is
 placed on an insulated stand, which, when the cake is im
 posed, participates in the disposition to receive; and the
 pith ball electrometer attached to it diverges with negative
 electricity. But it not only partakes of the character of the
 cake ; the capacity of the sole thus in contact with the ex
 cited substance is augmented; and it docs not merely operate
 as a conductor to convey the fluid to the cake, but obtains
 for itself, from contiguous bodies Moating in the atmosphere,
 more than in its separate state it is capable of holding. On
 the removal of the cake, therefore, carefully avoiding to de
 stroy the insulation of the sole, the attractive force of the
 sole is diminished.       It is left in a plus or positive state, is
 disposed    to  part with  its superfluous quantity, and the balls
'diverge   with   positive electricity.
    While the excited cake remains imposed, and the sole
 electrometer indicates the negative electricity, a conductor
 is offered to the excited surface. The attraction of the cake
 becomes strongest on the upper side, because any supply is
 obtained with more facility by the opening of a communi
 cation with the universal store diffused in the ground. The
 sole electrometer closes, therefore, on account of the dimi
 nished activity of force on the under surface ; and when the
 communication is complete, by the contact of the conduct
 ing substance, the sole acquires the same state, i. e. posi
 tive, and for the same reasons as when the cake is removed.
 On withdrawing the hand, or other conductor, the former
 state is restored.
    When the sole is not insulated it is difficult, and fre
 quently impracticable, to ascertain its state of electricity.
 The cover imposed by its insulating handle appears by its
 electrometer to be slightly positive ; and the sole, by its at
 traction for the pith balls attached to the cover, indicates a
 negative state.      I am at a loss to explain this circumstance,
 unless it be supposed that the force of attraction is princi
 pally exertedjownwards in consequence of its uninterrupted
  communication with the ground j that the activity of the
 upper surface is soon neutralized by the imposition of the
 cover ; and that the cover is brought into the state of the
 sole when insuhtcd and the cover imposed, i. e. diverges
 with positive electricity ; but in consequence of its increased
  capacity, arising from its contact with the excited electric,
                                                                    it

    SOt        On the Phcenomena   of the Electiophorus.
   it  does not show the whole amount of its superfluous acqui
   sition till removed, when the positive divergence greatly
    increases.
       When the sole is insulated with the excited cake imposed,
   the electrometer diverges as in the former instance, with
    negative electricity.  Now impose the cover, and the elec
   trometer connected with it indicates the negative electricity
   strongly, because the attraction is most eager and powerful
   at the upper or excited surface : the sole electrometer gra
   dually closes; sometimes, however, continuing negative for
   some time, and then opens with positive electricity.        This
   is precisely the state described by Mr. Brook in the act
   of charging ajar, both side* indicating a similar electricity:
   the negative of the cover appears anich stronger than the
   positive of the sole, and, by making a cotemporaueous com
   munication between the cover ana 6ole, a sensation is felt
   in the thumb and finger resembling a shock.           I am not,
   however, satisfied that any actual charge takes place in these
   circumstances : a charged insulated jar cannot be deprived
   of its charge without offering a conductor to each side ; but
  in this case the shock is prevented by touching either the
   sole or the cover separately when a spark passes ; and, on
   completing the circuit, another spark, but no shock-like
  sensation : the force of attraction being directed to the upper
   surface, of course produces a disposition to receive the fluid,
  or the negative state : the attractive force being diminished
  at the sole releases a portion of the fluid which is disposed
  to escape, and produces the positive slate. The sole and
  cover being thus differently disposed, one to receive and
  the other to part with, if at the same moment the thumb
  be presented to one side and the finger to the other, a double
  spark will pass, and must occasion the sensation of a shock.
 The cover remains imposed, and in a negative state : on its
 removal it changes and becomes positive ; for, having hail
•its capacity enlarged by contact with the excited         electric,
  it holds, when that contact is removed, a superabundant
 quantity : the attraction of the cake is redirected down
 wards, and the sole electrometer again becomes negative.
 Replace the cover, preserving its insulation, and the states
 are again reversed upon the same principles.           Let a con
 ductor be now brought in contact with the cover; the sole
 electrometer continues positive, and a spark passes between
 the cover and the conducting substance ; and so greedy is
 the cover of the electric fluid, that the positive state is some
 times super-induced slightly ; the cover, by its communi
 cation with the ground, has rapidly obtained all the fluid
             S                                                   its

          On the Phenomena          vf the        Eledrophorus.         303
Its increased capacity will enable it to hold : on its removal
it yields to the hand the superfluous quantity it had pre
viously obtained ; and thus the process may be repeated till
the surface of the electric becomes so much neutralized that
its capacity is not increased by the contact. On the removal
of the cover the sole electrometer becomes negative, and
will receive a spark : and         if,
                                     after the process above de
scribed be so often repeated that the cover will not any
longer give     a  spark on removal        the sole and cover be
                                            ;    if
touched together, the attraction to the upper surface             re   is
 stored in nearly its former vigour, and the cover oft removal
 again yields positive sparks to       conductor.
                                         a
     Whenever the sole or cover          touched, the electrometer
                                            is
 in either will of course become neutral, because the fluid                 is
 abstracted or supplied with the utmost facility, and its di
 stinctive characters are lost in the general mass of circula,-
 tion.
     There are two objections to. the foregoing theory which
 .seem to require some solutioa.
    1   . When the cake, in consequence of excitation, acquires
  an increased attraction for the electric fluid, why          it not
                                                                  is
  sooner rendered inert       by the supply       may obtain
                                                          it      the  by
  contact of its surface with the particles floating in the at
  mosphere ?.
      2. The transitions from the negative to the positive states,
  and vice versa, are so rapid, that they can hardly be recon
  ciled to the opportunities of supply or abstraction offered               by
a    dry atmosphere.
      In the first case, moist state of the weather, or Toom
                         a                                        a
  abounding with dust, will, in fact, rapidly destroy the effect
   of excitation in dry armosphere            may be supposed' that
                                                  is it
                :    a
   the uniform diffusion of the fluid         so much disturbed             by
   friction that the interior particles are     long time before thte
                                                      a
   equilibrium  is  restored, in consequence of the very slow and
   difficult transmission of the fluid through the pores of elec
   tric substances.
       In the second case, these transitions may be effected with

  LIV. A brief Account of the Mineral
                                   Productions of Shrop
    shire. By Joseph Plymley, A.M. Archdeacon of Salop,

 1 Jr. Townson, in his Tracts, p. 1 68, has given the strata-
 of two other pits in this district, and has added to the col1-
 liers' names for the different measures his own definition of
 each. He observes, that "annually about 260,000 tons of
 coal are raised in this district ;" a very large proportion of
 which are consumed in the adjacent iron-works, I presume;
 for I have understood, that in the Ketley iron-works they use
 at least six ton of coal out of every seven they raise. What I
 have called the collieries of the eastern district, comprehend
 pits on both sides the river Severn. The veins of coal in
this district are equal in thickness, I believe, to most in
this county, but very inferior to those of the Staffordshire
tvorks, from 15 to 20 miles east of these, where, I have
been told, there is a bed of coal measuring 13 yards, or
more.     The. next coal-works to be mentioned are those of
the Clee Hill^ from 20 to 30 miles south of those we have
been describing*.       Collieries, indeed, are now working at
Billingsley, connecting them, in some measure, by their
situation : and again, west of the eastern coal district, pits
have been lately sunk with success.        I am indebted to Dr.
Townson's Tracts, before quoted, for the following lists of
the strata in two of the Clee Hill collieries.

    In the first of these Clee Hill pits, then,           we find the first
 strata of coal 98 yards below the surface ;             that the thickest
vein is 6 feet; and that the aggregate of coal in 107 yards
 1 foot, is 12 feet 6 inches.        In the second pit they must
sink 116 yards before coal .is found, the vein of which is
also 6 feet thick; and the other veins, which are not pure
coal, measure in the aggregate 10 feet ; so that in 137 yards
there are only 16 feet of coals, and of these only six that are
unmixed.       Of the collieries in the west and north-west ex
tremity    of the   county, the most considerable were those of

306                  A brief Account   of the
Llwyn   y Main and Trevor Claudd, which appear to be nearly
exhausted ; but other collieries have been lately opened be
tween Oswestry and Chirk Bridge. The colliers describe these
veins as diverging rays from an ideal centre, marked here by
the part of the horizon where the sun appears from eight to
ten o'clock in the morning.     To this ideal centre the Rua-
bon collieries dip from north-west to cast on the north side
the Dee.   The Chirk collieries, from west to east on the
south side the Dee, and between that river and the Ceiriog;
and again, the Pen y bryn collieries, lately begun to be
worked, and the only work of the three in Shropshire, dips
from west to east on the south side the Ceiriog.         These
veins range up against a ridge of lime rocks that run from
north to south-west.    Those near Kuabon, as well as those
on the south side the Ceiriog, are a strong bituminous coal,
with the baking quality of the Newcastle coal, yielding a
strong heat, but no bad smell, except the top coal. The
veinsl>etween the Dee and Ceiriog are a lighter coal, burn
ing more quickly, and the ashes are white.     This difference
is supposed, by the colliers, to arise from the less weight of
water that is over these veins. Mr. Arthur Davies, of Os
westry, has favoured nie with the following list of the strata
in the engine-pit at Chirk Bank coal-work, and which is
the deepest pit he has sunk.                        Yds. Ft. In.

    We see, then, that in near 33 yards there is only 1 yard
9  inches of coal, and no vein thicker than 2 feet ; but pro
bably there are veins of more substance, whenever it shall
be thought expedient to sink these pits deeper.
    This county is also well supplied with lime, and in ge
neral the limestone is at no great distance from coal.            It
differs in colour, and in the quantity of flour or powder that
it yields when slacked. The liine-works at Lilleshal are
Tery considerable.       There is plenty of limestone near the
Wrekin and Coalbrook Dale ; and it extends from Bcnthall
Edge, (on the opposite side the Severn to Coalbrook Dale,)
near   to Wenlock,        called   there  Wenlock Edge;    and   so,
south-west, pointing towards Ludlow, it forms a ridge of

ble.     Lime is round also in the Clec hills ; in a small de
gree in the south -west_ district ; in many places south of
Shrewsbury, but of a brown colour, and less pulverizing
quality.      West of Shrewsbury, it is gotten in considerable
quantities in the parishes of Cardiston and Alberbury ; and
at Forth y wain and Llanymvnach, on the west confines, is
a   hill of limestone of an excellent quality. At the east end
of   the Wrekin,and at some other lime-works, is a red lime
that will set very hard in water.       Mr. Smeaton discovered
that lime, with a certain proportion of clay and iron, did
best under water.       And the colour of the lime here spoken
of indicates its having these component parts. Much of
the limestone of this county is near the surface ; but near
J^ebdtwood, about nine miles south of Shrewsbury, it "is
covered by 20 yards of argillaceous strata *."      " Limestone
is also found near Caughley, under 20 yards of argillaceous
and sandstone strata.     It is a yard thick, but not worked   f."
Ironstone is found in the neighbourhood of Wellington,
Coalbrook Dale, ard Broseley.          In and near the Clee hills
it is also met with ; and Dr. Townson has taken notice of
a species of ironstone in the Llwyn y main collierv, near
Oswestry, which be ascertained to be a mixture of spatous
iron ore and the common argillaceous ironstone.           He ob
serves, that the best iron and steel, viz. those of Styria, are
made of spatous iron ore; and therefore he judges that this
may be found very valuable. Mr. William Reynolds in
forms me there is a very good stratum of spatous iron ore
found atBillingsley, but that it is not worked.
     This county is also well supplied with building stone ;
and its north district, which could be but little noticed for
the subterraneous treasures we have been speaking of, stands
 pre-eminent for its quarry at Grinsell, seven miles north of
Shrewsbury, where is a white sandstone, superior, perhaps,
to anv in the kingdom : the top rock lies in thin strata ;
 the bed is 20 yards thick.        There is plenty, also, of good
 rid sandstone in the neighbourhood.            The same may be
 said of the east side of the county ; and near Bridgnorth
 ljeds of red sandstone are found under while sandstone;
 and again, beds of white sandstone under the red.            This
 appears a singular division and alteration of the cements.
 Iron particles give their colour to the red stone; and it is
 on this account, probably," that the weather has more in -

 much air as to lose its tenacious quality.
    Further south, sandstone prevails ; and Dr. Townson
 found at Orton Bank a stratum of the Bath and Portland
 stone between strata of common limestone.
    In the west district is a siliceous grit, hard to work, but
 very good to build with ; but the general stone is argilla
ceous. That nearest the surface is but in part indurated,
 and becomes friable, under a slight pressure, when exposed
to the vicissitudes of .weather.      Very good stone slates, for
covering    roofs, are met with   in the  parish of Bettus, on the
 south-west confines of the county.        And there is very good
flag-stone in Corndon Hill, west of Bishop's Castle.            In
Swinny Mountain, near Oswestry, is a superior white sand
stone, which works very well.            Bowden quarry, in the
hundred of Munslow, contains also very good white sand
stone ; and at Soudley, in the parish of Eaton, and fran
chises of Wenlock, is a very good stone-flag for floors.
This brings us near some hills which have not hitherto been
much mentioned, viz. the Lawley, and Caerdoc, or Caer
Caradoc.                .
                                           "
    South of the Lawley is a ridge of useful coarse grit, or
sandstone, of a yellowish white.        But the Lawley is in part
formed of a kind of granite, probably what mineralogists
call secondary granite ; but a greater part of the hill is com
posed of what Forms the basis of what has been lately called
toadstone,    which, though wanting no explanation to a
mineralogist, it may be well to give some popular idea to,
by saying, it is entirely distinct from sandstone, limestone,"
or slate, and approaches the nearest, in outward appearance,
to a basaltic rock, though probably verv different in reality.
The stone of the Caerdoc is chert and granulated quartz ;
and in some places the toadstone appears, which having, in
part, lost its glands, becomes cellular, and which may have
   ven rise to the opinion of its being lava.        The Ponsert
   ill partakes of the nature of the Caerdoc and Lawley.
I am indebted to a conversation with Dr. Townson for
whatever is scientific in the account of these two hills ; and
a more minute account of them, and of other hills in this
countv, will be found in his volume of Tracts, before quoted.
Mr. William Reynolds informs' me, that a part of the
Caerdoc, towards the north-west end, contains the pista

he calls a gray whack, and which actiuolitc, on examina

mentions the Longmount to be composed, so far as his
observations extended, of a very shivery kind of schislus.
Il  certainly presents that appearance on its east side, near
the Strettons.       But Dr. Townson says, the nature of the
rock, in general, is " compound sandstone, i. e. a stone
which, instead of being formed of grains of quartz, is
 formed of grains, or very minute fragments, of other kinds
 of stone. These, here, seem to be of an argillaceous and
jaspideous nature, mixed with a few grains of feldspar*."
    The Wrekin is chiefly composed, I believe, of a reddish
 chert. Mr. William Reynolds informs me, that prodigious
 masses of granulated quartz are imbedded in                       it,
                                                                and much

 the south-west end of the hill. The Stiper stones are                        a

 secret  : a, patent was   obtained for the discovery by the late
 Mr. Betton     ; but his right to a patent was disallowed, by
 the decision of a court of law, some time after.        The oil
 was used only medicinally, and has probably many of the
 properties of what is called Friar's balsam, and in quality and
 appearance has a near resemblance to oil of amber, and is
often sold as such. When the manufacture was carried on
 in its greatest extent, 1 have understood that a considerable
 quantity of the oil was exported, and principally to Ger
 many.      It is still to be bought in Shrewsbury, from the
 preparer.     It is also from a rock of red sandstone that the
 fossil tar spring, near Coalbrook Dale, issues.      Mr. Aikin
relates in his book, before quoted, p. 194, that this " spring
was cut into by driving a level in search of coal ; that the
quantity that issued at first was to the amount of three or
 four barrels per day ; but that, at present (1797), there sel
dom flowed more than half a barrel in the same period."
 And in 1799 Dr. Townson states the produce at only 30
 gallons per week (now, lttO'2, it is about half that quantity),
though, he imagines, other fissures, filled with the same
substance, may be found, if there were a greater demand for
 it. The oil distilled from this tar exactly resembles Betton's
British oil, and is used as a solvent for caoutchouc, (com
monly known by the name of elastic gum, or Indian rubber,)
 which is now used as a varnish for cloth, and is particu
larly applicable to balloons.      Near Jackfield, on the south
 side the river Severn, is carried on the manufacture of coal
tar, for which lord Dundonald formerly obtained a patent.
In coaking the coal, which is here done in close vessels*
they obtain the volatile products which are raised in vapour
by the heat of the operation of coaking, and condensed in
a chamber covered with lead plates, over which water is
constantly running.         These products arc a water and an
oil ; the former of which contains a portion of volatile al
kali, and the latter is boiled down to the consistence of tar
or pitch. The oil which is caught during the boiling down
is used as a solvent for resin, and forms an excellent varnish
for ships, or any wood-work exposed to weather.             The
.MS. account of Bradford North mentions a salt spring at
Smeithmore, in the lordship of Longford ; and Dr. Town-
son states several springs of salt water to have been found
in the neighbourhood of the tar spring j and that in the
parish of Broscley, on the opposite side of the Severn, salt
is said to have been made formerly from water taken out
of pits still called the Salt-house Pits. At the Lyth, in the
parish of Cundover, is a field the soil of which is impreg-

nated with salt     ; and there is no doubt but this commodity
 could be goiten in this county, though its proximity to the
extensive and established salt-works of Cheshire may pre
vent any profit from an adventure of this kind. At Kingley
 Wick, about two miles west of Lilleshall Hill, is a " spring
 of salt water that yields 4 or 5000 gallons in the 24 hours.
 It is an impure brine, but was formerly used : the salt pans
 and buildings are still remaining.            It flows out of a reddish
 sandstone rock, which rests upon a reddish chert, like that of
 the Wrekin*. And at Admaston, near Wellington, only two
miles from Kingley Wick, there is a salt medical spring, cha
lybeate and hepatic. There are two springs : the one contain
 ing carbonated iron and lime, selenite and sea salt ; the
other, hepatic air, aerated lime, selenite, and sea salt f. The
 MS. history of Bradford hundred, before quoted, says,                  "  at
Woreton Say is a mineral water that purges those who drink
it." There is also a well, not far from the parsonage-house,
that I am pleased to record, as it was fenced in under the
directions of the late archdeacon Clive, and which conti
nued to partake of the care and consideration he had for the
things, as well as the persons around him.                   Dr. Darwin
informs me that this spring is valuable as a strong chaly
beate, but that it has no other peculiar qualities.               There is
 a spring near Ludlow that contains a very little fixed air,
 some magnesia,        a little lime, and a good deal of sea salt.
Its strength is irregular as a medicine ; it is sometimes about
 as active as sea water, I am told, but frequently weaker.
    • This brine is now used for the making of soda at a work established
It  Wormbrid^e, on the banks of the canal there, as will be seen by the
following n6te, whi. h is one of many favours I have received from Mr.
Dugard, of the Salop Infirmary.
    " At Wormbpdge, mar Wellington,         as well as at several other col
lieries in the neighbuurhixid,   martial pyrites arc found in considerable
quantities.   After being cleared from the cru\ (sulphuicouscoal) in which
they are found, the lun:ps, which are perhaps from twelve to fourteen
pounds weight each, are disponed in loose heaps, upon a bed, or large
area, paved with bricks, and inclining from the circumference to the
centre, to allow the water, with which the whole is repeatedly sprinkled,
ultimately to flow into a large reservoir which is constructed at this place.
The pyrites are thus exposed to the ;:ction of the air, as well as frequent
waterings ; the decomposition of them, produced by this process, forms
sulphate of iion (martial vitriol) in considerable quantities, and was a
few years ago evaporated and crystallized, and allowed to be, by the con
sumers, as pure a salt of iron as any ever made in Great Britain.       The
demand for it was greater than the work, in its infant state, could sup
ply. It is now no longer carried on as a vitriol manufactory, but the acid
obtained from the pyrites is wholly consumed in gating the soda from
rock salt and the brine of Kingley Wick.

 LV. Extract from         a Work, published by Professor Proust,
     entitled Researches on the Tinning of Copper, on Tin
      Vessels,    and glazed Poltery ; published at Madrid
                  "
      1803  *.
  J. he author, in the introduction, says, that the motives
 which induced him to undertake this labour were the doubts
 spread abroad, two years before, among the public in re
 gard to the salubrity of tinned copper, and the accounts of
  the disagreeable accidents arising from vessels badly glazed.
  Government, always attentive to every thing that can tend
  to calm the public mind, had recourse on this subject to
  sound chemistry; the only tribunal competent to banish
  doubts of this kind. Two problems were presented to the
  author to be resolved :
      1st, Is the use of zinc advantageous or not, for tinning
  and for tin vessels ?
      2d> Can tinning, in consequence of the lead it contains,
  and sometimes in Targe quantities, expose the health of the
  public to the same dangers as glazing of a bad quality ?
      The author divides his work into three chapters, and each
  chapter into several paragraphs.
      The first part, which may be considered as historical, is
   divided into four paragraphs.
      In the first the author mentions the project which was
               •
                 From  the "Journal dt P ysique,  Frimaire, an 13.
                                                                   presented

    81*                 On the Tinning     of Copper,
     resented by M. Malouin         to the Academy of Sciences at
   f aris in    1741, in regard to   the employment of zinc for tin
   ning    iron  and copper : the    advantages be promised himself
   were only illusory, and his       expectations have not been con
   firmed by time.
       The second paragraph contains an account of a paper on
   tinning, presented to the same academy by J. B. Kemerlin
   in J 742.       One may see there the examination of it by
   Messrs. Heliot and Geoffroy, who entertained an opinion
   contrary to the assertions of the author.'
       The same year the academy charged Heliot and Geoffroy
  to examine the alloys of zinc proper for making vessels.
  The inconveniences pointed out bv the two academicians,
  as well as by many others, were verified by Proust ; and all
  of them are inclined to proscribe such alloys. Having made
  a mixture of equal parts of lead anil zinc, similar to that
  examined by the two commissioners, he obtained an alloy
  of a paste-like consistence, as easy to be cut with a knife
  as cheese, and difficult to be cast.           M. Pierre Blanco, a
  very ingenious pewterer, seconded the labours of Proust.
  The first time he poured the alloy into the mould, it did not
  Tun sufficiently to fill it.     He tried it a second time ; and,
  when he thought he could draw it from the mould, it fell
  into pieces, as they had no cohesion.             Being desirous to
              a
  procure piece       well or ill moulded,  he found  himself obliged,
  at the third time, to cool his mould in cold water, and to
 employ double the time necessary to cast a piece of the
  same size with common alloys : the vessel obtained broke
  short, and was filled with defects which could not be re
 medied. A pound of alloy was employed, and the article
 weighed only nine ounces. The whole of the residuum was
 mere loss.        The same article acquired in a month a dark
 colour, and at the end of six months was covered with
 oxie'e ; inconveniences which do not take place in vessels
 of common tin. The author still continues to make se
 veral practical objections, to which no one has given an
 answer.
      It is seen, therefore, that alloys of zinc are not so advan
 tageous as some have imagined; and those who propose
them have neither consulted chemistry nor practice. Before
they were presented to government for its sanction, it was
jiecessary to subject these alloys to the test of chemical
agents : and this the author has not omitted.
      1st, A plate of the alloy in question being brought into
contact with vinegar, the latter contracted a very disagreea
ble metallic taste at the end of a day : on the third day,
                                                             without

                 on Tin Vessels, and glazed Pottery.         3 13
  without being sweet, astringent, or bitter, it occasioned in
  the throat a very uneasy and disgusting sensation, and no
  doubt a small dose of it would have excited vomiting.
.     2d, A plate of the same alloy, of four inches' surface,
  boiled half an hour in vinegar, lost 16 grains of its weight.
      3d, Vinegar being boiled in a vessel tinned with the
  same alloy, acquired the same taste as No. 1 .
      4th, A plate of the same alloy, exposed cold in distilled
  vinegar, exhibited the same nhaenomena as No. 1 and 3,.
  'l'his solution, when attentively examined, did not exhibit
  an atom of tin.
      All these facts, which confirm those of the French aca
  demicians, prove that zinc is a metal exceedingly soluble
  in vinegar, very easily altered, and that solutions of it hav
  ing been found noxious, it ought to be proscribed from our
  kitchens.
      The subject of the third paragraph is the project of
   M. Doucet, who in 1778 presented to the Academy of Sci
   ences at Paris a bar and pan made with a mixture of his
   invention.     It was examined by Macquer and Montigni,
   who made a report on it.        These two chemists, having
   more experience than Hellot and Gcoffroy, analysed it che
   mically, and, having soon found that it had its inconveni
   ences, it was rejected.
      The alloy of Chartier, and the project of Lafolie, shared
   the same fate, as is seen by the report of the commissioners,
   and by the labours of the abbe Monges and of Bayen.
      The alloy of M. Buschaendorf, of Leipsic, presented in
    1902, and described in the Annates des Arts et Mamtfac-
   tures, forms the subject of the last paragraph.    Proust sub
  jected it to the same experiments as the preceding : he
   proves that it is attended with the same inconveniences,
   without having any of the qualities announced by Buschaeu-
   dorf.

   while he proposes his mixture, does not condemn the old,
   but he mentions the dangers to whieh people are exposed
   by this kind of tinning.         Kemerlin, Hellot, Geoffroy,
   IDoucet, Chartier, Lafolie, Buschaendorf, and others, have
    done no more : but no one has hitherto proved the reality
   of these supposed dangers ; and what is still more astonish
    ing is, to see the inactivity of the chemists of Europe in
    realising or exploding a fact which is so interesting to so-

316                On the Tinning     of Copper,
ciety. To decide the question in a peremptory manner, it
Was necessary to undertake a series of experiments which
had before been neglected.   To succeed in them it was pre
viously necessary to examine the properties of some metals
and oxides ; and there are nine paragraphs employed in the
examinatioVi of iron, antimony, mercury, lead, and zinc.
This examination was requisite to answer all the objections
which he proposed to resolve in the third part of this work.
                          PART       III.
  This   part is divided into five paragraphs.
                          Paragraph I.
      Experiments made on the old Method of Tinning.
   Five plates of copper, each a foot square, were tinned,
all the necessary precautions being taken. The object of
the author was to ascertain the quantity of alloy they would
lake one with another.
               The first took           144 grains
              The second              178
              The third              200
              The fourth             208
              The fifth              230
  The quantity of tinning which copper can           take is exceed
ingly variable, and not subject to calculation : the alteration
of the copper by tinning being in all points the same, the
variations in the weight must necessarily depend on the
more or less exact manner in which the workman removes
the superfluous tinning; and one might be induced to be
lieve that the artist has it in his power to give a tinning
more or less abundant ; but the tinning not alloyed with
the copper ought not to be considered in the same manner
as that which is alloyed.    The author has proved, in gene
ra!, that good tinning  takes a grain of tin per square inch.
                        Paragraph II.
On the Duration and Causes      of   the Destruction     of Tinning,
   Tinning with pure tin has a silver white colour, and, in
contact with vapours capable of attacking          it,
                                                 assumes    yel
                                                              a
low ish tint.    That made with one-third, one-fourth, or
one-half of lead, like the old tinning, has more brilliancy,
and may be easily distinguished from the former.
   The causes which destroy tinning are friction, caloric,
and acids :   the effects of all these causes vary according to
an infinite number of circumstances, which are determined
by  the author as exactly as possible, and have taught him,
                                                           that,

that, even supposing alloy to be made with one-half lead,
no individual can swallow per day l-20th grain of that
metal ; a quantity inappreciable in its effects, since we daily
swallow a hundred times more when we eat game, without
being incommoded by it. From these facts, and many
others, it results, that if vessels of tinned copper occasion
illness, they ought rather to be ascribed to the want of tin
ning than to the latter.
                           Paragraph      III.
     Of  Tinning considered as soluble in alimentary Acids.
    Eight saucepans, each capable of containing twenty
 ounces of water, were tinned with the following alloys :
    The 1st, with pure tin,
          2d, with tin having 0*05 of lead.
          3d,      -        -     0-10
          4th,     -     '
                            -     0-15
          3th,     -        -     0-20
          6th,     -        -     0-25
           7th,    -        -      0-30
          8th, with equal parts of tin and lead.
    Tinning with pure lead was impossible.
    Into each of these pans there was put a pound of red
 wine vinegar, which was boiled till it was half consumed.
 The vinegar of each pan was poured into a glass vessel, and
 suffered to remain at rest for twenty-four' hours.           The vi
 negar    was   then  poured    off,  and the  precipitates were  well
 washed: each portion of vinegar was mixed with an equal
 quantity of distilled water ; equal parts of each were put
 into the vessels, and three rows were formed of eight vessels
  each.    The vessels of the first and second rows contained
  vinegar; those of the third, sediments. Nearly four ounces
  of the sulphate of potash were poured into each vessel of
  the first row, and into those of the second and third row
  about four ounces of hydro-sulphurated water. In the first
  row no precipitate was observed, consequently there was
  no lead : in the vessels of the second row there was ob
  served a slight chestnut-coloured sediment, which indicated
  the existence of tin. The sediments of the third row did
  not change colour, whence it was concluded that there did
  not exist in them any metallic substances.              The vinegar,
  then, boiled in the tinned pans did not dissolve lead, Dut
  onlv a very small quantity of tin.
     The sediments of the third row were, for the most part,
  composed of tartar and sulphate of lime.            These two salts,
                                                                    in

 314.                 On the Tinning       of  Copper,
 in precipitating, might have carried with them a little lead ;
 but they did not contain an atom of it.
    The same experiments being repeated with very strong
white wine vinegar, which was boiled till three parts of it
 were consumed,        confirmed the preceding facts ; with this
 only difference,    that  the tinning assumed the colour of lead,
 and readily yielded     to  the faction of the finger, coming off
 in the form    of a  gray powder, which was nothing else than
very fine particles of lead.            This phasnomenon was more
remarkable      in  the  pan   No.   8,   though the quantity of that
           did not weigh half a grain.            These facts were the
f>owder
  ess  remarkable    the nearer   to  the   pan  No.   1 ; so that with a
little practice   one   might   judge    by  these means      of the quan
tity  of lead  and  tin  contained     in  tinning.
    The vinegar formed zones of a very beautiful colour on
 the tinning of the pan No. 1 .           These facts may still serve
to enable one to distinguish the quality of tinning.                 These
experiments     evidently   prove   that   lead, which     is very  soluble
 in vinegar, loses that property when alloyed with tin. This
is agreeable to chemical facts already known ; for tin is
more oxidable and soluble than lead, and the latter is pre
cipitated from its solutions by tin, and this is the cause of
the presence of the gray powder above mentioned ; for vi
negar, indeed, dissolves immediately a few particles of the
lead in the tinning, but it is afterwards precipitated by the
tin, and forms gray dust. All these facts, and many others
explained by the author, prove that tinning, the half even
of which is lead, cannot be dangerous in domestic purposes ;
and that, to be hurtful to the health by the contact of ali
mentary acids, it would be necessary that the pans should
be pure lead, or tinned with that metal only, which is im
possible.
                            Paragraph IV.
                             On Tin Vessels.
    It  was necessary to examine the action of vegetable acids
on vessels of tin. For this            purpose the author caused the
following vessels to be made         :
          1st, Pure tin.
          2d, Tin having                    0-05 of lead,
          3d, Ditto         -               o-io
          4th, Ditto        -               0-15
          ath, Ditto        -.              020
          6th, Ditto        -               0-25
          7th, Ditto        -               0'30
          8th, Ditto        -               0'50
          9th,  Of   pure lead.
                                                                        All

              on  Tin Vessels, and glazed Pottery.           319
    All these vessels were filled with boiling vinegar, which
was left in them three days.      The vinegar of the first eight
vessels being subjected to the examination of re-agents, did
not give the least signs of the existence of lead, but of some
particles of tin. The vinegar in the ninth vessel w as much
saturated with lead.
    The same experiments, repeated at three other times,
with vinegar of greater or less strength, exhibited the same
phenomena.         In these cases it was observed that the first
eight vessels had assumed the colour of lead, and exhibited
the same phenomena as those indicated in regard to tinning
in the preceding paragraph.
    The author, after supporting his observations by those of
Bayen and those of Vauquelin, deduces .this consequence :
Tin alloyed with lead is harder than when it is pure, and
less susceptible of suffering its particles to be mixed with
aliments. What have we to fear from such vessels ? Small
 particles which may be detached by the fork or the knife ?
Such fears are groundless.        Let us apply, then, to vessels
of tin, in regard to their use, what we have said of tinning,
 that the fears entertained in regard to the employment of it
 are not proved by any. facts well authenticated; and if the
 art of the pewterer is susceptible of improvement, either in
 regard to health or practice, it cannot be expected from
 mixtures which have always been rejected by sound che
 mistry.    Besides, we know several other mixtures which
 might   be  tried before we have recourse tq a metal so solu-
 luble, and so difficult to be worked, as zinc.
     Let us now form a parallel of the alloys we have exa
 mined, with those used by the pewterers.
     Pure tin forms the first quality, which they employ for
,the best utensils and those most esteemed.
     The second kind of mixture contains an eighth of lead,
  and serves for making common vessels.
     The third kind contains 0*15 of lead, and is employed
  for drinking- vessels.
     The first kind, which is the most common, contains 0,20
  of lead, and is employed for making ink-stands and other
  small articles.
     From what has been said it may be seen, that if pewterers
  employ sometimes for common vessels the fourth kind of
  mixture, the public can be exposed to no danger.           The
  antients, who made so much use of tin vessels, have left
  us no certain facts which prove that the use of them was
  contrary to health, and medicine never proscribed tfeem.

   By theRt. Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, -Bart. K. B. P. R. S.*
 Botanists have long known that the Blight in Corn is
 occasioned by the growth of a minute parasitic fungus or
mushroom on the leaves, stems, and glumes of the living
 plant.   Felice Fontana published in the year 1767 an ela
borate account of this mischievous weedf, with micro
scopic figures, which give a tolerable idea of its form ; more

powers   in their researches.
   Agriculturists da not appear to have paid, on this head,
sufficient attention to the discoveries of tlicir fellow -la
bourers in the field of nature; for though scarce any English
writer of note, on the subject of rural economy has failed to
state his opinion of the origin of this evil, no one of them
has yet attributed     to the real cause, unless Mr. Kirby's

    By these pores, which exist also on the leaves and
glumes, it is presumed that the seeds of the fungus gain
admission, and at the bottom of the hollows to which they
kad (see Plate V and VI. fig. 1. 2.), they germinate and push
their minute roots, no doubt (though these have not yet
been traced), into the cellular texture Beyond the bark, where
they draw their nourishment, by intercepting the sap that
was intended by nature for the nutriment of the grain; the
corn of course becomes shrivelled in proportion as the fungi
are more or less numerous on the plant ; and as the kernel
only is . abstracted from the grain, while the cortical part
remains undiminished, the proportion of flour to bran in
blighted corn, is always reduced in the same degree as the
corn is made light.       Some corn of this year's crop will not
yield a stone of flour from a sack of wheat ; and it is not
impossible that in some cases the corn has been so com
pletely robbed of its flour by the fungus, that if the propri
etor should choose to incur the expense of thrashing and
grinding      bran would be the produce, with scarce an atom
             it,

gathered     in.
     Though diligent          enquiry was made during the last
autumn, no information of importance relative to the origin
Or the progress of the blight could be obtained : this is not
to be wondered at 5 for, as no one of the persons applied to
had any knowledge of the real cause of the malady, none
of them could direct their curiosity in a proper channel.
Now that its nature and cause have been explained, we
may reasonably expect that a few years will produce an
interesting collection of facts and observations, and we
may hope that some progress will be made towards the
very desirable attainment of either a preventive or a cure.
     It seems probable that the leaf is first infected in the
spring, or early in the summer, before the corn shoots up
into straw, and that the fungus is then of an orange co
lour*; after the straw has become yellow, the fungus
assumes a deep chocolate brown : each individual is so
small that every pore on a straw will produce from 20 to
40 fungi, as may be seen in the plates, and ever)' one of
these will no doubt produce at least 100 seeds : if then one
of these seeds tillows out into the number of plants that
appear at the bottom of a pore in Plate V and VI. fig. 1, 2.
how incalculably large must the increase be ! A few diseased
plants scattered over a field must very speedily infect a whole
neighbourhood ; for the seeds of fungi are not much heavier
than air, as every one who has trod upon a ripe puff-ball
must have observed, by seeing the dust, among which is its
seed, rise up and float on before him.
     How long it is before this fungus arrives at puberty, and
 scatters its seeds in the wind, can only be guessed at by
the analogy of others ; probably the period of a generation
 is short, possibly not more than a week in a hot season : if
 so, how frequently in the latter end of the summer must
    * The abbe1 Tcssier, in his Traite des maladies des Grain?, tells us, that in
 France this disease first shows itself in minute spots of a dirty white colour
on the leaves and stems, which spots extend themselves by degrees, and in
 time change to yellow, and throw off a dry orar.gc-coloured powder, pp. 201 .

whenever a gentle breeze, accompanied with humidity,
shall give the signal; to intrude itself into the pores of
thousands of acres of corn 1 Providence, however, careful
of the creatures it has created, has benevolently provided
against the too extensive multiplication of any species of
being: was it otherwise, the minute plants and animals,
enemies against which man has the fewest means of de
fence, would increase to an inordinate extent : this, how
ever,   can in no case happen, unless many predisposing
causes afford their combined assistance.    But for this wise
and beneficent provision, the plague of slugs, the plague of
mice, the plagues of grubs, wire-worms,           chafers, and
many other creatures whose power of multiplying is count
less as the sands of the sea, would, long before this time,
have driven mankind, and all the larger animals, from the
face of the earth.
    Though all old persons who have concerned themselves
in agriculture remember the blight in corn many years, yet
some have supposed that of late years it has materially in
creased ; this however does not seem to be the case.      Tull,
 in his Horsehoeing Husbandry, p. 74, tells us, that the
year 1725
             " was a year of blight the like of which was
never before heard of, and which he hopes may never
happen again ;" yet the average price of wheat in the year
  1726, when the harvest of 1725 was at market, was only
 36s. 4d. and the average of the five years of which it makes
the first, 37*, Id. — 1797 was also a year of great blight ;
 the price of wheat in 1 798 was 49$. \d. and the average of
 the five years, from 1795 to 1799, 63s. 5d.*
    The climate of the British Isles is not the only one that
is liable to the blight in corn ; it happens occasionally in
every part of Europe, and probably in all countries where
corn is grown.     Italy is very subject to         it,
                                              and the last har

was principally owing to the very wet harvest of 1800.       The deficiency of
wheat at that harvest was found, on very accurate calculation, somewhat to

somewhat more damaged than       itwas in 1800, and oarley somewhat less than
an average crop.    Every other article of agricultural foodis  abundant, and

considerable mischief was do.ne to the wheat crop there in
the year 1803 bv a parasitic plant, very similar to the
English one. :
                    *
    It has been long admitted by farmers, though scarcely
                                                                                 "
credited by botanists, that wheat in the neighbourhood of
a barberry bush seldom escapes the blight.             The village of
Rollesby     in Norfolk,   where   barberries    abound,  and wheat
seldom     succeeds,  is called by the opprobrious appellation of
Mildew Rollesby.         Some observing men have or late attri
buted this very perplexing effect to the farina of the flowers
of the barberry, which is in truth yellow, and resembles in
some degree the appearance of the rust, or what is presumed
to be the blight in its early slate.
    It is, however, notorious to all botanical observers, that
the leaves of the barberry are very subject to the attack of a
vellow parasitic fungus, larger, hut otherwise much resem
bling the rust in corn.
    Is it not more than possible that the parasitic fungus of
the barberry and that of wheat are one and the same species,
and that the seed is transferred       from the barberry to the
corn ? Misletoe, the parasitic plant with which we are the
best acquainted, delights most to grow on the apple and
hawthorn, but it flourishes occasionally on trees widely
differing in their nature from both of these : in the Home
Park, at Windsor, misletoe may be seen in abundance on
the lime trees planted there in avenues.           If this conjecture
is founded, another vear will not pass without its being
confirmed by the observations of inquisitive and sagacious
farmers.
    It would be presumptuous to offer any remedy for a ma
lady, the progress of which is so little understood : con
jectures, however, founded on the origin here assigned to
it,   may be hazarded without offence.
  It   is believed * to begin early in the spring, and first to
appear on the leaves of wheat in the form of rust, or
orange-coloured powder           at this season, the fungus will,
                                  ;
 in all probability, require as many weeks for its progress
 from infancy, to puberty as          does days during the heats

its origin from       central position.

     May      not happen, then, that the fungus
              it                                          brought          is

sowing        ?  must be confessed, however, that the clover
                   It
lays, on which no dung from the yard was used, were as
much infected last autumn as the manured crops. The
immense multiplication of the disease in the last season,
seems however to account for this; as the air was no doubt
frequently charged with seed for miles together, and depo
sited    itindiscriminately on all sorts of crops.
    It  cannot however be an expensive precaution to search
diligently       the spring for young plants of wheat infected
                   in
 with the disease, and carefully to extirpate them, as well as
 all grasses, for several are subject to this or      similar ma       a
lady, which has the appearance of orange-coloured or of
black stripes on their leaves, or on their straw and            ex     ;            if
 perience shall prove that uncorrupted straw can cany the
disease with         into the field,

little precaution to prevent any mixture of fresh straw
from being carried out with his rotten dung to the wheat
 field.
     In year like the present, that offers so fair an oppor
         a
 tunity,        will be useful to observe attentively whether
               it
 eattle in the straw-vard thrive better or worse on blighted
 than on healthy straw. That blighted straw, retaining on
     the fungi that have robbed the corn of its flour, has in
it it more nutritious matter than clean straw which has
 yielded      acrop of plump grain, cannot be doubted the                           ;
                   is,

 though the seeds of wheat are rendered, bv the exhausting
  power of the fungus, so lean and shrivelled that scarce any

tained, and in some respects better ; for as a bushel of
much blighted corn will contain one-third at least more
grains in number than a bushel of plump corn, three bushels
of such porn will go as far in sowing land, as four bushels
of large grain.
   The use of the flour of corn in furthering the process of
vegetation, is to nourish the minute plant from the time of
its developement till its roots are able to attract food from
the manured earth ; for this purpose one-tenth of the con
tent? of a grain of good wheat is more than sufficient. The
quantity of flour in wheat has been increased by culture
and management calculated to improve its qualities for the
benefit of mankind, in the same proportion as the pulp
of apples and pears has been increased, by the same means,
above what is found on the wildings and crabs in the
hedge*.
   It is customary to set aside or to purchase for seed corn,

  X O treat fully of objects so important, and of such mag

 of detail, which can only be expected from great practical
 experience, aided by the most liberal communications from
 the public offices or government, in their commercial, re
 venue, and marine departments. The records of the custom
 house are in most countries, except Bengal, open to the
inspection of individuals ; but this source of information
 being inaccessible to us, the amount of foreign trade must
 be assumed from other data.
    Although Bengal possesses a considerable extent of sea
 coast, (from the Subunreccka to the Rajoo river, about

   On f.he west, and contiguous to Bengal, lies the great
peninsula of Hindustan.  To the numerous ports and set
tlements on both coasts of this peninsula, particularly the
coast of Coromandel, Bengal carries on a constant, exten
  sive, and profitable commerce, which may properly be
  called her home, or coasting trade.    On the east she bor
  ders on Assam, and touches the dominions of Ava.           The
  former she supplies exclusively with salt; and from the
 latter receivesall her teak timber for ship building and do
 mestic use.     The bay of Bengal, embracing the west end
  of Sumatra, and washing the coast of Malaya, affords              a
 direct communication through the straits of Malacca to
 China and the' eastern isles, where the opium, saltpetre,
 and piece goods of Bengal are always        in great demand.
 With the Persian and Arabian gulfs, as well as the eastern
 coast of Africa, Bengal likewise maintains commercial in
 tercourse, though many obstacles have in late years super

 India, as well as the emporium of Bengal,        issituated on
 the Houghly river, or western branch of the Ganges, about
  100 miles from the sea, and accessible to ships of all sizes
 at all seasons.   From Calcutta, foreign imports are trans
 ported with great facility by the Ganges and its subsidiary
 streams to the northern nations of Hindustan          ;and the
 consumption and exports of Calcutta are readily supplied
through the numerous rivers which intersect Bengal in
 every direction,   and to which her prosperity has been
ascribed, not only as they facilitate communication and
conveyance, but likewise as they contribute to the fertility
of her soil.
    The elegant villas that adorn the banks of the Houghly,
and the southern aspect of Calcutta, impress the mind of
a  stranger, on his approach, with high ideas of the opulence
of this great city but the shipping that crowd the port
                      ;
point out to him the true source of its splendor.       Nume
rous and magnificent houses, erected within        a few years,
are undoubted proofs of prosperity, and the great population
and extent of the place (still rapidly increasing), with the
busy and animated operations of the harbour, indicate an
active and thriving commerce.     I   am happy to yield my
unqualified assent to this observation; and       it    with no
                                                       is

                                    I   can safely ascribe, in

tions of British merchants resident in India.     Exclusive of
the company's exports, it is to their individual efforts that
Bengal owes her shipping and her commerce.
    In tracing the rise and progress of the maritime trade of
Bengal, since it fell under the sway of Great Britain, I
cannot, for want of materials, extend my researches further
back than the year 1773.         The accompanying abstract,
compiled from the port list of arrivals and departures, will
show the number ana the tonnage of vessels which have
imported and cleared out from Calcutta, or the river
Houghlv, for the years J 773, 1783, 1 791 > 1792, 1793, and
 1794, distinguishing the nations to which they belong, or
whose colours they assume : and annexed thereto will be
found a statement for trie years 1783 and 1793, showing
the different ports from whence the ships' of those years
arrived, and those to which they were bound.
    My intention in compiling this abstract is to show the
rapid increase of the maritime commerce of Bengal since
the year 1783 ; and more especially the increase of the
 country trade, or that which is carried on to and from ports
 in India.    I shall confine my observations principally to
 the years 1783 and 1793 : the former, the first year of peace
 after the American war ; and the latter, the year when the
 present war commenced, intelligence of which reached
 Bengal on the 4th of Juue.
    In 1773, the reader will perceive that only 160 sail of
 vessels entered the port, whose aggregate burthen was 44,497
 tons ; and no more than 108 vessels, carrying 33,470 tons,
 cleared out: of the former, 102 sail, burthen 28,872 tons,
 were country ships, under English colours; and of the
 latter 95 sail, burthen 25,080 tons, were of the same de
 scription.    Ten years afterwards, at the close of the Ame
 rican war, we find the tonnage inward increased to 64,510
 tons, on 149 vessels ; and the departures were 1 14 sail, car
 rying 49,225 tons. But this increase was only apparent ;
 for, the war having detained an unusual number of the
 company's ships in India, it will be perceived that they
 constjtute a large proportion of the arrivals and departures
 of that year, many of them being employed in carrying
 stores to the different presidencies, and in the coasting
 trade : to these must be added transports and men of war.
 The country shipping under English colours, which arrived
 and sailed in 1783, only amounts to 128 sail, carrying
 44,865 tons; whereas in 1773 their numbers were i9o,
  and burthen 53,952 tons; which exhibits a decline of this
                                                        tonnage,

tonnage, in consequence of the war, in the proportion of
one-firth nearly ; and we are persuaded that the captures
made by the enemy during that unfortunate contest, might
be stated at a much larger proportion.
    Our fleets in India, in that disastrous period, although
numerous, powerful, and well appointed, afforded but little
protection to the commerce of the country.        Not a single
frigate,  in my  recollection, was ever detached   as a convoy
to merchant ships in the country trade : nay, I have heard
jt frequently asserted, that ships of war, sailing from Bengal
to join the fleet on the coast of Coromandel, have rejected
all applications for protection to merchantmen pursuing the
same voyage ; notwithstanding they were laden with grain
for the supply of our armies in the Carnatic, where famine
was then raging with all its horrors.      I am not competent
to say how far the detention of a frigate a few days, tor the
 purpose of a convoy, might have been injurious to the public
 service; but the merchants here, in the loss of property,
and the famished inhabitants of the coast, in the privation
of food, felt severely this inattention to trade, and com
plained bitterly on the occasion . Nor did they fail to ob
serve, that, for other services, that which did not appear
to them of any importance to the public welfare, but under
taken solely for the purpose of acquiring prize money, fri
gates and sloops of war were readily detached.        Smarting
under repeated and heavy losses, they could neither perceive
 the utility nor applaud the zeal which prompted the aid of
a frigate and sloop of war to assist this government in the
reduction of the defenceless Dutch factory at Chinsurah
in 1781, the capture of which afterwards furnished a subject
of so much litigation.
    The daring activity of M. Suffrein at this juncture made
a striking impression.       No change of monsoon induced
him to quit the bay of Bengal ; and during the absence of
our fleet, in their annual visit to Bombay for refitment, and
to avoid the storms that prevail at the autumnal equinox, he
swept the seas, destroyed our trade, and intercepted       the
supplies from this to the. other presidencies. A ship of the
line and two frigates, which he stationed oft the Sand Heads,
or entrance into the Houghly, at one time nearly shut up
the port, at another made many valuable captures, carrying
back an ample supply of all sorts of provisions and stores,
which neither his own resources, nor those of his allies,
could have furnished.      From the abundance of Bengal both
friends and foes drew their supplies ; and, however much
the loss of what fell into the enemy's hands might have
                                                          been

been regretted,  H was a fortunate circumstance, that, during
the whole of that war, from a succession of favourable crops,
the great exports of grain created no enhancement of price;
or, at least, not greater than is experienced in the ordinary
fluctuations of the market.
   We shall pass over the years 1791 and 1792 without
further observation, than to remark, that from 1783 to
1791, the general trade of Bengal had increased          from
113,735 tons, the total of arrivals and departures in the
former year, to 944,035 tons of shipping, which imported
and cleared out in the latter ; and that the English country
shipping, which cleared in and out, had risen from 128
¦ail, carrying 44,865 tons, to 575 sail, burthen 175,407
tons; by which it appears that the country trade, in the
course of only eight years, had multiplied near four-fold,
The effect of this astonishing increase of maritime trade on
the general prosperity of the country, will be readily perr
ceived and admitted.
   I come now to the year 1793, when the present war orU
ginated, which soon after the commencement here became
ruinous in the extreme to the trade of this country.    Intel
ligence of hostilities reached us in June, when the only
English ship of force in India was the Minerva frigate:
the left the Indian seas in the month of February 1 794,
and, until the arrival of commodore Newcombe off the
Mauritius in May following, the whole of the British com
merce and possessions in this quarter of the globe was
without the protection of a single ship belonging to the
British navy.     Thirteen sail of frigates and privateers,
which sailed from the Mauritius, captured, besides two
Indiamen, numbers of the most valuable ships in the
country trade ; and would speedily have annihilated our
commerce, and shut up every port in India belonging to
us and our allies, had they not been checked by the vigour
of the supreme government. Our present governor-gene
ral, with a promptitude and decision which does honour to
his administration, equipped and dispatched a squadron from
Bengal, consisting of three armed Indiamen and a country
ship, strengthened by a detachment of artillery and troop*
from the garrison, which captured two of the enemy's pri
vateers, and repulsed an attack made by their grand arma
ment under M. Renaud ; obliging him soon after to return
to the Mauritius, without effecting any further mischief
than the capture of the Figot Indiaman.       Some notice of
these circumstances seemed necessary to explain the sudden
decline of trade in 1794: tha^ any commerce was conti

                On the Maritime Commerce           of Bengal.
   nued, is due to the exertions of the supreme government
   for its protection.
      In 1793, we find the tonnage inward and outward to
   consist of 757 vessels, burthens 291,190 tons ; and of these
   575 were English country ships, carrying 209,279 tons.
   In 1794, the total of arrivals and departures was reduced to
  441 sail, burthen 163,484 tons ; of which 2S6 were English
'
   country ships, carrying 96,321 tons; so that the general
  trade of the port, since the commencement of the present
  war, has decreased 127,706 tons, and the Indian'tradc on
  British ships 1 12,948 tons, being a declension of more than
   one-half of the country trade.
      The documents from which the foregoing statements
   have been drawn, are, as we have already mentioned, the
  port lists of arrivals and departures, which are registered in
  the master attendant's office, and may be received as accu
  rate, so far as they extend, with respect to number.                But
  we cannot say so much as to tonnage, for there being no
  tonnage duties paid here, the ships are never measured, and
  their burthen is of course estimated, or taken from the in
  formation of the commander.               Nor does this list exhibit
  such vessels as are piloted by native pilots or by their own
  commanders, which is the case with the native craft, or
  vessels belonging to and navigated              by natives from the
  northern circars on the coast of Coromandel.
      It is also much the practice with native commanders of
  other vessels outward bound to save the pilotage charged
  by the company's pilots, which, on ships drawing much
  water, falls very heavy, particularly on -vessels sailing under
  foreign colours. To estimate, therefore, the maritime com->
  merce of Bengal fr om these documents, particularly the
  exports, would be to undervalue it greatry.                We lament
  the   want   of  better  materials;     but  taking  them   as an occa^
  tional guide,    and  referring   to  such  other sources  of  informa
  tion   as  we haee    been   able   to  procure,   we  shall  attempt  to
  form    some    general idea  of   its magnitude,    and  the   channels
  through which it flows.
      The exports to Europe and to the United States of Ame
  rica, in importance and extent constitute bv far the most
  considerable portion of the commerce of Bengal.                    They
  may     be  comprised    under    the   general   heads  of  cotton  and
  silk wrought and unwrought, sugar, drugs, and dyes, in-
  eluding indiro and saltpetre.           As the medium adopted for
  the remittance of the surplus revenues of these provinces,
  the company's investment occupies the greatest share in
  this trade, being unquestionably the most valuable.
                                                                        In

                    On the Maritime Comiherce              of Bengal.              333
    In No. 15 of the Appendix to the Report of the Com
mittee of Accounts, published by the court of directors in
February 1793, we find an account of the prime cost of
all the cargoes purchased by the company in India for five
years, from 1786 to 1791 inclusive.          We shall only state
the last year's investment for Bengal, or that provided for
1 790- ] , as we believe it has rather Been increased since that
period ; and we shall adopt that as the present amount of
the company's exports from Bengal, being 99,11,598 cur
rent rupees, or 1,06,00,109 current rupees, including com
mercial charges at 6,88,511 current rupees.            The private
trade laden on the company's ships by individuals is esti
mated by the directors, on an average of three years prior
to 1793, at 300 tons, and valued in England at 694 1. pet
ton, making 208,200           the prime cost of which may be
                                 1.,
taken, on         conjectural estimate, at 15 lacks of current
                    a
 rupees    ;to this must be added the value of goods laden on
the privileged tonnage of the commanders and officers of
 the company's ships.        Fifty tons are allowed to each ship
 of 755 tons and upwards and further privilege of 30 tons
                                   ;         a
is   allowed, provided no goods ordered to be laden on the
 company account are refused.           We will suppose that 50
 tons only are occupied; and, estimating the number of
 ships on an average of 15 per annum, give us 750 tons for
 the whole privileged tonnage.               to be remarked, that
                                                 It   is
 *J1 the ships which, arrive at Bengal generally fill up their
 privilege at this place, although they may be afterwards
 destined to Madras, Bencoolen, or other ports in India;
 and as the company have lately increased their tonnage to
 this' port, we presume the number of tons we have allowed
 for privilege       less than what
                        is                really occupied*.
                                                 is           This
 tonnage we value at 3000 current rupees per ton, making
        lack of current rupees, or about 15,0001. for each ship.
     Had we estimated the value of privileged tonnage at
  40,000      per ship, we should probably have approached
               1.
  nearer to the truth; for            the medium
                                       it   is          which the     by
 captains and officers remit home the proceeds of their out
  ward adventures       and those who have no adventures sell
                             ;
  their privilege to others.
     *
         Fourteen company's ships sailed from Bengal         in   the season   1793-4 for
 Madras, Bencoolen, and Europe, and three on          cruise for the protec

   It is curious to observe the various modes bv which com
merce is pursued, and the expedients which are adopted for
mutual advantage.      For some years past it has not been the
practice with the captains and officers of the company's
ships to fill up their own privileged tonnage, or but a por
tion of it 5 and yet they convert it into a profitable and safe
remittance for the proceeds of their adventures to this coun
try. Little skilled in Indian goods, and of course liable to
imposition, they have wisely abandoned the homeward ad
venture to merchants resident in Bengal, who fill np their
privilege, receive their money, and grant bills, at the rate
of Ss. 4d. to 2s. 6d. for the current rupee. In the exchange
is included freight and insurance, and it depends on the
value remitted per ton, whether the freight is dear or cheap.
The less the merchant draws for, the cheaper he obtains
his freight ; for the exchange may at least be reckoned 20
per cent, beyond par, which of course becomes a charge
for freight and insurance. The bills are paid from the pro
ceeds of the goods, and if the ship is lost, the obligation
of payment is void.
   In estimating the value of exports to Europe and Americ*
on foreign ships, we shall form our calculation from the
tonnage cleared out in the last three years, 1 792, 1 793, and
J 794.    It may be objected to this estimate, that two of the
years we have selected being a period of war, neutral ton
nage under foreign flags would be increased.           This, no
doubt, has some influence ; but the war having involved
every nation in Europe, except the Danes and Swedes, al
though we have had an increase of Danish ships in conse
quence thereof, other foreign tonnage has declined in a.
greater proportion.    Taking, then, the departures of foreign
ships for Europe and America in 1792, we find them W

    The medium of         the  three years gives 12,963        tons; but
as many      of the ships under foreign colours from Europe
and America, touch at intermediate ports in India, and are
therefore recorded as arriving from or sailing to an Indian
port, they must be added to the ships which made a direct
voyage.       In the years before mentioned, these departures
were as follows :
    ,In 1792, 27 vessels, carrying              -       6,660 tons.
          1793, 28 ditto            -           -       9,555

           The medium is 6,21         If   tons per annum.
     The proportion of the cargoes of these ships intended for
 the Europe market, it would be impossible to ascertain :
 we shall estimate it at one-sixth of the medium for three
 years, or 1,035£, which, added to the direct tonnage, gives
  13,99&£ tons.
     As a considerable portion of tonnage is occupied by gruff
 goods, we cannot estimate it higher than 1000 current ru.
 pees, or 100 1, per ton: even at this rate the whole value
 will amount       to current rupees 1,39,98,833,54, to which
 adding the exports on the company's ships, the total of
 goods exported to Europe and America amounts by this
 computation to two crores, eighty-three lacks, forty-eight

 annas, four pice, or 2,834,894,481. 4s. 8d. The Dutch
 company, whose trade from Bengal was formerly so consi
 derable, that, within our recollection, their exports to Eu
  rope exceeded forty lacks per annum, have not, to our
 knowledge, provided any investment for Europe for several
 years past ; we must therefore exclude them for the present
  from our estimate of Europe exports, and proceed to the
  country trade.
     That branch of it which first claims our attention, is the
  intercourse with our settlements, and the different ports oa
 the coast of Coromandel in its greatest extent, including
 the Northern Circars, and reckoning from Point Palmiras
 to Cape Comorin ; which we have already denominated the
 home trade.
     This trade, as will be perceived from the port lists, gives
 employ to the greatest portion of our home tonnage ; and
 is important, not only for its nature and extent, but for the
 constant resource which it affords to ou? shipping, of mo
 derate freights, on grain, when other employments fail, or
 at intervals when they must otherwise remain idle.
     The principal articles of export to Madras and the coast
of Coromandel are grain and pulse, sugar, saltpetre, mo
lasses, ginger, long pepper, clarified butter, oil, silk wrought
and unwrought, muslins, spirits, provisions, &c.
     In the year 1793, 234 ships, burthen 84,04* tons, cleared
out for the coast of Coromandel ; and of this tonnage we
suppose that 1,0334^ tons were filled by goods intended for
Europe, and 80,000 tons at least were occupied by grain
and pulse ; which, valued on a medium at two and a half
current rupees per bag of two bazar maunds, or 164 lb.
avoirdupois, when shipped, and 13 bags to the ton, amounts
to 26 lacks of rupees.      Other exports to this coast on ship
ping owned by European traders, are estimated at 8 lacks,
making in the whole 34 lacks of current rupees.           But the
advantages of this traffic must not be appreciated by the
value, of the
                 goods when shipped, but their value when
sold ; for the freight of grain is nearly equal to the cost ;
and, if we take the sales, on a medium of five current ru
pees per bag, or allow for freight and charges two and a
half current rupees, we find it to be a trade which pays to
the European shipping of India near twenty-seven lacks of
current rupees per annum.        To this must be added the ex
ports   on  donies  and   native craft, or vessels belonging to
and wholly navigated by natives of India.       Before the pro
hibition of foreign salt their number was very considerable,
particularly iron the Northern Circars ; but that measure
                                                        depriving

                On the Maritime Commerce          of Bengal*          337
depriving them of a freight of salt to Bengal, and having
nothing to substitute but money for their purchases, it ope
rated for many years as a severe check on this branch of
trade. A more liberal policy was adopted by lord Corti-
wallis, by drawing part of the annual supply of salt from
the coast, which, with many other advantages, afforded
considerable encouragement both to native and European
shipping.    Since that period this trade has begun to revive,
and we may now rate the tonnage of vessels belonging to
and navigated by natives, which annually visit Bengal, from
all quarters, including the Maldivian vessels, and those
from the coast of Malabar and Muscat, at 10,000 tons.
Their exports are principally grain and pulse, with some
coarse sugar, long pepper, ginger, and silk and cotton piece
goods, which may be estimated at about five lacks of cur
rent rupees } and, added to the exports for this coast on
ships navigated by or belonging to Europeans, make 39
lacks of current rupees.
   After the Coromandel trade, we place that to the east
ward, and China ; and, were our scale of precedence deter
mined by the capital it employs, exclusive of shipping, or,
in other words, by the value of its exports only, it would
stand next in rank to that of Europe : but we cannot hold
any branch of trade which requires a capital of fifty-five
lacks of rupees, and an outlay of twelve months, to give
employment to 1 1,000 tons of shipping, equal to that which
employs 84,000 tons on a capital of thirty-four lacks only,
and which returns the outlay in eight or ten weeks.
   The grand article which supports the eastern trade is
opium.     This fascinating drug has ever been in great re
quest amongst all eastern nations, but more particularly
among the Malays.         In its oblivious fume (for they gene
rally smoke      they find refuge from every care and anxiety;
                 it)
and, when the evils of life press beyond their powers of
endurance, taken         another form,

have the means of procuring            it,
                                    use opium without restraint        ;
and the Chinese, notwithstanding              prohibited by their
                                             it   is
laws under severe penalties, appear to be equally fond of the
drug. It  was formerly difficult to import opium into China,
and the quantity sold there was trifling       but, in defiance of
                                                  ;
prohibitory  laws,  the consumption      of China  cannot now be
rated at less than half the quantity exported from Bengal.

 the sales of Patna opium, amount to 6,36,668,12 sicca ru

     Notwithstanding the large quantity of teak timber annu
 ally imported f.oin Pegue, the balance of trade is much in
 favour of Bengal.         Her exports to the dominions of the
 king of Ava, including Arracan, consist chiefly of silk and
 cotton piece goods, fire-arms, iron, nails, naval and mili
 tary stores, and a Variety of European goods ; which may
 be estimated at about six lacks of current rupees.
     It remains to be noticed, the supplies to the new settle
 ment on the Andamans, occasional cargoes to the colonies
 at Port Jackson, in New Holland, and expeditions to the
 north-west coast of America and Kamschatka : these can
 not be rated beyond two lacks per annum.
     Combining all the exports by sea under the heads to
 which we have referred them, they appear as follow :

    To this sum should be added exports by land to the De-
 can, Thibet, Nepaul, and the various nations that surround
 Bengal ; hut of these, although considerable, we can form
 no computation.          We know, however, that in the year
 1 791 there was exported from Benares alone, to thcDecart
 and Mahratta states, above a lack of maunds of sugar by
 inland traders, and the quantities of raw and wrought silks,
 and piece goods, with a variety of European goods, which
 are annually purchased by inland merchants, amount to a
 considerable sum ; probably not less than an eighth part of
by rhe Porte in consequence of representations ma<le by our ambassador
to the Ottoman government, at the ins'ance of the court of directors.   A
measure so injurious to Bengal we cannot attribute to those who are
bound to cherish and support fieri policy and humanity would prompt a
different conduct.  We must therefore suppose the prohibition arow from
the natural jealousy of the Turkish government.

  the exports by sea. Was I, therefore, to rate the whck
  annual exports or Bengal, by sea and land, at tour million?
  and a half of pounds sterlmg, I should, in my own opi
  nion, form a moderate estimate of their value.
      Imperfect as the materials are from which I have drawn
  my computation of the export trade of Bengal; I am sorry
  to confess, that I am without anv guide whatsoever to di
  rect me in forming the most distant idea of the amount of
  imports.    Had I even access to the records of the custom
  house, they would afford very unsatisfactory grounds from
  •which any conclusions could be drawn.
     The company's imports pay no duty. Some of the fo
  reign ships discharge their cargoes at Serampore, which of
  course pay no duty to the company", and do not appear on
  the books of the custom-house; and smuggling is a plant
  which rears its head in every climate.    1 shall not, there
  fore, hazard any estimates on this head, for all that I could
  offer would be only vague conjecture.    Since the abolition
  of government customs, no duties have been levied at Cal
 cutta on exports.    Foreign and inland imports pay four per
 cent, ad valorem, with an exception to indigo, and to silk
 and cotton piece goods of the produce of the country \ the
 former paying no duty, and the latter only two per cent.
 The duties on liquors are fixed at so much per dozen, or
 gallon.    A new regulation, I am informed, is about to take
 place, which f'rtes inland imports from all duty, and im
 poses two and a half per cent, on all imports by sea, and
 the same on exports. This regulation will increase the port
 duties, without being unfavourable to the trade of the coun
try, inasmuch as the whole consumption of inland produce
in Calcutta is thereby liberated ; for we cannot estimate the
 impost on goods exported, including even the advanced
price, or the profits of the intermediate merchant, who buys
from the manufacturer or inland trader, and sells to the
foreign exporter at a sum equal to the amount of the present
duties on inland imports into Calcutta, which comprehend
as well the consumption of the plate as the exports there
from.
     Provided the different articles of import and export be
precisely enumerated at the custom-house, and this source
of information is accessible, the regulation will afford to
future speculators on this subject some better data than we
possess for estimating the amount of the trade of Bengal.
 .. The imports of Bengal may be classed under the same
general heads into which we have divided the exports. From
Europe she receives metals of all sorts, wrought and uh-

stores  or* every description, gold and silver coin and bul
lion ; and almost every article of the produce of Europe,
which people in affluent circumstances there consume, is
imported for the use of the European inhabitants.
   The returns from Madras and the coast of Coromandel
consist of salt, red wood, some fine long cloth, izarees,
and chintz, and occasional speculations of European goods,
or the produce of other countries previously imported there.
The balance due to Bengal is either absorbed by drafts or
bills on this government, drawn by the Madras presidency,
«t is remitted in specie.
    From the eastern islands and Malay coast are received
pepper, tin, wax, dammer,- brimstone, gold dust, specie,
betel-nut, spices, benzoin, &c. : from China, tutenag,
sugar-candy, tea, alum, dammer, porcelain, and lackered
ware, and a variety of manufactured goods : and from Ma
nilla, indigo of a very fine quality, (which is re-exported to
Europe,) sugar, japan wood, and specie.        The balance of
this trade, meaning the whole eastern commerce* is gene
rally paid into the company's treasury at Canton for bills
on the court of directors, (which are negotiated          here,
and, whilst the exchange was at 5s. (id. for the Spanish
dollar, formed an advantageous remittance,) or it is ab
sorbed by bills granted by the traders to this government,
and payable to the supercargoes in China.
    The Malabar coast pays her purchases with sandal wood,
coyar rope, pepper, some cardamums, and occasional car
goes of cotton wool : the balance is remitted by bills, or
 sunk in the annual supplies which Bengal furnishes to the
 presidency of Bombay.
    From Pegue are brought teak timber, tin, wax, elephants'
teeth, lac, &c.      The gulfs make their returns in coffee,
specie,   brimstone,  dates, and some other articles of incon
siderable value.     And the Maldives and eastern cbast of
Africa supply cowries and coyar.

LVIIL    An Essay      on Medical Entomology.   By F. Chau-

                            HEMIPTERA.
Lvoccos — Gall Insect. — The female, says Cuvier, has the
form of a buckler firmly attached to the stems and leaves
of plants, and lives on the juice, which it extracts by a
long beak it inserts into them.             It has six short feet, and
two short and cylindric antennae : it has no wings.                The
male, in the state of larva, has almost the same form as
the female ; but it is metamorphosed into a very small in
sect with two long wings, long filiform antennas,                  and
six smooth eyes, without any apparent beak. When the
female has been fecundated, she becomes considerably
larger. The eggs which she lays remain under her body,
which afterwarHs becomes dry and serves as a shelter to the
 eggs, and for some time to the young after they have been
 hatched. The latter issue from an indentation in the poste
 rior part of the body of their mother, and run about some
 time on the tree before they become fixed.
      Coccus Ilicis — Kermes — This gall insect lives on a kind
 of green oak which grows in Spain, Portugal, and the south
 of France (Quercus coccifera). The female, which in April
 is not larger than a grain of millet, acquires by fecundation
 such a size, that in the month of June she is almost as
 large as a juniper berry, which she pretty nearly resembles
 in shape and colour.         At this last period, when the female
 loses life by communicating        it,   the follicles formed  by  her
 body and eggs are torn off      by    means of the nails.     To pre
 vent the latter from being hatched they are besprinkled with
 good vinegar, and dried in the open air.
      W ith the juice expressed from these follicles      is  prepared
 what are called eraines_ d'ecarlate and syrup of kermes,
 which   is   employed as an astringent, stimulant, and aphro
 disiac.
    It   will be sufficient to enumerate the different substances
 which enter into the preparation of alkermes, to show how
  little foundation there   is   for its great reputation. Notwith
  standing     the   successive  reforms which this electuary has
  experienced      since  the time  of Messue, it    could not lose the
  impression     of  that Arabic  polypharmacy     with  which, during
a     long series of ages, medicine was infected, and from
  which  it   is not yet totally freed.
                                                                 Pastils

                       On Medical Entomology.                          345
    Pastils of alkermcs deserve as little confidence, and must
also be rejected.
    Kermes furnish to the arts a red of a good colour, but
less brilliant than that of cochineal.    The latter is an insect
of the saine genus (Coccus cacti), which is produced in
America on a kind of cactus called nopal (Cactus coccinel-
liferus).    The female is oval, and retains traces of the seg
ments of her body. A decoction of these insects, mixed
with a nitro-munatic solution of tin, produces scarlet:
alone, they dye crimson.
    Stisser, Lister, and Struve, have extolled cochineal in
 affections of the urinary passages ; yet its medicinal quali
 ties are very uncertain, and, in my opinion, it ought to be
 applied only to dyeing*.
    Another kind of coccus produces gum lac. This, also,
 medicine may give up to dyeing, wnich derives from it a
 beautiful red colour.
                           ORDER III.
                            LEPIDOPTERA.
   Ph  ai./f.na — Moth. — The phalaenae
                                      are distinguished from
the butterfly and sphynx by their antennae decreasing from
the base to the summit, and by their flying abroad chiefly
in the night.
    Phalsna (Rombyx) Mori — The larva of this species is
 known generally under the improper denomination of silk
 worm.      A great deal ha3 been written on the method of
 producing and rendering useful the valuable tissue which
 forms the tomb it constructs for itself: Chaussier has che
 mically examined the phalaena of the mulberry tree, and
 has extracted from        it,  means of alcohol, an acid (the
                                 by
 bombic)    pretty  well concentrated,   with which the materia
 medica might be enriched.          consider all acids as capable
                                      I
 of furnishing powerful succour to medicine and, in my    ;
 opinion, none of them ought to be neglected.
    Bonnet, Bergman, and Sauvagcs have found acid pre—
          in the larvae of several other lepidopteras.      would
                                                                It

   a small head, and Ions thin antennae of thirteen or fifteen
  articulations.     The wings large, and almost without ribs.
  The thorax, as it were gibbous. The abdomen compressed
  on the sides and sharp below, where it contains, between
  two scaly laminae, a sting bent in a spiral form, and which
  i»sues only when the insect wishes to deposit its eggs under
  the epidermis of a plant.          Its prick occasions a protube
  rance called gall, which always increases, and in which the
  larva lives till the time of its metamorphosis*.                  It then
  gnaws through its prison, and the place where it issues is
 marked by a nole with which the gall is pierced : some
 times, however, the larva dies before that period, or is not
 able to form for itself a passage ; in that case the gall re
  mains without being perforated.
     Cynips Qoercus —-Gall F/y.— The oak affords nourish
 ment to several kinds of cynips, which all priek it in cer
 tain parts ; such as the branches, flowers, leaves, and foot
 stalks.    The species which attack the latter part have a
 black body, whitish legs, and brown thighs.                  It produces
 the large    round   gall full of  tubercles,     a decoction   of which,
 mixed   with   a  solution  of the    sulphate   of  iron, composes ink,
 and   almost   all black   colours.
     The gall (called commonly the gall-nut) was formerly
 considered as an excellent remedy ; and I consider as very
 blameable the forgetfulness to which it appears to be at
 present condemned.          It has a great analogy indeed to cin
chona; and if it cannot, in certain circumstances, supply
its place, there are others in which it is superior.               Hippo
 crates employed it externally against affections of the ma
 trix, and Galen cured intermittent fevers by administering
it in doses of a gros.
     The external and internal use of gall-nuts is indicated in
 asthenic diseases of the lymphatic and cellular systems, in
 some mucous fluxes too abundant/such as blennorrhea and
leucorrhea.       It is a powerful auxiliary for keeping in con
tiguity parts which have been divided.
     The gall nut of the oak, by simple infusion in water,
deposits crystals disposed in the form of a sun, of a gray
colour, and an acid styptic taste.              It is gallic acid, which
retains the properties ot the substance that furnished it.
Boiling akohol dissolves equal parts of that acid ; cold, it
dissolves a fourth.        The gallic alcohol which results from
it ought, in my opinion, to surpass in virtue all the pre
parations of gall nuts hitherto employed.

its abdomen        and   feet  are red  : the  excrescence   which gives
rise   to its  larva is   spongy,   reticulated,  and   formed  of yellow
and red filaments.            It is known under the name of moss
of the rose tree, or bedeguar.             It is astonishing that illus

even ante-hydrophobic properties to this substance, which
has no odour*.
     Chrvsis— Chryside. —The beautiful colours with which
the bodips of all these insects are ornamented, justify the
name of golden wasp which has been given to them. They
have jaws, but no trunk; their tongue is small and oval;
 their antennae are filiform, and composed of twelve articula
 tions, the first of which is longer than the rest : their sting
 is enveloped in a scaly covering, and serves the insect only
for depositing its eggs in the small cells which it forms in
the mortar of walU exposed to the south.
     Cvnips ignita— Blue and red Chryside. Cuvier. — The
 head and breast of this species are blue, changing to golden
green : the abdomen is red, changing to gold colour, and
 terminated by four indentations.
     It has been proposed to employ this insect, dried and
 pulverized, or digested in alcohol, in the same manner and
  the same diseases as cantharides.             Beiris recommends it in
  particular in paralytic affections.
     Apis — The Bee. — The mouth of bees is furnished with
j,aws, ,and a trunk, with which they extract the juice from
  flowers : their antennae are filiform.               The females and
  males have their anus armed with a retractile sting, which
  inflicts a painful wound.

domestic bee from the "other species of the same genus. It
is well known that a hive contains bees of three kinds :
    1st, The queen or mother is smaller and longer than the
males : her wings do not extend to the extremity of the
body : the latter is of a bright brown colour above, and of a
beautiful yellow below. She has neither palettes nor brushes
on the legs : her trunk is very short and very delicate.
    2d, The males or drones have long wings, a short trunk,
no palettes on their legs, and no sting. The only use of them
seems to be to fecundate the queen.              This important func
tion is scarcely discharged when they are expelled, or mas
sacred without mercy.          Yet bees are quoted as a perfect
model of good government*.
    3d, Bees without sex, which are called working bees,
because, indeed, the whole labour of the hive belongs ex
clusively to them, are distinguished by their smaller size,
and their long pointed trunk, moveable in every direction.
Their paws resemble brushes ; the posterior ones are hol
lowed out in the spoon form.                 It is by means of this
conformation that they are able to dive into the corolla of
flowers, suck the nectar from them, and load themselves
with pojlen to convert it into honey and wax. The latter
forms the basis of the combs, the surface of which exhibits
an assemblage of a multitude of cells arranged with won
derful art and astonishing symmetry.               A part of these cells
or alveolae is destined to receive the honey, and the mother
bee deposits in the rest the hope of a new generation .
    Most medicines are distinguished by a dark colour, a
nauseous odour, and a detestable taste.              The patient shud
ders at the bare view of the disgusting beverage which he
is ordered to swallow to the very dregs ; and, if the danger
is not urgent, he refuses to purchase health at that price.
Manna and senna enter into the composition of the purga
tives most generally employed.              The odour which exhales
from them often produces spasms and other accidents in
persons of a nervous constitution.                I knew a young man
to whom this odour gave frequent stools ; and I rarely pre
pare these medicines myself without experiencing nausea,
sometimes followed by vomiting.               Hippocrates, two thou
sand years ago,     recommended         some    remedy less energetic,
and more agreeable to the patient,           in  the room of one more

efficacious which excited his aversion.                Honey possesses
the double advantage of flattering the taste and producing
excellent effects.         If it does not occupy one of the first
places in the materia medica, it is probably because it has
an agreeable savour, and is very common.                  There are few
diseases, indeed, in which honey is counter-indicated.                 In
many it acts as a powerful palliative, and in many others it
produces a radical cure. Affections of the urinary passages
and those of the organs of respiration are the cases, how
ever, iu which the use of it is crowned with the happiest
success.       Last winter I had several instances of pulmonary
catarrh, and honey was always the principal means of cure;
I had also to treat a dyspnoea, and three cases of phthisis hi
the highest degree.            One of the patients affected with the
latter ascribed his malady to cinchona, of which he had been
made to take more than twelve ounces.                  All of them were
indebted, in a great measure, for their cure^ to honey.                  I
advised them to eat it with their bread j and I caused them
to put it into their common beverage, which was an infu
sion of the roots of the polygala amara. The anti-phthisical
properties of this plant have been placed beyond doubt by
a physician as estimable for his talents as for his virtues*.
 I wished to try this treatment on a phthisicky patient in the
second degree, who had been imprudently moved about from
hospital to hospital for a considerable time. Honey and
 polygala both failed, and the patient soon sunk under the
disease.       I also had the misfortune to see fall a sacrifice a
 captain of the 48th regiment of infantry, attacked with a
 phthisis laryngea t, the fatal termination of which ought
 chiefly to be ascribed to different treatments with hyper-
 oxygenated muriate of mercury. Can Van Swielen be par
 doned for having put into the hands of ignorance' a terrible
 poison, to which thousands daily fall victims ? Water in
 which honey is dissolved is called simple hydromel. If this
 mixture be subjected to vinous fermentation, the result is
 vinous hydromel.           The first is proper in angiotenic fevers
 and phlegmasia; ; the second is indicated in particular in
 adynamic diseases.
    Honey boiled with half its weight of white wine vinegar
 constitutes simple oxymel, the utility of which in meningo-
 gastric fevers, and phlegmasia; complicated with adynamic
 symptoms, has been proved by long experience. If vinegar

 of squills be substituted for common vinegar, there wilf oi
 formed oxymel of squills, which ought to be considered as
 an excellent hydragogue.       1 cured, in the hospital of Berg-
 op-Zoom,    several persons  attacked   with anasarca and partial
 dropsies just beginning, and many oedematous affections,
 by prescribing for them daily nothing but one or two ounce*
 of oxymel of squills in two pounds of the infusion of ab-
 synthium and a chopin of good wine, of which the patient
 took alternately a glass full every hour. Being persuaded
 that the best remedies to succeed require to be seconded by
a good regimen, I did every thing in my power to prevent
the hydropical patients from gratifying their appetite, which
is often voracious.    Their quantity ofbread never exceeded
twelve ounces ; and the only food I allowed them to add to
it was eggs, carrots, rice, turnips, and prunes. I could
have wished to allow them a little animal food, such as veal
or chicken ; but, having at my disposal nothing except beef
of an indifferent quality, I was obliged to interditt them
from flesh meat altogether.
    Honey, whether employed id its natural state or formed
into the different preparations before mentioned, must be
chosen exceedingly white, firm, and granulated.            That of
Narbonne possesses all these qualities.        The Gatinois fur
nishes some also, which is very good. The use of yellow
liquid honey is confined to lotions and cataplasms.
    I have said nothing of electuaries, confections, conserves,
opiates, See, of which honey is often one of the ingredi
ents, and sometimes the base.          The bare mention ot elec
tuary suggests theriac, orvietan, mithridate, double catho-
licum, 8cc. : and one cannot help being vexed to see these
whimsical compositions still make so conspicuous a figure
in the lists of pharmaceutical remedies.
   Though wax seems exclusively devoted to the arts, some
celebrated physicians have, in certain circumstances, ad
ministered it with success.        Jacobi found it very useful in
convulsive cough, hematuria, and dysentery.           It is above
all in the last disease that the efficacy of it,  used internally
and under the form of injection, has been confirmed            by
Diemerbroek, Valleriola, and Pringle.           Soap serves as a
medium for making of       itpills  or an aqueous solution.
   In certain cases the too speedy union of the lips of        a
wound or the edges of an ulcer must be retarded, because
it may be followed    by  disagreeable consequences    :  at other

indications but with extreme difficulty and extraordinary;
slowness, because our humours, both' in the sound state
and when degenerated into pus, have too weak an action
on the wax. This inconvenience ha3 been avoided by a
very simple process, Which perfectly answers the proposed
end. A sponge is dipped in water in such a manner as to
be completely soaked : it is then compressed as much as
 possible in every direction with a piece of packthread.          If
the latter be taken away at the end of a certain time, it is
observed that the sponge retains the form given to it by the
compression ; but the slightest humidity is sufficient to
make it resume its natural volume; and in this consists
the merit of this preparation, which was published as new
 a few years ago, though long known, and though employed
 with great success by I. F. Morand, surgeon.
    Cerates are indebted for their consistence and name to
 wax ; it is wax which gives to ointments and plasters that
 apparent homogeneity and smoothness which is sought for.
 Desault was so fully convinced of the danger which accom
 panies the application of greasy substances to the surface of
 the body, that he almost entirely proscribed the use of thesie
 topics.    I have attended too little the lectures of Desault
 to be well acquainted with his general method of treating
 external diseases ; but I have had for colleagues in the army
 several of his pupils, who applied in abundance aqueous
 ¦solution of acetite of lead (vegeto-mineral water of Goulard)
 to all wounds, ulcers, and tumours.           I congratulate myself
 that I have not imitated them, and that I followed the wise
  counsels of my learned Mecoenas*, who recommends the
  substitution of muriate of soda for acetite of lead.          This
  metallic salt, indeed, participates in all the faults so justly
  ascribed to fat bodies.      Like them it forms a stratum im
  permeable to the excrementitious fluids, and gives besides
  to the orifice of the exhaling vesseb an astnetion which
  may occasion a fatal metastasis, or mortal tetanus.

  silver, in all of which the alloy is dissolved in the nitric
  acid. As the price of this acid is high, M. Goetling, in
  place of      it,
                 employs sulphuric acid, which               much cheaper.

               by                                             For each part
  of silver one part of sulphuric acid, and for each part of
  copper three and three-fifth parts of the same acid, are to
  be taken.      The acid, diluted with half its weight of water,
is   to be poured into the matrass on the alloy, reduced to
  small pieces.       An addition of one part more of the acid to
 every sixteen parts of the alloy facilitates the solution.
 Place the matrass in          sand heat, and bring the contents to

J.  he interest which the learned world so justly takes in
the travels of Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland, as well as
my friendship for them, impose on me the agreeable obli
gation of giving an abstract of what     have been able to
                                                  I
learn respecting them, either from their public and private
correspondence, or from the memoirs read in the Institute.
This account will be short, but correct.
   After making physical researches for eight years in Ger
many, Poland, England, France, Swisserland, and Italy,
M. Humboldt came to Paris in 1798, where the Museum
of Natural History afforded him an opportunity of making
a voyage round the world with captain Baudin.      When on
the point of setting out for Havre, with Alexander-Aime
Goujou Bonpland,      pupil of the School of Medicine and
                            a
Garden of Plants, the war which recommenced with Austria,
.
and the want of funds, induced the Directory to put off the
voyage of Baudin till more favourable occasion. M.

to promote the physical sciences, resolved then to accom

 brant to Algiers, to accompany the caravan thence to Mecca*
 and to proceed to India by Egypt and the Persian Gulph :
 but the war, which broke out in an unexpected manner
 in the month of October 1 798, between France and the
 Barbary powers, and the troubles in the East, prevented
 M. Humboldt from setting out from Marseilles, where he
 waited to no purpose for two months.         Impatient at this
 new delay, but always firm in the project of joining the
 expedition in Egypt, he set out for Spain, hoping he should
 be able to proceed more easily under the Spanish flag from
 Carthagena to Algiers or Tunis. He took the road to Ma
 drid through Montpellier, Perpignan, Barcelona, and Va-
 lentia; but the news from the East became every day more
 distressing. The war there was carried on with unexampled
 fury, and he was at length obliged to renounce the design
 of going through Egypt to Indostan. A happy concurrence
 of circumstances soon indemnified M. Humboldt for this
 delay. In the month of March 1 799, the court of Madrid
 granted him full permission to proceed to the Spanish colo
 nies in both the Americas, in order to make such researches
 as might be useful to the sciences. His catholic majesty even
 deigned to show particular interest for the success of this
 expedition ; and M. Humboldt, after residing some months
 at Madrid and Aranjues, set out from Europe in June 1 799,
accompanied by his friend Bonpland, who unites an exten
sive knowledge of botany and zoology to that indefatigable
zeal and love for the sciences which induce men to submit
with indifference to every kind of hardship.
    With this friend M. Humboldt travelled for five years,
 at his own expense, between the tropics, passing over, by
sea and land, nearly 9000 leagues.        These two travellers,
provided   with  recommendations     from  the court of Spain,
embarked in the Pizarro frigate, at Corunna, for the Ca
naries. They touched at the island of Graciosa, near Lan-
cerotta, and at Teneriff, where they ascended to the crater of  •
the peak, in order to analyse the atmospheric air, and make
geological observations on the basaltes and porphyritic schist
of Africa. In the month of July they arrived at the port of
Cumana, in the gulph of Cariaco, a part of South America
celebrated by the labours and misfortunes of the indefatiga
ble Lbfling.    In the course of 1799 and 1800 they visited
the coast of Paria, the Indian missions of Chaymas, and
the province of New Andalusia, one of the hottest, but at
the same time healthiest, countries in the world, though
convulsed by dreadful and frequent earthquakes.          They
traversed the provinces of New Barcelona, Venezuela, and
                                                       Spanish

bellished by the majestic vegetation of the tropic3.
   From Portocabello they proceeded south, penetrating
from the coast of the sea of the Antilles as far as the boun*
daries of Brazil towards the equator.      They first traversed
the immense plains of Calabozo, Apure, and Lower Ore-
boko ; the Llanos* deserts similar to those of Africa, where
by the reverberation of the heat, but under the shade, Reau
mur's thermometer rises to 33° or 37°* and where the
scorching soil, for more than 2000 leagues, differs in its
level only five inches.    The sand, similar to the horizon at
sea, exhibits every where the most curious phenomena of
refraction and elevation.     Without any vegetation, in the
dry months It affords shelter to the crocodile and the torpid
boat

   At St. Fernando d'Apufe, In the province of Variriasi
Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland began a laborious navi
gation of nearly 500 nautical leagues in canoes, during^
which they made a chart of the country by the help or
timekeepers, the satellites, and lunar distances. They de
scended the river Apure, which falls into the Orenoko in
the latitude of seven degrees.       Having escaped from the
danger   of  imminent    shipwreck  near  the island of Pana,>
numa, they ascended the latter river as far as the mouth of
the Rio Guaviare, passing the famous cataracts of Atures
and Maypure, where the cavern of Ataruipe contains mum
mies of a nation destroyed by the war of the Caribs and
Maravitains.      From the. mouth of the Rio Guaviare, which
descends from the Andes of New Granada, and which fa
ther Gumilla erroneously took for the sources of the Ore
noko, they quitted the latter and ascended the small rivers
Atabapo, Tuamini, and Temi.
   From the mission of Javita they proceeded by land to the
sources of the Guainia, which the Europeans call the Rid
Negro, and which Condamine, who saw it only at its?

 mouth in the river Amazon, calls a fresh water sea. Thirty
 Indians carried their canoes through bushy trees of hevei,
 lecytkis, and the lanrus cinnamomoides,     to Cano Pimichin.
By this small stream our travellers proceeded to the Rio Ne
 gro, which they descended as far as the small fortress of San
 Carlos, which has been erroneously believed to be situated
 under the equator, and as far as the frontiers of the Grand
 Para, the captainry-general of Brazil. A canal from Temi
 to Pimichin, which on account of the level nature of the
 ground is very practicable, would form an interior com
munication between the province of Caraccas and the ca
 pital of Para much shorter than that of Casquiare.       By this
 canal also,  such is  the astonishing disposition  of the rivers
in this new continent, one might descend in a canoe from
Rio Guallaga, within three days journey of Lima, or the
 South Sea, by the river Amazon and Rio Negro, as far as
the mouths of the Orenoko opposite to Trinidad, a navi
gation of nearly 2000 leagues. The misunderstanding which
prevailed then between the courts of Madrid and Lisbon
prevented M. Humboldt from carrying his operations be
yond St. Gabriel de las Cochuellas, in the captainry-general
of Great Para.
    La Condamine and Maldonado having determineda stro-
nomically the mouth of the Rio Negro, this obstacle was
Jess sensible, and it remained to fix a part more unknown,
which is the arm of the Orenoko called Casquiare, form
ing the communication between the Orenoko and the river
Amazon, and respecting the existence of which there have
been so many disputes for fifty years past. To execute this
labour, Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland ascended from the
Spanish fortress of St. Carlos along the Rio Negro and the
Casquiare to the Orenoko, and on the latter to the mission
of Esmeraldo,near the volcanoDuida,or as far as the sources
of that river.
    The Guaica Indians, a very white, small, and almost
pigmy race of men, but exceedingly warlike, who inhabit
the country to the east of the Pasimoni ; and the Guajaribes,
of a dark copper colour, extremely ferocious, and still an
thropophagi, render fruitless every attempt to reach the
sources of the Orenoko, which the maps ot Caulin, though
in other respects meritorious, place in a longitude much too
far east.
    From the mission of Esmeralda, an assemblage of huts
situated in the most remote and most solitary corner of this
Indian world, our travellers descended, with the assistance
•f the floods, 340 leagues j that is to say, the whole of the

  Orenoko, as far as towards its mouths at St. Thomas de la
  Nueva Guyana or Angostura, passing a second time the
 cataracts, to the south of which the two historiographers of
 these countries, fatherGumilla and Caulin, never penetrated.
    In the course of this long and painful navigation, the
 want of food and shelter; the nocturnal rains; living in
 the woods ; the masquitoes, and a multitude of other sting
 ing and venomous insects ; the impossibility of cooling
 themselves    by the bath, on account of the ferocity of the
 crocodile and of the small carib fish ; together with the
miasmata of a hot and damp climate, exposed our travellers
 to continual suffering.    They returned from the Orenoko to
Barcelona and Cumana by the plains of Cari and the mis
 sions of the Carib Indians, a very extraordinary race of
 men, and, next to the Patagonians, the tallest and most
robust perhaps in the world.
    After a stay of some months on the coast, they proceeded
 to the Havannah by the south of St. Domingo and Jamaica.
This navigation, performed when the season was far ad
vanced, was both long and dangerous, the vessel having
been in great danger of being lost on the bank of Vibora,
the position of which M. Humboldt determined by the
timekeeper.      He staid in the island of Cuba three months,
during which time he employed himself on the longitude
of the Havannah, and the construction of a new kind of
stove in the sugar-houses, which was speedily and gene
rally adopted. When on the point of setting out for La
Vera Cruz, intending to proceed by the way of Mexico
and Acapulco to the Philippines, and thence, if possible,
by Bombay, Bussorah, and Aleppo, to Constantinople,
false intelligence respecting the voyage of captain Baudin
alarmed him, and induced him to alter his plan.              The
American papers announced that this navigator would set
out from France for Buenos- Ayres, and that after doubling
Cape Horn he would proceed along the coasts of Chili and
Peru.
    M. Humboldt, at the time of his departure from Paris
in 1798, had promised to the Museum and to captain Bau
din, that in whatever part of the world he might be, he
would endeavour to join the French expedition as soon as
he should hear of its having been set on foot.      He flattered
himself that his researches and those of Bonpland would be
more useful to the progress of the sciences if thev united
their labours to those of the men of science who were to
accompany captain Baudin.        These considerations induced
M. Humboldt to send his manuscripts of the years 1799
                                                       ¦

938         Account  of Travels between the Tropie^K
and 1800 directly to Europe,     and to freight a small gaUiol
in the port of Batabano to proceed to Carthagena in the
Indies, and thence, as soon as possible, by the isthmus of
Panama to the South Sea. He hoped to find captain Baudin
at Guyaquil or at Lima, and to visit New Holland and the
islands of the Pacific Ocean, so interesting in a moral point
of view, and by the richness of their vegetation.
    It appeared to him imprudent to expose the manuscript!
 and collections already formed to the dangers of this long
 navigation.    The manuscripts, respecting the fate of which
M. Humboldt        remained in painful uncertainty for three
years, till his arrival at Philadelphia, were saved ; but a
third of the collections were lost at sea by shipwreck: fori
tunately this loss, and that of some insects from the Ore-
 noko and Rio Negro, extended only to duplicates ; but
 this shipwreck proved fatal to a friend to whom M. Hum
 boldt had intrusted his plants and insects, Fray Juan Gon
 zales, a Franciscan, a young man of great courage and ac-i
 tivity, who had penetrated in this unknown world from
 Spanish Guyana much farther than any other European.
    M- Humboldt set out from Batabano in March 1801,
 coasting along the south side of the island of Cuba, and
 determining astronomically several points in that group of
 small isles called the King's Gardens, and the approaches
 to the port of Trinidad.   A navigation which ought to have
been only thirteen or fifteen days, was prolonged by cur-*
 rents beyond a month.        The galliot was carried by them
too far east, beyond the mouths of the Atracto. They
touched at Rio Sinu, where no botanist had ever searched
for plants ; but they found it difficult to land at Carthagena,
on account of the violence of the breakers of St. Martha.
The galliot had. almost gone to pieces near Giant's Point ;
they were obliged to save themselves towards the shore in
order to anchor; and this disappointment gave M. Hum
boldt an opportunity of observing the eclipse of the moon
on the 3d of March 1601.        Unfortunately they learned on
 this coast that the season for navigating the South Sea from
 Panama to Guyaquil was already too far advanced : it was
necessary to give up the design of crossing the isthmus ;
and the desire of seeing the celebrated Mutis, and exa
mining his immense treasures in natural history, induced
M. Humboldt to spend some weeks in the forests of Tyr-*
baco, ornamented with gustavia, toluifera, anacardium ca-
racoli, and the Cavanilksca of the Peruvian botanists ; and
to ascend in thirty-five days the beautiful and majestic river
of the Magdalen, of which he sketched out a chart, though
                                                     tormented

tormented by the mosquitoes, while Bonpland studied the
vegetation, rich in heltconia, psychostria, melastoma, my-
roaia, and dychotria emetica, the root of which is the ipe
cacuanha of Carthagena.
    Having landed at Honda, our travellers proceeded on
mules, the only way of travelling in South America, and
by frightful roads through forests of oaks, melastoma and
cinchona, to Santa Fe de Bagota, the capital of the kingdom
of New Grenada, situated in a beautiful plain 1 360 toises
above the level of the sea, and, in consequence of a perpe
tual spring temperature, abounding in the wheat of Europe
and the sesamum of Asia. The superb collections of Mutis ;
the grand and sublime cataract of Tequendama, 98 toises
or 588 feet in height; the mines of Mariquita, St. Ana,
and Zipaguira; the natural bridge of Icononzo, two de
tached rocks which by means of an earthquake have been
disposed in such a manner as to support a third ; occupied
the attention of our travellers at Santa Fe till September
1801.
    Though the rainy season had now rendered the roads al
most impassable, they set out for Quito ; they re-descended
by Fusagasuga, in the valley of Magdalena, and passed the
Andes of Quindiu, where the snowy pyramid of Tolina rises
amidst forests of styrax passiflora in trees', bambusa, and
wax palms.     For thirteen days they were obliged to drag
themselves through horrid mud, and to sleep, as on the
Orenoko, under the bare heavens, in woods where they saw
no vestiges of man.     When they arrived, bare-footed and
drenched with continual rain, in the valley of the river
Cauca, they stopped at Cathago and Buga, and proceeded
along the province of Choco, the country of platina, which
is found between rolled fragments of basaltes, filled with
olivin and augite, green rock (the grunste'm of Werner),
and fossil wood.
    They ascended by Caloto and Quilichao, where gold is
washed, to Popayan, visited by Bouguer when he returned
to France, and situated at the bottom of the snowy volca
 noes of Purace and Sotara, one of the most picturesque
 situations and in the most delightful climate of the uni
verse, where Reaumur's thermometer stands constantly be
tween 17 and 19 degrees.      When they had reached, with
much difficulty* the crater of the volcano of Purace, filled
with boiling water, which from the midst of the snow
 throws up, with a horrid roaring, vapours of sulphurated
hydrogen, our travellers passed from Popayan by the steep

air of the valley of Patia.
    From Pasto, a town situated at the bottom of a burning
volcano, they traversed by Guachucal the high plateau of
the province of Pastos, separated from the Pacific Ocean
by the Andes of the volcano of Chili and Cumbal, and
celebrated by its great fertility in wheat and the erytroxy-
lon Peruvianum, called cocoa. At length, after a journey
of tour months on mules, they arrived at the towns of
 Ibarra and Quito. This long passage through the cordillera
of the high Andes, at a season which rendered the roads
impassable, and during which they were exposed to rains
¦which continued seven or eight hours a day, encumbered
with a great number of instruments and voluminous collec
 tions, would have been almost impossible, without the ge
nerous and kind assistance ol M. Mendiunetta, viceroy of
 Sanla Fe, and the baron dc Carondelet, president of Quito,
who, being equally zealous for the progress of science,
 caused the roads and the most dangerous Dridges to be re
 paired on a route of 450 leagues in length.
     Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland arrived on the 6th of
 January 180S at Quito, a capital celebrated in the annals
 of astronomy by the labours of La Condamine, Bouguer,
 Godin,    and  Don Jorge-Juan    and  Ulloa; justly celebrated
 also by the great amiableness of its inhabitants and their
 happy disposition for the arts.      Our travellers continued
 their geological and botanical researches for eight or nine
 months in the kingdom of Quito ; a country rendered per
 haps the most interesting in the world by the colossal
 height of its snowy summits ; the activity of its volcanoes,
 which in turns throw up flames, rocks, mud, and hydro-
 sulphureous water; the frequency of its earthquakes, one
 of which, on the 7th of February 1797, swallowed up in
 a few seconds nearly 40,000 inhabitants; its vegetation;
 the remains of Peruvian architecture ; and, above all, the.
 manners of its antient inhabitants.
     After two fruitless attempts, they succeeded in twice
  ascending to the crater of the volcano of Pinchinca, where
 they made experiments on the analysis of the air; its elec
 tric charge, magnetism, hygroscopy, electricity, and the
 temperature of boiling water. La Condamine saw the same
  crater, which he very properly compares to the chaos of
  the poets ; but he was there without instruments, and could
  remain only some minutes.
     In his time this immense mouth, hollowed out in basaltic
                                                     porphyry.

              Account  of Travels let ween the Tropics.       361
porphyry, was cooled and filled with snow : our travellers
found it again on fire ; and this intelligence was distressing
to the town of Quito, which is distant only about four or
five thousand toises. Here M. Humboldt was in danger
of losing his life. Being alone with an Indian, who was
as little acquainted with the crater as himself, and walking
over a fissure concealed by a thin stratum of congealed snow,
he had almost fallen into it.
     Our travellers, during their stay in the kingdom of Quito,
made several excursions to the snowy mountains of Anti-
sana, Cotopaxi, Tunguragua, and Chimborazo, which is
the highest summit of our earth, and which the French
academicians measured only by approximation.            They exa
mined in particular the geognostic part of the cordillera of
 the Andes, respecting which nothing has yet been published
 in Europe; mineralogy, as we may say, being newer than the
 voyage of La Condamine, whose universal genius and in
 credible activity embraced every thing'else that could be
 interesting to the sciences. The trigonometrical and baro
 metrical measurements of M. Humboldt have proved that
 some of these volcanoes, and especially that of Tunguragua,
 have become considerably lower since 1753; a result which
 accords with what the inhabitants of Pelileo and the plains
  of Tapia have observed.
     M. Humboldt found that all these large masses were
  the work of crystallization.       " Every thing I have seen,"
  says he in a letter to Delametherie,
                                              " in these regions,
  where the highest elevations of the globe are situated, have
  confirmed me more and more in the grand idea that you
  threw out in your Theory of the Earth, the most complete
  work we have on that subject, in regard to the formation of
  mountains.       All the masses of which they consist have
  united according to their affinities by the laws of attraction,
  and have formed these elevations, more or less considerable
  in different parts on the surface of the earth, by the laws of
  general crystallization.     There can remain no doubt in this
  respect    to  the traveller who considers without prejudice
  these large masses.      You will see in our relations that there
  is not one of the objects you treat of which we have not en
   deavoured to improve by our labours."
      In all these excursions, begun in January 1 802, our travel
   lers were accompanied by M. Charles Montufar, son of the*
   marquis de Selvalegre, of Quito, an individual zealous for the
   progress of the sciences, and who caused to be reconstructed,
   at his own expense, the pyramids of Sarouguier, the boun
   daries of the celebrated base of the French and Spanish aca

demicians.     This interesting young man, having accom
panied M. Humboldt during the rest of his expedition to
Peru and the kingdom of Mexico, proceeded with him to
Europe.      The efforts of these three travellers were so much
favoured by circumstances, that they reached the greatest
heights to which man had ever attained in these mountains.
On the volcano of Antisana they carried instruments 2200,
and on Chimborazo June 23, 1 802, 3300 feet higher than
Condamine and Bouguer did on Corazon. They ascended to
the height of 3036 toises above the level of the Pacific
Ocean, where the blood issued from their eyes, lips, and
gums, and where they experienced a cold not indicated by
the thermometer, but which arose from the little caloric
disengaged during the inspiration of air so much rarefied.
A fissure eighty toises in depth and of great breadth pre
vented them from reaching the top of Chimborazo when
they were distant from it only about 224 toises.

LXI.     On the Formation of Water by Compression) with
    Reflections on the Nature of the Electric Spark.           Read
    before the National Institute by M. Biot.
Oome time ago, conversing with M. Berthollet on the
nature and properties of heat, I told him I was convinced
that the combination of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas might
be determined without the aid of electricity, merely by the
effect of very rapid compression.           This result appeared to
me to be so immediate a consequence of the observations
already made on heat disengaged from air by compression,
that I thought it superfluous to assure myself of it. But,
having afterwards spoken of it to M. Laplace, he was so
much interested in this object as to induce me to verify it.
I therefore made the experiment, and it completely suc
ceeded.
    I took the barrel of an air-gun the breech of which was
closed by a piece of very thick glass, in order that I might
observe the light disengaged, as usual, by compression. The
barrel was of iron, and was furnished on the side with a
cock for introducing the gas, and its lower extremity to
wards the piston was surrounded by a cylinder of lead, suf
ficiently heavy to accelerate the fall and render the com
pression more rapid.       This apparatus was first tried by in
troducing atmospheric air; but though we darkened the
apartment no sensible light was perceived, because, in all
                                                        probability,

         On the formation          of Water      by Compression.           363
probability, the violent motion necessary to compress with
rapidity prevented us from seeing into the interior of the
tube in a manner sufficiently direct to observe the fugitive
light disengaged by the manifest compression, and which
in other experiments I had myself seen.
    After this trial we introduced into the tube a mixture of
hydrogen and oxygen gas ; gave a stroke with the piston,
and there immediately appeared a bright flash. A strong
detonation took place. The glass bottom was driven out j
the copper ring by which it was screwed fast was broken ;
and the person who held the barrel had his hand slightly
burnt and bruised by the force of the explosion.
    We renewed the experiment, substituting for the glass
bottom one of copper, made of one piece, and screwed in.
Having then introduced into the barrel a new mixture of
the two gases, an explosion similar to the smart crack of
 a whip was heard on the first stroke of the piston ; but a
second stroke given to the new gas made it detonate, and
broke the barrel, or rather tore           with violent explosion.
                                           it,         a
    After these phenomena no doubt could remain                regardin
 to the combination of these two gases, since               known
                                                           it   is            it
is  that which produces the detonation               by
                                                  the immense quan
 tity of heat disengaged when they pass to the liquid state                   :
a   heat which  is  sufficient to reduce them immediately into
 vapour, and to give them in that state an excessive dilata
tion. We did not then think                 necessary to repeat any
                                           it
 more this experiment, which           not free from danger.
                                      is
    The theory of these phenomena                exceedingly simple.
                                                  is
 A rapid compression forces the gas to abandon very large       a
 quantity of heat, which, as          cannot be immediately dissi
                                     it
 pated,   raises their temperature     for     moment, and in that
                                                 a
 state of compression     is sufficient to inflame them.
     We find therefore in the two gases all the elements ne
 cessary for combining them, independently of the electric
 spark or external fire      and        not improbable that all \he
                                    it
                                    is
                          ;
 gaseous combinations which require an elevation of tempe
 rature might be fonned in the same manner without any
 foreign agent.
     This identity of results suggested an idea which         submit T
 to the opinion of philosophers.            It known, and M. Ber-
                                                 is

 pression.     This effect    produced with prodigious velocity,
                              is
 as may be proved    by a   variety of experiments      but, as elec

  364       On the Formation            of Water      by Compression.
  engage it by a compression much less rapid.       We are thus
  led to see in the electric spark a result purely mechanical.
    If  we now compare what takes place in the compressing-
 pump and Volta's eudiometer, the analogy is complete :
  only in the first case we are obliged to confine the air, be
  cause the velocity which we can give to the piston is li
 mited; whereas in employing electricity the particles are
 compressed with a velocity so great, that they can never
 recede with so much speed as to withdraw themselves from
 its effort. The compression then, and also the disengage
 ment of light, or the spark, which is the consequence of
                                                                          is it,
 may take place as well in the open air. But this effect
   local and
        ;       ifthe gases, not being susceptible of combining,
  should return, after each explosion, to their primitive di
  mensions, they would immediately resume in that state of
  dilatation all the heat at first disengaged from them, so that
  no lasting change could be effected in their constitution                :
  and this serves to explain why no alteration has been ob
  served in pure and unmixed gases when subjected to the
  action of the electric spark.
     This light which electricity disengages from gases                   by
  compression would still be disengaged from those most ra
  refied, and in consequence of its extreme velocity          ought  it
  to disengage   it even from vapours,          the experiment were
                                                 if
  made under    a  receiver or in the Torricellian vacuum; for we
  can never form      perfect vacuum with our machines, and
                      a
 even in the barometric tube there            always mercury in
                                                 is                       a
 State of vapour. This vapour, though highly rarefied, still
 contains   a very large quantity of caloric, which electricity
 in its passage ought to disengage by compression but the         ;
 instantaneous increase of elasticity which thence results
 cannot become sensible, on account of the little density of
 the medium whereas
                ;             becomes sensible in denser air, as
                              it
 seen in that instrument called Kinnersley's thermometer.
     These considerations seem to me to indicate that the
 phaenomenon called the electric spark arises from the light
 disengaged from the air           by
                                  compression during the passage
of electricity so that this phaenomcnon merely mecha

It   has often been     remarked as a singular circumstance,
that during the last half century, while the practice of                        .
mechanics and the structure and operation of machines
have received so many and such valuable improvements in
this country, we have onlv had one treatise (that by Emer
son) into which we can look for information both on the
theory and the actual construction of machinery.          Mr.
Gregory,    of the   Royal Military Academy, Woolwich,     has
endeavoured to supply the deficiency just adverted to, and
has now in the press a General Treatise of Mechanics,
which is intended to.be comprised^ in two volumes octavo.
The first volume will be devoted chiefly to the theory, and
 will be divided into five books, under the several heads
 of Statics, Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Hydrodynamics, and
 Pneumatics.     The second volume will be chiefly appropri
 ated to the description of machinery, and will commence
 with some practical remarks on the application, improve
 ment, and simplification of mechanical contrivances ; on
 friction, the stiffness of ropes, the energy of different first
 movers, &c. And these will be followed by accounts, ar
 ranged alphabetically, of about one hundred of the most
 curious, useful, and important machines.       In this latter
 part Mr. Gregory has been promised the assistance of some
 celebrated civil engineers; and the alphabetical arrange
 ment (the only unfinished part of the work) will be com
 pleted in the course of the month of July, when he hopes
 he shall have received the communications of these gentle
 men, or of any others who may favour him with descrip
 tions of new and useful machines.       The work is intended
 to be published before the end of the present year.

  Covibr has publbhed in the Annals of the Museum of

 S68            Natural History. — Fossil Bones.
    He has accomplished this by his usual method, attending
 to the relations which exist between the different parts of
 the skeleton of each genus of animals; relations which
 are not eventual, but which, on the contrary, are connected
 with the whole of the organization ; since from them re
 sult the animal's mode of life, its strength or its weakness,
its agility or slowness ; in a word, its whole nature, which
is thus entirely impressed on the smallest of its bones.
    The fragments of the megalonix hitherto discovered
 consist of some bones of the thighs or legs, and several
phalanges, of which complete toes can be formed.                These
bones have been found in America, and we are indebted
for the first publication of them to Mr. Jefferson, president
of the United States, who thought he saw in them an ani
mal of the genus of the lion. Cuvier now proves that
these remains belong to an animal of the genus of the
sloth.
   He first proves it bythe first fossil phalangium, which form
ed the extremity of the toe of a megalonix. This phalangium,
examined successively on its six faces, exhibits six faces of
the sloth, and excludes all other genera.            The other pha
langes   of the  same    toe  examined    in the  same manner, each
in particular -and independently of the rest, were also the
phalanges of the sloth.         These phalanges, when examined
in their articulations, and the relation of their length, ex
hibit all the modifications by which this genus of animals
is characterized.
    From the perfect agreement of all these modifications,
one may no doubt conclude, with Cuvier, that the toe
formed by these phalanges was the toe of a sloth.
   The phalanges of the second toe, when examined in like
manner, lead to the same consequence.               The insertion of
these toes in the bone of the foot, the form of the facets
where they are applied, and the remaining bones, all equally
prove the same truth.
    If one attend to this inevitable connexion of all the part*
of animals, and their reciprocal dependence, it will not be
necessary to see the other bones of the megalonix, to be
sensible that the same conclusions ought to he admitted in
regard to them. But Cuvier has had the advantage of
being able to remove even the smallest scruple, by inspect
ing a fossil tooth of the megalonix brought from America
by M. Palisot-Beauvois.         This tooth is a tooth of Ihe sloth ;
and this proof     is  equal   to all the rest, since the teeth, by
their influence     on    the  system of nutrition,      furnish the
surest characters     for  the classification  of  animals.

    What Cuvier has proved in regard to the megalonix, lie
before proved in regard to the megatherium. The remains
of that animal found in Paraguav, show that it must have
been of the size of the rhinoceros.      An entire skeleton of
it is preserved in the cabinet of Madrid.    M. Cuvier, em>
ploying the same method and form of reasoning in regard
to these bones, as thesu applied to the bones of the mega-,
lonix, establishes, with the same force of argument, that the
megatherium oughtto be placed also in thegenusof the sloth.
   These two large species, therefore, which have disap
peared from the surface of the earth,' were herbivorous, and
it is difficult to conjecture by what causes they were anni
hilated. The neighbouring species, which stdl exist, are
composed of animals much smaller.
   The captain -general Ernouf, commandant of Guada-
loupe, has written a letter to M. Faujas Saint Fond, dated
21st Messidor last, in which he communicates to him some
observations of natural history, and among others the fol
lowing note :
    " Your son must have informed you, on his arrival in
France, of the tour I made in the island, and that I visited
the famous Cote du Mole, where are found bodies of the
Caribs, enveloped in masses of petrified madrepore.       I en
couraged an active and intelligent individual, with a view
of procuring some of these remarkable skeletons. The
one in the best preservation    I destine for the Museum ot
Natural History.       I have given some negroes, who are
Btone-cutters, to the person who presides over this labour,
which is attended with great difficulty in the execution :
 1st, because these bones of the Caribs adhere to abed of
madrepores exceedingly hard, and which can be attacked
only with the chisel ; 2nd, Because the sea at every full tide
covers the place where they are. I how ever hope to accom
plish my end.
    " These human remains are of a large size; the mass
which must be extracted with them is about eight feet in
length, and two and a half broad, and will weigh about
3000 pounds, but it can be easily transported by sea.
    "Opinions are divided in regard to their origin : some
say that a great battle was fought in this place between the
natives of the island and those of another ; others assert,
that a fleet of piroguas perished in this spot, where the
Sea indeed      breaks with great violence when the wind is
strong; in the last place, others presume that it was the
purying-place,of the natives of the country, and that the

                          ANTIQUITIES.
    M. KaeMe'r, who is on a tour through the Crimea at
fhe expense of the Emperor of Russia, in a letter dated
August 1804, at Syrnpheropol, says, That he has disco
vered several curious old inscriptions of the temple of
Apollo, at Olbia, without which several antient coins
could not have been ascribed to that city.        He had found
above 200 old and scarce coins of that district, among
which was a very beautiful gold one of Olbia, the oldest of
all the known coins belonging to this country; also, at
 beautiful gold figure of a syren, and a gold ear-ring, of ex
cellent workmanship, both of Olbia, 8cc.           This celebrated
antiquary was expected to return to Petersburgh about the
 end of last year.
    Some time ago, a peasant of the Veltschanskoi district,
 in the Ukraine, found, not far from the village of Schikai-
 lof, in ploughing a field, a copper vessel, covered with a
great deal ot rust, and of a form not used by the inhabi
tants of that district.     This vessel contained a great num
ber of antient Roman silver coins, of the size of a silver
 piece of ten copecs.     The weight of the vessel was two
 pounds   and  a  half, and  that of Ihe coins eleven.    The lat
 ter, when cleaned, exhibited heads of Trajan, Vitellius,
 Nero, Anthony, and some of the early Roman emperors.
 The discovery of Roman coins in a district into which the
 Roman arms never penetrated, must appear as extraordinary
 as that of French coins of the fifteenth and sixteenth cen
 turies, found the same year in the Ukraine, not far from
  Pultawa. But this circumstance may be explained, perhaps,
 by supposing that among the Poles who were expelled from
 their possessions about the middle of the seventeenth cen
 tury, by the Cossacs of Lesser Russia, there wefe rich
  amateurs of antiquities, who had collected the above coins,
 and, in consequence of the disturbed state of the country,
  were obliged to bury them in the earth.         The appearance
  of French coins in the Ukraine may be more easily com
 prehended, when it is recollected that Henry III. of France
 was in possession, for a short time, of the throne of Po
  land, and resided in that turbulent kingdom.           It is very
  probable that a great many French coins were carried to
  Poland by his numerous followers, and that they were de
  posited by them in the places where they were found ; a
  conjecture still further strengthened by many of them being
                                                          inscribed

inscribed with the name of that prince, and none of them
being older than the short period during which the prince
of Anjou sat on the throne of Poland.
                       VACCINATION.
  A letter from Copenhagen, dated April 27th» says,
" The King has received with great satisfaction the last re
port of the commission for the vaccine inoculation, and at
the same time resolved, that their labours shall be continued.
He  has given orders also, that the clergy, at baptisms, and
on other proper occasions, shall recommend to parents to
have their children inoculated, and that all medical men,
when they establish themselves in business, shall enter into
an engagement to promote vaccination as much as possible.
According to a general estimate made in the report, 480
pieces of glass, with vaccine matter, have in the course
of last year been distributed ; namely, 230 to different
places in Denmark ; 1 1 7 to Norway ; 39 to the Duchies ;
30 to Iceland ; 30 to Greenland ; 4 to China ; 8 to the
East Iudies, and the rest to Sweden.        In Copenhagen,
during the last year, 1007 persons were inoculated; and in
the whole kingdom 7985 ; making altogether a total of
98966 inoculated in the three last years, since the intro
duction of this praqtice.
                          BOTANY.
   In honour of Count Alexis Razumofsky, of Mosco,
Professor Sprengel, of Halle, has given the name of Ra-
xumovia to a genus of plants belonging to the Syngenesia
Polygamia cequalis jlosculosa; and which stands next to the
Eupntorium and Piqueria.      Its generic characters are :
   Calyx imbricatus, binorus, squamis cariosis laxis.
   Rec. nudum.
   Papp. o.
   Sent, teretia, glandulosa.
  The species is Razumovia paniculata.
  M. Sprengel obtained    it,    means of
                                by            friend, from the
                                                a
herbal of Sir Joseph Banks.
                          DEATH.
   Professor Vahl, who died at Copenhagen on the           loth of
December last, was born at Bergen, in Norway,               on the
10th of October,   1719.   In the year 1766 he             left the
school of Bergen, and entered at the university of         Copen
hagen, where Tie studied  a year.  From 1767 to        1   769 he
                           A    a   2                      resided

  resided in Norway, with the celebrated naturalist Professor
  Strom, and studied five years at Upsal, under Linnaeus,
  whose friendship he had obtained.        On his return to Co
  penhagen, in 1779, he became lecturer at the botanical
             and in 1783 undertook,        by command of the
  Sarden,
    Ling, a tour through Holland, France, Spain, Barbary,
  Italy, Swisserland, and England.         When he returned in
  1 785,  he was nominated Professor, and appointed to su
  perintend the publication of the Flora Danicu.        To qualify
  himself for discharging with more advantage this important
  task, he explored the coasts and mountains of Norway, as
  far as Wardoe.      In the years 1799 and 1800 he undertook
 another tour, at the expense of government, to Holland
 and Paris, where he met with a most favourable reception.
 The French Directory made him a present of that scarce
 work Plantes da Rot, which had been destined for him by
 the celebrated Malherbes, in the time of Louis XVI.
 When he returned from this tour, he was appointed Pro
 fessor of Botany, and obtained the management of the bo
 tanical garden belonging to the university. For some years
 Madame Buonaparte sent him, in a most flattering manner,
 the numbers of the Jardin de Malmaison, as they were
 published, and those of Redoute's Liliacees.        Though Pro
 fessor Vahl had devoted himself to botany, he did not
 neglect the other departments of natural history.        He had
a share in the Zoologia Danico, and the Icones of Ascanius,
director of mines. Cuvier received from him contributions
towards his History of the red-blooded animals, and Fabri-
cius towards his History of insects. During his travels he
collected a considerable herbal, which, by the abundant
contributions of his friends in everv part of the world, in
creased to an uncommon magnitude, and was scarcely
equalled by any, on account of the multitude of plants,
and their proper arrangement. He had an extensive know
ledge of bibliography, and the history or literature, had
read much, and with great diligence.         His last work, Etiu-
meratio Plant arum, was interrupted by his death.

I. Extract of two Letters from Captain Von Krusen-
   stern, Commander of the Russian Expedition to Japan,
   dated   the Harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul,   July  19,
   and August 20, 1801.
 We      arrived here on the 15th of July, and are now ac
tively employed in unlading the ship and taking in ballast.
Agreeably to our original plan, we ought to have proceeded
directly to Japan ; but as it appeared to me impossible that
the business of the embassy could be terminated soon
enough to return in the course of the same year to Kamt-
chatka, as several months would be necessary only for
transporting the presents from Naugasaki to Jedo, I re
solved to proceed first to Kamtchatka in order to unload
the vessel there, and then set sail for Japan, where we
otherwise must have remained the whole winter.      The dif
ference of two months later could be of little importance
to the embassy j while, on the other hand, if the lading,
respecting the value of which I had formed an improper
idea, as from 1000 to 2000 per cent, may be gained on some
articles, had remained a whole year in the ship, the hatf
of it at least must have been lost ; for already some of the
articles have been spoiled by dampness. In regard to my
                                           ¦
voyage from Brazil to Kamtchatka,        which took up five
months and a half, during which, nine days excepted, we
were continually under sail, and which in every respect
•was exceedingly fortunate, I intended to have transmitted
to you a complete journal of it; but as Dr. EBpenberg has
told me that he proposes to send you one, and as there is
reason to expect that his information will be more interest
ing than mine, which would contain rather nautical than
 historical events, I an* happy to think that vou will be in
 formed by him of every thing that distinguishes our expe
 dition from others of a similar kind. The account of our
 residence at the island of Nukahivah, respecting the nature
 and inhabitants of which nothing has yet been known in
 Europe, is the only thing new that you can expect. The
    Vol. 32. No, 85. June 1805,      A2            Sandwich

4                    Russian Expedition to Japan.
Sandwich islands are too well known for me to. regret
having been prevented "by want of time from touching at
them.    The changes, however, which have taken place in
these islands since the time of Vancouver, and which must
be considerable, will be accurately described by capt. Lisi-
anski, as he undertook to remain there at least a fortnight.
It appeared to me of some importance to examine Easter
Island : the information which Roggewein and La Perouse
have given us respecting it (for the Spaniards have published
no account of     proves that
                 it)           has experienced greatchariges.
                                  it
I  consequently was desirous to ascertain whether the bene
volent views of the French voyage of discovery in regard to
this island had been accomplished, and therefore resolved
to come to anchor there for sometime; but the strong
north winds rendered this impossible, or at least prevented
us from doing      without considerable loss of time, — sa
                     it                                        a
crifice which  m  my present situation   could not venture to
                                         I
make. Capt. Lisianski, from whom we separated when wt
doubled Cape Horn, remained some days in the neighbour
hood of it,' but without coming to anchor, and without
having any communication with the inhabitants, who pro
bably, for want of canoes, of which they had some in the
time of Cook and of La Perouse, did not come on board.
My passage from this place to Japan will exhibit no variety,
for on account of the lateness of the season      must use as
                                                      I
much dispatch as possible to arrive in proper time at Nan-
gasaki.   But,     circumstances permit,
                     if                      hope that my re
                                             I
turn from Japan will prove of some benefit to geography.
Journal    of  tlic Voyage from Brazil to Kamtchatka        ex ;
     tracted from      aLetter    Dr. Espenberg, dated thp_
                                  of
     Harbour    of St. Peter and St. Paul, August 24, 1804.
   That we were obliged to remain at the island of St. Ca
tharine from the 21st of December to the 4th of February,
because the Neva stood in need of two masts,              is
                                                         already
known to you. On the 4th of February we hove up out
anchors, aiufcas soon as we had got to       sufficient distance
                                             a
from the land we directed our course southwards.         On the
,25th we saw land at     greatadistance  :   it
                                             proved  to be  Cape
 St. John, the eastern extremity of Staaten Land. This land
is  exceedingly high, and in consequence of the great              di
stance looked like    cloud. People unacquainted with nau
                          a
tical affairs, to'which class our naturalists belong, were exr-
tremely sorry that the ship did not approach the land.             I
myself was at' first in the same situation      but the captain
                                                  ;
 assured me that the winds near the land are very changea

                Russian Expedition to Japan.                  i
ble, arid that gales and calnis often take place. In conse
quence of these calms, vessels are often in danger of being
driven on shore by the currents and breakers, and therefore
it was not advisable without necessity, and merely for the
sake of gratifying curiosity, to run such a hazard.         At
Staaten Land the current is remarkably strong.      I was told
by the captain of an American ship at St. Catharine, that
he was once carried by the current through the strait of
Le Maire in one night, contrary to his intention, and with
out knowing it.     At one time he saw, to his great terror,
the land on both sides } but not long after he found himself
again in the open sea.      If this be true, he was truly for
tunate.
    We did not pass through this strait, but sailed to the
eastward, around Staaten Land.          From St. Catharine to
this place nothing remarkable occurred.       Between lat. 46*
and 53° south, we saw a great number of whales.            One
night the Neva struck against something, which in all pro
bability was a whale. The greatest southern latitude to
which we were obliged to proceed on account of the wind
was 60 degrees.     Whether we really doubled Cape Horn,
or not, in the proper sense of the term, I cannot with cer
 tainty affirm. On account of the north-west winds, which
blow here so incessantly, and with so much violence, the
 captain is of opinion that navigators cannot be sure of con
tinuing their voyage with safety in the ocean till they have
 sailed round the whole of Terra del Fuego. Tt is well kpown
that capt. Bligh, who advanced so far as 78° west longitude
from Greenwich, was obliged to return and steer for the
 Cape of Good Hope, in order to reach the Sandwich islands.
On the 20th of March we were opposite to Cape Victoria
and the Straits of Magellan.      Cape Horn is not entirely
undeserving    of its bad name  :  it was stormy enough, and
the land very high.     How often we experienced storms I
cannot exactly say. The eye becomes accustomed to heavy
seas, and, by habit, the howling of the winds ceases to excite
alarm. During these storms the heavens were filled with
 clouds ; in the course of one of them we were separated
from the Neva, and did not see her again till we reached
the Marquesas, where she arrived three days after us. The
captain intended to remain some days at anchor at Easter
 Island, but the wind prevented us ; and, as we had resolved
 to proceed first to Kamlchatka,      he was unwilling to lose
 time to no purpose. We therefore directed our course to
 the Marquesas.
     On the 6th of May, early in the morning, we saw Hood's
                              A 3                       Island,

6                Russian Expedition to Japan.
 Island, discovered by Cook: towards noon we came in sight
of  the island called by Hergest Rious Island, which belongs
 to the group of the New Marquesas, and which Ingraham,
an American,       the first discoverer, called Washington's
 Island, and Marchand, a month later, Isle de la Revolu
tion. The largest of all these islands, that to which we
 properly steered, and which by Marchand is called Isle
Baux, but in the language of the natives Nukahiva, we
6aw towards evening.
    On the 7th, at noon, we were pretty near to the shore.
Our expectation was on the stretch as we approached               it,
but no canoe appeared which was rather
                        ;                   a   disappointment,
a?, according to the accounts of all navigators, these islan
ders venture a   great way out to sea.    The captain suspected
that the master of some American ship must have behaved
ill to the natives, and that this might serve to account for
their timidity.    At length two boats were dispatched to ex
plore the bay of Anna Maria, so called     by  Hergest.   Whew
these boats were about      a  verst distant from us, we ob
served a canoe making towards them. Our expectation was
now at its height :   we saw the canoe approach the first boat,
and in a   few minutes both of them rowed off together our
                                                         :
boat proceeded forwards, and the canoe, which steered for
the ship, approached the second boat. We could now plainly
perceive that all the people in  it  were naked :  one of them,
who was of somewhat lighter colour, we took to be their
            a
chief or king for we are told
             ;                       by
                                      navigators that the higher
ranks have      whiter colour.   This person stepped into our
boat, and the crew of our ship all exclaimed, " The king
            a
                                                                  !
the king !" The boat and the canoe then both rowed to
wards the ship. We now observed something in the water
near the canoe, which we at first believed to be an islander
swimming; for we knew from books of voyages that they
are very expert at this exercise.      " A man swimming       !   a
man swimming !" was repeated both in Russian and Ger
man.     All hurried to the head of the ship, and one climbed
up   on the  shoulders of another.     On their nearer approach
wc discovered to our regret that the excellent swimmer who
had afforded us so much satisfaction was an outrigger oj
cross pole placed over the canoe, which was not above             a
foot in   breadth, to defend    it from being injured    by  the
rocks. When the islanders got close to the ship, the light-
coloured person climbed up, and, to our astonishment, ad-
dressed us in English.-     We soon found that he was an
Englishman, who had already spent five years in the island:
he was almost entirely naked, having only       a narrow girdle
                                                             tied

                 Russian Expedition io Japan,                 J
 tied round his middle, and was tatooed on the breast. The
 canoe rowed past the ship, and the men addressed to us a
 kind of speech.    The index finger of their right hand was
 always stretched out, and they moved it towards us nearly
 in the same inanner as when a person threatens.      Mr. Ro
 berts, for such .was the Englishman's name, informed us
 that this motion was an assurance of friendship.
    At length one of the natives in the canoe took courage
 and clambered up the side of the ship : he was the king's
 brother.    He was exceedingly timid : sat down at the Eng
 lishman's feet, grasped one of his legs, looked round with
 great fear, and pressed his face, as if ashamed, against the
back part of the Englishman's thigh.      He was followed by
another. We endeavoured to inspire him with courage i
patted him, and called him our tayo.       We firmly believed
that this word signified friend ; but this is not the case.
M. FleurieU, the editor of Marchand's Voyage, must there
fore pardon me for suspetting that he copied the following
passage,
          — Vous etes nos amis, et vous nous tuez, from Bou
gainville. Their attention was much attracted by our fowls,
and some small papajays from Brazil : they squatted down
before them and stared at them with their mouths wide
open. These people have limbs remarkably pliable.        Very
old men will often sit down on the ground without ever
assisting themselves in the least with their hands. They
do not stretch out their legs when they sit, but squat down
with their knees bent like young children. This may be in
Some measure owing to the frequent use of coco-nut oil,
with which they besmear their skin to keep it soft and
pliable.
    Towards noon we came to anchor in Anna Maria Bay. at
the distance of about a verst from the nearest shore 5 which,
however, was onlv a barren rock.      The shore on the other
side, which was about two versts distant, was covered with
beautiful trees, and exhibited a most charming prospect,
especially to people who for thirteen weeks had not seen
land; for the view of Cape St. John scarcely deserves to
be mentioned.     We now saw two groups which had the
appearance of water fowl, not far from the inhabited part
of the coast. As they approached us we perceived them
to be natives ; and among them were some small children *
who sometimes laid hold of their stronger neighbours with
one. hand, again let them go, and continued swimming
alone.    They surrounded the ship, and their number gra
dually increased till the whole place swarmed with them.
They seemed highly gratified, kept continually laughing,
                             A4                           and

and did every thing in their power, by gestures and tricks
of every kind, to attract our attention. They threw them
selves into all sorts of postures, lay sometimes on one side
and sometimes on their back, elevated their legs, 8cc. The
women in this respect did not yield to the men ; and the
object  of their pantomime might easily be comprehended.
When     a piece of a coco-nut was thrown at them from the
uhip, or when any of tfce sailors spat down upon one of
them, the astonished savage immediately became an object
of laughter to the rest. Ihe natives brought us coco-nuts,
bread-fruit, and bananas.      The two latter articles, at this
season of the year, were scarce.      When any of them had
obtained, as the price of their wares, a small piece of iron,
or an old nail, they burst out into an immoderate fit of
laughter; the reason of which, as appeared, waSj that they
thought we had been most egregiously cheated.           When
they received nails from us, they stuck them into the laps
of their ears, the holes in which were so susceptible of ex
tension, that they did not seem to be incommoded by a
large rusty nail.     Mr. Roberts told us that there was a
Frenchman in the island ; but he cautioned us against him,
as a man of a very bad character.
    While we lay at anchor the king or chief of the bay,
Tapeka Ketenue, came to us in a canoe, and among his
retinue was the Frenchman.           As I do not understand
English, I was extremely glad ; but this Frenchman had so
much forgotten his mother tongue, that he was become a
real savage.     All that he was able to say was, — Oui moi
 leaucflup Frangois, Americanish ship, alt dansons la Car
magnole ! He would then laugh like a native of Nukahiva,
 to whom he had a great resemblance, as not only his body
 but tho greater part of his face was tatooed. He understood
English pretty well, as he had been accustomed to converse
 with the Englishman in this language. He told us, that
 he had come to the Marquesas in an American ship 5 that
 this ship had been on the whale fishery ; and that from the
 whales coco-nut oil was obtained.      The person called by
 the Englishman the king, though that title did not seem
 at ail suited to bim, was a man of about forty or fifty
 years of age, tatooed over his whole body, except on the
 palms of the hands and the soles of the feet : he viewed his
 corpulent person with great satisfaction in the captain's
 looking-glass, and was nighly delighted with the present*
 which Tie received.
    Next dav, the 8th,   we went on shore: we were all armed ;
  and the sailors, who had muskets, pistols, and sabres, kept
                                                            tnar

the natives in awe.     Having landed with great difficulty,
on account of the strong surf, the people surrounded us
with every token of joy : they ran round us singing and
dancing, while Ketenue's paternal uncle, who, however,
was always called his father, kept them in order with a
long pole, but without ever striking any of them.          We
entered Ketenue's house and saw his whole family, con
sisting of his wife and daughters. He then conducted us
into another house adjacent, but as it was iaabooed nont
of the natives durst follow us. The place on which this
house stood was elevated, and paved with stones.       We here
remained unmolested, and were regaled with the kernel of
the coco-nut, and had some of the liquor to drink. Ke-
tenue often paid us a visit, and always received a present :
but the natives set so much value on their swine that we
 could obtain from them only five, which were all of a small
size.
     On the 9th we received information that a ship was in
eight; and on the 10th the Neva arrived.         On the 1 3th a
 large body of us, for we were accompanied by some of the
 crew of the Neva, went on shore well armed; and after
viewing the morai, which is here called wahilaaboo, we
 paid a visit to Roberts and Ketenue.     By an accident I lost
 a great many of my papers, among which were three sheets
 respecting Nukahiva.      This, I know, is no serious loss ;
 but I must make an apology for presenting you only with
 fragments.
     I cannot comprehend why the beauty of the women of
 the Marquesas has been so much extolled.         In regard to
 the face in general, 1 shall say nothing ; but their persons
 are altogether ugly.     They are small, and of low stature:
  their arms are proportionally thin, and the lower extremities
  thick and clumsy.     When a female, has attained to the full
 growth,   that is to say,  the age of fourteen or fifteen, her
 breasts are quite flaccid, and hang down.      Children of the
  age of nine or ten came on board our ship, many of whom
  were married.    All those who came on board were quite
 naked. Some of them had a cord tied round their middle,
from which were suspended two leaves, one before and the
  other behind.    On shore we saw several who had fastened
  round them a piece of cloth made from the bark of the paper
  mulberry tree ; and others were painted yellow with the
juice of the curcuma root. They were not much tatooed,
  and only on the arms and shoulders, with some transverse
  strokes above the lip's.
     The males are very fine men, of a good stature, and have
                                                            well

    jo               Russian Expedition to Japan.
   well proportioned limbs.       Though they do not exhibit pro^
   minent and athletic muscles, and their arms are rather like
  those of a well made woman, they gave proofs of very great
   strength. They ornament themselves in the most romantic
  manner.       Many of them have a circle of feathers around
  their head, or of swine's teeth strung on a cord^ on their
  toes and fingers ; feathers, or small bunches of human hair,
  and other kinds of ornaments, around their neck. Most of
  them arc more or less tatooed. The figures are regular, and
  have each a determinate name : some of them are attended
  with particular privileges ; thus, for example, the Englishman
  had a figure on his breast which gave him a right, on certain
  festivals, to form part of Ketenue's suite. Those who have
  not this mark are not entitled to receive any pork.            Some
  of the officers and most of the sailors on board our ship
 caused themselves to be tatooed.          The natives, for the most
 .part, go entirely naked.
      Their chief food is the bread-fruit, which to me did not
 appear to be very savoury : but it was then unripe, and not
 in season.      The tree has a good deal of similarity to the
 wild chesnut tree. They eat also bananas, coco-nuts, vamsy
 pork, fish, and even human ilcsh.              However incredulous
 I was in regard to the last point, it is certain that these
 people, who according to every appearance are so friendly
 and so mild, are real cannibals.             The Englishman, and
 afterwards    the  Frenchman,     who    certainly had not entered
into    an agreement    to deceive   us, concurred  fully in their ac
 counts of this circumstance.          We have several sculls, two
 of which I purchased, which were tho3e of enemies whom
 they had defeated in battle and afterwards eaten.              Somoi
years,    when   the  bread-fruit  is scarce,  a famine  takes place:
and on such occasions many of them kill their wives or
children, and eat them; others undertake a warlike expedi
tion against the enemy ; that is to say, several of them
creep imperceptibly in the night-tune to the neighbourhood"
of the houses of the enemy, or conceal themselves behind
trees or among the grass, and as soon as they discover any
of the enemy, whether men, women, or children, they
immediately attack them, carry them off, and devour thcrru
Even whe"n there is no scarcity, their expeditions against
the enemy are continued, partly because they delight in
than, and partly because they consider human flesh as s
great delicacy, and prefer it to that of their hogs.            They
nght also battles in which one party is regularly pitched
against another.         Their weapons are slings, lances, and
clubs.     The two last arc made of casuarino wood : one of
                                                                these

                   Russian Expedition     to  Japan.               ll
these clubs I have in my possession.            As soon as a coupl*
of the enemy have fallen, the battle immediately ceases,
because something has been obtained to eat. The English
man, Roberts, cautioned us not to place any confidence in
these islanders ; to be always on our guard, and, when any
of them   offended us, to shoot them immediately : he assured
us that this would produce no bad consequences, and that
the rest would give themselves no trouble about it. Such
are the islanders of the South Seas, so celebrated for their
mildness and humanity ! On the most friendly of these
islands they are no better ; and Cook, after being massa
cred, was publicly eaten by the natives of the Sandwich
isles : nothing is clearer, notwithstanding         the pains which
capt. King and M. Fleurieu have taken to contradict it. It
is mere tolly to consider the man of nature, as he is called,
as better and more benevolent than the man who has been
civilized. Fortunately wc had no disagreeable disputes with
them. They feajed us on account of our fire-arms, and
considered us as aluas, or gods. None of them were ever
struck by our shot, though we sometimes fired muskets or
some of our cannon in the night-time, to frighten those
whom we heard swimming around us, and to prevent them
from injuring our cable. >
    These islanders spend their time properly in a state of
indolence, and employ themselves only in dancing or or
namenting their persons.         When any of them set about
making    tackle   for catching  fish, a girdle, or club, the work
is speedily completed.        On the whole, none of them, pro-
pcrly speaking, have any particular occupation.           When we
gave any   of   them   work  to perform,   it  was a kind of festival
to them.      ITiey dragged away for us the wood which we,
bad cut down ; but they were most useful to us in filling
our water casks. I do not know how other navigators
could convey, without their assistance, large casks through
the violent breakers ; but it required five or six of our sailors
to accomplish what one of these natives could do seemingly
in sport. When a large wave came and threatened to dash
the cask and man to pieces on tlx: shore, the latter dived
into the water, forcing down the cask along with him, so
that the wave passed over both ; after which the islander
swam on quietly as before : on the approach of the nest
wave he did the same; and before we could believe it pos
sible he arrived with the cask at our boat.             The piece of
iron which he obtained as a reward for this service he
showed with a great deal of laughter to his companions
standing on the shore, who then burst out into loud laughter

 also. They      are remarkably fond         of dancing, which forrhd
 the principal    part  of  all their   festivals.   The most essential
 part of their   dancing    consists     in  a quivering motion of the
 hands : it is   not disagreeable,        and has in it something sin
 gular, which to me at least was new. Their music consists
 in beating in time with the right hand on the left arm. The
 sound was much louder than we were able to produce in
 the same manner.          When they sing, they clap their hands
 in time in such a manner that the lingers cross each other
 and produce a full tone.            A drum made of fish-skin was
used also on these dancing festivals.
    Their morals are of a piece with the rest.               Parents and
husbands sent their daughters and wives on board our ship
to display their charms ; and a piece of iron or a nail was
 sufficient to remove all their scruples. Those who have
 wives keep also a fire-maker, because this business is some
 what laborious.        This fire-maker is the woman's second
 husband, and he pays great attention to her because his own
interest is interwoven with hers.              I was told afterwards by
the Frenchman that the men are very jealous.                  This seem*
to be a contradiction, but it may nevertheless be explained.
    Their expertness in swimming is really wonderful.
Many of them swam off early in the morning to the ship,
with their forenoon's repast, consisting of coco-nuts, which
they ate in the water, and returned on shore late in the
evening.       Others had both their hands full of different arti
cles, which they wished to barter with us, or which they
had procured from us. These they held up, and swam for
several hours merely with their feet.               Some of them,- tor
the greater convenience, had a piece of board with them.
Thisboard they held before them, and suffered themselves
to be driven on shore by the surf: however dangerous this
experiment may appear, none of them ever experienced any
hurt by it.
    Taaboo is the magic word here, in which are comprehended
all their religious, political, and moral laws.             But a clearer
idea of   the  importance     of   this   word   will be  conveyed by a;
few examples.        When       one   says   that  this or  that place i«
dedicated    to the  spirit  of  his  father,  the spirit  Atua  inhabits
the place, and no person dares to pass over it ; it is taaboo.
When a person gives his name to a tree or to any other
man, the tree or man is taaboo to all others : the spirit
resides in both.       In all the houses the place set apart for
eating   is taaboo  to  the women ; and when any of the na
tives  have   got any thing which they arc desirous to eat un
molested, they sit down in the place which is taaboo.

 Swine's flesh is taaboo to the women ; but they eat human
 flesh when it is given tq them.            Ketenue and his whole fa
 mily were taaboo : those who bore Ketenue's name were
 taaboo.      The case was the same with the Englishman ; so
 that no one durst do him any hurt. There is a particular
 ceremony by which people can make themselves taaboo. It
 consists in binding feathers around the head, dancing and
 singing, and declaring that they desire to have Ketenue's
  name. While this ceremony lasts, they are safe from all
  harm.      One day it was taaboo for all the islanders to come
  on board the ship, those only who brought hogs to the
  ship were excepted.         Those who break taauoo will be eaten
       the first opportunity by the enemy.           This they so firmly
  Enelieve, that it keeps them in order. When it is discovered
  that any one has broken taaboo, he must make atonement
  for his fault by giving presents, such as hogs, &c. which
  the priest applies to his own use ; or he is deprived of his
  land : if he has nothing, he becomes kikino ; he is then
  unprotected, and always in danger of being eaten by the
  enemy.
      Tapeka Ketenue is said to possess a great deal of land ;
  he does not go to war, but there is nothing to prevent him
- if he chooses it.       In times of scarcity he maintains a great
  many    of  the natives  j for, as he possesses abundance of bread
   fruit trees, he has large pits filled with fermented bread
   fruit, which in this state will keep a long time. I cannot
   say much in favour of this kind of food 5 it has a disgust
   ing sour smell, similar to that of fermenting wheat used
   for manufacturing starch. He has no power to command
   any person, but lie and his family are taaboo; and as he is
   able to give maintenance to a great many, for the sea be
   longs to him, and all those who fish in it must bring him
   part of what they catch, he is still an important personage.
    He has also several houses.           Roberts, who was well esta
    blished, had received from him a house with coco-nut and
    bread-fruit trees.

                           To   Mr. Tilloch.
     DEAR SIR,                                           New York, April   2,   1805.
X   inclose you    copy of my letter to baron Humboldt on
                     a
the hurricane of September 1804.                It
                                         intended to furnish
                                                     is
facts for  more satisfactory theory of the American winds
            a
than we possess at present.    My situation at Washington,
the seat of our national government, and the great amount
of ship news contained     our gazettes, have enabled me to
                               in
make the collection of facts very extensive.
                         Yours truly and respectfully,
                                                Samuel L.         Mitchill.
   Mr. Volney, when he was in North America, sought
information concerning its atmosphere, with an intention
of forming       theory of the winds prevalent in the territory
                 a
of the United States. At that time was not able to furnish
                                            I
any facts worthy to be communicated to that able observer.
Since his return to Europe        have had an excellent oppor
                                    I
tunity to collect the facts afforded                by
                                             most violent snow
                                                         a
storm from the north-east, on the 21st, 22d, and 23d days
of February 1802. These were published in the first Hex-
ade, vol. v. p. 465, of the Medical Repository.       From that                         !
inquiry      appeared that our most boisterous winter storms,
            it
accompanied with snow and            north-east wind, began to
                                        a
leeward, and progressed to windward from South Carolina to
Maine, at the rate of about one hundred miles in an hour.
   Since that collection of facts was printed, Mr. Volney
has given to the public
                              " his Picture of the Climate and
Soil of  the  United  States," in two octavo volumes, at Paris,
in 1803.      In  the ninth chapter of this work he has ven
tured to give "      a system of the winds within the United
States."     Herein he has treated of the winds from the
north, north-east, and east; from the south-east and south;
                                                                           from

           Account   of a Hurricane In     the West Indies.      it
from the south-west; and from the north-west, in distinct
sections.      But finding there are some considerations in my
piece on    the  gale of February 1802 which are not contained
in   his treatise upon our north-east wind, I take the present
opportunity      of inscribing it to you. In his short essay upon
the   south-cast    wind  he closes his observations, for want of
more facts, not choosing to supply their place by conjec
ture.     I believe that, by reason of a hurricane which lately
happened in the southern latitudes, bordering on countries
in North and South America which you have visited, it is
now in my power to communicate to you some additional
facts on the south-east wind of the western hemisphere,
and some very important information relative to its north
east and east winds.
     Between the 3d and 9th of September 1804, there oc
 curred in the Caribbee Islands, in the Bahamas, on the
 ocean to the north-east of these, and on the coasts of Flo
 rida, Georgia, and South Caroliua, one of the most de
 structive storms that had ever raged within the memory of
 nun. The agitation of the atmosphere and of the sea was
 so dreadful as to overwhelm and destroy an unc mmon
 number of vessels, cargoes, and crews, both on the ocean
 and in port, and also to work great damage on shore. A
 current from the south-east swept all before it in its pro
 gress from the Caribbces.          It had, however, various turn
 ings, whirlings, and eddies, blowing in the most opposite
 directions, and veering almost all round the compass. An
 other current from the north-east met the former in about
 the latitude of Charleston or Beaufort.           The two streams
 formed for a while an east wind, which continued until the
 south-east gale triumphed by its superior force. This con
 flict of the winds was accompanied by torrents of rain, by
 a retardation of the Gulf Stream, and by such an accumu
  lation of water in the curvature of the coast between Florida
  and North Carolina, as to lay a great portion of the low
  shores and islands of Georgia and South Carolina under
  water.     This storm, unlike the former one which I de
  scribed, began to windward, and by violent propulsive force
  worked its way to leeward.           I have reduced to something
  like method, the relations and facts as stated by navigators,
   and gathered from cotemporancous publications.
      A gale or hurricane of this sort happened in September
   1782, as far north as lat. 42° 15', and in long. 48° 55'. It
  began on the lflth, and destroyed many English ships, be-           v
  longing to a fleet of ninety sail, then off the ranks of New
  foundland, and bound homewards from Jamaica.              It began
                                                                   at

     16         .•          Account   of a Hurricane
     at east-south-cast on that day, and prevailed with greater
     violence than was ever before known on that part of the
    ocean, until about three o'clock the next morning, when,
    without the least warning, it shifted in an instant, and blew
    with such fury from north -north-west, that the oldest sea
    man in the fleet had never seen the like.           The Ramillies,
    the Centaur, L'Hector, the Ville de Paris, and many other
    ships, the spoils of Rodney's victory in the West Indie*,
    all perished.
       The particular accounts will be given under distinct heads,
    classing the occurrences according to their appearance.
       1st, ln.the Caribbce Islands. — On the 3a of September
   there was a hard gale at Martinique, so as to make vessel*
    quit their anchors, drive ashore, &c. A number of vessels
   were driven ashore at St. Croix.          Of thirty-two sail at St.
   Bartholomew's,          only two rode it out.      At St. Pierre's
    (Martinique), Mr. J. Anderson stated the wind to have been
   from the north-west and west-north-west.            At St. Bartho
   lomew's it began from the north-west, then blew from
   north, and at last got round to the south-west.             On the
   3d, 4th, and 5th of September, capt. Henry, on a voyage
  from Point- Petre to Philadelphia, was obliged to lie-to under
  Deseada for fifty-six hours. The gale was heavy, with rain
  and thick weather.
      Captain Jones related that at Point-Petre there was, on
  the 4th of September, the most dreadful gale known for
  twenty years.          There happened to be no vessels at Basse
  terre. But        at Dominique every vessel had been lost.
      On    the  4th   of September two brigs, commanded by cap
  tains   Lovell     and  Glacier,  were driven out of their ports j
  one    at  St.   Croix,  and  the  other at St. Thomas.   The gale
 was so violent as to make them slip their cables with the
 loss of their best bowers. It lasted thirty-six hours, and
 was as severe as any ever recollected. At St. Thomas thirty
 sail were driven on shore.                              ^
      Capt. Smith sailed from Demarara on the 21st of Au
 gust, bound for New York. He was overtaken by the hur
 ricane on the 4th of September. It blew from the south
ward and eastward. After being thrown on his beam ends,
 and losing his foremast and bowsprit, she was rendered so
leaky as to be abandoned on the 8th as a wreck.
      Capt. Boardman, on his passage from Guadaloupe to
Newbury Port, experienced the gale from the 4th tq the
7 th of September.           Capt. Day, on his passage from Ber-
bice to the same place, was overtaken by the gale to the
leeward of Tobago.
                                                               Capt.

                  in the West Indies in Sept.  1 804.              17
      Capt. Mountfort, from Demarara, gave information that
  the hurricane had not been felt there. Capt. Wood declared
  the like of Grenada.
      The gale commenced at St. Thomas on the 4th of Sep
  tember, in the afternoon, and lasted three days.         During
  this time it destroyed forty-two sail of vessels. Recounts
  from the windward stated that the British packet from,Fal-
  roouth to Barbadoes had been lost. Guactaloupc, St. Bar
  tholomew's (where thirty sail were driven on shore), Tor-
  tola, St. Kitts, Antigua (four sail driven on shore, a packet
  foundered at anchor, and much damage done to estates in
  the mountains), Eustatia, St. Martin's ; and, in short, all
  the Caribbee Islands experienced a like fate, with the loss
  of many vessels, and much other property. There were
  four wrecks at Anegado.
      At St. Kitts the hurricane began on the afternoon of the
  3d of September. It blew at first from the north and north
  west. On the 4th it shifted to the south-west, and changed
  frequently to the south, blowing with equal fury in all these
  directions.    It was reckoned to be nearly as fatal in its ef-
'
   fects, to shipping and to property on shore, as the ever-
  memorable one in 1772, and ot much longer duration. The
   quantity of rain which fell was great and sudden, so as al
   most to deluge the mountains.
      2d, In the Bahama Islands. — The gale was experienced
   at Turks Islands on the 4th of September.        It prevailed in
   the Bahamas with extreme violence.         No severer one was
   ever known.      At Turks Islands all the vessels ran ashore
   except two, which, put to sea.      Most of them were totally
   lost.   Capt. Rhodes, who put to sea, returned thither on
   the third day after, having sustained no' other damage than
   the loss of one of his boats.    The sea had broken into the
   salt-ponds, injured the dykes and canals, and melted large
   parcels of the salt in stacks.
      But capt. Waite informed us that the gale was severely felt
   at Nassau, in New Providence, on the 5th and 6th of Sep
   tember. About thirty sail of small craft were driven on
   shore, but not much damage done to square-rigged vessels.
   Capt. Bakus, who was on his passage from Ragged Island
   to New Providence, experience     J the gale on the ;th.     The
   wind came first from north-east, then hauled to the westy
   and afterwards blew north-north-west, and then west again.
      3d, On the Atlantic Ocean, to the North-east and North
   of the Bahamas. — Capt. Johnson encountered the gale on
   the 6th ol September, in lat. 31° 5', and long. 81°.      It first
   blew from the north-east, and from that veered to west-
      VoL22. No. 85, June 1805,         B                    south

 18                 Account   of a Hurricane
 south-west, north-west, and south-west.        It was terribly
 furious, so as to damage his rigging very much, loosen ha
 masts, and render his ship very leaky.
    Capt. King, from Demarara, was invaded by the gale on
 the evening of the 6th, in lat. 21° 5l', and his vessel was
 thrown on her beam ends. He was forced to cut away her
 main-mast.      Lost a man, who was washed overboard.
    Capt. Messroon took the gale in the Gulf Stream, lat.
 20°, on the 6th of September. The wind was then east-
 north-east, and continued so until the 7th, then it shifted
to south-east. It was very severe, though he escaped with
out material damage.
    In lat. 22°, long. 64°, capt. Beard was wrecked in the
gale. It began on the 3d ot September, continued during
the 4th, ana did not end before the 5th.       He and his crew
were taken off the wreck on the 9th.
    On the 7th, 8th, and Qth of September, capt. Jenne,
bound from Kingston, in Jamaica, to Baltimore, suffered
a tremendous gale in lat. 33°, long. 74°.      The wind varied
between north-cast and south-east.
    Capt. Mood, on a voyage from Alexandria (Virginia),
to St. Mary's (Georgia), was, on the night of the 7th, in
the Gulf Stream, to the eastward of Charlston : the wind
there was east-north-east, and so hard as to throw his vessel
on her beam ends. She lay several hours in this situation.
Several of his crew were washed overboard.
    Capt. Miller, on a voyage from Martha-Brae, in Jamaica,
oound for Wilmington (North Carolina), experienced the
same gale the same night, on the inner edge of the Gulf
Stream.     It was so violent as to heave his vessel on her side
as she was lying-to under her jib, to unstep her masts, and
to tear up her deck. In this forlorn condition the crew were
fortunate enough to save themselves by gettting on board
another vessel.
    Capt. Andrews, on his way from Charlston to Nassau
(New Providence), encountered the most formidable part of
the gale on the night of the 7th of September,       in lat. 26",
long., 7 7°. She was thrown on her beam ends, her boom
broken to pieces, her main-topsail and rigging carried away,
and two men washed overboard.
    The brig Augusta was on her passage from Savannah to
New York when the gale began. She had sailed on the
3lst of August, and had progressed no further than the
Frying-pan Shoals, off Cape Fear, on September 7th. Being
there exposed to its vehemence, they stood off shore as long
as she could carry sail j but at half past two P. M. they were.
                                                         obliged

               in the West Indies in Sept. 1804.                19
obliged to lie-to.    The weather was turbulent all the night.
On the morning of the 8th the rage of the storm was ex*
cessive, beyond what any person on board had ever expe
rienced.    It increased until two P.M., and continued all
night with unabated fury; At day-light on the yth she
was about three and one-half leagues from the breakers on
the Roman shoals at Cape Carteret.            They were lucky
enough, to escape these, and to arrive about noon at
Charleston bar, which was one continued breaker/ so that
no pilot could get out. They were forced to cast anchor
on a lee shore, and with the help of two cables and anchors
rode it out until the 10th, when she got into Charleston.
Capt. Davidson, of this vessel, related, that in the fore part
of the 7th, before the gale began, he plainly saw a brilliant
star in the zenith.
   4th, In the Latitudes South of the Bahamas. — Capt. Jag*
gart, who left Jeremie, in St. Domingo, on the 14th of
September, declared, that the gale was not felt or known
at that place at all.     The captain of a Spanish schooner
from Matanzes said, the gale was felt there, but not much
damage done.
   The British armed ships Theseus and L'Hercule took the
gale first in north lat. 22° 127, and west long. 63° 44', on
Wednesday, September 5, about eight o'clock P. M. They
were then about sixty miles north-east of the " Square
Handkerchief," and about one hundred miles north of the
" Silver Quays." The gale was in the beginning from Ihe
north-east, and by degrees came round to the south-east.
Its violence reduced them to the utmost distress.        It lasted
until Friday the 7th, at five P. M.       They afterwards got
into Kingston harbour, in the island of Jamaica.
   Capt. Howe, from Porto-Rico, related, that the gale was
experienced there on the 4th of September, and drove ashore
 every vessel at the„west end.
    Capt. Bennet sailed from St. Thomas on September 3.
 On the 6ih, about thirty miles southward of Porto-Rico,
 he was assailed by a tremendous hurricane.        The wind was
 south-south-east, but frequently varying.          The Jamaica
 papers  of  the  6th  contained  accounts  of   considerable  da
 mage   done  on  the south-east side of that  island by  the gale
 of the 4th. The north side did not feel it.
    5th, In the Latitudes North of Cape Fear. — It appear*
 that the gale did not prevail much to the northward of
 Wilmington (North Carolina).         It was but slightly felt
 there.   On the 9th, a small schooner and periago were
 driven on shore, but not materially injured.
                               B2                              The

  80                Account of a Hurricane
     The brig Wilmington packet, from New York, had bet*
  ashore on the  Frying-pan, but, after taking out the cargo,
  was got off.    The crops in the neighbourhood of Wil
  mington had not been injured.
     Capt. Tilford, on a voyage from London to Baltimore,
  felt the gale on the 3d of September in lat. 39°, and long.
  65°; it blew from east-north-east, and continued in the
  form of a strong and favourable wind until the 8th, when
  he made the Capes of Chesapeake. As soon as the gale
  reached land it grew more violent, and seems to have parted
  into two streams.    By the assistance of one he then ran up
  the bay to the mouth of Patapsco in twenty hours. The
  other branch turned southward along the land toward Cape.
 Hatteras.
     Vessels from Europe, which had not got further south
 than lat. 39°, seemed to have escaped the hurricane.
     6th, On the Continent of North America, and the adjacent
 Islands. — (A) In Florida the gale was excessively hard ; at
 St. Augustine the tide rose to an uncommon height. Of
 nine vessels in the harbour only one rode out the storm.
     (B) In Georgia. At Savannah the gale began on Satur
 day morning the 8th. The wind was from the east, yet
 varying between south-east and north-cast incessantly.      It
 was more dreadful than any that is recollected to have ever
 happened there.     It commenced by slight wind and rain
 until about ten A. M., when it blew with uncommon vio
 lence.    It was accompanied by heavy rain, and went on
 increasing until between six and seven in the evening. It
 did not cease until three o'clock in the morning of the 9th»
 The continuance was seventeen hours. The water rose to
 between eight and ten feet above the level of common spring
 tides.   Houses and stores were blown down by the wind,
 and undermined by the water. Fences and trees were pro
 strated. Ships and vessels were stranded, and left high and
 dry upon the tops of the wharves. Great damage was done
 on the island opposite the town, and on Wilmington and
 Skidawa Islands.     Fort Green, on Cockspur Island, was
 completely levelled; thirteen lives were lost, and all the
 buildings destroyed.    The water was supposed to have riseu
from fifteen to twenty feet above the level of the fort. The
 surface of the land was considerably lowered and washed
away.     One of the national gun-boats was carried about
eight miles from her moorings, and landed in a corn-field
upon Whitemarsh Island.        A cannon weighing 4,800 lb.
was carried thirty or forty feet from its position.   A bar of
lead of 300 lb. was carried one hundred feet.        Cases of
            6                                        canntster

                  in   t!ie West Indies     in Sept.   1804.                  si
  cannister shot were carried from one hundred to two hun
  dred feet, and muskets were scattered all over the island.
      Such was the beating of the ocean against the shores, that
  at Savannah the rain which fell was of a saline taste.             Ab
  experiment made by evaporating some of                    it,
                                                          proved      to it
  be highly impregnated with sea salt          this was probably de
                                               ;
  rived from the spray of the sta. The water in the river was
  Baltish at Savannah, and for fifteen miles above.          Sand was
  blown into the upper stories of houses thirty feet higher
  than the surface of the earth.
     At St. Simon's Island great damage was done                   by
                                                                  inun
  dating   the  crop9  and drowning    the negroes.    The   like  hap
  pened on St. Catharine's, and on the other islands along
  the coast. At Sunbury the bluff was reduced to                perfect
                                                                   a
  beach, and almost every chimney was levelled with the
 ground.
     Mr. Isaac Briggs, who was             the interior of Georgia,
                                          in
 about twenty-three miles from the high shoals of Apalachy,
 on his way to Hawkins's settlement, on Tallapoosa river,
 arrived at the house of an Indian trader there on the 8th of
September here he was detained two days                  by
                                                       severe stormy
 weather. In his letter to Mr. Jefferson he remarks, " that
              :
 sometimes his ear could scarce distinguish an interval be
 tween the sound of one falling tree and that of another."
 The wind was north-east.
     The gale was distinctly felt in the upper country as far
 as it   issettled, which     is to the distance of three hundred
 miles from the ocean.          It was felt there as     strong wind
                                                            a
 which blew down the corn, but was not hard enough to
   rostrate trees.     There    jtblew from the north-east, and
E  egan   on  the  afternoon  of  Saturday  the 8th.    The rain did
 not begin until in. the evening.
     (C) In South Carolina. — At Charleston the gale was
 more furious and long continued than was ever known
 since the hurricane of 752.1           prevailed there on the 7th,
                                       It
 8th, and 9th of September, and exceeded, in violence and
 duration, the great storm of 1783.             began at Charleston
                                               It
 on the 7th, about eleven P. M., and continued until Sunday
morning, the 9th, at one. The wind was at first north-east.
In the course of the morning of the 8th               shifted to the
                                                       it
east, and in the afternoon to south-east.                  lasted for
                                                              It
nearly thirty-six hours, But three or four of the vessels in
 the harbour escaped without injury.             Many were much
damaged,       and several wholly lost.         The whole of the
wharves, from Gadsden's, on Cooper River, to the extent
of South Bay, received considerable damage. Many stores
                                   B 3                                  were

 22                   Account   of a Hurricane
  were washed or blown down, and much property lost.
  Numerous houses were unroofed, and trees overturned.
     On Sullivan's Island fifteen or twenty houses were un
  dermined by the-water, and carried away. Fort Johnson,
  which had been long in a tottering condition, was destroyed,
  so as not to admit the mounting a single cannon.            The
  breast-work    and  pallisadoes  of Fort Pinckney were  washed
  away. From Fort Moultrie, near which the sea made a
  clear breach to the cove, every spot was covered with
  water.
     At Jacksonburgh the crops of com and cotton were much
  injured. The bridges were carried away between Charleston
  and George Town, and so many trees blown across the
  roads as to obstruct the stages for several days.
     At May River all the crops, cotton, and negro houses,
  machines, &c. were completely swept off. The tide rose
  nine feet higher than the highest spring rise. On Hutchin-
. sou's Island many negroes,        and some white people, were
  drowned.      The like happened at Dawfousky and Brough-
  ton's Islands.
     At Coosahatchie trees were thrown across the roads,
  and bridges carried away, so as to prevent intercourse
  through the country ; that village was entirely surrounded
                   '
  by sea water.      In Prince William's parish, Beaufort di
  strict, the storm was experienced in an awful manner.
  The sea formed a junction through the streams of Pocota-
  ligo, Stony Creek, and Huspa rivers, in such a manner as
  to turn Scotch Neck into an island.         Through the fields,
  at Sheldon to Motley, the water covered the plantations
  four feet deep on the high road and causeway leading to the
  meeting-house, rendering the roads impassable.       Great de
  struction was made upon the crops of rice and cotton, and
  many animals of various kinds were drowned.            Nothing
  but the high ground was visible on the roads of the Fish
  pond and Horse-shoe savannas.
     The gale began at George Town (South Carolina), be
  tween three and four A.M. on the 8th of September.          The
  wind was at north-east, and blew with increasing violence
  until midnight.     It then changed to south-south-east, and
  abated little of its fury before the evening of the gth.    The
  rain descended in most profuse quantity the greater part of
  the time.
     The gale extended to the upper part of the country as far
  as the mountains, to a distance of two hundred and fifty
  miles.    It blew from the north-east, and was so violent at
  one hundred miles from the sea board, as to blow down

     From a consideration of all these details it appears that
 the gale extended from beyond the latitude of Tobago, in
  1 2° north, to the latitude of Wilmington
                                                         (North Carolina) ,
 northward of lat. 34°, sweeping a tract of ocean at least
 twenty-two degrees in extent. It probably exceeded by far
 these limits, as capt. Tilford felt it as far north as 39°.                   It
appears also that it reached from the longitude of the wind
ward islands, in 60° west of Greenwich, to the mountains
and back settlements, travelling over a surface of as manv
degrees in that direction.              And its prevalence was, in all
likelihood, much mere wide and diffusive than has come
to my knowledge.
     The gale in the islands blew from north-north-west, and
even from the south-west, but, as it approached the coast,
got round to the eastward, and varied between north-east,
east, and south-east,             It arose to windward in both the
north-eastern and south-eastern quarters.                    In this respect
it widely differed from the great north-east snow storm de
scribed in Med. Rep. Hex. i. vol. 5. p. 465, which began
to leeward*.           It seems to have taken, about four days for
                                                                             the

          did the one which is described in the following account : — But these
snow storrru from the north-east do not seem always to olow the whole length
of the coast between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Bay of Mexico. The
winter of 1804-5 was the most rigorous that had happened since that of
1779-80.     One of the snow storms which occurred during the latter winter,
illustrates at once the fact of their beginning to leeward, and of their limited
extent in certain cases. It also shows that they prevail at different places
with very different degrees of violence. The weather had been intensely cold
during January; the quicksilver had sometimes been as low as S" above 0,
and frequently down to 11 and 14". After this uncommonly severe weather,
the atmosphere rapidly became warmer, the mercury rose to 46" in the
course of a few days, and immcdiatclya thick and heavy fog overspread the
ice on the rivers, and the snow on the earth. 1 hi-, continued until the SGth,
when the cold increased again. About four in the afternoon of that day,
snow fell at Washington, and there was a mingled fall of snow and rain at
 George Town (Maryland).         This storm was felt at New York city in the
fore part of the evening, and not until eight Y. M. by the ship Favourite,
then off Boston harbour.      At Newbury port the newspapers state it to have
twgun on Sunday morning, the 'J7th. By a comparison of the facts it will be
 found that this storm began at least four hours soonei ou the Potowmac than
in Boston harbour.       The difference of time was no less remarkable on its
cessation; for it had ceased so entirely at Washington on Sunday night, that
the weather had cleared up on Monday morning the Math. In New York
it continued until Tuesday morning, and lasted at Boston until Tuesday
 evening. Though the storm was not of long duration at Washington, and
the fall of snow was moderate there, yet it was far otherwise in New York
and Massachusetts.       The quantity of snow which fell in both those places
 ¦/fit uncommonly great.

the south-east current (from the 3d to the 7th) to force its
way along from Tobago and Barbadoes to Augustine, Sa
vannah, and Charleston.              In like manner, by comparing
the times of its commencement along the Fredish coast, it
is evident that the north-east current blew violently near
the Frying-pan shoals at half past two P. M. on the 7th ;
that it began at Charleston at eleven the same night, and
did not become formidable at Savannah before ten in the
morning of the 8th, consequently it did not begin at
Charleston until eight hours and a half after it began at
the Frying-pan, nor at Savannah sooner than the nine
 teenth hour and a half subsequent to its commencement
 at the same place.         Hence, on comparing this storm with
 the one before alluded to, it is evident that this, which had
 its rise to windward, was not near so rapid in its progress
 as that one which took its origin to leeward.
      From all these facts and considerations there is reason to
 believe, that this gale, consisting chiefly, as it advanced
 toward the Continent, of currents from the north-east, east,
 and south-east, was the trade-wind diverted from its ordw
 nary course, and blowing with a force prodigiously aug
 mented over a tract considerably to the northward of its
  usual limits.        The two columns of agitated atmosphere
  moving obliquely toward each other, appear to have met
  and expended their combined forces upon that bend of the
  coast which forms the front of North Florida, Georgia, and
  South Carolina.          At present I know too little of atmo
  spheric movements to determine what was the particular
  rarefying or expanding cause that, on this occasion, put
  the windward air into such destructive commotion, made
  it rush with such resistless impetuosity to leeward, and
  more particularly determined it to quit the intra-tropical
  regions, and exert its whole strength upon a part of the
  Continent so far to the northward as that which lies be
   tween St. Augutine and Wilmington, betwixt the latitudes
  of 29° and 34° north.

  north-east lasted thrice twenty-four hours, while in Maryland it did not at
   furthest continue more than half the time, and certainly with less by far
   than half the violence.

its influence throughout the whole domain of chemistry,
and which tended even to the subversion of some of its ele
ments, would awaken the attention of philosophers.        We
find accordingly, that             it   has become             a   subject of inquiry in
England, France,   and Germany; but the experiments which
I had recommended as the least likely to fail, have been
found insufficient to insure the principal result and have                    ;         I
had the mortification to learn that they have been generally
unsuccessful.     have even reason to believe that the nature

              Platina and Mercury         upon each other.                  27
made upon them, and M. Guyton was the person appointed
for   the purpose. He repeated some of the experiments, and
produced some of his results. His general conclusion was
the same as mine.
    Messrs. Vauquelin and Fourcroy then undertook the sub
ject, and they were led by it to the confirmation of the re
cent discovery of M. Descotils.               The existence of a new
 metal which that chemist had found in crude platina, re
 ceived great sanction from their experiments ; and thus the
 discussion upon palladium has established a fact which will
 be considered as interesting, but which would be much
 more so, were we not already overburthened with substances
 which our present ignorance obliges us to acknowledge as
 simple.
     No sooner were these celebrated chemists convinced of
 lhe existence of a new metal in platina, than they concluded
 that it must play a principal part in the composition of pal
 ladium.       Shortly after this, in a note to a letter from
 M. Proust to M. Vauquelin, in which M. Proust expresses
 his astonishment concerning all he has read upon palladium,
 Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin further declare, as their
  opinion, that this compound metal does not contain mer
  cury, but is formed of platina and the new metal. Whe
  ther this new substance does or does not play a principal
  part in the formation of palladium, could not be ascertained
  at the time my experiments were made, because the new
  metal itself was not then known. But from all that Messrs.
  Fourcroy and Vauquelin have stated, in such of their dif
  ferent memoirs upon this subject as I have seen, the grounds
  of tlieir supposition have not appeared.               May we not refer
  their opinion, then, to that common propensity of the
  mind, against which M. Fourcroy has himself warned us
   with equal justness and eloquence on another occasion,
  namely, a proneness to be allured by novelty beyond the
  bounds of rational belief, and to convert principles which
   are new into principles of universal influence.
      Messrs. Rose and Gehlen * were ¦the first among the
   German chemists who instituted experiments upon palla
   dium ; and M. Richter has also published a paper on the
   same subject.
      The first attempt of Messrs. Rose and Gehlen to form
   palladium was by the precipitation of a mixed solution of
   platina and mercury by green sulphate of iron.                    Their re-

   SB                       On the Action    of
  suit was precisely that which I had observed when my ope
   rations failed altogether, and which of course was the most
   frequent.      This method was repeated twice. The second
   time the precipitate of platina and mercury was boiled with
  muriatic acid, in order to free it from iron ; but the latter
  trial was not more successful than the former.
       Their third experiment was what they have called a re
  petition of that in which I had obtained palladium by pass
  ing a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through a mixed
  solution of platina and mercury.          Their method was the
  following: — They dissolved 150 grains of platina with 450
  of mercury, and added a solution of hydro-sulphuret of
  potash. They obtained a precipitate which, at first, was
  black, afterwards gray ; but the whole became black by
  being stirred. To he certain that all the metal was preci
 pitated, they added an excess of sulphuret of potash, and
               that a part of the precipitate was redissolved. The
    iquor was then filtered, and to that part of it which con*
 Iierceived
  tamed the redissolved     precipitate an acid was added. From
 this process they obtained a yellow precipitate weighing 9 1
 grains ; and 50 grains of this, exposed to a strong heat,
 left 3-8ths of a grain of platina.       They obtained no palla
 dium from that part of the precipitate which had not been
 redissolved ; and the result of the experiment was complete
failure.
      I shall not make any observation upon the issue of this
             since, in this case, the best conducted is but too
   iable to be unsuccessful, and that without any apparent
{>rocess,
fault in the operator. But as it has been given as a repeti
tion of one of mine, it may not be fruitless to examine how
far the repetition was exact.
      I had passed a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas
through a mixed solution of platina and mercury, by which
means they were precipitated together.            My object was so
intimately      to combine  sulphur  with  these  metals, that when
exposed      to   heal they  might      I
                                     (if may     be allowed  the ex
pression) be in chemical contact with it at the moment of
their nascent metallic state ; and as a low temperature suf
fices, as well to reduce those metals as to combine palla
dium with sulphur, I hoped that those effects might be
produced before the total dissipation of the mercury.           How
far my expectation was fulfilled has been stated in my former
paper.
     The sulphuretted hydrogen gas which Messrs. Rose and
Gehlen presented to those metals was combined with pot
ash. Now, in the course of docimastic lectures annually
                                                           delivered

             Platina and Mercury   upon each other.           29
delivered by M. Vauquelin at the Ecole des Mines in Paris,
when he was professor at that establishment, it was his
constant custom to exhibit an experiment to prove that
mercury, precipitated from its solution by many of the al
kaline and earthy hydro-sulphurets,        was rcdissolved by
adding    an excess of them.
    Tt is moreover well known that there is a strong affinity
between potash and the oxide of platina, and also that when
those substances are brought together in solution, a triple
salt, but little soluble, is the result. It was to avoid these
difficulties that I had employed uncombined sulphuretted
hydrogen gas ; for the method adopted by Messrs. Rose
and Gehlen appearing to me to be the application of two
divellent forces, I presumed that it would produce a sepa
ration.     The result of their experiment, which, it appears
from their paper, they had not anticipated, shows the ne
cessity of the precaution I had used.    The operation which
they performed to unite platina and mercury was, in fact,
nearly the reverse of that which they supposed they had
repeated from me, and might have been applied perhaps
With a better prospect of success towards the decomposition
of palladium.
    Messrs. Rose and Gehlen seem, in many parts of their
paper, to question my having fused platina; and inform
Us, that although they had exposed this metal in the furnace
of the royal porcelain manufactory of Berlin, in which
Wedgewood's pyrometer ceased to mark the degree of heat,
they could not accomplish its fusion.      Many of my friends
in England have, however, seen the buttons which I ob
 tained, and which were not few in number. The flux which
I had used was borax. But no mention is made in any orft
of the operations of Messrs. Rose and Gehlen of borax hav
ing been employed.
    In manv of their attempts they obtained an irregular and
porous mass, which of course was of a specific gravity much
inferior to that of platina ; and it might be inferred from
 their paper that the diminution of specific gravity, which     I
 had observed, was owing to the same cause.           It is true,
not only that I had very often obtained such a mass, but
that I had frequently al3o observed no diminution whatso
 ever in the specific gravity of the button which resulted
 from my operations.        But all those upon which I had
 founded the conclusions alluded to by Messrs. Rose and
 Gehlen were performed in the following manner, and have
 been repeated since.      A Hessian crucible was filled with
 lamp-black, and the contents pressed hard together. The
                                                    lamp-black

  30                     On the miction   of
  lamp-black was then hollowed out to the shape of the cftf«
  cible as far as one-third from the bottom, leaving that much
  filled with the compressed materials ; this lining, which
  adhered strongly to the sides of the crucible, was made ex
  tremely thin in order not to obstruct the passage of caloric.
 A cylindrical piece of wood, as a pencil, was then forced into
  the centre of the thick mass of lamp-black at the bottom,
  and the diameter of this rod was determined by the quantity
 of metal to be fused, or varied according to other circum
 stances at pleasure.     In general the axis of the cylindrical
 hole was about three or four times the diameter of the basis.
 After withdrawing the rod, the crucible was about half filled
 with borax. Upon this was placed the metal to be fused ;
 and if it had been before melted into a cylindrical form, the
 axis of the metallic cylinder was placed horizontally, and
 was of course perpendicular to the axis of the cylindrical
 excavation at the bottom of the cover. More borax was
 then added to cover the piece of metal, and another quan
 tity of lamp-black was presssed hard over the whole in order
 to keep it tight, together.     An earthen cover was finally
 luted to the crucible, and in this state it was exposed to heat
 in a forge, in which, upon another occasion, I had, in tht
 presence of Messrs. Hatchett, Howard, Davy, and others,
completely melted a Hessian crucible lined and prepared in
 the same manner.       The fuel which I used was the patent
 coke of Messrs. Davey and Sawyer.          In the present expe
riments I moderated the heat so as not materially to injure
the crucible, and, upon taking it out of the fire, the lining
was generally found so compact and so firm that it remained
in a solid mass after the crucible was broken. When the
metallic cylinder occupied the space at the bottom, it was
natural to suppose that it had been fused; because in no
other state but that of liquidity could it have run into the
mould.      In order, however, to prevent all objections, I had
the precaution to make the hole of a different diameter from
the metallic cylinder, and to observe whether the necessary
change in the shape of the. latter ensued.      If, after such a
test, repeated as often as required, I perceived that the metal
did not vary in its specific gravity, I thought myself autho
rized to conclude that it was exempt from air.
     M. Richter says that he had hoped to have put himself in
possession of a considerable piece of palladium by repeat
ing, with minute accuracy, the process which I had recom
mended as the best.       He precipitated a mixed solution of
platina and mercury by a solution of green sulphate of iron ;
and, after varying the subsequent operations, to which he
                                                       submitted

               Platina and Mercury          upon each other.                   31
submitted the product he had obtained by this method, he
was led to the following important conclusions, amongst
others of less consequence: — 1st, That two metals, the se
parate solutions of which are not acted upon by a third
body, may be acted upon, and even reduced to the metallic
state, by that same body when presented to them in one
and the same solution.
   Sdly, That mercury is capable of entering into combina
tion with platina, so that it cannot afterwards be separated
by fire.  From the first of these conclusions it is evident
that metals in their metallic state are not incapable of che
mical action upon each other; and from the second, that
mercury can be fixed         (it  purposely that use the alche
                                   is                I
mical expression)       byplatina.
   In addition to the chemists above mentioned,                 must
                                                                 I
name two more who in Germany have been occupied                                by
palladium.       M. Tromsdorfl", in        letter to the authors of
                                            a
the journal already quoted, mentions his having made some
fruitless attempts to form this combination            and M. Klap-
                                                        ;
roth, in   a letter to M. Vauquelin, published in the Annates
de Chimie for Ventose, an 12, likewise says that he could
not succeed in producing palladium.
   Messrs. Rose and Gehlen, as well as M. Richter, had
conceived from my paper           reliance on the success of their
                                   a
experiments, which       no  words   of mine had authorized, and
have accused me of enforcing the truth of my results with
a degree of certainty which .their observations do not coun
tenance. M. Richter supposed that the formation of pal
ladium was attended with no difficulty              ;and in general
they  have  laid  so much   stress upon   this  charge, that should
                                                                I
be inclined to think my paper had not been read                 theseby
chemists.      In referring to asain,
                                    it         find there
                                                I            hardly a

page in which       Ido not mention some failure; and no ex
periment, of the very few which occasionally succeeded,                        is
related without my stating at the same time that              was re
                                                                it
peatedly unsuccessful.       As far as regards palladium,                 it   is
rather a  narration of fruitless attempts than description of
                                                        a
an infallible process, and more likely to create aversion to
the pursuit than to inspire           confidence of success.

course of experiments which           had made, as well before as
                                        I
after reading my paper to the society, took me up more
than two months, and employed me from twelve to sixteen
hours almost every day.            had frequently seven or eight
                                   I
operations     inthe forge to perform daily, and          do not ex

as well in the dry as in the humid way, in stating them to
                                                                          have

  have been one thousand.        Amongst these, I had four suc
  cessful operations.    I persevered, Decause, even in my fail
  ures, I saw sufficient to convince me that I should quit the
  road to truth if I desisted.    After all my labour and fatigue
  I cannot say that I had come nearer to my object, of ob
 taining more certainty in my processes.        Their success was
  still a nazard on the dice, against which there were many
 chances ; but till others had thrown as often as I had done,
 they had no solid right to deny the existence of such a com
 bination.     On this foundation none, I believe, have esta
 blished such a right.      Messrs. Rose and Gehlen do not say
 how often their experiments were repeated ; but it is pro
 bable that if they had been performed very often, these au
 thors would not have neglected to mention it. M. Richter
 states his merely as preparatory to more extensive researches;
 and M. Tromsdorfl, as well as M. Klaproth, mention little
 more than the fact.       If the German chemists have con
 cluded against my results, they have done so without just
              and without having bestowed upon them that
 fprounds,
   abour and assiduity for which they are usually so remarka
 ble.
     In this state of uncertainty the compound nature of palla
 dium received an indirect, but a very able, support from
 some experiments of M. Ritter, the celebrated Galvanist of
Jena. M. Ritter had ascertained the rank which a great
number of substances hold in a Galvanic series, arranged
 according to the property they possess of becoming positive
or negative when in contact with each other.             He had
established     the following order, the preceding substance
being in a minus relation to that which comes next :
Zinc, lead, tin, iron, bismuth, cobalt, antimony, platina,
gold, mercury, silver, coal, galena, crystallized tin ore,
kupfer nickel, sulphur pyrites, copper pyrites, arsenical
pyrites, graphite, crystallized oxide of manganese.       He had
the goodness to try palladium in my presence, and found it
to be removed, not only from what I believed to be its con
stituent parts, but altogether from among the metals, and
to stand between arsenical pyrites and graphite. This re
sult led M. Ritter into a new and general train of reasoning,
and induced him to undertake the examination of a great
number of alloys, and of a variety of amalgams. He con
sidered the subject as a philosopher, and his operations were
those of a consummate experimentalist. It would be doing
him an injustice to attempt an extract of his ingenious
paper, which contains a series of the most interesting ex
periments.      I shall merely observe for the present purpose,
                                                             that

              Platina and Mercury    upon each other.         S3
 that it very rarely happened that the mixture of two metals
 bore any determinate relation to the same metals when se
 parate ; that in every case the smallest variation in the pro
 portions produced the most marked effects; and that
 M. Ritter has furnished us with an instrument calculated
 to detect the presence of such small quantities as have hi
 therto been considered as out of the reach of chemistry.
 As palladium presents a very striking instance of the ano
 maly, to which all compounds seem to be more or less sub
ject, by being removed altogether from the series of simple
 metals, this may serve to support the other proofs of its
 compound nature.
     One of the principal objections of those who dispute the
 truth of my conclusions with respect to palladium, is
    rounded upon the repeated failure of all the methods I
f   ad made use of in forming it ; but this cannot be of very
 great weight, when we consider the uncertainty of njany
 other operations of chemistry.       The most simple are some
 times liable to fail ; and the easiest analyses have often given
 different products in the hands of different chemists, who
 yet enjoy indisputable and equal rights to the title of accu
 racy. The progress which we have made in some parts of
 the science has not removed the obstacles which impede
 our advancement in others. We have no method of pro
 ving the truth of an experiment except by repeating it; yet
 this often tends to show nothing more than contradictory
 results, and consequently the fallibility of the art.
     But a recent case has occurred which is perfectly analo
 gous to that of palladium.         A few years ago, professor
 Lampadius, in distilling some substances which contained
 sulphur and charcoal, obtained a liquid product of a pecu
 liar nature. He repeated his experiments, but in vain ; and,
 after many fruitless attempts, abandoned his researches, and
 confined himself to stating the fact to the chemical world.
 Little notice was taken of    it,   and not much interest was
 excited by   an experiment so likely to fail.   Some time after
 this, Messrs. Clement and Desormes obtained the same re
 sult, and attempted to produce the substance second time.
                                                 a
 They performed    a    vast number of experiments; but their
 success bore no proportion to their diligence and zeal.
 They published an account of their process and its conse
  quences, but gained little credit, as no person was fortu
  nate enough to produce the same substance.         Many disbe
  lieved the experiments altogether, and denied the existence
  of such a     combination;    whilst others, less inclined to
  doubt, attributed its formation to fortuitous circumstances
      Vol. 22. No. 85. June 1805.     C                     which

94      Action of Platina and Mercury    upon each other.
which might never     again occur together. In February 1804,
professor Lampadius, in distilling some pyritized wood,
though with a different intent, obtained the same substance.
As he had it now in his power to observe the phaenomena
that attended its formation, he discovered, and has com
municated to the world, a method of producing it which
never fails.    Since his late paper upon the subject, as the
necessary precautions can be followed by every chemist,
Messrs. Clement and Desormes have obtained that credit
 to which their experiments had, in truth, always been en
titled ; and the formation of what professor Lampadius
 terms his sulphur-alcohol is no longer a result of chance,
or accounted tor by being supposed one of those subterfuges
to which human pride resorts, in order to spare itself the
 confession of human weakness.
    The observation of any new fact becomes a matter of
 general concern, and truly worthy of philosophic contem-
           then only when its influence is likely to be extended
 Elation,
   evond the single instance to which it owes its discovery.
 \\  hether water were a simple body or a compound, could
 have been of little importance as an insulated fact ; but,
 connected with the vast chain of reasoning it gave rise to,
 it opened a new field for genius to explore.     If in the pre
 sent case our researches were to be confined merely to ascer
 taining whether palladium were a simple metal or a com
 pound, all the advantages likely to arise from the facts ob
 served during the. inquiry would be lost ; and an object of
 the most comprehensive interest would thus sink into a
 controversy concerning the existence of one more of those
 substances which we nave dignified with the name of ele
 ments. It was in this point of view that Messrs. Richter and
 Ritter considered the subject as far as they went, and a few
 facts are stated in my first paper in support of the opinion
  that palladium is but a particular instance of a general truth.
     By taking the reasoning on this subject, then, in its widest
  extent, we shall be led, I think, to the following conclu
  sion, — that metals may exercise an action upon each other,
  even in their metallic state, capable of so altering some of
  their principal properties as to render the presence of one
  or more of them not to be detected by the usual methods.
  In this is contained the possibility of a compound metal
  appearing to be simple ; but to prove this must be a work
  of great time and perseverance, and can only be done by
  considering singly and successively the different cases which
  it contains, and by instituting experiments upon each.

 and this will be more particularly the case when neither of
 those substances is remarkable for exercising a powerful
 action upon others.         The method of analysis, therefore,
 does not promise much success ; and the labour of syn

 •   Production from Devonshire, consisting principally of
     Alumine and IVater. By Humphry Davy, Esq. F.R,
     Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution*.
                   I. Preliminary        Observations.
  J. his fossil was found many years ago by Dr. Wavel, in
 a quarry near Barnstaple : Mr. Hatcnett, who visited the
 place in 1796, described it as filling some of the cavities
 and veins in a rock of soft argillaceous schist.              When first
made known, it was considered as a zeolite; Mr. Hatchett,
 however, concluded, from its geological position, that it
most probably did not belong to that class of stones ; and
Dr. Babington, from its physical characters, and from some
experiments on its solution in acids, made at his request by
Mr. Stockier, ascertained that it was a mineral body as yet
not described, and that it contained a considerable propor
tion of aluminous earth.
    It is to Dr. Babington that I am obliged for the oppor
tunity of making a general investigation of its chemical
nature ; and that gentleman liberally supplied me with spe
cimens for analysis.
              II.  Sensible   Characters      of the Fossil.
    The most common appearance of the fossil is in small
hemispherical groups of crystals, composed of a number of
filaments radiating from a common centre, and inserted on
the surface of the schist ; but in some instances it exists as
a collection of irregularly disposed prisms forming small
veins in the stone : as yet, I believe, no insulated or distinct
crystal has been found.         Its colour is white, in a few cases
with a tinge of gray or of green, and in some pieces (appa-

   The perfectly white and semi-transparent specimens of
the fossil are soluble both in the mineral acids and      fixed                     in

without leaving any notable residuum     but small part re j          a

its weight.    Water and alcohol, whether hot or cold, had
no effect on the fossil.   When    was acted on  it    heat of                 by   a
from 21 2a to 600° Fahrenheit in glass tube       gave out an

fluid possessing    slight empyreumatic smell, but no taste
                              a
different from that of pure water.
   The solution of the fossil in sulphuric acid, when eva
porated sufficiently, deposited crystals which appeared in
thin plates, and had all the properties of sulphate of alu
mina and the solid -matter, when redissolved and mixed
          ;

solution of the white and semi-transparent fossil in muriatic

nate of ammonia, and therefore        could not contain ahy

in alkaline lixivia showed that it was alumine.               -   ¦
    When the opake varieties of the fossil were fully ex
 posed to the agency of alkaline lixivia, the residuum never
amounted to more than l-20th part of the weight of the
whole.      In the white opake variety it was merely calca
reous earth ; for, when dissolved in muriatic acid, not in
excess,   it gave a white precipitate when mixed with solu
tion of oxalate of ammonia, and did not affect solution of
prussiate of potash and iron, v        . :
    In the green opake variety calcareous earth was indicated
by solution of oxalate of ammonia: and it contained oxide
of manganese; for it was not precipitated by solution of
ammonia; but was rendered turbid, and of a gray colour,
by solution of prussiate of potash and iron.
   The residuum of the alkaline solution of the yellow va
riety, when dissolved in muriatic acid, produced a small
quantity of white solid matter when mixed with the solu
tion of the oxalate of ammonia, and gave a light yellow
precipitate by exposure to ammonia ; but after this, when
neutralized, it did not affect prussiate of potash and iron,
so that its colouring matter, as there is every reason to be
lieve, was oxide of iron.
                   IV. Analysis of    the Fossil.
¦  Eighty grains of    the fossil, consisting of the whitest and
most transparent parts that could be obtained, were intro
duced into a small glass tube having a bulb of sufficient
capacity to receive them with great ease. To the end of
this tube a small glass globe, attached to another tube com
municating with a pneumatic mercurial apparatus, was joined
by fusion by means of the blow-pipe.
   The bulb of the tube was exposed to the heat of an Ar-
gand lamp, and the globe was preserved cool by being placed
in a vessel of cold water. In consequence ot this arrange
ment, the fluid disengaged by the heat became condensed,
and no elastic matter could be lost.       The process was con
tinued for half an hour, when the glass tube was quite red.
   A very minute portion only of permanently elastic fluid
passed into the pneumatic apparatus,          and when examined
it proved to be common air. The quantity of clear fluid
collected, when poured into another vessel, weighed 19
grains ; but, when the interior of the apparatus had been
carefully wiped and dried, the whole loss indicated was 21
grains.    The 19 grains of fluid had a faint smell, similar to
that of burning peat ; it was transparent, and tasted like

distilled water ; but it slightly reddened litmus paper. It
produced no cloudiness in solutions of muriate of barytes,
of acetite of lead, of nitrate of silver, or of sulphate of iron.
   The 59 grains of solid matter were dissolved in diluted
sulphuric acid, which left no residuum ; and the solution
was mixed with potash in sufficient quantity to cause the
alumine at first precipitated again to dissolve.        What re
mained undissolved by potash, after being collected and
properly washed, was heated strongly and weighed ; its
quantity was a grain and quarter.        It was white, caustic t«
the taste, and had all the properties of lime.
   The solution was mixed with nitric acid till it became
sour. Solution of carbonate of ammonia was then poured
into it till the effect of decomposition ceased.       The whole
thrown into a filtrating apparatus left solid matter, which,
when carefully washed and dried at the heat of ignition,
weighed 56 grains. They were pure alumine : hence the
general results of the experiments, when calculated upon,
indicated for 100 parts of this specimen,

           Loss         -        -                 8*4
   The loss I am inclined to attribute to some fluid remain
ing in the stone after the process of distillation ; for I have
found, from several experiments, that a red heat is not suf
ficient to expel all the matter capable of being volatilized,
and that the full effect can only be produced by a strong
white heat.
   Fifty grains of a very transparent part of the fossil, by
being exposed in a red heat for 15 minutes, lost 13 grains ;
but when they were heated to whiteness, the deficiency
amounted to 15 grains; and the case was similar in other
trials.
   Different specimens of the fossil were examined with great
care, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any minute
portion of fixed alkali existed in them ; but no indications
of this substance could be observed: the processes were
 conducted by means of solution of the unaltered fossil in
nitric acid ; the earths and oxides were precipitated from
the solution by being boiled with carbonate of ammonia ;
and after their separation the fluid was evaporated to dry
ness, and the nitrate of ammonia decomposed by heat, when
no residuum occurred.
   A comparative analysis of 30 grains of a very pellucid
specimen was made by solution in lixivium of potash. This
                                                        specimen

             a mineral Production from Devonshire.             3<?
specimen lost eight grains by long continued ignition, after
which it easily dissolved in the lixivium bv heat, leaving a
residuum of a quarter of a grain only, which was red oxide
of iron. The precipitate from the solution of potash, made
by means of muriate of ammonia, weighed, when properly
treated, SI grains.
    Several specimens were distilled in the maimer above de
scribed, ana in all cases the water collected had similar pro
perties. The only test by which the presence of acid matter
in it could be detected was litmus paper ; and in some cases
the effect upon this substance was barely perceptible.
                    V.   General Observations.
    I have made several experiments with the hope of ascer
taining the nature of the acid matter in the water ; but,
from the impossibility of procuring any considerable quan
tity of the fossil, they have been wholly unsuccessful.         It
is, however, evident, from the experiments already detailed,
that it is not one of the known mineral acids.
    I am disposed to believe, from the minuteness of its pro
portion, and from the difference of this proportion in dif
ferent cases, that it is not essential to the composition of
the stone ; and that, as well as the oxide of manganese, that
of iron, and the lime, it is only an accidental ingredient ; and
on this idea the pure matter of the fossil must be considered
as a chemical combination of about thirty parts of water
and seventy of alumine.
    The experiments of M. Theodore dc Saussure on the pre
cipitation* of alumine from its solutions, have demonstrated
the affinity of this body for water ; but as yet I believe no
aluminous stone, except that which I have just described,
has been found, containing so large a proportion of water
as thirty parts in the hundred.
    The diaspore, which has been examined by M. Vauque-
lin, and which loses sixteen or seventeen parts in the hun
dred by ignition, and which contains nearly eighty of alu
mine, and only three of oxide of iron, is supposed hy that
 excellent chemist to be a compound of alumine and water.
 Its physical and chemical characters differ, however, very
much from those of the new fossil, and other researches arc
 wanting to ascertain whether the part of it volatilized by
 heat is of the same kind.
     I have examined a fossil from near St. Austle, in Corn
 wall, very similar to the fossil from fiarnstapie in all its

VI.   Experiments              on Wootz.        By    Mr. David Mushet*.
J.  he following experiments were made at the request of
sir Joseph Banks, on five cakes of wootz, with which he
supplied me for that purpose. As the cakes, which were
numbered        1,  3, 4,
                     2,        were not all of the same quality,
                                   5,
it will be proper first to describe the differences observable
in their external form and appearance.

side. The round or under surface was covered with small
pits or hollows, two of which were of considerable depth                            ;
one through which the slit or cut had run, and another
nearly as Targe towards the edge of the cake. These de-
              the effects, as    suppose, of
                                    I            species of crystal-

even approached        little way upon the upper surface of the
                          a

   The cake was quarter of an inch thicker at one extre
                          a
mity of the diameter than that at the other from which           ;                  I
infer, that the pot or crucible in which this cake had been
made had not occupied the furnace in              vertical position.

Its convexity, compared to that of the other five, was se
cond. Upon breaking the thin fin of steel, which connects
the half cakes together,         found

with steel of the best quality, and           less frequent
                                                        is       very         in
high   steel,  though   the  quality be otherwise   good.
    Upon examining the break with attention,               perceived  I
several laminae and minute cells filled with rust, which in
working are never expected to unite or shut together. The
grain otherwise was uniformly regular in point of colour
and size, and possessed         favourable appearance of steel.

    No. 2. This cake had two very different aspects ; one
 side was dense and regular, the other hollow, spongy, and
 protuberant. The under surface was more uniformly honey
 combed than No. 1 ; the convexity in the middle was greater,
but towards the edges, particularly on one side, it Became
 flatter.  The grain exposed by breaking was larger, bluer
 in colour, and, more sparkling than No. 1. Inl>reaking,
 the fracture tore but slightly out, and displayed the same un
 connected lamina:, with rusty surfaces, as were observed in
No. 1. Beside these, two thin fins of malleable iron pro
jected from the unsound side, and seemed incorporated
with the mass of steel throughout.       Towards the centre of
 the break, and near to the excrescence common to all the
 cakes, groups of malleable grains were distinctly visible.
The same appearance, though in a slighter degree, mani
fested itself in various places throughout the break.
    No. 3. The upper surface of this cake contained several
deep pits, which seemed to result from the want of proper
fluidity in fusion.    They differed materially from those de
scribed upon the convex sides of No. 1 and 2, and were of
that kind that would materially affect the steel in forging.
    The under or convex side of this cake presented a few
crystalline depressions, and those very small ; the convexity
was greater than that of No. 1 and 2, the fracture of the fin
almost smooth, and only in one place exhibited a small
degree of tenacity in the act of parting.       In the middle of
the break, about half an inch of soft steel was evident ; and
in different spots throughout numerous groups of malleable
grains and thin laminae of soft blue tough iron made their
appearance.
    No. 4. was a thick dense cake possessed of the greatest
convexity; the depressions upon the under side were neither
so large nor so numerous as those in No. 1 and 2, nor did
they approach the upper surface of the cake further than
the acute edge.     This surface had the most evident marks
of hammering to depress the feeder, or fungous \part of the
metal, which in the manufacturing seems the gate or orifice
by which the metal descends in the act of gravitation.
    The break of this cake, however favourable as to external
appearance, was far from being solid.       Towards the feeder
it seemed loose and crumbly, and much oxidated. The
grain divided itself into two distinct strata, one of a dense
whitish colour, the other large and blueish, containing a
number of small specks of great brilliancy.         Several irre
gular lines of malleable iron pervaded the mass in various
            3                                             places,

   good steel.
      5th cake. This was materially different in appearance
   from any of the former.       It had received but little ham-
, mering,     yet was smooth, and free from depressions, or
   honey-comb on both surfaces. The feeder, instead of being
   an excrescence,    presented a deep concave beautifully cry
   stallized.
      In breaking, the fracture tore out considerably, but pre
  sented a very irregular quality of grain.     That towards the
  under surface was small and uniform, but towards the flat
  or upper surface it increased in size, and in the blueness of
  its colour, till it passed into the state of malleable iron.
      The break of this steel, though apparently soft, was the
  least homogeneous of the whole, and throughout it presented
  a very brilliant arrangement of crystal, which in other steel
  is always viewed with suspicion.
                       General Remark.
   Uniformly the grain and density of the wootz are homo
geneous, and free from malleable iron towards the under
or round surface ; but always the reverse towards the feedet
or upper side.
                    Remarks in Forging.
   No. 1 . One-half of the cake was heated slowly, by an
annealing heat, to a deep red, and put under a sharp broad-
mouthed chisel with a small degree of taper.        It cut with
difficulty, was reheated, and cracked a little towards one
end of the slit or cut originally in the cake.
   The heat in this trial was so moderate that I was afraid
that the crack had arisen from a want of tenacity, occasioned
by the heat being too low.
   The other half was heated a few shades higher, and sub
jected to the same mode of cutting ; before the chisel had
half way reached the bottom, the piece parted in two in the
direction of the depression made by the cutting instrument.
The additional heat in this instance proved an injury, while
the cracking of the steel in both cases, particularly the
former, was a certain proof of the abundance, or rather       of,
the excess of the steely principle.
   The fractures of both half cakes, now obtained for se  a
cond time, were materially different from that obtained by
the simple division of the cake. The grain was nearly uni
form, distinctly marked, but of too gray     a  colour for ser
viceable   steel. Two  of  the quarters being  drawn   into neat

bars under hand-hammers at a low heat, one of them con
tained a number of cracks and fissures. The fracture was
gray, tore out a little in breaking, but was otherwise yolky
ana excessively dense.      A small bar, of penknife size, was
improved greatly    in drawing down, and had only one crack
in thirteen inches of length. The grain and fracture were
both highly improved by this additional labour; the tena
city of the steel was greater, and it stood firmly under the
hammer at a bright red heat.
   The other two quarters of this cake were squared a little,
and successively put under a tilt hammer, of two hundred
weight, going at the rate of three hundred blows per mi
nute, and drawn into small penknife size.       One of the bars
from an outside piece, always the most solid, was entirely
free from cracks, and had only one small scale running upon
one side.
   These bars exhibited a tougher break than those drawn
by hand \ the colour was whiter, and the grain possessed a
more regular and silky appearance.
                         Forging No. 2.
   One-half of this cake was heated to a scarlet shade, and
put under the cutting chisel ; it was at first struck lightly,
then reheated, and cut comparatively soft; but a small crack
had over-run the progress of the chisel.        Its softness in
cutting  was  attributed to  an evident want of  solidity.   The
other half cake felt harder under the hammer, but proved
afterwards spongy throughout the mass. In the act of cut
ting, a loose pulverized matter was disengaged from some
of the cells, possessed of a shining appearance.
   The fractures obtained in consequence of the division of
the half cakes presented a flattish crystallized appearance,
more resembling very white cast iron than steel capable of
being extended under the hammer. One of the middle cuts
was entirely cellular with crystallized interiors, and inca
pable of drawing ; the corresponding cut of the other half
cake was drawn into a straight bar three quarters of an inch
in breadth and tbreereighths thick, but was covered with
cracks and flaws from end to end. The colour of the break
was one shade lighter than No. 1 ; it tore less out, was
equally yolky, and possessed on the whole an aspect very
unfavourable for good steel,
   The other two outside quarters were also drawn into shape,
 one under the tilt hammer, and the other by hand.         These
 were more solid in the fracture, possessed fewer surface-
 cracks, stood a higher degree of heat, tore out more, and

       One-half of this cake, first subjected to be cut, was found
  softer than any of the preceding, and exhibited no symptom
  of cracking. The other half was cut at three heats, but
  found loose and hollow in the extreme. A considerable
             of the same brilliant powder, formerly noticed, was
  [»ortion
    lere again disengaged.        It was carefully taken up for exa
  mination, and found to be very fine ore of iron in a pulve-
  rescent state, very obedient to the magnet, and without any
  doubt an unmetallized portion of that from which wootz is
  made.
      This curious circumstance        led me to examine every pore
  and    cell throughout the whole fragments.           On the upper
  surface of two of them I found small pits containing a por
 tion of the ore, which had been slightly agglutinated in the
 fire, but still highly magnetic.         The upper surface of the
 present     cake,  close  by the   gate or feeder, contained a large
 pit filled   with  a  stratum  of   semi-fused  ore, surmounted by
 a mass of vitrified matter, which bore evident marks of con
 taining calcareous earth.
      Those who have devoted sufficient attention to the affi
 nities of iron and earths for carbon, will be surprised to find
 that, on this particular subject, the rude fabricators of steel
 in Hindostan have got the start of our more polished coun
 trymen in the manufacture of steel.
      Two bars of wootz were formed from this cake, and
 these, in point of quality, inferior to any of those formerly
                 The appearance of the metal was more varied,
   ess homogeneous, and contained more distinct laminae with
 [>roduced.
 rusty surfaces than either of the two former cakes.
      It appeared highly probable, from the observations that
occurred in forging, and in the examination of the cake,
that the original proportion of mixture was such as would
have formed a quality of steel softer than No. 1 and 2 ; but
as steel of such softness requires a greater heat to fuse it
than when more fully saturated with carbonaceous matter,
                                                   '
it is probable that the furnace had not been sufficiently
powerful to occasion complete fusion of the whole mass,
and generate a steel homogeneous in all its parts.

cakes. Ttvo quarters of this cake were drawn under the
tilt hammer, and one by hand. The resulting bars were
nearly perfect. , A slight scale was observable upon the bar
from that quarter which contained the figure. The fracture
was solid, though not homogeneous as to quality and co
lour, and it appeared pretty evident that a considerable por
tion of one side through the whole bar was in the state of
malleable iron, and of course not capable of being hardened.
It was a subject of considerable regret that the cake the most
perfect and the most tenacious of the whole, in the process
of forging, should get an imperfection which rendered it
 useless for the perfect purposes of steel.
                         Forging   Stti Cake.
    The first half of this cake cut uncommonly soft for wootz,
but by cracking before the chisel still exhibited a want of
 proper tenacity.     The next half cut equally soft, but with
more tenacity.      Two quarters of this cake drew readily out
 under the tilt hammer, and a third was drawn by hand at a
 bright red, sometimes approaching to a taint white heat.
 None of the bars thus obtained were uniformly free from
 cracks and scale, although the fracture exhibited a fair break
 of a light blue colour, and the grain was distinctly marked,
 and free from yolks.
                          General Remarks.
     The formation of wootz appears to me to be in conse
 quence of the fusion of a peculiar ore, perhaps calcareous,
 or rendered highly so by mixture of calcareous earth along
 with a portion of carbonaceous matter. That this is per
 formed in a clay or other vessel or crucible, is equally pre
 sumable, in which the separated metal is allowed to cool ;
  hence the crystallization     that occupies the pits and cells
  found in and upon        the under or rounded surface of the
  wootz cakes.
     The want of homogeneity and of real solidity in almost
  fvery cake of wootz, appears to me to be a direct conse
  quence of the want of heat sufficiently powerful to effect »
   perfect reduction ; what strengthens this supposition much
  is, that those cakes that are the hardest, i. e. that contain
   the greatest quantity of carbonaceous matter, and of course
   form the most fusible steel, are always the most solid and
   homogeneous.       On the contrary, those cakes into which
   the cutting chisel most easily finds its way, are in. general
                                                         cellular,

  cellular,  replete with laminae,   and abound     in veins of mal
  leable  iron.
     It is probable, had the native of Hindustan the means of
  rendering his cast steel as fluid as water, it would have oc
  curred to him to have run it into moulds, and by this means
  have acquired an article uniform in its quality and conve
  nient for those purposes to which it is applied.
     The hammering, which is evident around the feeder and
 upon the upper surface in general, may thus be accounted
 for : — When the cake is taken from the pot or crucible, the
 feeder will most probably be slightly elevated, and the top
 of the cake partially covered with small masses of ore and
 steel iron, which the paucity of the heat had left either im
 perfectly separated or unfused.       These most probably, to
 make the product more marketable, are cut off at a second
 heating, and the whole surface hammered smooth.
     I have observed the same facts and similar appearances
 in operations of a like nature, and can account satisfactorily
 for it as follows :
    The first portions of metal that are separated in experi
 ments of this nature, contain the largest share of the whole
 carbon introduced into the mixture.         It follows, of course,
 that an inferior degree of heat will maintain this portion of
 metal in a state or fluidity, but that a much higher tempe
 rature is requisite to reduce the particles of metal, thus for
 a season robbed of their carbon, and bring them into con
 tact with the portion first rendered fluid, to receive their
 proportion of the steely principle.      Where the heat is lan
guid, the descent of the last portions of iron is sluggish,
 the mass below begins to lose its fluidity, while its disposi
tion for giving out carbon is reduced by the gradual addition
of more iron. An accumulation takes place of metallic
masses of various diameters, rising up for half an inch or
more into the glass that covers the metal ; these are neatly
welded and inserted into each other, and diminish in dia
meter as they go up. The length or even the existence of
this feeder or excrescence depends upon the heat in gene
ral, and upon its temperature at different periods of tha
same process.       If there has been sufficient heat, the surface
Will be convex, and uniformly crystalline; but if the heat
has been urged, after the feeder has been formed and an
affinity established between it and the steelified mass below,
it will only partially disappear in the latter, and the head
or part of the upper end of the feeder will be found suspended
in the glass that covers the steel.

   The same or similar phenomena take place in separating
crude iron from its ores, when highly carbonated, and diffi
cult, from an excess of carbon, of being fused.
   TTie division of the wootz cake by the manufacturers of
Hindostan, I apprehend, is merely to facilitate its subse
quent application to the purposes of the artist j it may serve
at the same time as a test or the quality of the steel.
   To ascertain, by direct experiment, whether wootz owed
its hardness to an extra quantity of carbon, the following
experiments were performed with various portions of wootz,
of common cast steel and of white crude iron, premising
that, in operations with iron and its ores, I have always
found the comparative measure of carbon best ascertained
by the quantity of lead which, was reduced from nipt glass.

     It would appear to result from these experiments, that"
 wootz contains a greater proportion of carbonaceous matter
 than the common qualities of cast steel in this country, and
 that some particular cakes approach considerably to the na
 ture of cast iron.     This circumstance, added to the imper
 fect fusion which generally occurs in the formation of
 wootz, appears to me to be quite sufficient to account for
 its refractory nature, and unhomogeneous texture.
    Notwithstanding       the many imperfections with which
wootz is loaded, it certainly possesses the radical principles
of good steel, and impresses ua with a high opimon of the
ore from which it is formed.
    The possession of this ore fo* the fabrication of steel and
bar iron, might to this country be an object of the highest
importance.       At present it is a subject of regret that such
a source of wealth cannot be annexed to its capital and ta
lent. Were such an event practicable, then our East India
company might, in their own dominions, supply their stores
with a valuable article, and at a much inferior price to any
they send from this country.

JTormica- — Tlie Ant. —These insects, on the pedicle of
their abdomen, have a small vertical scale, a large head,
small eyes, broken antennae, and strong mandibles. Each
species consists of three kinds ; males and females, provided
with lortg wings, and neutrals or labourers, who are desti
tute of them.           The two last kinds have sharp retractile
stings.
     Ants live like bees in large societies.            The government
of both is founded on injustice, ingratitude, and barbarity.
There is no difference but in the choice of the viptims ; in
a bee-hive the males are banished or cut in pieces after they
have given birth to a numerous family ; in an ant-hill the
females are cruelly expelled as soon as their eggs have been
deposited*.
     The strong penetrating emanations which escape from an
ant-hill, have given reason to suspect that the insects which
inhabit it possess medicinal properties, and this conjecture
has often been verified by experience.                   A cataplasm of
bruised ants, with their nymphec, commonly called eegs,
and a portion of their habitation, has been sometimes ap
plied with success to limbs attacked with rheumatic pains,
 oedema, or palsy.            The same epithem has increased the
 energy of the organs of generation.              Baths rendered stimu
 lating by the expressed juice of a large quantity of ants, have
 been found very efficacious in similar cases.                 The desire,
 no doubt, of having at all seasons a medicine proved to be
 so useful, gave rise to the invention of oil of ants.                In re
 gard to Hoffman and Kunrath's water of magnanimity, its
 pompous title was never justified by experience.                 It may be
 readily conceived, that in such compositions the virtue of
 the ants is altered or destroyed, when it is considered that
 it resides essentially in the acid, of which these insects fur
 nish, by mere lixiviation or distillation, a quantity equal to
 half their weight.
      The formic acid, diluted with water, is agreeable to the
 palate, and with the addition of a little sugar forms excel
 lent lemonade. Ardrisson and CEhrne have proposed to
  substitute this acid in the room of vinegar for domestic

purposes. Alcohol, with which it perfectly mixes, ought,
as we. may say, to give it wings; to multiply its virtues, and
in particular, to increase that of rousing the palled organs.
    The formic acid unites so easily with alkalis, that, if a
piece of linen imbibed with these bases be presented to an
ant-hill, you will obtain formiates of soda, potash, or
ammonia'.          I have strong reasons for believing that these
two salts are preferable to the acetites of potash and am
monia ; and if the formic acid has a great analogy to the
phosphoric, as Thouvenel thinks, the formiate of soda
would furnish the healing art with a gentle purgative, much
cheaper than the phosphate.

     Scorpio — The Scorpion.— 'The scorpion               is distinguished
 by   characters     so striking  that  it  is impossible not to know
 it on the first view.         It has a long articulated tail, termi
nating in a sharp moveable hook, which to this animal is
both a defensive and offensive weapon.                   Under its man
dibles there are enormous feelers, terminating in pincers,
like those of crabs. These feelers, which Spielman calls
 cheliform antennae, are much longer than the feet.                     The
 latter are eight in number, as well as the eyes. At the
 posterior part of the breast also there are two dentated
 scales in the form of combs, the use of which has not yet
been discovered*.              »
     Scorpio Europ^eus. —The European scorpion lives like
 the other species in the warm or very temperate climates.
 It is common in Spain, in Italy, and in the south of
 France.        Its length varies from one to two inches : its
 pincers are oval and angular : its combs have sixteen or
 eighteen teeth.
     If the sting of the European scorpion were mortal, as has
 been asserted, it would be a powerful cause of depopulation
 in certain towns, in which I have seen this insect inhabit
 ing without molestation the greater part of the houses, and
 infesting even the beds.             We must not, therefore, give
 implicit belief to the tales circulated on this subject". I was
  stung at Lodi by a brown scorpion an inch in length, and
  of the size of a goose quill. The result was only a slight
  pain, and a superficial phlogosis, which was soon dissi-

internal and external organization seems to remove them
from all other insects except the monoculi, to which they
have a great affinity.       On this account several naturalists
have united these two genera under the name of Crustacea.
But was it necessary to make of them a separate class, and
will naturalists never become sensible of the inconvenience
of those endless divisions which render zoology an inexpli
cable chaos ?
    Crab* have a head and breast confounded in one piece,
which hears five pair of legs, the first of which terminate
generally in pincers.        The tail is of greater or less size, and
formed of different articulations : their eyes are compound
ed-, and supported by a moveable pedicle : they have for the
most part four antennae formed of threads, sometimes
double or treble : the branchiae are very complex : they
 have a muscular heart, from which proceed a great many
vessels ; a stomach supported by an osseous structure, and
 containing three hard stony pieces, which pound their
 aliments.     The organs of generation are double in each
 sex, and have their exit at the bottom of one of the pairs
 of legs.
    All crabs are aquatic, and change their shell every year:
 at the same time also they throw up the stones from their
 stomach*.
    The cray-fish {Cancer astacus) is commonly served up at
 our tables.
    The great horse crab (Cancer pagurus), the lobster (Can
 cer gammarus), the prawn (Cancer serratus), the white
 shrimp (Cancer squilla), and the spiny lobster (Cancer
 komarus), have a more delicate taste.             They all furnish an
abundant quantity of gelatine, which renders broth nutritive
 and detergent. It is by the first of these properties that it
 acts in phthisis : it develops the second in cutaneous dis-
 •ases, and Pinel recommends it in leprosy f.               1 am of opi

 sometimes just thrown out against the humoral medicine, it
 rests on a real foundation ; and that in a multitude of cases
 every thing ought to be referred to a vitiated state of the
 humours J.
    At the period when the cray-fish casts its shell, to
 assume a new one, there are found on the sides of its
 stomach, between the membranes of -that viscus, two cal
  careous concretions, which are employed as absorbents,

lar virtue is ascribed to the pincers of the larger species,
Cancer pagurus, gammarusy &c. These inert and hurtful
substances     have, however, been long since proscribed by
sound chemistry.      Were it proved that a morbific affection
was produced by the presence of an acid in the primary or
secondary passages, pure and not carbonated magnesia
would be the most proper remedy.
    Oniscus — The Ivbod-loitse. — The body of this insect is
oval, and formed of articulated segments, the first seven of
which have each a pair of legs ; their eyes are compounded
and fixed, and their antenna; setaceous.

which is terminated by two filiform appendages, or the
armadillo, which is indebted for its denomination to the

is the one chosen for medicinal purposes.
  . The trials made by Lister, Neumann,       and Cartheuser,
to determine the constituent principles of wood-lice, were
only rude sketches. Thouvenel threw some light on the
chemical analyses of these insects, and on the use of them
in the art of healing. When distilled alone in a balneum
marias, they gave a water sufficiently alkaline to render
syrup of violets greenish. Being then treated with water
and alcohol, they furnished a fourth part of their weight of
extractive and cirous matter, which ether separated from
each other, dissolving the latter without touching          the
former.      The expressed juice of wood-lice contains muri
ates of lime and of potash, in which reside the dissolving
and aperient qualities, which cannot be refused to these
insects. Dioscorides and Entmuller extol the efficacy of
them in obstructions of the abdominal viscera. Riviere has
confirmed the utility of them in arthritic affections, foul
ulcers, and tumors of the breasts of women.           They are
killed by the steam of alcohol, and are then dried and pul
verised. This preparation is superfluous, and even preju
dicial, when these insects are employed in disorders of the
breast.     I have observed the good effects of the juice of
these insects in two chronic pulmonary catarrhs.           The
preparation I prescribed in spoonfuls was as follows :
    ft. Infusion of creeping ivy five ounces.

                           [Concluded from p. 362.]
JDciung         his residence at Quito M. Humboldt received k
letter from the French National Institute, informing him
that captain Baudin had set out for New Holland, pursuing
an easterly course by the Cape of Good Hope.             He found
it necessary therefore to give up all idea of joining him,
though bur travellers had entertained this hope for thirteen
months, by which means they lost the advantage of an easy
            from the Havannah to Mexico and the Philippines,
fassage
  t had made them travel by sea and by land more than a
thousand leagues to the south, exposed to every extreme of
temperature,         from summits covered with perpetual snow to
the bottom of those profound ravines where the thermo*
meter stands night and day between 25° and 31° of Reau
mur. But, accustomed to disappointments of every kind,
thev readily consoled themselves on account of their fate.
They Were once more sensible that man must depend only
on what can be produced by his own energy ; and Baudin's
voyage, or rather the false intelligence of the direction he
bad taken, made them traverse immense countries towards
which no naturalist perhaps would otherwise have turned
his researches. M. Humboldt being then resolved to pursue
his own expedition, proceeded from Quito towards the river
Amazon and Lima, with a view of making the important
observation of the transit of Mercury over the sun's disk.
    Our travellers first visited the ruins of Lactacunga,
Hambato,          and Riobamba,       a district convulsed by the
dreadful earthquake of the year 1797. They passed through
the snows of Assonay to Cuenca, and thence with great
difficulty, on account of the carriage of their instruments
and packages of plants, by the paramo of Saraguro to
Loxa. It was here, in the forests of Gonzanama and Mai
lacatcs, that they studied the valuable tree which first made
known to man the febrifuge qualities of cinchona.              The
extent of the territory which their travels embraced, gave
them an advantage never before enjoyed by any botanist,
namely, that of comparing the different kinds of cinchona
of Santa Fe, Popayan, Cuenca, Loxa, and Jaen, with the
cuspa and a/spare of Cumana and Rio Carony, the latter
of which, named improperly Cortex angusturce, appears to

alternate leaves.
    From Loxa they entered Peru by Ayavaca and Gounca-
bamba, traversing the high summit of the Andes, to pro
ceed to the river Amazon.        They had to pass thirty-five
times in the course of two days the river Chamaya, some
times on a raft, and sometimes by fording.        They saw the
superb   remains   of the  causeway  of Ynga,   which  may be
compared to the most beautiful causeways in France and
Spain, and which proceeds on the porphyrinic ridge of the
Andes, from Cusco to Assonay, and is furnished with
tambo (inns) and public fountains.       They then embarked
on a raft of ochroma, at the small Indian village of Cha
maya, and descended by the river of the same name, to that
of the Amazons, determining by the culmination of several
Btars, and by the difference or time, the astronomical posi
tion of that confluence.
    La Condamine, when he returned from Quito to Para and
to France, embarked on the river Amazon only below
Quebrada de Chucunga; he therefore observed the longi
tude only at the mouth of the Bio Napo.          M. Humboldt
endeavoured to supply this deficiency in the beautiful chart
of the French astronomer, navigating the river Amazon as
far as the cataracts of Rentema, and forming at Tomepcnda,
the capital of the province of Jaen de Bracamorros, a de
tailed plan of that unknown part of the Upper Maranon,
both from his own observations and the information ob
 tained from Indian travellers. M. Bonpland in the mean
 time made an interesting excursion to the forests around
 the town of Jaen, where he discovered new species of cin
 chona ; and after greatly suffering from the scorching heat
 of these solitary districts, and admiring a vegetation rich in
 new species of Jacqulnia, Godoya, Porterla, Bougaiuvilleat
 Collelta, and Pisonia, our three travellers crossed for the
 fifth time the cordillera of the Andes by Montan, in order
 to return to Peru.
     They fixed the point where Borda's compass indicated the
 zero of the magnetic inclination, though at 7 degrees of
 south latitude.    They examined the mines of Hualguayoc,
 where native silver is found in large masses at the height of
 8000 toises above the level of the sea, in mines, some
 metalliferous veins of which contain petrified shells, and
 which, with those of Huantajayo, are at present the richest
 of Peru. From Caxamarca, celebrated by its thermal
 waters, and by the ruins of the palace of Atahualpa, they
 descended to Truxillo, in the neighbourhood of which are

   found vestiges of the immense Peruvian city of Mansiche,
   ornamented with pyramids, in one of which was discovered,
   in the eighteenth century, hammered gold to the value of
   more than 150,0001. sterling.
       On this western declivity of the Andes our travellers en
  joyed, for the first time, the striking view of the Pacific
   Ocean ; and from that long and narrow valley, the inhabi
   tants of which are unacquainted with rain or thunder, and
   where, under a bappy climate, the most absolute power,
   arid that most dangerous to man, theocracy itself, seems
   to imitate the beneficence of nature.
       From Truxillo they followed the dry coasts of the South
   Sea, formerly watered and rendered fertile by the canals of
'
   the Ynga j nothing of which remains but melancholy-
   ruins. Vvhen they arrived, by Santa and Guarmey, at Lima,
   they remained some months in that interesting capital of
   Peru, the inhabitants of which are distinguished by the
   vivacity of their genius and the liberality of their sentiments.
   M. Humboldt had the happiness of observing, in a pretty
   complete manner, at the port of Callao at Lima, the end
   of the transit of Mercury : a circumstance the more fortu
   nate, as the thick fog which prevails at that season often
   prevents the sun's disk from being seen for twenty days.
   He was astonished to find in Peru, at so immense a distance
   from Europe, the newest literary productions in chemistry,
   mathematics, and physiology ; and he admired the great
   intellectual activity of a people whom tbe Europeans accuse
   of indolence and luxury.
       In the month of January 1803 our travellers embarked in
   the king's corvette La Castora for Guyaquil ; a passage which
   is performed, by the help of the winds and the currents, in
   three or four days, whereas the return from Guyaquil re
   quires as many months.        In the former port, situated on
   the banks of an immense river, the vegetation of which in
   palms, piumeria, talerncemontava, and scitamineee, is ma
  jestic beyond all description.      They heard growling every
   moment the volcano of Catopaxi, which made a dreadful
   explosion on the 6th of January 1803.
      They immediately set out that they might have a nearer
   view of its ravages, and to visit it a second time ; but the
  unexpected news of the sudden departure of the Atlanta
   frigate, and the fear of not finding another opportunity for
   several months, obliged them to return, after being tor
  mented for seven days by the mosquitoes of Babaoyo and
  Ugibar.        .'7
      They bad   a  favourable navigation,   of thirty days on the
                                                             Pacific

  Pacific Ocean to Acapulco, the western port of the king
 dom of New Spain, celebrated by the beauty of its bason,
  which appears to have been cut out in the granite rocks by
  the violence of earthquakes ; celebrated also by the wretch
  edness of its inhabitants, who see there millions of piastres
  embarked for the Philippines and China ; and unfortunately
  celebrated by a climate as scorching as mortal.
      M. Humboldt intended at first to stay only a few months
  in Mexico, and to hasten his return to Europe ; his travels
  had already been too long ; the instruments, and particularly
  the time-keepers, began to be gradually deranged ; and all
  the efforts he had made to get new ones had proved fruit
  less.    Besides, the progress of the sciences in Europe s
  so rapid, that in travels of more than four years a traveller
 may see certain phenomena under points of view which are
  no longer interesting when his labours arc presented to the
  public.
       M. Humboldt nattered himself with the hope of being
   in England in the months of August or September 1803;
   but the attraction of a country so beautiful and so variegated
  as the kingdom of New Spam, the great hospitality of its
   inhabitants, and the dread of the yellow fever at Vera Cruz,
   which cuts off almost all those who between the months
. «f June and October come down from the mountains,            in
   duced him to defer his departure till the middle of winter.
   After having occupied his attention with plants, the state
   of the air, the hourly variations of the barometer, the phae-
   nomena of the magnet, and in particular the longitude of
    Acapulco, a port in which two able astronomers, Messrs.
    Espinosa and Galeano, had before made observations, our
    travellers set out for Mexico. They ascended gradually from
    the scorching valleys of Mescala and Papagayo, where the
    thermometer in the shade stood at 32° of Reaumur, and
    where they passed the river on the fruit of the crescenlia
   pinnata, bound together bv ropes of agave, to the high
   plateaux of Chilpantzingo, Tehudotepec and Tasco.
       At these heights of six or seven hundred toises above the
    level of the sea, in consequence of the mildness and cool
    ness of the climate, the oak, cypress, fir, and fern, begin
    to be seen, together with the kinds of grain cultivated in
   Europe.
       Having spent some time in the mines of Tasco, the oldest
    and formerly the richest in the kingdom, and having studied
    the nature of those silvery veins which pass from the hard
    calcareous rock to micaceous schist and inclose foliaccous
    gypsum, they ascended, by Cuernaraca and the cold regions
                                                                of

which have         decreased      in size    since    the  Spaniards, to lessen

a multitude of Indian hamlets, and without doubt may be
compared to the finest cities of Europe.                      It is distinguished
also by its large scientific establishments, which may vie
with several of the old continent, and to which there are
none similar in the new.
    The botanical garden, directed by that excellent botanist
M. Cervantes ; the expedition of M. Sesse, who is accom
panied by able draftsmen, and whose object is to acquire
a knowledge of the plants of Mexico ; the School of Mines,
established°by the lioerality of the corps of miners and by
the creative genius of M. d'Elhuyar; and the Academy of
 Painting, Engraving, and Sculpture; all tend to diffuse
 taste and knowledge in a country the riches of which
 seem to oppose intellectual culture.
     With instruments taken from the excellent collection of
 the School of Mines, M. Humboldt determined the lon
 gitude of Mexico, in which there was an error of nearly
 two degrees, as h:is been confirmed by corresponding ob
 servations of the satellites made at the Havannah.
     After a stay of some months in that capital, our travellers
 visited the celebrated mines of Moran and Real-del-Monte,
 where the vein of La Biscayna has given millions of piastres
 to the counts De Regla ; they examined the obsidian stones
 of Oyamel, which form strata in the pearl stone and por
 phyry, and served as knives to the anticnt Mexicans.                            The

Montezuma.        They then passed Queretaro, by Salamanca
and the fertile plains of Yrapuato, to Guanaxuato, a town
which contains 50,000 inhabitants: it is situated in a narrow
defile, and celebrated by its mines, which are of far greater
consequence than tho9e of Potosi.
    The mine of count de Valenciana, which has given birth
to a considerable town on a hill which thirty years ago
scarcely afforded pasture to goats, is already 1840 feet in
perpendicular depth.       It is the iVepcst and richest in the
world ; the annual profit of the proprietors having nevet
been less than three millions of livrcs, and it sometimes
 amounts to five or six.
     After two months employed in' measurements and geo
 logical researches, and after having examined the thermal
 waters of Comagillas, the temperature        of which is 11* of
 Reaumur higher than thote of the Philippine islands, which
 Sonnerat considers as the hottest in the world, our travel
 lers proceeded through the valley of St. Jago, where they
 thought they saw in several lakes at the summits of the ba
 saltic mountains so many craters of burnt-out volcanoes, to
 Valladolid, the capital of the antient kingdom of Michoa-
 can.     They thence descended, notwithstanding the con
 tinual autumnal rains, by Patzquaro, situated on the margin
 of a very extensive lake towards the coast of the Pacific
 Ocean, to the plains of Jorullo, where in the course of one
 night in 1 759, during one of the greatest convulsions which
 the globe ever experienced, there issued from the earth a
 volcano 1494 feet in height, surrounded by more than
  2000 mouths still emitting smoke.        They descended into
  the burning crater of the great volcano to the perpendicular
  depth of 258 feet, jumping over fissures which exhaled
  flamihg sulphurated hydrogen gas.          After great danger,
  arising from the brittleness of the basaltic and sienitic lava,
  they reached nearly the bottom of the crater, and analysed
  the air init,  which was found to be surcharged      inan extra
  ordinary manner with carbonic acid.
      From the kingdom of Michoacan, one of the most agree
  able and most fertile countries in the Indies, they returned
  to Mexico       by
                   the high plateau of Tolucca, in w hich they
  measured the snowy mountain of the same name, ascending
  to its highest summit, the peak of Fraidc, which rises 236*
  t'oises above the level of the sea  :they visited also at Toluc

  unique, — that of there being only one individual of it,
  which has existed since the remotest antiquity.
      On their return to the capital of Mexico they remained
  there several months to arrange their herbals, abundant in
  gramineous plants, and their geological collections ; to cal
  culate their barometric and trigonometrical measurements
  performed in the course of that year ; and in particular to
 make fair drawings of the geological atlas, which M. Hum
 boldt proposes to publish.
     Their return furnished them also with an opportunity of
 assisting at the erection of the colossal equestrian statue of
 the king, which one artist, M. Tolsa, overcoming diffi
 culties of which a proper idea cannot be formed in Lurope,
 modelled, cast, and erected on a very high pedestal : it is
 wrought in the simplest style, and would be an ornament to
 the finest capitals in Europe.
     In January 1804 our travellers left Mexico to explore the
 eastern declivity of the cordillera of New Spain : they mea
 sured geometrically the two volcanoes of Puebla, Popoca-
 tepec and Itzaccihuatl.     Acoording to a fabulous .tradition,
Diego Ordaz entered the inaccessible crater of the former
 suspended by ropes, in order to collect sulphur, which may
 be found everv where in the plains',
    M. Humboldt discovered that the volcano of Popocatepec,
 on which M. Sonnenschmidt, a zealous mineralogist, had
the courage to ascend 2557 toises, is higher than the peak
of Orizaba, which has hitherto been considered the highest
colossus of the country of Anahuac : he measured also the
great pyramid of Choiula, a mysterious work constructed
of unbaked brick by the Tultequas, and from the summit
of which there is a most beautiful view over the snowy
 summits and smiling plains of Tlaxcala.
    After these researches they descended by Perote to Xa-
lapa, a town situated at the height of 674 toises above the
level of the sea, at a mean height at which the inhabitants
enjoy the fruits of all climates, and a temperature equally
mild and beneficial to the health of man. It was here that,
by the kindness of Mr. Thomas Murphy, a respectable in
dividual, who to a large fortune adds a taste for the sciences,
our travellers found every facility imaginable for performing
their operations in the neighbouring mountains.
    The level of the horrid road which leads from Xalapa to
Perote, through almost impenetrable forests of oaks and fii;s,
and which has begun to be converted into a magnificent
causeway, was three times taken with the barometer.
M. Humboldt, notwithstanding the quantity of snow which
                                                           had

had    fallen the evening before, ascended to the summit of
the famous Cofrc, which is 162 toises higher than the peak
of Teneriffe," and fixed its position by direct observations.
He measured also trigonometrically the peak of Orizava,
which the Indians call Sitlaltepetl, because the luminous
exhalations of its crater resemble at a distance a falling star,
and respecting the longitude of which M. Ferrer published
very exact operations.
    After an interesting residence in these countries, where,
under the shade of the Uquidambar and ami/ris, are found
growing the epidendrum vanilla and conuotuulus jalappa,
two productions equally valuable for exportation, our tra
vellers descended towards the coast of Vera Cruz, situated
between hills of shifting sand, the reverberation of which
 causes a suffocating heat ; but happily escaped the yellow
 fever, which prevailed there at the time.
    They proceeded in a Spanish frigate to the Havannah to
 get the collections and herbals lejt there in ] 800, and, after
 a stay of two months, embarked for the United States : but
 they were exposed to great danger in the channel of the Ba
 hamas from a hurricane which lasted seven days.
    After a passage of thirty-two days they arrived at Phila
 delphia; remained in that city and in Washington two
 months; and returned to Europe in August 1804 by the
 way of Bourdeaux with a great number of drawings, thirty-
 five boxes of collections, and 6000 species of plants.
   IX. An      Account     of Sutton Spa, near Shrewsbury,            By
                               Dr. Evans*.
Outton        Spa is situated within two miles south of Shrews
 bury, on the slope of a gentle eminence, and close to a vil
 lage of the .-ame name, the property of the right honourable
 lord Berwick.        The spring issues from a rocky stratum of
 ash-coloured clay, or argillaceous schistus, containing (as
 appears by its effervescence with nitrous acid) a small por
 tion of lime ; and, in its present unimproved state, vields
 but a scanty stream.         In the neighbourhood are several beds
 of soft limestone and coal, the latter mineral accompanying
 nearly the whole course of Meole-brook. In the Sutton
 pits it is mixed with so large a proportion of pyrites, or sul-
 phuret of iron, as to be used only for inferior purposes.                 ,

          Fresh from the spring, the Sutton water is clear and co
     lourless, and exhales a slightly sulphureous smell ; which
     is most perceptible in rainy weather*.                 It sparkles little
     When poured into a glass, having no uncombined carbonic
    ;«icid in its com position.        When first drawn, its strong salt
     taste is evidently mixed with a chalybeate flavour ; but the
   Jatter is wholly lost on exposure for a few hours, bubbles of
     air separating slowly, and a reddish sediment lining the sides
     and bottom of the vessel.
         Its temperature, the thermometer in the open air stand
   ing at about 70°, varied from 53° to 55° of Fahrenheit; but
    at another time, the thermometer in the air being at 55°,
    sunk as low as 46°.
         The infusions of litmus and red cabbage were not red
    dened by it when fresh, nor greened after boiling, or long
    exposure; showing the absence of any disengaged acid or
    alkali, or of any material portion of earthy carbonate.
         When fresh, it instantly struck a reddish purple with
   tincture of galls ; but no change was produced wlicn it had
   been boiled a few minutes, or exposed some time to the
    atmosphere. The former circumstance 'clearly proves the
   presence of iron, and the latter, that it was wholly held in
   solution by a fugacious acid.
        Mixed with lime water it deposited a reddish sediment
   of the carbonate of lime and iron oxide ; and with caustic
   ammonia, a reddish cloud, formed by the above metal, with
   probably a small portion of magnesia.
        The saccharine or oxalic acid threw down a large and
   immediate precipitate of oxalited lime.                With mild kali, a
   copious dirty     sediment      was    instantly   formed    of earth and
   iron, separated from their acids by the superior affinity of
   the alkali.
        The marine and nitrous acids produced no change, or
   rendered it more transparent; but a few drops of sulphuric
   acid produced instantly a copious deposition of selenite.
        Muriated barytes did not show the presence of any sul
   phuric compound.
        A solution of acetited lead caused an immediate milki-
   uess in the water, which, however, became perfectly trans
   parent on the addition of distilled vinegar. This also proves
  'the absence of any sulphuric acid, which would have formed
   with the lead an insoluble compound.                   Characters traced

on paper with the above solution, and exposed to the vapour
of the fresh water,   became visible, of a light brown colour,
by the action of hepatic air or sulphurated hydrogen gas.
Some silver leaf exposed to its vapour became faintly yellow,
and a globule of bright quicksilver was slightly tarnished.
But a solution of nitrated silver produced merely a white
precipitate, turning blue on exposure to light ; the usual
effect of the muriatic acid ; the quantity, therefore, of he
patic air is probably very small.
     A portion of the water, evaporated slowly, formed
beautiful cubic crystals, which, with a drop of sulphuric
acid, gave out the peculiar smell and gray fumes of the mu
riatic acid.
     From a gallon of the water fresh from the well, were ob
tained eight ounces, or about 14.-^*^- cubic inches of vola
tile contents, of which about one-eighth part extinguished
flame, precipitated lime water, and was evidently carbonic
acid. On applying to the remainder (which was not soluble
in water by repeated agitation) the flame of a candle, a
slight combustion took place, and afterwards the flame
burnt nearly as well as in common air.          One measure of
this air, mixed with an equal bulk of nitrous air in an ac
curate eudiometer, was diminished from 200 to l.^^.,
while the common air of the room, added to nitrous air in
the same proportion, was lowered to l.-rWV, its purity being
in a direct ratio to the degree of diminution.     It was there
fore atmospheric air, with a slight mixture of sulphurated
 hydrogen gas, and somewhat more than the usual portion
 of azote, as is always the case with the air of chalybeate
 waters.
     A wine gallon of the fresh water being evaporated to
 dryness, there remained of residuum 2 ounces 3 drachms,
 or 1320 grains ; this, mixed with 12 ounces of cold distilled
 water, left on the filter 12 grains of a reddish brown sedi
 ment.
     Caustic ammonia added to the clear solution did not
 precipitate any magnesia worth collecting ; but mild kali
 threw down a copious sediment of aerated lime, which, on
 exsiccation, weighed 206 grains ; and must, according to
Bergman and Kirwan, have been produced from 226 grains
 of muriated lime, the former containing -fjs parts of pure
 lime, and the latter -fc?7 of muriatic acid.
     Subtracting this, and the twelve grains of brown resi
 duum, from the whole, there remain in a gallon of th»
 water 1082 grains of muriate of soda or common salt. The
  ) 2 grains of residuum,   treated with diluted marine acid,

and again precipitated by caustic ammonia, produced nearly-
half a grain of iron oxide, which, fused with charcoal by
the blowpipe, was strongly attracted by the magnet, and
assumed some degree of metallic lustre.                       The remaining
llj    grains, insoluble in the acid, evidently consisted of
clay, mixed, as appeared in a magnifier, with several crystals
                               ...
of silex, which were probably merely suspended, and not in
a state of solution, in the water*

    This, in common with most mineral waters, varies not
a little in the quantity and proportions of its ingredients at
different seasons and in different states of the atmosphere.
At    one   time, the caustic ammonia produced no effect on
the   water   ; at another, it deposited a very considerable por
tion   of   magnesia; and the hepatic smell is sometimes not
in  the   least  perceptible, particularly in dry weather *. But,
however provoking these variations may be to the accurate
chemist, they are luckily of little moment to the practical
physician.        A considerable latitude, in this respect, makes
no   material     difference   in the medicinal effects ; much more
depending        on   the quantity    of the water, as a diluent and
detergent,      than    on  any  other    circumstance.
    I am greatly indebted to my ingenious friend Mr. Du-
gard, house-surgeon to the Salop Infirmary, for his kind
assistance in making the above analysis.
   • In the present exposed state of the opening of the well, this must parti
cularly happen, rainy weather weakening the saline impregnation, and a
warm air exhaling the gases and precipitating the iron. The well known
effect of salts in operating more powerfully as they are the more dilutee),
compensates    for the diminished strength of the solution.

      The Sutton water           has by many been compared with that
 of Cheltenham,            and    supposed to contain nearly the same
 ingredients.          It  bears, however, a much closer resemblance
 to sea water, as will be evident from the annexed table*.
      We have accordingly found it most beneficial in those
 Cases for which sea water is usually recommended.                             It
 yields the same salutary stimulus to the stomach in chronic
 weakness of that organ, and obviates, both mildly and ef
 fectually, the habitual costiveness of hypbehondriac patients.
 Diluted in a large portion of liquid, the saline ingredients
 serve to wash out any acrid sordes collected in the first pas
 sages, which I believe to be one of the most important uses
 of mineral waters. On no other principle can we explain
 the uniform good effects produced on the digestive organs
 by waters so various in the nature and proportion of their
 contents, and in the degree of their impregnation.
      Conveyed by the lacteals into the mass of circulating
 fluids, and thence through the different secretory organs,
 this water has proved highly serviceable in a great variety
 of glandular affections ; and, being disposed to pass off with
 the finer parts of the blood, promotes the excretions of
 urine or perspiration, according to the attendant circum
 stances of clothing, temperature of the air, &c.                    Absorbed
 by the lymphatics, the acrid muriates stimulate the torpid
 vessels, and wash out any acrimony accumulated in conse
quence of that inirritability. We hence may readily explain
their efficacy in those disorders to which the poorer classes

are particularly liable, chronic diseases of the skin, and
scrophula.    Tn the former, which have so improperly been
termed scorbutic *, this water has been found a very valua-
ble remedy, both externally and internally applied.
    In the cure of scrophula, the superior merits of sea water,
first introduced to publicnotice by Dr. Russel,have ever since
been uniformly and universally acknowledged f.               A simi
larity of ingredients would naturally lead us to expect si
milar effects from the Sutton water ; and I am happy to bear
testimony, that a twenty years' attendance at the Salop In
firmary, as well as in private practice, has furnished me
with abundant proofs of its success in the treatment of
scrophulous affections. Yet I will frankly own, that in
this deceitful, and, I fear, increasing malady, the effects
of medicine arc frequently but too fallacious. At certain
seasons of the year, and particular periods of life, the sym
ptoms will subside spontaneously, and the credit due to .
Nature be given to the remedy last employed.
    In addition to the above properties possessed by the Sut
ton spring in common with sea water, it enjoys one evi
dent advantage, in containing iron.            Though the minute
portion of         in this and many other mineral springs, may
                        it,
be thought inadequate to any useful purpose, — experience,
our surest guide, has amply proved the contrary              and ;             it   is
now well ascertained, that small and repeated doses of this
valuable metal produce far more beneficial and permanent
effects on the constitution than the much larger ones for
merly prescribed.

      This being by no means intended as a medical commu

  to be expected from the Sutton water.       The outline may be
  readily  filled up hereafter, whenever   the  improved state of
  the Spa shall require a more accurate description of its best
  modes' of exhibition, and the diseases to which it is appli
  cable.
      Though its value has been long felt and acknowledged
  by the immediate neighbourhood, the spring still remains
  in a very rude and neglected State ; an iron spout attached
  to a piece of wood stretched across the opening, forming
  the only channel for the water's exit.         Entangled in its
  passage    to  the brook  below,  it has  produced an artificial
  morass, its surface being abundantly covered with ochery
  scum, from the deposition of iron oxide. Some time since,
  it was held in contemplation by the noble proprietor to erect
  baths, &c. for the accommodation of invalids ; but the mi
  litary avocations of the day postponed the truly benevolent
  institution.     With the return of the blessings of peace, it
  will, I trust, be resumed, and an inestimable benefit thereby
  conferred on an extensive and populous district.       The mo
  rass might easily be drained by channels communicating
  with the brook ; and baths erected on this site would have
  both a constant supply from the well, and a regular dis
  charge of the refuse water.
      While almost every fishing village on the coast is pre-
i paring conveniences for sea bathing, how desirable would
  it be to extend similar advantages to the interior parts of
  the island) where poverty or infirmity renders it impossible
  to visit the distant sea ! In this county, abounding in mi
  nerals, whose subterraneous wealth is beyond all calcula
  tion, there is probably scarce a parish that would not supply
  a mineral water for the benefit of the neighbouring poor,
  were the springs properly examined.
      The air of Sutton, as might be expected from its open
  elevated situation, is dry and wholesome.         The site com

          X.   On the Blight or Mildetv      of Wheat*.
Jcjut   the most remarkable effect of the seasons of the pre
sent year (1800) is that of wheat being, in particular
situations, injured by blight or mildew — in a dry summer.
In this district (the Vale of Exeter) many fine looking
crops were, in a manner, cut off by this malady : the straw
becoming black as soot, and the grain shrivelled and
light. In one instance which I particularly attended to, it
was barely worth the labour of thrashing out; even at the
present prices ! owing, however, in some considerable de
gree, I apprehend, to the imprudence of the grower, who
suffered it to stand to ripen after the blight had seized it ;
while a more judicious manager in this quarter of the
county t, by cutting his wheat as soon as he perceived it
to be struck with the disease, preserved            it,
                                                  he believes,
from material injury. This precaution, however,           very it   is
probable,   ninety-nine  growers  in   hundred
                                         a      did not take               :
and the country may have lost, in the most alarming hour
of scarcity, some hundred thousand quarters of wheat                       by
this one defect in English agriculture!       !
    1804. A similar, but more universal effect took place this
 summer, which has likewise been characterized             by
                                                      dryness,

less blighted ; excepting in a few instances in Gloucester
shire, and others in Oxfordshire, in which instances only
strong, yellow, healthy stubbles were observable.
   The pause of the disease in the county in which I had
the best opportunity of observing it (Caermarthenshire),
appeared, very evidently, to proceed from some cold rains
which fell about the middle of August.        Before that time
wheat crops in general looked healthy, and were beginning
to change to a bright colour. But presently after a few cold
wet days the malady became obvious to the naked eye. The
straw lost its smooth varnished surface,        being occupied
by innumerable specks, which changed in a few days, in
kss than a week, to a dark or blackish colour, giving the
straw a dusky appearance *.
   A gentleman of Caermarthenshire, who is attentive to
agricultural concerns, is of opinion that this destructive
disease may be prevented by sowing old seed ; namely,
wheat of the preceding year's growth, instead of new wheat,
agreeably to the practice of the Cotswold Hills of Glouces
tershire.   I am much inclined to think, that by sowing
early, agreeably to that practice (see Gloucestershire, II.
51.), this fatal disease might frequently be avoided, early
ripe crops being, from all the observations that I have
hitherto made, the least subject to its baleful effect.   Corn
which ripens under the hot summer        sun of July, is not so
liable to cold chilling rains as that which remains unmatured
until the sun begins to lose its power, and the nights to
increase in length and coolness.
   A certain preventive of this disaster would be a disco*
very worth millions to the country.        Until this be made,
let the grower of wheat not only endeavour to sow early,
but let nim look narrowly to his crop during the critical
time of the filling of the grain ; and whenever ne may per
ceive it to be smitten with the disease, let him lose no time
in cutting   it,suffering     to lie on the stubble until the

straw be firm and crisp enough to be set up in sheaves,
without adhering in the binding places — allowing;           to   it
remain in the field, until the grain shall have received the
nutriment which the straw may be able to impart.         Where
wheat has been grown on " lammas land," and the ground

     Devonshire had its rains in the ripening season of 1800. A third in
stance of the blight of wheat succeeding rain, was observed in the same
county, in 1794. And  a  fourth was equally obvious, in 1785, in the Mid
land Counties, as may be seen in the Rural Economy of that department,
minute ~i.

and spread upon grass land to dry.                   Yet the grain has been
found to mature, and always to afford a fine-skinned beau
tiful sample.          Raygrass that is cut even while in blossom,
is well known to mature its seeds with the sap that is lodged
in the stems.           Hence there is nothing to fear from cutting
wheat or other corn before the straw be ripe.
      1805. April.         That the operation of this disease is car
ried on by the fungus tribe, evidently appears from the
ingenious and persevering labours of botanists*.                            But
 fungi, it is equally evident, are an effect, not the cause of
the disease.         They are the vermin of the more perfect ve-^
 getables     ;  and  fasten on them, whether in a dead or in a
 diseased state j but seldom, I believe, while they are in full
 health and vigour.            Their minute and volatile seeds may be
 said to be every where present — ready to produce their kind
 wherever they may find a genial matrix.                    Such at least apr
 pears to be the nature of the fungus, or fungi, of wheat ;
 for it may be liable to the attack of more than one species.
 In a dry warm summer, which is well known to be favour
 able to the health, vigour, and productiveness of the wheat
 crop, the seeds of fungi are harmless, so long as the fine
 weather continues.             On the contrary, in a cold wet season,
 which gives languor and weakness to the wheat plants, few
 crops escape entirely their destructive effects.                  A standing
 crop     not   unfrequently escapes,         while    plots  that  are lodged
 in the same field, especially in pits and hollow places, ber
 come liable to their attack. And by the facts above stated,
 we plainly sec, that even strong healthy crops may, in a
 few days, or perhaps in a few hours, be rendered liable to
 be assailed — not progressively, as by an infectious disease,
 but at once, as by a blast or blight.                  In the state of the
 atmosphere we are to look for the cause of the disease in a
 standing crop ; and nothing is so likely to bring on the
 fatal predisposition of the plants as a succession of cold
 rains while the grain is forming.                The coolness necessarily
  gives a check to the rich saccharine juices which are then
  rising towards the ear; and the moisture may, at the same
  time, assist the seeds of the fungi to germinate and take
  root. Thus reason and facts concur in pointing out the
  cause and the operation of the diseasef. The natural event

 is too well known, and                         it   is the business    of art   to endeavour
 to prevent it.
     If by
         cutting down the crop, as soon as it is found to be
diseased,  the operation can be stopped — as experience, in
different instances, has shown that it may — the remedy is
easy     *.
     Aprobable means of prevention is that of inducing early
ripeness (for reasons above offered), either by sowing early,
or by forcing manures, or by selecting and establishing
early varieties— i-of wheat most especially ; — as early varieties
of pease and other esculent plants are raised by gardeners :
a work which only requires ordinary attention, and which
it is hoped will, without delay, be set about and encou
raged by every attentive grower of wheat, and every pro
moter of rural improvements in the united kingdom.

72                   On the Origin   of Stones
teors, given in the sixth volume of the Abridgment of the
Philosophical Transactions, now publishing.
    Dr. Halley takes it for granted that the luminous bodies
sometimes seen in the atmosphere are merely unkindled
vapours.     Dr. Hutton observes, that " the difficulty, not
to say impossibility of conceiving how any exhalations
could be raised so high, ought to have hinted the idea of
some other origin," and then proceeds as follows :
    "  Later observations have induced a belief that these
luminous appearances are allied to, if not the same as, the
stones which have frequently been known to fall from the
atmosphere, at different times, and in all parts of the earth.
Several of the phenomena are common to both.               These
luminous bodies are seen to move with very great velocities,
in oblique directions descending ; commonly with a loud
hissing noise, resembling that of a mortar shell, or cannon
ball, or rather that of an irregular bard mass projected
violently through the air ; surrounded by a blaze or flame,
tapering off to a narrow stream in the hinder part of it ; are
heard to explode or burst, and seen to fly in pieces, the
larger parts going foremost, and the smaller following in
succession ; are thus seen to fall on the earth, and strike it
with great violence ; that on examining the place of the
fall, the parts are found scattered about, being still consi
derably warm, and most of them entered the earth several
inches deep.     After so many facts and concurring circum
 stances, it is difficult to refuse assent to the identity of the
 two phenomena : indeed it seems now not to be doubted,
 but generally acquiesced in. And hence it is concluded,
that every such meteor-like appearance is attended by the
 fall of a stone, or of stones, though we do not always see
 the place of the fall, nor discover the stones.
    " This conclusion, however, has contributed nothing
 towards discovering the origin of the phaenomenon, at least
 as to its generation in the atmosphere : on the contrary, it
 seems still more difficult to account for the production of
 stones, than gaseous meteors, in the atmosphere, as well
 as to inflame and give them such violent motion.              In
 fact, it seems concluded as a thing impossible to be done
 or conceived ; and philosophers have given up the idea
 as hopeless.     This circumstance has induced them to
 endeavour to discover some other cause or origin for these
 phaenomena.       But no idea that is probable, or even
  possible, has yet been started,       excepting one, by the
 very celebrated mathematician Laplace, and that of so
  extraordinary a nature, as to astonish us with its novelty,
                                                              and

and boldness of conception*        This is no less than the
conjecture that these stony masses are projected from
the moon ! a conjecture which none but an astronomer
could have made, or at least have shown to be probable,
or even possible. Any ordinarv person might at random
utter the vague expression of a thing coming from the
moon ; but no one, except the philosopher, could propose
the conjecture seriously, and prove its possibility.         This
M. Laplace has been enabled to do by strict mathematical
calculation.   He has proved that a mass, if projected by a
volcano from the moon, with a certain velocity, of about a
mile and half per second (which is possible to be done), it
will thence be thrown beyond the sphere of the moon's
attraction, and into the confines of the earth's ; the conse
quence of which          is,
                     that the mass must presently fall to the
earth, and become     part of it.

of, and their outward appearance and structure, we are now
to consider what inferences respecting their probable origin
may be drawn from this mass of information.       And indeed
we may safely conclude, as        has been interred from the
                                       it
whole,       the philosophers best qualified to judge of the
            by
circumstances, as follow, viz. that the bodies in question
have fallen on the surface of the earth    but that they were
                                            ;
not projected       by
                  any terrestrial volcanoes and that we have
                                                ;
no right, from the known laws of nature, to suppose that
they were formed        the upper regions of the atmosphere.
                          in
Such   anegative conclusion has been thought all that we
are, in the present state of our knowledge,        entitled to
draw.
   "  In this embarrassing predicament, the total want of
any other possible way of accounting tor the origin of those
bodies, an idea has been started, perhaps at first merely at
                                                      random,

 74                  On the Origin   of Stones
 random, that since there is no other possible manner of
  accounting for them, then they must have dropped from
  the moon.      And, indeed, this singular thought has now
 advanced     into a serious hypothesis, which it must bo
 allowed is unincumbered with any of the foregoing difficul
 ties; having at least possibility in its favour, which no other
  hypothesis yet proposed can claim.
      "As the attraction of gravitation extends through the
 whole planetary system, a body placed at the surface of the
 moon is affected chiefly by two forces, one drawing it
 toward the centre of the earth, and another drawing it to
 ward that of the moon.       The latter of these forces how
 ever, near the moon's surface, is incomparably the greater.
 But as we recede from the moon, and approach toward the
 earth, this force decreases, while the other augments, till
 at length a point of station is found between             the two
 planets, where these forces are exactly equal ; so that a body
 placed there must remain at rest : but if it be removed still
 nearer to the earth, then this planet would have the superior
 attraction, and the body must fall towards it. If a body
 then be projected from the moon towards the earth, with a
 force sufficient to carry it bevond this point of equal attrac
 tion, it must necessarily fall on the earth. Such then is
 the idea of the manner in which the bodies must be made
 to pass from the moon to the earth, if that can be done,
 the possibility of which is now necessary to be considered.
    " Now supposing a mass to be projected from the moon,
 in a direct line towards the earth, by a volcano, or by the
 production of steam by subterranean heat, and supposing
 for the present those two planets to remain at rest, then it
 has been demonstrated, on the Newtonian             estimation of
 the moon's mass, that a force projecting the body with a
 velocity of 1 2,000 feet in a second, would be sufficient to
 carry it beyond the point of equal attraction.           But this
 estimate of the moon's mass is now allowed to be much
 above the truth ; and on M. Laplace's calculation it appears
 that a force of little more than half the above power would
 be sufficient to produce the effect, that     is,
                                                 a force capable of
 projecting    abody  with
                         a   velocity of  less  than a   mile and
                                                                a
 half per second. But we have known cannon balls pro
jected    bythe force of gunpowder, with        a velocity of 2500
 feet per second, or upwards, that is, about half        amile. It
 follows therefore, that projectile force, communicating
                         a                                      a
 velocity about three times that of cannon ball, would be
                                      a
 sufficient to throw the body from the moon beyond the
 point of equal attraction, and cause     it   to reach the earth.
                                                             Now

                  that have fallen from the Atmosphere.           15
Now   there can be little doubt that a force equal to that is
exerted by volcanoes on the earth, as well as by the pro
duction of steam from subterranean heat, when we consider
the huge masses of rock, so many times larger than cannon
balls, thrown on such occasions to heights also so much
greater.    We may easily imagine too such cause of motion
to exist in the moon as well as in the earth, and that in a
superior degree, if we may judge from the supposed sym
ptoms of volcanoes recently observed in the moon, by the
powerful tubes of Dr. Herschel ; and still more, if we con
sider that all projections from the earth suffer an enormous
resistance and diminution, by the dense atmosphere of this
planet, while it has been rendered probable, from optical
considerations, that the moon has little or no atmosphere
at all, to give any such resistance to projectiles.
    " Thus then we are fully authorised in concluding, that
the case of possibility is completely made out ; that a known
power exists in nature, capable of producing the foregoing
effect, of detaching a mass of matter from the moon, and
transferring it to the earth, in the form of a flaming meteor
or burning stone ; at the same time we are utterly ignorant
of any other process in nature by which the same pheno
menon can be produced.         Having- thus discovered a way in
which it is possible to produce those appearances, we shall
now endeavour to show, from all the concomitant circum
stances, that these accord exceedingly well with the natural
effects of the supposed cause, and thence give it a very high
degree of probability.
   '.'This important desideratum will perhaps he best attained
by examining the consequences of         substance supposed to

                      a

                                     ;
with the known and visible phenomena of the blazing me
teors or burning stones that fall through the airon the earth.
And      if  in
             this comparison    striking coincidence or resem
                                 a

for the human mind to resist the persuasion that the assumed
cause involves       degree of probability but little short of
                      a
certainty itself. Now the chief phaenomena attending these
blazing meteors, or burning stones, are these             :  That

they appear or blaze out suddenly.          2. That they move
with     surprising rapid motion, nearly horizontal, but
         a                                                         a
little inclined downwards.      3. That they move in several
different directions, with respect to the points of the com
pass.    4. That in their flight they yield      loud whizzing
                                                 a
sound.      5. That they commonly burst with          violent ex
                                                     a.

         force in a sloping direction.              7. That they are very
    ot at first, remain hot a considerable time, and exhibit
 freat
 visible tokens of fusion on their surface. 8. That the fallen
  stony masses have all the same external appearance and
 contexture, as well as internally the same nature and com
 position.      9. That they are totally different from all our
 terrestrial bodies, both natural and artificial.
     " Now these phaenomena will naturally compare with
 the circumstances of a substance projected by a lunar vol
 cano, and in the order in which they are here enumerated.
 And first with respect to the leading circumstance, that of
 a sudden blazing meteoric appearance, which is not that of a
 small bright spark, first seen at immense distance, and then
 gradually increasing with the diminution of its distance.
And this circumstance appears very naturally to result from
 the assumed cause.             For the body being projected from a
lunar volcano, may well be supposed in an ignited slate,
like inflamed matter thrown up by our terrestrial volcanoes,
which passing through the comparatively vacuum, in the
space between the moon and the earth's sensible atmo
sphere, it will probably enter the superior parts of this
atmosphere with but little diminution of its original heat ;
from which circumstance, united with that of its violent
motion, this being 10 or 12 times that of a cannon ball,
and through a part of the atmosphere probably consisting
chiefly of the inflammable gas, rising from the earth to the
top or the atmosphere, the body may well be supposed to
become suddenly inflamed, as the natural effect of these
circumstances ; indeed it would be surprising if it did not.
From whence it appears that the sudden inflammation of
the body, on entering the earth's atmosphere, is exactly
what might be expected to happen.
     "  2. Secondly, to trace the body through the earth's
atmosphere, we are to observe that it enters the top of it,
with the great velocity acquired by descending from the
point of equal attraction, which is such as would carry the
body to the earth's surface in a very few additional seconds
of time, if it met- with no obstruction.                 But as it enters
deeper in      the    atmosphere,        it meets    with   still more and
more resistance        from     the  increasing density of the air ; by
which the great velocity           of  6 miles per second must soon be
greatly    reduced       to  one   that   will be uniform, and only a
small part       of  its   former     great velocity.     This remaining
part   of its  motion      will  be various    in different  bodies, being
more or     less   as  the    body    is larger  or  smaller,   and as it is
                                                                      more

              that have fallen from the Atmosphere.           77
more or less specifically heavy ; but, for a particular in
stance,    if the body were a globe of 1 2 inches diameter, and
of the same gravity as the atmospheric stones, the motion
would decrease so, as to be little more than a quarter of a
mile per second of perpendicular descent.        Now while the
body is thus descending, the earth itself is affected by a
two-fold motion, both the diurnal and the annual one, with
both of which the descent of the body is to be compounded.
The earth's motion of rotation at the equator is about 17
miles in a minute, or ^ of a mile in a second ; but in the
middle latitudes of Europe little more than the half of that,
or little above half a quarter of a mile in a second : and if
we compound this motion with that of the descending body,
as in mechanics, this may cause the body to appear to
descend obliquely, though but a little, the motion being
nearer the perpendicular than the horizontal direction. But
the other motion of the earth, or that in its annual course,
 is about 20 miles in a second, which is 80 times greater
 than the perpendicular descent in the instance above men
 tioned ; so that, if this motion be compounded with the
 descending one of the body, it must necessarily give it the
 appearance of a very rapid motion, in a direction nearly
 parallel to the horizon, but a little declining downwards.
 A circumstance which exactly agrees with the usual appear
  ances of these meteoric bodies, as stated in the 2d article of
  the enumerated phxnomena.
     "  3. Again, with regard to the apparent direction of the
  body, this will evidently be various, being that com
  pounded of the body's descent and the direction of the
  earth's annual motion at the time of the fall, which is itself
  various in the different seasons of the year, according to the
  direction of the several points of the ecliptic to the earth's
  meridian or axis.      Usually, however, from the great excess
  of the earth's motion above that of the falling body, the
  direction of this must appear to be nearly opposite to that of
  the former.      And in fact this exactly agrees with a remark
  made by Dr. Hallcy, in his account ot the meteors in his
  paper above given, where he says that the direction of the
  meteor's motion was exactly opposite to that of the earth in
  her orbit.     And if this shall generally be found to be the
   case, it will prove a powerful confirmation of this theory of
   the lunar substances.       Unfortunately,  however, the ob
   servations on this point are very few and mostly inaccurate :
   the angle or direction of the fallen stones has not been
   recorded ; and that of the riving meteor commonly mistaken,
   all the various observers giving it a different course, some
               6                                             even

78       On Stones that have fallen from the Atmosphere.
even directly the reverse of others.   In future, it will be
Very advisable  that the bbservers of fallen stone3 observe
ana record the direction or bearing of the perforation made
 by the body in theearth, which will give us perhaps the
course   of the path nearer than any other observation.
 .
     " 4. In the flight of these meteoric stones, it is com
 monly observed that they yield a loud whizzing sound.
 Indeed it would be surprising if they did not. For if the*
 like sound be (given by the smooth and regularly formed
 cannon ball, and heard at a considerable distance, how ex
 ceedingly great must be that of a body so much larger*
 which is of an irregular form and surface too, and striking
 the air with 50 or 100 times the velocity.
     " 5. That they commonly burst and fly in pieces in
 their rapid flight* is a circumstance exceeding likely to
happen, both from the violent .state of fusion on their sur
face* and from the extreme rapidity of their motion through
the air. If a grinding stone, from its quick rotation, be
 sometimes burst and        in pieces, and
                                 fly       if the same thing
happens to cannon balls, when made of stone, and dis
charged with considerable velocity, merely        by
                                                   the friction
 and resistance of the air, how much more    is the same to be
expected to happen to the atmospheric stones, moving with
more than 50 times the velocity, and when their surface
may well be supposed to be partly loosened or dissolved      by
the extremity of the heat there.
  "   6. That the stones strike the ground with   agreat force,
and penetrate to       considerable depth, as
                             a                  is usually oba
served,        circumstance only to be expected, from the
              is   a
extreme rapidity of their motion, and their great weight,
when we consider that        cannon ball, or
                                   a         a   mortar shell,
will often bury itself many inches, or even some feet in the
earth.
  "       That these stones, when soon sought after and
         7<
found, are hot, and exhibit the marks of recent fusion, are
also the natural consequences of the extreme degree of in
flammation in which their surface had been put during their
flight through the air.
    " 8. That these stony masses have all the same external
appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same
nature and composition, are circumstances that strongly
point out an identity of origin, whatever may be the cause
to which they owe so generally uniform      a  conformation.
And when            considered, athly, that in those respects
                   it   is
they differ totally from all terrestrial compositions hitherto
known or discovered, they lead the mind strongly to
                                                       ascribe

ascribe them to some other origin than the earth we in
habit; and none so likely a3 coming from our neighbouring
 planet.
      " Upon the whole then it appears highly probable, that
 the flaming meteors, and the burning stones that fall on
 the earth, are one and the same thing.                  It also appears im
 possible, or in the extremest degree improbable, to ascribe
 these, either to a formation in the superior parts of the
 atmosphere, or to the irruption6 of terrestrial volcanoes, or
 to the generation by lightning striking the earth.                     But, on
 the other hand, that it is possible for such masses to be
 projected from the moon so as to reach the earth 5 and that
 all the phenomena of these meteors or falling stones, having
 a surprising conformity with the circumstances of masses
 that may be expelled from the moon by natural causes, unite
 in forming a body of strong evidence, that this is in all pro
 bability and actually the case."
  XII.      Description     of   a  Plough-ear which offers the least
      possible   Resistance,      and which may be easily constructed.
      By Mr.       Jefferson, President of the United States of
      America*^.
   X he body of a plough ought not only to be the continua
  tion of the wing of the sock, beginning at its posterior edge,
  but it must also be in the same plane. Its first function is
  to receive horizontally from the sock the earth, to laise it
  to the height proper for being turned over } to present in
  its passage the least possible resistance, and consequently to
  require only the minimum of moving power.                            Were its
  functions confined to this, the wedge would present, no
  doubt, the properest form for practice                 fj  but the object is
  also to turn over the sod of earth.               One of the edges of the
  ear ought then to have no elevation to avoid an useless
   wasting of force; the other edge ought on the contrary to
      •  Prom Annnles'iu Museum National d'Hiitoire Naturelle, no. 4. 1802.
      ¦f 1 am sensible that if the object were merely to raise trie sod of earth to
   a given height by 'a determinate length of ear, without turning it over, the
  form which would give the least resistance would not be exactly that of a
   wedge with two plane faces ; but the upper face ought to be curvilinear
   according to the laws of the solid of least resistance described by mathema
   ticians. But in this case the difference between the effect of the wedge with
¦
   a curved face, and that of a wedge with a plane face, is so small, and it
   would be so difficult for workmen to construct the former, that the wedge
   with a plane face ought to be preferred in practice as the first element of
   our method of construction.      (.Yoie uj the Author.)

  go on ascending until it has passed the perpendicular, iri
  order that the sod may be inverted by its own weight; and
  to obtain this effect with the least possible resistance, the
  inclination of the ear must increase gradually from the mo
  ment that it has received the sod.
     In this second function the ear acts then like a wedge
  situated in an oblique direction or ascending, the point of
  which recedes horizontally on the earth, while the other
  end continues to rise till it passes the perpendicular.      Ory
  to consider it under another point of view, let us place on
  the ground a wedge, the breadth of which is equal to that of
  the sock of the plough, and which in length is equal to the
  sock from the wing to the posterior extremity, and the
  height of the heel is equal to the thickness of the sock:
  draw a diagonal on the upper surface from the left angle of
  the point to the angle on the right of the upper part of the
 heel j slope the face by making it bevel from the diagonal
 to the right edge which touches the earth : this halt will
 evidently be the properest form for discharging the required
  functions, namely, to remove and turn over gradually the
 sod, and with the least force possible.       If the left of the
 diagonal be sloped in the same manner, that is to say, if
 we suppose a straight line, the length of which is equal at
 least to that of the wedge, applied on the face already sloped,-
 and moving backwards on that face, parallel to itself, arid
 to the two ends of the wedge, at the same time that its
 lower end keeps itself always along the lower end of the
 right face, the result will be a curved surface, the essential
 character of which     is, that    will be combination of the
                                   it       a
 principle of the wedge, considered according to two                di
 rections, which cross each other, and will give what wc
 require,   a   plough-ear presenting the least possible re
 sistance.

One of the great faults of this essential part of the plough         is
the want of precision, because, workmen having no other
guide than the eye, scarcely two of them are similar.
  It   is   easier, indeed, to construct with precision the
plough-ear in question when one has seen the method which
furnishes the means once put in practice, than to describe
the method      by  the aid of language, or to represent       by

as the length of the head of the plough, from its junction
                                                                   with

with the wing to its posterior end, be given, for these data
will determine the dimensions of the block from which the
ear of the plough must be cut.         Let us suppose the breadth
of the furrow to be 9 inches, the depth 6, and the length
of the head two feet : the block then (Plate I. fig. 1.) must
be 9 inches in breadth      at its base be, and 13£ inches at its
summit     ad; for, if it  had at the top onlv the breadth ae
equal to that   of  the base, the sod, raised in a perpendicular
direction,    would by its own elasticity fall back into the
furrow. The experience which I have acquired in my own
land, has proved to me that in a height of 12 inches the
elevation of the ear ought to go beyond the perpendicular
4^ inches, which gives an angle of about 2()^,°, in order
that the weight of the sod may in all cases overcome its
elasticity. The block must be 13 inches in height, because,
if the height of the ear were not equal to twice the depth of
the furrow, when friable and sandy earth is tilled it would
pass the ear, rising up like waves.          It must be in length
3 feet, one of which will serve to form the tail that fixes the
ear to the stilt of the plough.
    The first operation consists in forming this tail by sawing
                                                   f
the block (fig. 2.) across from a to b on its left side, ana
at the distance of 12 inches from the end g: then con
tinue the notch perpendicularly along be till within an
inch and a half or its right side ; then taking di and e A,
each equal 14, inch, make a mark with the saw along the
Vinede, parallel to the right side.         The piece abcaefg
will fall of itself, and leave the tail cdeh i k, an inch and a
half in thickness.      It is of the anterior part abcklmn of
the block that the ear must be formed.
    By means of a square trace out on all the faces of the
block lines at an inch distance from each other, of which
there will necessarily be 23 : then draw the diagonals It m
 (fig. 3.) on the Upper face, and ko on that which is situated
on the right ; make the saw enter at the point m, directing
it towards A, and making it descend along the line m I
until it mark out a straight line between k and I (fig. 5.) ;
then make the saw enter at the point 0, and, preserving the
direction 0 A, make it descend along the line 0 1 until it
meet with the central diagonal A /, which had been formed
by the first cut : the pyramid kmnol (fig. 4.) will fall of
itself, and leave the block in the form represented by fig. 5.
    It is here to be observed, that in the last operation, in
stead of stopping the saw at the central diagonal k I, if we
had continued to notch the block, keeping on the same
plane, the wedge Imnokb (fig. 3.) would have been taken

 away,     and     there   would     have     remained another wedge
 lohinr,        which, as I      observed    before, in sneaking of the
 principle     in  regard to     the construction of the ear, would
 exhibit the most perfect form, were the only object to raise
 the sod ; but as it must also be turned over, the left half of
 the upper wedge has been preserved, in order to continue, on
 the same side, the bevel to be formed on the right half of
 the lower wedge.
    Let us now proceed to the means of producing this bevel,
 in order to obtain which we had the precaution to trace out
 lines around the block before we removed the pyramid
 (fig. 4.).      Care must be taken not to confound these lines,
 now that they are separated by the vacuity left by the sup
 pression of that pyramid (fig. 5.). Make the saw enter in
the two points of the first line, situated at the places where
the latter is interrupted, and which are the two points
where it is intersected by the external diagonals ok and m k,
 continuing the stroke on that first line till it reach on the
one hand the central diagonal k I, and on the other the lower
 right edge oh of the block (fig. 5.) : the posterior end of
the saw will come out at some point situated on the upper
trace in a straight line with the corresponding points of the
edge and the central diagonal.                Continue to do the same
thing     on   all the   points    formed    by  the intersection of the
exterior diagonals and lines traced out around the block,
taking alwavs the central diagonal, and the edge o k as the
term, and the traces as directors : the result will be, that
when you have formed several cuts with the saw, the end
of that instrument, which came out before at the upper
face of the block, will come out at the face situated on the
left of the latter ; and all these different cuts of the saw will
have marked out as many straight lines, which extending
from the lower edge o h of the block, will proceed to cut
the central diagonal.           Now by the help of any proper tool
remove the sawn parts, taking care to leave visible the traces
of the saw, and tins face of the car will be finished*. The
                                                                         traces
   * The figures 9 and 10, which we have added here to those which ac
company Mr. Jefferson's memoir, were drawn in perspective by M. Valen-
cienne, assistant naturalist belonging; to the museum, and may serve to give
a better idea of the result of the operation here described.   Let us suppose
that the saw cuts the lines mk, ok (fig. 9.) in the points x and f, taken in
the traces  i ( and is situated in the same plane parallel to hare, and the
prolongations of which on the triangles m k I and ok I are the lines xz and
tx', the saw must then penetrate the block remaining in the plane in qucs*
tion until its edge has arrived at the point t, and at the same time touch the
point i of the central diagonal k I. The same edge of the saw will come out
at some point y of the face m k I , so that the three points <,z, y, will be in
                                                                             the

                     Description     of    a Ploiigh-ear.                      83
traces will serve to show how the wedge which is at the
right angle rises gradually on the direct or lower face of the
wedge, the inclination of which is preserved in the central
diagonal.       One may easily conceive and render sensible the
manner in which the sod is raised on the ear, which we
have described, by tracing out on the ground a parallelogram
two feet long and nine inches broadj as abed (fig 6) : then
placing in the point b the end of a stick 27*- inches in length,
and raising the other end 12 inches above the point e: (the
line de, equal to 4J- inches, represents the quantity which
the height of the car exceed* the perpendicular).                       When
this is done, take another stick 12 inches in length, and,
placing it on ab, make it move backwards, and parallel to
itself trom ab to cd, taking care to keep one of its ends al
ways on the line ad,; while the other end moves along the
stick be, which here represents the central diagonal.                       The
motion of this stick of 12 inches in length will be that of
our ascending wedge, and will show how each transverse
line of the sod is carried from its first horizontal position
until it be raised to a height which exceeds the perpendicular
so much as to make it fall inverted by its own weight.
    But to return to our operation : — it remains to construct
the lower part of the ear.              Invert the block aud make the
saw enter at the points where the line a I (fig. 9.) meets
with the traces, and continue your stroke along these traces
until both ends of the saw approach within an inch, or any
other convenient thickness, of the opposite face of the ear.
When the cuts are finished, remove, as before, the sawn
 pieces, and the ear will be finished *.                              •
                                                                                 It
the same straight line. But if this operation be repeated in different places
of the lines m k, o k b from k tu a certain height, the points of the fare m k r,
at which the saw comes out, will form a curve kyn.           Beyond this height
the saw, alwavs directed in such a manner that at the end of its motion it
•hall touch at the same time the edge o h and the central diagonal kl, will
 come out at other points situated on the posterior face a /¦m I, and the series
of these points will form a second curve 11I, wh:ch will meet the first in tha
point n. These two curves being traced nut, let us suppose straight lines
drawn to the places where the saw stopped each time that it touched the
diagonal k I, and of which one, as already said, passes through the point*
1, t,y; and let us conceive a surface touching all these straight lines, and
whose limits, on the one hand, shall be the curves kyn, nl, and on the oilier
the edge oh, this surface, which must be uncovered by sections made with
a proper instrument, will form one of the faces of the ear.      The latter is re*
presented tig. 10, and the face in question is that which appears before, and
which is indicated by in/or.     It will be remarked that the angle situated to
wards h (fig. 9) on the part kedieh of the block has also been cutolFby a
section made from d to r, agreeably tu what will be said hereafter. — -Vote of

84                     Description     of a Plough-ear.
     It is fixed to the plough by morticing the fore part o                      I
 (fig. 5 and 10.) into the posterior edge of the sock, which'
must be made double, like the case of a comb, that it may
 receive and secure this fore part of the ear.                  A screw-nail
 is then made to pass through the ear and the handle of the
 sock at the place of their contact, and two other screw-nails
 pass through the tail of the ear and the right handle of the
 plough.       The part of the tail which passes beyond the han
 dle must be cut diagonally, and the work will be finished.
     In describing this operation I have followed the "simplest
 course, that it may be more easily conceived ; but I have
 been taught by practice, that it requires some useful modi
 fications.      Thus, instead of beginning to form the block as
represented abed (fig. 7.), where a & is 12 inches in length
 and the angle at b is a' right one, I cut off towards the bot
 tom, and along the whole length be of the block, a wedgt
 bee, the line I being equal to the thickness of the bar of the
 sock (which I suppose to be 1+ inch) ; for, as the face of the
 wing inclines from the bar to the ground, if the block were
 placed on the sock, without taking into the account this
 inclination, the side ab would lose its perpendicular direc
 tion, and the side ad would cease to be horizontal. Be
 sides, instead of leaving at the top of the block a breadth
 of 13-J- inches from mton (fig. 8.), I remove from the
 right side a kind of wedge nkicpn of 1-J- inch in thickness;
because experience has shown me that the tail, which by
these means has become more oblique, as ci instead of kit
 fits moi^ conveniently to the side of the handle. The dia-
in regard   to the anterior face of the ear.   The, thickness of the latter being
determined by that of the part kedieh (fig. 9.), or, what amounts to the
same thing, by the length of the lines c k, di, eb, let us first conceive that
there has been traced out, proceeding from the point c, the curve cup pa
rallel to k y n, and then; proceeding from the point p, the curve p 3 parallel
to In. Let us next suppose that the saw cuts the edge a I of the face abml
in the point t, situated in the same plane as x ( and Is, which plane has been
taken for example in regard to the anterior face of the ear. The saw must
be directed along the traces )£ and J.< in such a manner that its motion shall
 stop at the term where its edge on the one hand shall touch the curve cp in
the point « situated on the trace xz, and on the other shall be situated pa
rallel to the line szy at which the saw stopped on the other side of the ear.
The edge of the saw will then cut the face a lor in some point s, so situated
that the straight line drawn through that point and the point u shall be pa
rallel to the straight line whicn passes through the point s, z, y. If you con
tinue in the same manner cutting with the saw different points of the edge alt
those by which it comes out will form on the face a lor a curve t/t*S; and
if through these points and those corresponding to them in the lines rp, n&,
there be drawn straight lines, such as that which passes through the points
i,i/, and which we have taken as an example, the surface touching these
straight lines, and uncovered by means of any sharp instrument, will form,
with the remainder e hot 5f«» of the plane alor, the posterior face of the ear,
such as is rcpreseated fig. 10. — Note of the French Editor.

modifications may be easily comprehended by those ac
 quainted with the general principle.
     In the different experiments to which ears have been sub
jected to determine the quantity by which the right upper
 side of the block passes beyond the perpendicular, ana to
 fix the relation between the height and the depth of the
 furrow, they were made only of wood ; but since my cx-
                have convinced me, that for a furrow 9 inches
   road and 6 in depth, the dimensions I have given are the
Eeriments
 best, I propose in future to have these ears made of cast
iron.
     I am sensible that this description may appear already too
long and too minute for a subject which has hitherto been
considered as unworthy of furnishing matter of application
to science; but, if the plough is really the implement most
 useful to man, the improvement of it can never be thought
a vain speculation.         However, the combination of a theory
satisfactory     to the learned, with a practice which falls within
the reach of the most unlettered labourer, must meet with
a favourable reception from two classes of men who render
most service to society.

                  NEW INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA.
      A
      lettter from New York, dated April 1st, says:—
"  Among the numerous institutions which have been
formed in this country in the Course of 1804, there are
Jhrce in particular in which the public take warm interest.
                                                       a
           :                   3                                      The

90            Society   of the   Sciences at   Flushing.    4
    The first is a Society of Agriculture established at Wash
 ington under the special protection of government.          The
 president of the United States, the chiefs of administration,
 the senators and deputies to congress, are members of it in
 right of their situation.    The society have already acquired
 a convenient edifice, with a field of thirty acres ; the com
mencement of a library, and that excellent collection of
ploughs and other agricultural implements which formerly
belonged to general Washington. The form of its admi
nistration, the capital which it can possess (specified in
bushels of wheat), and its whole organization have been
 fixed by its charter of incorporation, which constitutes the
 society into a political body, and ensures the existence of
 it for ever.   The answers to the numerous questions which
it sent, soon after its formation, to the societies of different
countries, form, it is said, an interesting work, which will
be published.
    The second institution is a Botanical Garden in the neigh
bourhood of New York, for which the subscribers have ob
tained also a charter. As soon as the large green-house is
completed, the most curious productions of the southern
provinces will be sent to it.
    The third institution is an Academy of Fine Arts. The
first idea of this establishment originated with Mr. Living
ston, the American minister at Paris ; and the public were
so sensible of its importance, that long before the arrival of
the plaster casts, which that gentleman presented to          theit,
subscribers, of twenty-five piastres each, amounted to 180.
Mr. Vandeline,   a   native of America, who has resided se
veral years at Paris, where he has become an eminent
 painter, has sent to the academy some fine paintings.
    The president,   by  the support of the friends to this in
stitution, has purchased for       itthat beautiful edifice which
forms the centre of the circus lately built on Hudson's river,
the large hall of which    is lighted by a rotunda of cast iron
entirely filled with panes of glass.          here that Mr. Li
                                             It   is
vingston's plaster casts, among which there           one of the
                                                       is
celebrated Laocoon, have been deposited: and seventeen
pupils arc already employed in making drawings from these
fine models.
         SOCIETY OF THE SCIENCES AT FLUSHING.
   In the meeting of November      last year, at the Museum
                                        2,
in Middleburgh, the society proposed again the two follow
ing questions, announced in the year 1803, and to which
no answers had been received.
                                                            I.   Wh»t

               Society of the Science's at Flushing.         91
    I. What are the natural causes that the bottom of the
,harbours in Middleburgh and the Wclzinge channel has
been so perceptibly raised, during a series of years, by an
 accumulation of the mud ?        What arc the simplest, most
effectual, and least expensive means of remedying this evil ?
and is it possible to give a sufficient depth to these harbours
and channel, and to maintain them in that state ?
     II. A history of the influx of the current of the sea ac
 cording to fixed laws, and in a determinate line ? What are
 these laws ? Is the course of these currents prejudicial to
our dykes and to the strand, and in what degree ? What
 are the practicable means of giving to this prejudicial cur
rent another direction, and of conducting it to other places,
so as to obviate its destructive effect ?
    The prize is a gold medal ; and the answers must.be sent
in before the 1st of January 1806.
    The two following questions also, announced last year,
are again proposed for the same reason as the preceding :
the first for a year, the second for an indefinite time.
    I. As the utility of pouring out oil and other fat sub
stances during storms at sea, is established by sufficient
proofs ; but as the objection, that this mean may be preju
dicial to ships which follow, has not been entirely obviated,
the society requires 'to know;:. What is the physical prin
ciple of calming the waves by pouring out fat substances ?
and, Can the above objection be entirely done away by an
explanation of this point ?
    II. What was the geographical state of Zt eland in re
gard, in particular, to rivere and streams, from the earlier
periods to the commencement of the government of Counts ?
What changes took place in it between the latter period and
the end of the fourteenth century ? Has it continued the
same, or have evident alterations taken place? and what are
these alterations ?
    The society has proposed also three new questions, the
        for which is a gold medal ; the first to be answered
  efore the 1st of August 1S05, the other two before the
Erizc
 1st of January 1806.
    I. As we have no general history of the sciences and fine
arts in this country, which would be both agreeable and
useful ; and as such a history is not to be expected until
histories of each branch be composed, the society has re
solved to turn its attention to this object, and to 'announce
one part annually as the subject of a prize question, with a
view that materials may be collected for a general history,
and that our countrymen may in the mean time enjoy the
                                                         benefit

  92             Society of the Sciences at Flushing.
 benefit of particular histories.      But as it appears necessary
 to the society that the compass of this fertile subject should"
 be treated in methodical order, for the purpose of avoiding
 confusion and needless prolixity, and that not only a proper
 distinction should be made between the sciences and fine
 arts, but that a proper distribution of them should be pre
 viously established, according to which the society may
 propose its annual questions : and as it appears also that
 several men of letters who have written on the division of
literature, science, and the fine arts, which, according to
 the opinion of the antients, are so intimately connected
 with each other, evidently differ, the society considers it
 necessary first to propose the following question : — Is there
 any connection between the sciences and the fine arts ? Is
 it possible to separate them from each other, and to distri
 bute and arrange both in a regular series ? What is the best
 order, and at the same time the best adapted to make the
 literary history of the various branches of the sciences and
 fine arts serve as materials for prize questions ?
     II. As the Pythagorean philosopher, Apollonius of Ty-
ana, has, by many of the pagan and other writers, been
.placed in the same rank with our blessed Saviour Jesus
 Christ, the society requires to know : " What real or pro
bable information is to be obtained in regard to this man ?
And what proofs of the truth of the evangelical .writings can
be deduced from a comparison of the accounts given us of
Apollonius by Philostratus and others, and of Jesus Christ
by the evangelists ; together with a comparison of the ex
ternal relation of these writers?
     III. As the bloody feuds known under the name of Hoekseh
and Kabeljaauwseh form, the principal part of the early history
of this country, and as different opinions have been enter
tained in regard to various circumstances relating to them,
the society wishes for a more satisfactory account of the
origin of these two parties. Was it not earlier than the
•destructive quarrel between Margaret of Hennegau and her
son William V ? What gave occasion to the appellations
Hoekseh and Kabeljaauwseh ? Is the real etymology of these
words established, and what was the principal object of these
parties from their origin to the time when they became ex
tinct?
    The answers, written in the Dutch, Latin, or French
languages, but in a legible hand, must be transmitted,
sealed up in the usual manner, to A. Dryfhout, the se
cretary, at Middleburgh, before the periods above an
nounced.
                                                        XIV. In-

        XIV.   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                        PRIZE QUESTIONS.
 J.  he king oF Prussia has proposed the following prize
                                                   "
question in regard to the yellow fever : — Are there suffi
cient grounds, founded on indubitable facts, for believing
that the contagion of the yellow fever can convey its infec
tion to substances destitute of life, without losing any of its
force, and in such a manner that the contact of these sub
stances can communicate the infection to sound persons,
and by these means convey the fever to other countries )
    The prize for the best answer is 200 ducats, and for the
second best 100 ducats. The answers must be written in
Latin, German, or French ; and transmitted to the Supe
rior College of Medicine before the 1st of January 1807.
                           NEW METAL.
    Dr. Richter, of Berlin,     has discovered in the cobalt ore
of the Saxon mines a new       metal which has properties com
mon to cobalt and nickel, but which differs from both. He
has given it the name of niccolan.           A particular account of
this metal has been published in Gehler's Journal of Che
mistry.

                  ,              THE TIDES.
         A correspondent remarks, that from
                                        the peculiar position
    of
    the two grand luminaries, the sun and the moon, on the
 I Oth day of August next, a great increase of tide may be
 expected on the three following days; and that a very good
 opportunity will then offer to ascertain the moon's influ
ence over the ocean, by observing the height of the tide at
the principal maritime ports, particularly at Chepsljw, the
Bristol channel,       and at    London bridge.
                                  DEATH.
   On the 9th of March last, at the age of about 76, the
celebrated Felix Fontana, director of the Royal Museum at
Florence.     " He died," says Fabbroni, " full of glory."
Being   attacked twenty-seven days before by an apoplexy,
he was assisted during the fit by the duke De Bonelli, who
was accidentally passing at the time. After this accident
 his mental faculties were so weakened lhat he was scarcely
 able to make the necessary disposition of his property in
 favour of his relations, friends, and domestics.
    The physical sciences have lost in Fontana a man by
 whom they were cultivated with unremitting ardour. Italy,
 in particular, regrets in him one of its brightest ornaments.
 He possessed the rare talent of an observer. He bad great
 boldness of conception, uncommon strength of judgment,
 and an obstinate perseverance in every thing he undertook.
The numerous and laborious experiments he made on the
 poison of the viper are a proof of               it,
                                              as well as those,  by
which he threw great light on the animal ceconomy. Tha
 cabinet of Florence         indebted to his persevering courage,
                            is
 thwarted         by
               difficulties and obstacles, for the immense and
valuable collection, to which there               is
                                             nothing equal  in Eu-
n>pe,  of wax   models    of  every kind  executed  under his assi
duous and minute direction.             Italso indebted to him for
                                             is
two wooden statues which can be taken to pieces         :   one of
them could not be finished in his life-time, and perhaps
will never be completed after his death. The reader will
be astonished to learn that         consists of s"x thousand dif
                                   it
ferent pieces, and     is destined to show in its decomposition
((he whole system, the bowels and membranes of the human
Body.
:  These labours, though assiduous, left him sufficient time
{<) cultivate the other branches of the physical sciences, on
which he has left works written both in Italian and in
French. His style          perspicuous and elegant, valuable
                            is

qualities, in which he participated with his brother Gregory
Fontana.
    His obsequies were celebrated with great solemnity in his
parish : his body was opened before the most celebrated
professors, and the features of his face were taken oft" by a
plaster cast. His remains were deposited in a leaden coffin,
with the principal circumstances of his life written on parch
ment inclosed in a metal tube closely soldered. This coffin,
put into another of fir, was interred three days after under
the public chapel of the noviciate of the minor conventual
brothers of Samte-Croix, close to the ashes of Galileo and
Viviani, Michael Angclo and Machiavel.        One of his ex
ecutors, M. Pettcr Ferroni, a celebrated mathematican, will
make known to the republic of letters the valuable manu
scripts left by this eminent philosopher, as well as those of
Gregory Fontana, found among his philosophical collec
 tions.

  XV. Letter       to M. Lacepede, of Paris, on the Natural
      History of North America.               By Benjamin Smith
      Barton, M. D. Professor of Materia Medica, Natural
      History, and Botany, in the University of Pennsyl
      vania *.
  At    is a long time since      I  have received a letter from you.
  I   have anxiously expected one, as           I am very desirous to
  know what progress you have made in your work                      f on
  Fishes. I should, indeed, have been very glad if my leisure
  had permitted me to have1 transcribed for your use a very
  considerable number of facts relative to the fishes of North
  America, especially of the United States. These facts will,
 however, be published in two works in which I am en
 gaged, viz. my Fragments of the Natural History of Penn
 sylvania, and my Travels through various Parts of the
 United States.        I shall only observe at present, that many
 of our fishes are undescribed by the different writers whom
 I   have had an opportunity of consulting; and I believe                I
 may assert that much very interesting matter relative to the
 manners, the migrations, &c. of various American species
 is entirely unnoticed.
      I exceedingly rejoice to find, by the French and other
 foreign publications, that all the branches of natural history
 are making so much progress in your country.                     On this
 side of the Atlantic we also are doing something ; as much,
 perhaps, as could be expected from us.                  The museum,
 founded by our countryman Mr. C. W. Pealc, is very re
 spectable, both for the number and value of the articles
 which it contains.         Within the last three or four years se
 veral new species of quadrupeds, or mammalia, have been
 discovered, and our knowledge concerning other species
 has been greatly extended.             You are, doubtless, well in
 formed that two pretty complete skeletons of the mammoth
 (as it has long been called) have been discovered.                One of
 these has been sent to Europe, and it is probable that yoii
will have an opportunity of seeing it at Paris J. I think you
will have no hesitation in agreeing with me, that this mon
strous animal must be referred to the genus elephas.                   As
far as we are enabled to judge from the bony fabric of the
animal, (and I take this to be an excellent foundation upon
which to construct generic characters,) the American mam-

London, returned with it for America without visiting the Continent of .
Europe. — Edit.

 moth was a true elephant. If in the form of his grinders,
 in the curvature ot his defences or tusks, and in several
 other circumstances, he differed considerably from the living
 elephants that are now known lo us, those differences do no
 more than assure us that the American animal constituted
 a species distinct from the (living) elephants of Asia and
Africa. The American species is unquestionably lost; for
 nature, it would seem, is much less anxious to preserve the
 whole of her created species than some illustrious naturalists
 have supposed.           The skeletons or bones of some other large
 animals, more or less allied to the family of elephants, have
 also been discovered in different parts of North America.
 Among these I recognize the grinders of a species which,
 if not the same as the elephant of Asia, must have been (as
to the form of its grinders at least) more nearly allied to
that species than is the mammoth.                    The bones of another
large     animal     have   been   discovered.      These    appear to have
belonged       to  a species   of trichechus   ; perhaps    to the tricheclms
rosmarw, or morse.              We occasionally find the bones of
 some of the largest of the ceiacea in situations very remote
from those in which the living animals are at present to be
seen.        The scapula of a species of whale has been found at
a considerable distance beneath the surface of the earth
 within the limits of the city of Philadelphia.                 Several years
 ago, the tooth of the monodon, or narwhal, was found at
the distance of a few miles from the city.                These last-men
 tioned facts, however, need not excite much surprise, since
very extensive portions of the present dry country exhibit
the most unequivocal proofs of an antient covering by the
sea.       I may add, that within the memory of our history
whales were not uncommon in some of our bays and rivers,
where they are no longer seen *.
    You      have, I suppose, heard of the large bones which
have been found, in a .nitrous cave, in the back^parts of
Virginia. Mr. Jefferson, the president of the Unitedsutes,
has given an interesting memoir on the subject of tbese
bones in the fourth volume of the Transactions of the Ame
rican Philosophical           Society.      He supposes them to have
belonged        to a  large  animal    of   the genus felis. But these
remains must be referred to a very different family of ani
mals ; to some one of the genera in' the order tardigrada :
the hula of Linnaeus.              I have little doubt that they and
the bones found near tlic Plata, in South America, belong

to the same species : at all events, to an animal of the same
genus ; the megatherium of your countryman M. Cuvier.
Many similar discoveries may be expected from the coun
tries of the United States when it shall be our lot to possess
men of more leisure than we do at present ; or even wherr
our labourers shall more generally know that subjects of
this kind are interesting to philosophers both here and
abroad.
  In the fourth volume       of the Transactions of the American,
Philosophical Society, I have given an account of a new
species of dipus or jerboa, which I call dipus Americanus.
I have discovered some other species of this genus, parti
cularly one, which I call dipus mellivortis.          It is very de
structive to our bee-hives, eating the honey : hence the
specific name. We are very rich in small animals of the
order glires of Linnaeus.        There has lately been discovered
a species of mus, somewhat larger than the common house-
mouse, which has some of the singular habits of the opos-
ium tribe. This animal is a native of Virginia and other
parts of the United States.        You have seen Dr. Shaw's ac
count of the mus lursariits, or Canada rat.              Either this
species (which      was  discovered   in  Canada),  or  another very
nearly allied to   it,   is common in the state of Georgia and
other southern parts of the United States.           In Georgia        is
                                                               it it
known    by   the ridiculous name of salamander.       I   take    to
be the tozan or tuza of Clavigero.              If the Canada and
Mexican animal be the same species, its range through the
continent     isvery great. But  I     have long since discovered
 that the quadrupeds of America have          a  very extended geb-
 graphical range.   I    may say the same of the trees and otbec
 vegetables of this portion of the world.
 I    must now return to some of our large animals.              The
 animal best known in the United States           bythe name of elk
is essentially different from the cexvus alces, or moos, and
 has not hitherto been described         by  any of your systematic
 naturalists.  I    call
                      it   cervus wapiti (wapiti being one of its
 Indian names), and shall give     a
                                         pretty ample account of       it
 in my Fragments, part ii., now in the press. This            is  not
 the only North American cervus with which the naturalists
 of Europe appear to be unacquainted. But what will you
 say, when  I    inform you that there has lately been disco
 vered an American species of sheep      !     You know that some
 of the missionary Jesuits, who visited California towards the
 end of the 17th century, inform us that they found in that
 country two sorts of deer, which they call sheep, from their
 resemblance, in make, to the sheep of Europe.              The first
                                  G2                             sort

100              On the Natural History of North Amer 'tea.
sort is said to be as large as a calf of one or two years old ',
its head is much like that of a stag, and its horns like those
of a ram. Both its tail and hair are speckled, and shorter
than a stag's.    Its hoof is large, round, and cleft like that
of an ox. The flesh of this animal is said to be very tender
and delicious.     The second sort differs less from the sheep
of Europe. Some of them are white, and others black.
They are larger than the common sheep, have much more
¦wool, which is very good, and easy to be spun and wrought*.
In the History of California, by Venegas, there is a figure
of one of these animals, which the Monqui Indians, inha
biting that country, call tayef.     Mr. Zimmermann seems
to entertain no doubt that the taye (or tage, as he calls it,)
is the same animal as the argali, or wild sheep, which in
habits the north-east parts of Asia and the country of
Kamtschatka J. Mr. Pennant, though less positive, is of
the same opinion §.     '1 his, however, appears to me to be a
doubtful point.      Venegas's figure rather forbids the idea
that the Asiatic and American animal are the same.         The
horns of the former arc less incurvated than those of the
latter.   The abbe Clavigero says the taye is " unques
tionably the ibex of Pliny, described by count de Buffon
under the name of bouquetin^." This cannot be; judging
by the figure of the Californian animal, it appears to be most
essentially different from the bouquetin, which is the capra
ibex        of Linnxus.
       I
     have lately received some additional information con
cerning the existence of a large horned animal, probably
the taye, in the country adjacent to the river Missouri, the
great western branch of the Mississippi. This animal is a
native of the Stony mouniains, about the head waters of the
Missouri. -It is nearly of the size of an elk, and of the
colour of a fallow deer. Its horns resemble those of a ram,
but are turned, in a spiral form, like a trumpet, and are of
an enormous size, some of them measuring eight (French)
inches in diameter. The animal is said not to live longer
than ten or twelve year*, because its horns, advancing for
ward in proportion as the creature grows, finally pass the
mouth in such a manner as to prevent it from eating grass,
upon which alone it lives ; and thus it falls a victim to its
hunger.    T!ic Indians of the country make of the horns

    I have been well assured that a small species of goat,
spotted black and white, inhabits the country beyond the
Mississippi, to the south of the Missouri. They are said
to be numerous.        They have also been seen, hut less plen
tifully, about the mouth of the Arkansaw river, which emp
ties itself into the Mississippi nearly in the latitude of 33°
5(f. They are said to be much smaller than the common
kind of goat, and extremely wild. This is possibly a va
riety of the common goat ; but it is more probable that it
is a distinct species, or perhaps a species of the genus an
telope.     Francis Ximenez, in his Account of New Spain,
of which the country that is watered by the Arkansaw is a
part, says there are in this country great numbers of rock
goats, which the savages call mazatl*.                  These rock goats
may be the same animal as the small pied goat which I have
mentioned. But this is conjecture. I must add that I have
received the most undoubted information of the existence
of great herds of a small horned animal in that part of New
Spain which is watered by the Red river, a considerable
western branch of the Mississippi f.                From the description
which has been communicated to me, I think there can be
little doubt that the animal is either a species of goat cr
antelope, and very probably the mazatl of Ximenez. Cla-
vigero's confident assertion, that the tayc of theMonqui In
dians is the bouquetin or capra ibex, renders it probable that
this last-mentioned animal is actually a native of the western
parts of North America.            In that case, perhaps the mazatl
and the Red river animal are no other than the ibex.                  Cer
tain I am, that the taye cannot be the same as the ibex.
    The ursus maritimus, or polar bear (ours dc mer of Buf-
fon), is said to be a common animal in the country adja
cent to a river called the Plata, which empties itself into
the Missouri about four hundred leagues above the junction
of this latter river with the Mississippi.                As the Missouri,
from its source to its mouth, pursues a course nearly due
east, we find that the white bear is common twelve hun
dred miles west of the Mississippi, nearly in the latitude of
40°; this being about the latitude of the mouth of the Mis
souri.     To the north of this the animal is much more
    * Francis Ximenez, as quoted by De Laet, in his Novus Orbis, p. 232.

common.       I haye seen a number of the claws of one of
these animals from the Plata, and they appeared to me to
be the claws of the great polar bear.
    If the animal which I have just mentioned should prove
to be the ursus maritimus, we shall be obliged to assign to
this species, in a geographical view of animals, a much
more southern climate than it is supposed to exist in. And
wc should not forget that many facts conspire to render it
probable that various species of quadrupeds were once more
extensively diffused over the earth than they are at present.
With respect to the very animal of which I am speaking,
it would appear to have been formerly an inhabitant of se
veral countries in which it is at present unknown.         It is
not certain, however, that the white bear of the river Plata
is the ursus maritimus.     Perhaps, it will prove to be a new-
species.    The  claws which   1 have seen lead me to suppose
that the animal to which they belonged could not be infe-.
rior in size to the large white bear or the pole.
    Permit mc in this place to give you some account of the
travels of an intelligent Indian who lately returned from a
very long journey many hundred miles to the north-west of
Detroit. This Indian had left his countrymen (the Mo
hawks) for the purpose of hunting, but was not inattentive
to many of the objects of natural history about him.        He
reports, that the game of the country which he visited was
the buffaloe (bos Americanus) , black bear (ursus Americanus) ,
white bear (ursus maritimus ?), the latter much larger than
 the former, with a remarkably broad foot furnished with
 nails or claws as long as a man's finger: moos (cervus
 alces), elk (my cervus wapiti),
                                   " goats which climb up the
rocks j" a kind of    " sheep with a hairy back, much like
a deer, but furnished with long wool over the belly, and
with large horns," one of which he saw that weighed seven
 pounds ; a kind of deer which the French in some parts of
America call capree; the fisher (I believe a species of must
tela), the otter, the beaver, and a species of fox.    He met

XVI.      On Ike Action      of Platina and Mercury upon each
     other.   By  Richard     Chenevix, Esq. F.R.S.M.R.I.A.
     &c.
                         [Concluded from p. 35.]
J.T    is my intention now to exhibit one example of my po
sition, and to prove that platina and mercury act upon each
other in such a manner as to disguise the properties of both.
I   shall therefore waive for the present all consideration of
palladium, which is in fact but a subordinate instance of
the case before us.
     When a solution of green sulphate of iron is poured into
a solution of platina, no precipitate nor any other sensible
change ensues.         This I had already observed, and it hag
since been confirmed by all who have written upon the
subject. But, if a solution of silver or of mercury be added,
a copious precipitate takes place.          This precipitate contains
metallic platina and metallic silver or mercury ; some mu
riate of one or other of the latter metals is also present, as
 it is not easy to free the solution of platina from all super
 fluous muriatic acid. But these salts are of no importance
in the experiment, and can be separated by such methods
 as a knowledge of their chemical properties will easily sug
 gest. The proper object of consideration is the reduction
 of the platina to the metallic state, which docs not happen
 when it is alone.       I have tried to produce the same effect
 with other metals and platina, but I have not observed any
 thing similar.      It is therefore fair to conclude, that when
  a solution of platina is precipitated in a metallic state by a
  solution of green sulphate of iron, either silver or mercury
  is present.
      The precipitation of a mixed solution of platina and silver
  requires no further caution than to free the salt of platina
  as much as possible from muriatic acid ; for, as I observed
  in my former paper, the effect of nitrate of silver poured
  into muriate of platina, is to produce a precipitate, not of
  muriate of silver, but of a triple muriate of platina and
  silver.    It was by this experiment that I then proved the
  affinity of these two metals ; for, when silver is not present,
                                   G4                           muriate

104                    On the Action    of
muriate of platina is among the most soluble salts.           The
best method of presenting the three solutions of platina,
stiver, and green sulphate of iron to each other, is first to
pour the filtered solution of the last into the solution of
platina, and then, after mixing them thoroughly together,
to add the solution of silver by degrees, and to stir them
constantly.    In this, as in all similar operations, the pre
sence of all acids, salts, &c. excepting those necessary for
the operation, should be avoided ; and if proper proportions
have been used, and all circumstances attended to, the pre
cipitation of these two metals will be very complete.
   But the precipitation by a solution of mercury requires
to be further considered, as the state of oxidizement of this
metal, as well as the acid in which it is dissolved, produces
a considerable modification in the result. In the first place,
the oxide, at the minimum of oxidizement, dissolved in
muriatic acid, is unfit for the experiment ; and even the red
oxide dissolved in the same acid, or corrosive subl iniate, is not
the most advantageous. When a warm solution of the latter
is poured into a mixed solution of platina and green sulphate
of iron also warm, as in the case of silver, these substances
are brought into contact under the most favourable circum
stances.    Yet even thus the precipitation is slowly and im
perfectly formed, often not till several hours have elapsed ;
and sometimes a very great deficiency of weight is observed
between the quantities used and those recovered directly by
this method.      If a solution of nitrate of mercury be used,
the effect is produced more rapidly, and the precipitate is
more abundant. The precipitation of muriate of platina by
nitrate of silver, and the combination which ensues from           it,
suggested to me an experiment which    I   must state at length,
as from the result of    it  consequences   are deduced which
modify some of the experiments of my former paper.
  It  occurred to me that     a method of uniting platina and
mercury without the intervention of any other metal, or of
any substance but the solvents of these metals, might be
accomplished as in the case of silver and platina.         there
                                                           1
fore poured  a   solution of nitrate of mercury, which solu
tion, being at the minimum of oxidizement, consequently
formed an insoluble muriate with muriatic acid, into           so
                                                               a
lution of muriate of platina.      The result was     triple salt
                                                      a
of platina and mercury, which, when the mercury was com
pletely and totally at the minimum of oxidizement, was.
nearly insoluble.    To procure in this state
                                  it             it    sufficient
                                                      is
to put more metallic mercury into dilute nitric acid than the
nitric acid can dissolve, and to boil them together. This
                               • ¦¦                         triple

                 Platina and Mercury               upon each other.            105
triple salt of platina and mercury shall be presently exa
mined.      From this it is evident that to produce the union
of platina and mercury, the' latter being at its minimum
of oxidizement in nitric acid, the addition of green sulphate
of iron is superfluous.
    But if mercury be raised to its maximum of oxidizement
in nitric acid the case is different, for no precipitation occurs
till the green sulphate of iron is added.         The most advan
tageous    method     for   precipitating platina and mercury by
green sulphate     of  iron         is,
                                   believe, the following.
                                      I                        Mix                 a
solution of platina with solution of green sulphate of iron,
                                    a
both warm, and add to them              solution of nitrate of mer
                                               a
cury at the maximum of oxidizement, also warm.                                It   is
necessary to avoid excess of acid, salt, &c. in this as            all        in
such cases. With due care the precipitation of both metals
will then be complete.
    By comparing the experiments made with mercury arid
platina with those made with silver and platina,             striking  a
 resemblance will be found. This induced me to pursue the
analogy, and to examine whether, independently of the ac
tion of platina, mercury had not the same property of being
precipitated        green sulphate of iron as silver.
                      by                                  Nitrate of
silver     precipitated by green sulphate of iron, but muriate
            is
 of silver      not sensibly acted upon
                 is                                         by
                                                  the same reagent.
The insolubility     of  muriate   of silver might be alleged as the
 cause of this,       if had not tried the experiment
                           I                                 pouring   by
 nitrate of silver into green muriate of iron, in which case
 all the substances were presented to each other            solution. in
 The result was not reduction, but muriate of silver and ni
 trate of iron.    This fact rests upon        much more extensive
                                                        a
basis than mere mechanical circumstances and,                pursued
                                                             j        if
 with the attention          deserves,
                               it           would lead us into the
                                                   it
 wide expanse of complicated affinities and their relations.
 From reasoning alone we should be disposed to think that
 an acid, so easily decomposed as the nitric, would be suf
 ficient to prevent the reduction of metal which    a        can dis  it
 solve.    But on the one hand           can spend its oxygen upon
                                               it

•the other its affinity for oxide of silver            not powerful

 enough to retain          it,
                          when there       another part of the oxide
                                                   is
 of iron present to deprive         of oxygen. But the affinity of

 106                               On the Action      of
 mercury, no reduction takes place ; but if mercury, whe
 ther at the maximum or the minimum of oxidizement, be
 dissolved in nitric acid, and green sulphate of iron be added,
 the mercury is precipitated in the metallic state.
    These experiments are much stronger examples than the
 former of the effects produced by complicated affinities.
They are of importance not only as objects of general con
sideration, but in their application to the present subject.
They most materially modify and are indispensable to the
accuracy of the results I formerly stated ; but I was not
aware of them at the time I first engaged in the investiga
tion of this subject. I can also now explain a very material
difference between some proportions observed by M. Richter
and myself in an experiment which that chemist had made
as a repetition of one of mine.
    I had poured a solution of green sulphate of iron into a
Solution of 100 parts of gold and 1200 of mercury, and had
obtained a precipitate consisting of 100 of gold and 7/4 of
mercury.      M. Richter repeated, as he terms            this expeit,
riment; that        is,
                    he used 100 of gold and 300 of mercury,
and obtained      precipitate weighing 102.
                    a                               He      surprisedis
at the difference of weight between our results, which might
be owing to his method of repeating the experiment                but         ;
the real cause of this difference lies, as          suppose, in my
                                                           I
having accidentally used .nitrate instead of muriate of mer
cury.   I   had never observed that with mercury and silver
this operation had failed, and          must have been, because,
                                            it
on account of the known effect of muriatic salts upon those
of silver,I   had naturally avoided using         muriate of mer
                                                           a
cury.
   But the state of the nitrate of mercury which           used with is
a  solution of gold     not indifferent.
                              is             As green sulphate of
iron reduces mercury when dissolved in nitric acid as well
as gold,  it    necessary to mix the solutions of those metals
               is
before the green sulphate of iron             added, in order that
                                                   is
both may be acted upon together.              If the nitrate be at
the minimum of oxidizement,             precipitate
                                            a          immediately

formed upon mixing the solutions of gold and mercury.
Calomel   is  produced by the muriatic acid of the solution of
gold   and the  oxide of mercury      whilst the gold

becoming more oxidized, and forming the soluble muriate.
The precipitate consists of calomel, of metallic gold, and
of very small portion of mercury, which believe to be

the contrary,     a  nitrate of mercury be highly oxidized, no
precipitate nor reduction of gold takes place until the green
sulphate of iron      isadded.     But at any rate the precipitation
of gold and mercury, or of silver and mercury,                    green        by
sulphate of iron, cannot be adduced as an argument to sup
port the affinity of these metals, since the effect          the same is
whether they are separate or united.
    These preliminary considerations were necessary, as well
for the rectification of my former experiments, as for the
 pursuit of my present object and now to return to platina.

                                       nitro-muriatic acid       and the
  solution, when nearly in            neutral state, gives                 a ;
                                             a                   copious
  metallic precipitate (yet not equal to the quantity employed)
  when boiled with         solution of green sulphate of iron.

   of the former metals            generally obtained. After nitric
                                      a is
   acid has been boiled for long time upon the precipitate so
   formed, the original weight of platina, together with            con             a
   siderable increase, remains behind, nor can nitric acid sen
                                                                                          sibly

   sibly diminish it. It yields more easily than platina to the
   action of nitro-muriatic acid, and its solution in that acid,
  when neutralized, gives a precipitate, as in the former ex
   periment, by green sulphate of iron.                If this precipitate be
   exposed    to  a  strong   heat after  it has    been  boiled with nitric
   acid, it loses a great part of its weight, and the platina alone
  will generally be found to remain.
      Exp. 3. When a quantity of ammoniacal muriate of pla
  tina is treated according to the method of count Mussin
  Pushkin to form an amalgam, and, after being rubbed for
  a considerable time with mercury, is exposed in a crucible
  to a heat gradually increased till it becomes violent, a me
  tallic powder remains in the crucible. This powder is acted
  upon by nitro-muriatic acid, and when the solution is neu
  tralized a copious precipitate is formed upon the addition
  of green sulphate of iron. This effect takes place even after
  the metal has been fused in the manner described in the
  former part of this paper.
     Exp. 4. If sulphur be added to the ingredients recom
 mended by count Mussin Pushkin, and the whole treated
 as in the last experiment, the quantity of precipitate caused
 by green sulphate of iron in the nitro-muriatic solution of
 the button which results from the operation is generally
 more considerable.
     Exp. 5. If sulphur be rubbed for some time with ammo
 niacal muriate of platina, and the mixture be introduced
 into a small Florence flask, it can be melted on a sand-bath.
 If mercury be then thrown into             it,     and the whole be well
stirred together and heated,          it     may afterwards be exposed
to a    very strong fire and melted into          a    button.    If this be
dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid,          it     will give
                                                          a     precipitate,
as in the former cases,       by    green sulphate of iron.   .
     Exp. 6. If     a   current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas be
sent through     a    mixed solution of platina and mercury, and
the precipitate which ensues be collected, the metal may be
reduced    by    heat; and with the addition of borax          it   may be
melted into     a     button which will not contain any sulphur.
Green sulphate of iron causes           a     precipitate in the solution
of   this  metal    also.
     Exp. 7- If to      a   mixed solution of platina and mercury
phosphate       of   ammonia     be added,  a     precipitate takes place.
If this be collected and reduced,           it      will be acted upon by
green    sulphate     of  iron poured    into   its  solution, in the same
manner as the metallic buttons in the preceding examples.
    Exp. 8. have already mentioned that when solution

             Platina and Mercury     upon each other.       109
poured into a solution of muriate of platina, a mercurial
muriate of platina is precipitated. The supernatant liquor
may be decanted and the residuum washed ; if this be re
duced and afterwards dissolved in nitro-muriatic        acid, it
will yield a precipitate with green sulphate of iron. This
method appears to me to be the neatest for combining pla
tina and mercury, as the action which takes place is inde
pendent of every substance except the metals themselves.
    Exp. 9. One of the most delicate tests that I have ob
served in chemistry is recent muriate of tin, which detects
the presence of the smallest portion of mercury*.        When
a single drop of a saturate solution of neutralized nitrate or
muriate of mercury is put into 500 grains of water, and a
few drops of a saturate solution of recent muriate of tin are
added, the liquor becomes a little turbid, and of a smoke-
gray colour.     If these 500 grains of liquid be diluted with
ten times their weight of water, the effect is of course di
minished, but still it is perceptible.    I had on a former oc
casion observed the action of recent muriate of tin upon a
solution of platina.     If a solution of recent muriate of tin
be poured into a mixed solution of platina and mercury,
not too concentrated, it can hardly be distinguished from a
simple solution of platina.       But if too much mercury be
present, the excess is acted upon as mercury ; and the liquor
 assumes a darker colour than with platina alone.
    From all these experiments it is evident that mercury can
act upon platina, and confer upon it the property of being
 precipitated in a metallic state by green sulphate of iron.
 By Experiments 1 and 2, it is proved, 1st, That platina can
 protect a considerable quantity of mercury from the action
 of nitric acid : and, 2dly, That mercury can increase the
 action of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina.      From Experi
 ments 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, it appears that mercury can com
 bine with platina in such a maimer as not to be separated
 by the degree of heat necessary to fuse the compound, since
 after the fusion it retains that property, which is essentially
 characteristic of the presence of mercury in a solution of
 platina.    The eighth Experiment proves that the action of
 mercury upon platina is not confined to the metallic state;
 but that these metals can combine and form an insoluble
 triple salt with an acid which produces a very soluble com
 pound with platina alone. The ninth Experiment shows
 that platina can retain in solution a certain quantity of mer
 cury, and prevent its reduction by a substance which acts
 most powerfully to that effect, when platina is not present.
 That part of the general position, therefore, which is the
                                                          object

  110                   On the Action     of
 object of this paper is proved, if these experiments, upon
 being repeated by other chemists, shall be found to be ac
  curate.
    One or two of the above experiments seem to be in con
 tradiction to some that I have stated in my paper upon pal
 ladium ; for in the present examples platina protects mer
 cury against the action of nitric acid ; whereas in palladium
 the mercury is not only acted upon itself, but it conduces
 to the solution of platina in the same acid. I am well aware
 of this objection ; but, confining myself to ray present ob
ject, I shall waive all further discussion of it till another
 opportunity.     In the mean time, however, it may be laid
 down as an axiom in chemistry, that the strongest affinities
 are those which produce in any substance the greatest de
 viation from its usual properties.
    When a button of the alloy of platina and mercury, a9
 prepared by any of the above methods, is dissolved in nitro-
 muriatic acid, and afterwards precipitated by green sulphate
 of iron, the entire quantity of the alloy used is seldom ob
 tained. A considerable portion of platina resists the. action
 of green sulphate of iron, and remains in solution.          This
 may be looked upon as the exces3 of platina, and can be
 recovered by a plate of iron.       Hence it appears that less
 mercury is fixed than can determine the precipitation of
 the entire quantity of platina j yet in this state it can draw
 down a greater quantity of the latter than when it is merely
          into a mixed solution of platina, not before so treated,
   ndeed the whole of these experiments tend, not only to
 fioured
 show that these two metals exercise a very powerful action
 upon each other, but that they are capable of great varia
 tion in the state of their combination ; and also, that sub
 stances possessing different properties have resulted from
 my attempts to combine platina with mercury.
    This observation furnished me with a method of ascer
 taining, or at least of approaching to the knowledge of, the
 quantity of mercury thus fixed by platina, and in combina
 tion with it. The experiment, however, having been seldom
 attended with full success, I mention the result with the
 entire consciousness of the uncertainty to which it is sub
ject. I observed the increase of weight, which the original
 quantity of platina had acquired in some cases after it had
been treated with mercury, and fused into a button.              I
 counted that augmentation as the quantity of mercury fixed.
 I then determined how much was precipitated by green sul
 phate of iron from a solution of this alloy, and supposed it
 to contain the whole quantity of mercury found as above.

            Platina and Mercury    upon each other.             Ill
But,  even if attended with complete success, there is a che
mical reason which must make us refuse our assent to this
estimate.    It is possible, and not unlikely, that a portion
of mercury may be retained in solution by the platina, as
well as that a portion of the platina may be precipitated by
means of the mercury.        The mean result, however, was
that the precipitate by green sulphate of iron consisted of
about 1 7 of mercury and 83 of platina, when the specific
gravity was about 16.
    With regard to palladium, lest it should be supposed that
either my own observations or those of others have given
me cause to alter my opinion,       I will add, that I have as
yet seen no arguments of sufficient weight to convince me,
in opposition to experiment, that palladium is a simple sub
stance.     Repeated failure in the attempt to form       it,

in well conducted operations but four successful trials,

ficient answer to that objection.     By determining the pre
sent question we may overcome the prepossession conceived
by many against the possibility of rendering mercury as
fixed, at an elevated temperature, as other metals    ;we may
be led to see no greater miracle in this compound than in
a   metallic oxide, or in water, and be compelled to take        a
middle path, between the visions of alchemy on the one
hand, and the equally unphilosophical prejudices on the
other, which they are likely to create.      In the course of
experiments just now related, I   have seen nothing but what
tends to confirm my former results     ;  yet the only means
which can, after all, prescribe for succeeding, is perse
       I
verance.
  To ascertain    whether the opinion of Messrs. Fourcroy
and Vauquelin,    that the new metal was the principal in
gredient   inpalladium, had any just foundation,     observed

 think them worth the trouble of verifying, that even these
 experiments are liable to fail, unless proper precautions are
 used ; that I have never operated upon less than one hun
 dred grains ; and that the results which          I have stated, how
 ever simple they may appear, have been the constant labour
 of some weeks.
                             POSTSCRIPT.
    Since this paper wa3 written, Dr. Wollaston has pub
lished some experiments upon platina.                He has found that
 palladium    is  contained   in    very    small  quantities in crude"
platina.     This fact was mentioned to me more than a year
ago by Dr. Wollaston.          I have not yet seen a copy of his
 paper ; but I shall merely observe here, that, whatever be
the quantity of palladium found in a natural state, no con
clusion can be drawn as to its being simple or compound.
Nothing is more probable than that nature may have formed
this alloy, and formed it much better than we can do. At
all events the amalgamation to which platina is submitted
before it reaches Europe, is sufficient to account for a small
 portion of palladium.
XVII.     Observations on the polishing          of Glass, and       on t he-
 Amalgam used for silvering Mirrors.                By B. G. Sage *.
.Having       been consulted       in regard to the bad effects of
some    calces or red oxides      of iron, which alter the surface
of glass by rendering it dull and yellowish,            I  analysed these
calces of iron, and found out the cause on which this defect
depends.      Red calx or oxide of iron, called colcothar, is
employed with water for giving the last polish to glass in
tended for mirrors.
   Were not the oxide or calx of tin, commonly known by
the name of putty, so dear, it would be far preferable to red
calx or oxide of iron, obtained by the decomposition of mar
tial vitriol, either by calcining it in a fire proper for disen
gaging the acid or decomposing the sulphate of iron by
marine salt.      In the latter case, the red oxide or calx of
iron retains a litlle of that salt, which is of no hurt in the

    Glass when smoothed and polished docs not acquire the
property of reflecting objects till       has been silvered (as

The tin leaf employed must be of the size of the glass, be

fore,    istaken in silvering glass to remove the calx of tin
 from the surface of the amalgam.
     The process       as follows — The leaf of tin
                              is                     :      laid on           is              a
very smooth stone table, and mercury being poured over
 the metal,         extended over the surface of it by means of
                    it   is
a   rubber made of bits of cloth.       At the same moment the
 surface of the leaf of tin becomes covered with blackish
 oxide, which        removed with the rubber.
                         is                           More mercury
is   then poured over the tin, where          remains at level to  it              a
 the thickness of more than       line, without running off. The
                                                 a
glass    isapplied in    horizontal direction to the table at one
                                   a
 of its extremities, and being pushed forwards             drives be         it
 fore     the oxide of tin which is at the surface of the amal
         it
 gam. A number of weights are then placed on the glass
 which floats on the amalgam, in order to press                 down.              it
 Withsut this precaution the glass would exhibit the inter
 stices of the crystals resulting from the amalgam.             These
 crystals have the form of large square laminae irregularly
 disposed.
     To obtain leaves of tin, which are sometimes six or seven
 feet in length, with        proportionate breadth, they are not
                                       a

extended     the number  of  the plates is doubled, so that they
amount      sometimes to    eighty or more.       They are then
smoothed with the flat side of the hammer, and are beat
till they acquire the length of six or seven feet, and the
breadth of tour or five.     The small block of tin from which
they' are formed is at first ten inches long, six in breadth,
 and a line and a quarter in thickness.
     When the leaves are of less extent, and thin, from eighty
to a hundred of them are smoothed together.
     Tin extracted from the amalgam which has been em
ployed for silvering glass, exhibits a remarkable peculiarity.
When fused in an iron pan, its whole surface becomes co
 vered with a multitude of tetraedral prismatic crystals two
 or three lines in length and a quarter of a line in thickness.
 The interior of these pieces of tin, when cut with a chi
 sel, have a grayer lint than pure tin, which is as white as
 silver. The latter crystaHizes also by cooling; but it re
 quires care. When it begins to be fixed, decant the part
 which is still in fusion, and there will remain at the bottom
 of the crucible beautiful crystals of a dull white colour,
 which appeared to me to be cubes or parallelopipedons.
     The peculiar and constant crystallization of tin taken
 from the amalgam of mirrors, the leaden gray colour which
 the mass of this metal had, and the mystery made of the
  preparation of this tin, induced me to try whether I could
 not discover by analysis the substance mixed with it.
      flaving calcined this tin in a test, it was reduced to a-
  powder of a delicate red colour, and increased in its weight
  l-25th. The magnet attracted particles of iron-, the result
 of the hammering.- It appears that this metal concurs to
  produce the crystallization of the tin, and the singularity
  exhibited by the solution of its oxide in nitric acid. At
  first, nothing is manifested but a slight effervescence, which
  soon subsides ; but four or five minutes after, the mixtures
  become very hot, and a stronger effervescence takes place,
 accompanied with a great deal of nitrous gas, which is dis
  engaged with an explosion, and there remains in the glass
  a magma of a pale red colour.
      The white oxide of tin, mixed also with nitric acid at 32°,
  exhibits neither effervescence nor disengagement of nitrous
      I fused this reddish calx of tin with three parts of black
  flux and a little charcoal powder, and extracted from it 16
  pounds of tin per quintal.      This metal was brittle, a pro
  perty arising from the lead, which contributes also to at
  tenuate the colour of the tin.     If the lead is found there in
              3                                             larger

                  Russian Expedition to Japan.                   1 15
 larger quantity, it is because there are four-fifths of tin ab
 sorbed by the alkaline flux.
     To determine the quantity of lead contained in the tin
extracted from the amalgam of mirrors, I decomposed                 a
hundred parts of it by four hundred parts of nitric acid at
32°.     A great deal of nitrous gas was disengaged, and there
remained at the bottom of the matrass a white magma.                I
washed it with distilled water, and evaporated the ley, which
produced a twenty-fifth of nitrous ammoniacal salt mixed
with nitrate of lead, which predominates, and forms nearly
two-thirds of the saline residuum ; a proportion which
would indicate that the tin employed for silvering mirrors
contains three pounds of lead per quintal.
     I now return to the mercury extracted by distillation from
this amalgam. It volatilizes a portion of tin, which remains
there so intimately combined that it cannot be separated by
a second distillation of the mercury. I was able to disengage
from it the tin by shaking the mercury with nitric acid,
which attacks and oxidates the tin.          I washed the mercury
and strained it through a piece of linen.            In this state it
may be employed for gilding, but when it contains the
smallest quantity of tin it stains the articles.
    What I have related in this memoir shows that red oxide
of iron, known under the name of colcothar, is not proper
for polishing glass when it contains vitriol ; that the tin
employed for silvering mirrors contains lead and iron ; that
when this tin is separated from the mercury by distillation
this metal crystallizes with the greatest facility and without
any precaution ; and, in the last place, it is shown that a
portion of tin is volatilized by the mercury during the di
stillation of the amalgam, and that it cannot be separated
but by the nitric acid.

    Japan, dated tlie Harbour of St. Peter ana St. Paul)

 J.  he Frenchman    is now at Kamtchatka.         I shall mention
hereafter  by what accident he remained on board the ship.
This man is a singular phenomenon : he had forgotten his
own name, those of his father and mother, and that of the
place from which he came.         He sung to us some patriotic
                                H2                           songs,

1   10           Russian Expedition to Japan.
songs, which he, however, mutilated very much.         He at
length recovered his French ; and then remembered that he
came from Bourdeaux, that his father was named John
Cabrit or Joseph Cabrit; but instead of Cabrit he some
times said Cadiche 5 and Roberts called him John.      As he
now saw that he could no more get back from the ship to
his dear Nukahivah, he exhibited a wonderful mixture of
melancholy and levity.     Sometimes he would fall a-laugh-
ing,   and  afterwards say in a whining tone : Moi heaucoup
irtste la madame, la mademoiselle.       He had a wife who
had brought him a son or a daughter ; and his father-in-
law had given him a house with coco-nut and bread-fruit
trees.   It was curious to observe in what manner his ideas
were expanded.      One time, recollecting some of his joyful
scenes at Bourdeaux, he suddenly exclaimed, as if he had
seen a vision, — Beaucoup de chandelles, heaucoup de violons,
heaucoup de musique,    les madames,   les mademoiselles   !   As
may be readily supposed, we did not know what this meant;
but we at length conceived that he might remember his hav
ing been at the play. He still thought of Nukahivah, and
he has not yet given up the idea of returning thither.        He
 soon recovered his French, and made use of expressions
which he could not have learnt from us, as we were not ac
 quainted with them, such as the names of the different
sails, &c. He often afforded us subject of laughter. Hav
 ing asked him in what the natives of Nukahivah showed
acuteness, he replied, — Beaucoup d'esprit, ill ne couchera
pas avec sa soeur, un autre haiscra sa soevr et il couchera
avec un autre Jille, heaucoup d'esprit ! I here quote his own
words.      From these expressions it is seen that certain de
grees   of consanguinity are in that island forbidden.    I once
 gave  him   a good new  shirt, but he  immediately  bartered  it
 with one of the sailors for a red flannel jacket.     When I
told him that he had suffered himself to be cheated, he
 would not listen to me. As soon as he went on shore he
      on the jacket, and with feathers on his head and          a
    f>ut
  ance in his hand danced on an eminence, capering and
jumping in   a    most extraordinary manner.      Several of the
 natives then wished to accompany him, in order that they
 might go to war. He now showed them how they would
 creep along and conceal themselves behind bushes or among
 the grass, and  in what manner, when thev fell in with any
 of the enemy, they would beat them and carry them off.
 He seemed to be inspired with an enthusiastic spirit of war
 fare, and extolled what gives these people so much pleasure.
 When asked whether he would himself eat any of the flesh
                                                               of

of their enemies, he replied                 "
                                No, I have never done so :"
he  added,  that the sight of others eating it had made him
sick : he had killed three enemies, but had exchanged them
for swine. The latter circumstance was confirmed by the
Englishman.          From this it appears that war among these
people    is   a  kind  of amusement, as hunting is among us.
Ketenue is very averse to           butit,   not able to prevent it.
                                                 is
When      I  asked him why he did not prevent                       it,

swered, When five or six seize an enemy and put him to
death, they carry him into the woods and there devour him.
How then can Ketenue prevent it? Having spoken so much
of their enemies,         must now mention who they are. All
                            I
the islands in the South Seas are exceedingly mountainous,
as   isthe case with the Marquesas and Nukalnvah                 the fer  :
tile and inhabited valleys are separated                       by
                                                       high, steep, and
barren mountains.          Tapeka Ketenue was the chief man at
the Bay of Tayohoie, where we lay at anchor; and other
valleys are in the possession of other chiefs.            With the in
habitants of many of these valleys the former are                   state in   a
of warfare. These are their enemies.                The hostile parties
are always separated              by
                               high mountains, and at each expe
dition these must be clambered up. They have few war
canoes, for the purpose of undertaking expeditions                 water.     by
Ketenue's daughter was married to the chief of another bay,
and, as she was conveyed thither               sea,  bywas agreed that
                                                               it
during her life no war should be carried on at sea with the
inhabitants of that bay. Should she come to Tavohoae on
a  visit and die, her spirit would remain there, and no naval
battle could be fought between the two bays.                  Hogs are
killed on all their festivals and occasions of solemnity.

    Their god Atua is the body of their deceased priest. The

a  piece  of   cloth,  and   being suspended     in  the priest's house,
in the morai or wahitaabo, becomes their god. Sometimes
it    consulted as an oracle; and Joseph is still convinced
     is
that the answers          gives are infallible.
                             it                     Roberts firmly be
lieves that the natives here arc well acquainted with the art
of witchcraft. Joseph considers himself as an adept in
and asserts that          means of certain knots he can make
                             by                                                     a it,

immediately ensues ; and they then endeavour to find out
some enemies, who are either eaten or merely hung up, T do
not exactly know which, in honour of the deceased. When
the priest dreams that he has eaten human flesh, he tells
whether the person was tatooed or not, and gives nearly a
correct description of him. A state of war now ensues ;
 that is to say, some of them creep towards the enemy to
 endeavour to find a person answering this description, and,
 according to their opinion, the person of whom the priest
 dreams, will always fall into their hands : the person is al
 ways a kikino, that         is,
                            one who has broken taaboo.       The
 Frenchman had been in several of the Marquesa islands              ;
 first in Santa Christina.     The people, manners, and cus
 toms, are in all the same.
      On the 8th of May we took advantage of light breeze
                1                                          a
 to get out of Anna Maria or Tayohoae Bay.           On this oc
 casion the Frenchman remained on board. We had for
 gotten to send him on shore. When we were out in the
 open sea, the wind was so strong and so fresh, that, though
 an excellent swimmer, he would not venture to swim back
  to the shore.    Our passage to the Sandwich islands, as          is
  always the case between the tropics, was pleasant and agree
  able, the weather being always fine.
      On the 6th of June, in the afternoon, we were opposite
  to the south-east coast of the island of O-why-he, at the
  distance of about three or four Italian miles.     The natives
  brought off to us     dish of sweet potatoes and
                         a                            small hog
                                                           a         ;
  one of the women also came on board the ship.          Towards
  night we stood off from the land, and next day were at the
  southern extremity at about the. same distance as the pre
  ceding day. We purchased small hog   a          larger one they
                                                   ;   a
  carried back with them because we could give them no
  cloth, of which they wanted          large quantity.
                                           a              A frock
  which we offered them was too small for them. On knives,
  axes, and mirrors, they set no value     and therefore we sup
                                               ;
  posed that they mu3t have been supplied with all these arti
   cles  by the English and the Americans.       Several of them
  spoke little English
          a                   woman who was among them held
                                   a
  out her hand to us, and kept continually repeating, — " How
                             :
  do you do? Very well."
      On the 10th we were opposite to the western coast. We
   here saw the large mountain Morno Roa, which            said to
                                                               is
   be as high as the Peak of Tcneriffe.    As the summit of         it
                                                                    is
   very broad,     does not appear to have the same elevation.
                    it
  We were       agreat way from the shore, and no boats came
 off   to us.
                                                                    We

    We now parted from the Neva and proceeded south
west, while the Neva determined to come to anchor in
Karakakua Bay, where the celebrated Cook was killed.
The natives of the Sandwich isles are more industrious than
those of the Marquesas.         Their canoes are exceedingly
neat, and fully secured from being overset, by outriggers
applied to them. The sea was very rough at the time when
they visited us ; bnt they suffered no damage.      The cloth
which they make of the bark of the paper-mulberry is
very beautiful, and of bright colours.        The broad girdle
worn by the woman was of a. lively red colour.        The men
are smaller than those of the Marquesas, and seem to be
artful and deceitful people. In most of them the incisor
teeth are wanting.      These they are very careful to knock
out. The women are larger and more elegantly made than
those of the Marquesas.       Both sexes have a darker colour
than the natives of the Marquesas, though the climate in
the latter is much warmer. Many of them also are tatooed,
but not so strongly : some of them had severaj figures on
their legs ; and one had the figure of a musket and bayonet
on the arm.      This is nearly the whole of the intercourse
we had with them.        When we return from Kodjak we shall
pay them another visit.
    To be sure of the trade wind we again approached the
equator, and proceeded west on the parallel of 17°. The
weather was fine, and the wind as favourable as possible ;
so that we advanced more than two degrees ever)' day.        As
 we turned towards the north we began to be sensible of the
 effects of custom ; the temperature of 18° of Reaumur was
somewhat disagreeable to us.         I asked Joseph whether it
 was ever so cold in Nukahivah.         " Jamais, jamais," re
 plied  he.   In the latitude of 36" north, and longitude 191°
 west from Greenwich,       we proceeded 'some degrees towards
 the west, but saw nothing of the Silver islands.
    On the evening of July 13 we saw the high mountains
 of Kamtchatka.      On the 1 5th we entered the harbour of
 St. Peter and St. Paul, and came to anchor.         When we
 saw the fine prospect which here presented itself, we could
not believe our own eyes : there was still a little snow to be
 seen on the summits of the highest mountains, but the
 lower ones were covered with beautiful verdure; and the
 smell of the birch-trees was perceived on board the ship.
 The only scorbutic patient in the ship was sent on shore,
 where he soon recovered.        We were extremely fortunate,
 when it is considered that we were five months at sea, and
 for the last tour months had lived entirely on salted provi-

 sions.      Our sour crout had become spoilt at St. Cathe
 rine's, and was thrown overboard. A pthisicky German
 cook, who would not remain in Brazil though every kind
of support was offered to him, died three days after we had
crossed the line.      The heat of Nukahivah had entirely ex
hausted him. He would certainly have died in Europe,
but perhaps some months later.
     The arrival of the Nadeshda was a very fortunate circum
stance for this country.         The beneficial effects of it are al
ready    felt by all Kamtchatka.     Many necessary articles could
no longer be obtained, and others had risen to a most ex
orbitant price. This evil has been remedied. Brandy, for
example, at certain time3 had been sold for fifty rubles per
can : from eighteen to twenty rubles was the common
price; and at present it is six rubles : all other things were
in the same proportion.           The ambassador Resanof, and
general     Koschelef,  a fine  young   man, settle th«. price, and
superintend all public transactions.
     In regard to the Kamtchatdales I have little to say ; few
of them now remain. All those in Paratunka have become
extinct.      Those left have, in a great measure, lost their
originality of character : the only thing by which they are
at present distinguished       is,   that they are excellent bear-
hunters.       There are here  a   great many bears, which feed
on fish.    I   was told that above forty of them were seen
round   a     whale lately cast on shore this, perhaps, may be
                                          :
exaggeration, but    it   is  nevertheless    certain that they are
very numerous.                 k
  I    lattly was present at an original Kamtchatdale dance       :
    represents the courtship of        bear.    The bear, animated
by it
                                     a
      the passion of love, gesticulates        with great violence;
emits wild tones, which die away almost in the throat             :
the female,     by   no means insensible to these strong indica
tions of tenderness, answers with         a  kind of growling and
snarling; her motions, however, were much more mode
rate.     The whole was exceedingly disgusting, and          a    re
main, no doubt, of the antient Schamans, as well as the
dance of birds.
    We lately received    a  visit on board ship from two of the
natives. As we gave them             a  good reception they were
highly pleased, and praised us much telling us that we
                                               ;
were very good men, just like the Kamtchatdales.
    All the houses here, without exception, smell like stock
fish.     The degree of the smell    is  determined     by

which     are a  kind of shepherds' dogs, is heard here almost
every evening.. They are very numerous; but tame, and
never hurt any one. This harmlessness. of disposition arises
from their being fed by all the inhabitants ; for every person
who catches     fish , as soon as the nets are drawn, throws a
few to the dogs, which are accidentally present, and there
fore they are tbnd of frequenting the sea shore. In winter
they are chained up.
   Captain Clark's grave is below an old birch tree.          The
epitaph La Perouse caused to be engraved on a plate of
copper, and under it was inscribed, — " By the order of
count de la Perouse, chef d'escadre," ice. The copper plate
was fixed up with nails, but was nevertheless stolen. After
this circumstance a voice was heard every night demanding
it back ; and it was at length restored.      It is not nailed up
at present, yet no person touches it.
   The ship Slava Rossic, in which Billings performed his
voyage, lies here sunk in the harbour.
   Great complaint having beeri made here that there was
no establishment for taking care of the sick, and that many
perished for want of proper assistance, general Koschelet
proposed a subscription, which was seconded by the am
bassador; and each having subscribed 1000 rubles, the sum
of 4000 was collected in the course of less than an hour.
On its being remarked that this circumstance would give
great satisfaction to the emperor, the enthusiasm became
general. All this was done on board the ship, and it is
not improbable that something has been collected on shore.
I shall send you a further account of Kamtchatka when I
return from Japan.
   Our water continued sweet, and never became corrupted :
for this we were indebted to the care of the captain, who
always caused the casks to be charred. When at Copen
hagen he had read in a journal, edited by Pfaff and ivied-
lander, that water would keep a long time uncorrupted in
charred casks ; and this we have found perfectly confirmed.
   The following' trait will serve to show Joseph's way of
thinking, and what he considered allowable in Nukahivah.
When the ship was unloaded here, it was found that a great
deal of mischief had been done by the rats ; they had emp
tied several pipes of wine, or at least gnawed the casks in
such a manner that the wine had run out. As the whole
almost of our provisions were on shore, they became very
restless, and appeared in great numbers.       I recollected that
I had among my medicines nux vomica, some of which I
                                                           mixed

 mixed with dough.          When Joseph heard that this would
 destroy  rats,  he  asked  if it would kill men also. Having
 answered in the affirmative, he requested me to give him
 some of it.     On asking him what he meant to do with                    it,
 he replied, that when he returned to Nukahivah and ate with
 any of the natives, he would mix      it privately with the food,
 bo that the person should die.       When represented to him
                                               I
 the atrocity of this idea, and told him that he might perhaps
 poison us also, he replied, that    it would be highly criminal
 to poison us, but that in Nukahivah           it was nothing     ;the
 natives, he said, bewitched each other in such               manner
                                                              a
 that they must die, and poisoning was not worse.
   It   ismentioned in Cook's Voyages that he frequently
 interchanged names with some of the kings or chiefs. Cook,
 in all probability, was taabooed         by assuming the king's
 name; and the king took Cook's name in order to oe
 taabooed against the English. But Cook, perhaps, laboured
under    a  mistake; for Ketenue gave his name to captain
 Krusenstern, but assumed none in return. The same cus
 tom prevails in almost all the islands of the South Sea          :   it   is
to be supposed that Cook and other navigators must neces
 sarily have fallen into many mistakes         ; for of this circum
stance we      should   have  been  entirely ignorant, had         not
                                                                  it
been for the information given to us        byJoseph and Roberts.
    There have been English missionaries at Otaheite, Santa
Christina, and even in Nukahivah.           The one who was in
Nukahivah      was  called  Crook,  and  had    the name of Kete-
nue's   son    he
                :  was  not able, however,  to    convert any of the
natives, and soon quitted the island. These missionaries
will have      in their power to communicate the most certain
                it
information respecting the natives of the islands in the
South Sea, for some of the accounts given                byothers are
contradictory.
 I    have had an opportunity of making        a very droll observa
tion.    Wherever we touched where we did not understand
the language, each person endeavoured          to remedy that de
fect   bythe language of which he understood the least. One
of our naturalists spoke Russian to the inhabitants of Nu
kahivah     ;the sailors spoke Portuguese      :  butin  Brasil they
had spoken English and Danish.            A droll fellow, of the
name of Kurganon, endeavoured to make his way with
German, of which he understood only two words                 IVollefi

XIX.      Extract from    a  Memoir of       M. Pavsse, principal
     Preparer of Medicines at the Camp of Utrecht, on the
     manufacturing,     on a large Scale, of some Oxides of
     Mercury.     By   M. Parmentier*.
 JVl. Paysse, to whom we are indebted for the following
information, in regard to the manner in which the Dutch
 prepare, on a large scale, red sulphurated oxide of mercury
 and red oxide of mercury by nitric acid, does not lose a
 moment to take advantage of his stay in Batavia. He seizes
every opportunity of visiting the manufactories, so nume
 rous in that country, as well as the cabinets of the curious,
 which may contribute towards his instruction.            The diffi
 culties of every kind which he encountered before he could
 get admission to these manufactories are a sufficient proof
 of his ardent zeal for the arts and sciences ; hut amidst the
 disappointments which the traveller experiences on his route
 while making researches, he often obtains an indemnity for
 the care he takes, and the sacrifices he makes, when he is so
 happy as to meet with any objects proper for seconding the
 desire he has to add to his knowledge, and to enrich his
 country with the discoveries of the industrious nations he
  is so fortunate as to visit.    Such is the advantageous situa
  tion of M. Payss6, who has already procured us detached
  information in regard to many interesting objects. The
  reader will easily form an opinion of them from the follow
  ing extract from the last memoir addressed to me by this
  chemist.
          Red sulphurated Oxide      of Mercury (Cinnabar).
      This matter is prepared only in two manufactories at
   Amsterdam. The most considerable is that which belonged
   to the late M. Brand.      M. Paysse assisted at an operation
   in which 800 pounds were prepared, divided into two por
   tions.   He observed all the details with every possible at-

 1 24        On the manufacturing, on a large Scale,
tendon; and, after comparing them with those published
by M. Tuckert in the fourth volume of the Annales de Cki-
 mie, for the year 1790, he found only a very slight differ
 ence ; so that the description of the chemist of Amsterdam
 may be considered as nearly exact.      The following is what
 he has omitted.      He does not speak of the duration of the
 flame, nor of its colour, which arises from the combustion
 of the union of the sulphur and mercury previously pre
 pared and introduced into the apparatus.       This flame, the
 disengagement of which is exceedingly rapid, exhibits the
 most various colours ; first of a bright dazzling white, rising
 at least twelve decimetres above the dome of the furnace ;
 then yellow and white orange yellow ; blue and yellow, giv
 ing birth to the green and violet shades, and at last to blue
 and to green.    Its disengagement is overcome towards the
 end by a sort of register of iron plate, when it no longer
 rises but to the height of some centimetres, and its colour
becomes indigo or sky blue.       The apparatus is then her
metically sealed, and luted on the outside with a mixture
 of clay and sand.
    There is no doubt, from the loss experienced in the result
 of the operation, that the shades so various of this flame,
 the disengagement of which lasts about half an hour with
 200 kilogrammes of matter, arise from the union of the
 3ulphur with varied proportion of mercury at different de
grees of oxygenation.      The 400 kilogrammes, or about 800
pounds of red sulphurated oxide of mercury, were reduced
to 379 or 322 kilogrammes,          or between 738 and 743
pounds, which form a loss of from 27 to 31 kilogrammes.
    In speaking of the vessels employed in this operation
M. Tuckert forgot also to describe exactly their form. The
principal vessel is not a jar, but a kind of crucible, round
which the heat circulates, and which has over it an iron
dome, through the summit of which the matter is intro
duced after the crucible has been brought to a red heat.
The success of the operation depends in an essential manner
on the management of the fire during the sublimation. The
fuel employed is turf, and, according to M. Paysso's ob
servation, none is better calculated for the purpose when
a constant and moderate heat is required.      This uniformity
of temperature during the thirty hours of heat maintained
in the furnace  is, no doubt, one of the causes which contri
butes most to the success of the operation.      Besides, expe
rience, according to the acknowledgment of the workmen,
speaks  in favour of this opinion.
    When red sulphurated oxide of mercury       is  prepared,a
                                                            very

                 of   some Oxides   of Mercury.                125
very large quantity of it is pulverized to be converted into       i
vermilion.     This preparation is still a secret among the
Dutch. In every work of chemistry, however, the process
for obtaining it is described. They merely say that the
cinnabar is to be reduced to powder, then washed in water
and driedw This method, which M. Paysse often employed,
gave him always, indeed, for product a very beautiful red
powder ; but it must be allowed that it is inferior in beauty
and the splendour of its colour to that manufactured in
Holland.
     China furnishes painting with     a kind of red sulphurated
oxide    of mercury in powder         (vermilion),    much more
esteemed than that of the Dutch.          It is of a beautiful red
colour, with a shade, the splendour of which nothing can
equal. For some years, therefore, the Dutch have endea
voured to imitate it. M. Paysse saw some prepared in the
manufactories of that country, the process of which is an
other mystery.        This oxide rivals in beauty that of the
Chinese.     He   is  of  opinion that in a little time it will at
tain to the  same    degree of perfection.
     As he was  not    able to obtain any information in regard
to the means employed to imitate this particular preparation,
and suspecting that the splendour of the Chinese sulphurated
oxide of mercury could arise only from the state of oxygena
 tion, more or less advanced, in which the mercury may be
in that combination, he made the following trial : — He took
 a hundred parts of Dutch red sulphurated oxide of mercury,
 and having pulverized thein, put them into a glass capsule
 sheltered from the impression of the solar rays, and covered
 this powder with some cubic centimetres of pure water,
 taking care to stir the mixture for a month with a glass
 tube. At the end of seven or eight days he saw the oxide
 sensibly change, and assume a very agreeable shade. Durino-
 about twenty-five days the splendour of the red increased
 gradually and acquired the utmost beauty.            Having ob
 served that the matter remained in the same state, and that
 it no longer underwent any apparent change, he decanted
 the water, and dried in the shaide and in a gentle tempera
 ture the red sulphurated oxide of mercury.          He compared
  it in this state, and when very dry, with that of the Chi
  nese and that of the Dutch manufactories prepared by their
  secret process, but did not find any sensible difference in
  the splendour or beauty of the red ; so that this very simple
  experiment puts us in possession of a process advantageous
  to the arts, and particularly that of painting, and which
   the Dutch will long keep a secret.
                                                             Being

    It6         On the manufacturing, on a large Scale,
      Being desirous to ascertain whether the air and light alone
   might produce a similar effect on this sulphurated oxide,
   M. Paysse put a hundred parts of the same substance, in
   powder, into a vessel of the same kind, and exposed them
   to the action of a strong light for more than a month.                He
   took care, as before, to renew the surfaces very frequently
   by stirring the matter, in order to multiply the points of
   contact of the sulphurated oxide with the air which served
   it as an atmosphere ; but instead of acquiring a more agree
   able red, it assumeda brick colour inclining to brown. After
  this experiment, there can be no doubt that light has a sen
   sible influence on this substance, and tends to reduce the
  sulphurated oxide of mercury by taking from it a portion
  of oxygen, as it does from most matters of this kind exposed
  to immediate contact.
     Red Oxide    of Mercury     by   Nitric Acid (Red Precipitate).
      This oxide,    so generally known in commerce by its bril
  liancy   and  its beautiful  colour, was also one of the prepara
  tions which M. Paysse had the curiosity to see made in?
  Holland, in order that he might learn the means employed
  by the manufacturers to obtain always a brilliant red of a
  crystalline appearance, similar to that manufactured in Ger
 many, and which comes to us in particular from Nurem
 berg, Franconia, Bale in Swisserland, and from Trieste.
      Every work on chemistry gives a process for preparing
 this oxide ; but few of them agree in regard to the means
 of obtaining a beautiful, lively, and brilliant red. Some,
 after dissolving the mercury in nitric acid, evaporate the
 liquor and expose the matter to a pretty violent heat for
 some hours, in order to decompose the nitrate of mercuryr
 and convert it into red oxide : others pour a certain quantity
 of nitric acid over the first solution when dried and distilled.
 By repeating this operation several times M. Chaptal ob
 tained red precipitate very beautiful and crystallized*.
 Some also, after having dried the nitrate of mercurv, in
 corporate with it a new quantity of fluid mercury; and ex
pose the mixture, when well formed, to a brisk heat of a dark
red colour, between two crucibles luted together.                      V«r>
Mons asserts, that in this manner he obtained, with great
ease, red oxide of mercury perfectly crystallized \.

sufficient to the chemist who is desirous of undertaking
operations on a large scale, or who wishes to apply che
mistry to the arts which depend on it.       Unless one has ac
quired experience in extensive manufactories, and been ha
bituated to the operations used in large laboratories, it will
be impossible to succeed, even after many expensive and
discouraging attempts.
   M. Paysse has often employed the different methods here
spoken of, and proceeded with all the care of one desirous
to succeed ; yet he never obtained results so satisfactory as
he wished.     He, however, adds, that the means proposed
by M. Chaptal are those which were attended with the
most constant success, though it was not complete.           He
varied his processes,      employing nitric acid in different
proportions, and of a different density and purity : but,
notwithstanding the quantity of crystallized oxide which
he obtained, it was not possible for him to account exactly
for the phenomena which occasion so many variations in
the results of this operation, which is apparently nothing,
and which, however, is not performed without great diffi
culty.   So much care is required m the application of the
heat necessary to be employed, that in two operations where
every thing is arranged in the same manner, and where all
the circumstances appear to be absolutely similar, his re
sults were almost always different.      Sometimes one of the
vessels contained a crystallized portion of oxide, while the
other part was a red powder of a brick colour; sometimes,
the whole of the oxide in one of ihe vessels was converted
into a beautiful crystalline precipitate (red oxide of mercury),
and that in the next vessel, which had been treated the
same, exhibited only a mass half yellow and red, without
any appearance of crystallization ; sometimes both vessels
exhibited this oxide converted, in part, into a brilliant ox
ide, and the rest of a disagreeable red ; and sometimes this,
oxide exhibited three very distinct colours, bright red, red
inclining to brown, and orange red.
   The second vessel exhibited only an oxide with two co
lours very distinct, orange and brick red without brilliancy.
"  Where (says M. Paysse) shall we seek for the cause of
these anomalies but in the manner of evaporating the solu
tion, and particularly in that of decomposing the metallic
nitrate during the whole course of the operation ?" We
shall see, however, that the purity of the nitric acid con
tributes also very strongly to render difficult the conversion,
of the mercury into crystallized red oxide, and that the
muriatic acid, with which the former is constantlv mixed in
                                                             the

 1   28    On the manufacturing,      on a large Scale,
 the shops, presents a powerful obstacle when in too strong
 proportions.
     By dissolving mercury in nitric acid mixed with muriatic
 acid there is almost always formed a white precipitate, which
 is the more abundant as the quantity of that acid is greater.
 Without attempting at present to determine the real nature
 of this precipitate, M. Paysse considers only the part which
 this combined substance performs in the oxidation proposed
 to be given to the mercury by decomposing the nitrate of
that basis by the action of heat.
     If crystallized nitrate of mercury, arising from a solution
of that metal in nitric acid mixed -with muriatic acid, be
exposed to heat, this salt first begins to lose its water of
crystallization ; it is then decomposed, suffering to escape
a portion of acid which it contained in excess, and which
may be collected by means of a proper apparatus, because
it has experienced no alteration. This disengagement is
succeeded by that of gaseous nitrous acid, which is mani
fested by very elastic red vapours.       This acid gas is almost
always mixed with oxide of azote, or the latter follows the
disengagement of the former. These two gases indicate
the decomposition of the nitric acid, which gives a portion
of its oxygen to the mercury, and is thereby brought to the
nitrous state, or to that of oxide of azote. By continuing
the heat, the last portions of the nitric acid abandon the
mercury, and the latter is converted into an oxide more or
less saturated with oxygen j indeed, its production seems to
depend on the quantity of caloric which is accumulated
on that substance during its passage to the state of red
oxide.
    When the vapours of the nitrous gas cease, the oxide
changes its .colour, passing successively from white to yel
low, from yellow to orange, and from orange to red, more
or less intense. It is generally when the red is very bright
and beautiful that the vessel is taken from the fire, and the
mass is then preserved as it    is, or reduced to powder.
     It would seem, on the first view, that an operation con
ducted as above ought to give, for constant product, an
oxide well crystallized. This, indeed,   is  the case, 1st, When
the nitric acid is   free from muriatic acid, or when the latter
is  in very small quantity 2d, When its density
                            ;                         is  equal to
34 or 38 degrees ;     3d, When the desiccation and decompo
sition of the metallic nitrate have been effected slowly and
in an uniform manner 4th, And when the heat employed

primitive form, as the author, on several occasions, had an
opportunity of observing.

may be mixed           too great, and

several times remarked in his experiments.               On the other
hand,    if   the proportion be small          may be neglected, and

mercury       by nitric acid — that an acid, as free as possible
from muriatic acid, should be employed — he had remarked
in the experiments which he made every year in his course
of chemical lectures         but not being able to form
                                   ;                           very just      a

he developed            it,
                       to observe with attention what takes place
in  the large operations performed in manufactories where
considerable masses are used at one time. Now that all his

    ti has been already said that the turf employed in the
manufactories of this country has some advantages over the
Other kinds of fuel ; and this remark is true, for an equal
heat may be easily and for a long time obtained, because
this matter burns slowly and in a very uniform manner.
    As charcoal, or the coals found in the bowels of the
earth, are the two combustibles employed most commonly
in France, none of the circumstances here mentioned must
be neglected when they are used.
    By strictly observing all the precautions here indicated*
one will rarely fail to obtain oxide of mercury by nitric acid
of a brilliant red colour and well crystallized.
     Ifthe mercurial mass, notwithstanding all the care taken j
be not brilliant, or does not exhibit the crystalline aspect
required, it must be reduced to coarse powder and again
      into   new earthen vessel, at the bottom of which have
              a
 Eut
   een placed some cubic centimetres of nitric acid only, in
order that the whole of the oxide which        not brilliant may

or two hours' exposure to heat under this apparatus will be
sufficient to convert the oxide into crystallized precipitate.
    Resuming what has been said on the method of preparing
red oxide of mercury        by
                            nitric acid, we see that the condi

that the nitrate may be uniformly decomposed and may
pass as speedily as possible to the state of red oxide.

proportion as the decomposition of the nitrate advances.
   6th, That this temperature may be maintained the same
during the whole time of the operation, that     to say,during

132           On the manufacturing, on a large Scale,
vitrification, as M. Van Mons thinks*; for it would fol
low, if this oxide were really half vitrified by this ope
ration, that a higher temperature would be capable and
ought necessarily to convert it into glass : but nothing ol
the kind takes place ; for I have exposed to a very strong
heat, and at several times, four grammes of this oxide, well
crystallized, in two crucibles luted together, and, instead of
vitrifying, it lost not only its brilliancy but also its fine red
colour, and acquired one of a disagreeable brick red.                  Ex
posing it to a still greater heat, a great part of it was reduced,
and the rest of the oxide acquired a dark brown colour.
    "   I know, however, that there are bodies which are not
Susceptible of passing to complete vitrification, and which
nevertheless experience, at a certain degree of heat, a paste
 like fusion which is called semi-vitriform ; but by heating
 the oxide of mercury in transparent vessels nothing similar
is seen to take place, not the least vestige of a partial or
general softening of the mass is observed.               Besides, I have
 strong    reasons  for  believing   that  the  crystalline state of the
mercury      oxidated  by  nitric  acid  arises  only from the degice
of the oxygenation of that metal, and the uniform manner
in which the oxidating principle combines with the mer
cury during the decomposition of the nitrate of that base,
 and its conversion into red oxide."

 JNothing        remains, in order to make known the memoir
 of M. Pavsse on the oxides of mercury, but to give a short
 view of the other experiments he made in regard to the red
 oxide of mercury by nitric acid (red precipitate) : they form
 the complement of his process given in the preceding ar
 ticle. If this process be followed, it will remove all the un
 certainty of manufacturers who hitherto have not been able
 to prepare this substance as is done in Holland.                   Every
 thing is easy in theory ; but in the arts facts speak much
 better than the most brilliant reasoning.
    To ascertain that the crystalline state of the red oxide of

mercury does not arise froma semi-vitrification, as M. Van
Mons asserts, M. Paysse made a solution of mercury in
nitric acid mixed with some hundredths of muriatic acid.
Having evaporated the solution to dryness, he treated this
matter with the game care and caution as the former ; and
when the operation was finished the mercurial oxide exhi
bited a red aspect, sufficiently beautiful in some parts and
dull in others, but without any appearance of brilliancy or
crystallization.     This mass was pulverized, and again in
troduced into another glass vessel, into the bottom of which
he took the precaution of pouring a small quantity of nitric
acid, that the mercurial powder might be slightly impreg
nated. He then proceeded as before, exposing the vessel
to a gentle and graduated heat.         But, notwithstanding all
the precautions he observed during the operation, the oxide
which was the result of them had passed to red without
exhibiting the least vestige of crystallization or brilliancy.
This experiment was repeated three times, but with no
better success.     It is evident, however, that if the red oxide
of mercury is indebted for its brilliancy only to the senii-
vilrified state it experiences when heated, there is no reason
why this matter should not be constantly in the same state
every time it is prepared, since nothing is necessary, ac
cording to Van Mons, but to apply to it a violent heat be
tween two crucibles luted together.
    In preparing crystallized red oxide of mercury, M. Paysse
made observations which gave him reason to suspect that
the brilliant state of this substance is owing rather to the
 constant degree of the oxygenation in which the mercuiy
 is, than to any other cause, anil that the presence of the
muriatic acid in the nitric acid       an obstacle to the forma
                                       is
tion of that brilliant state  by the new combinations to which
it gives birth during the operation.        What he supposed   is
 uow become certainty, as the following experiments will
 show.
    He took hundred parts of red oxide of mercury, brilliant,
            a
 and prepared     bynitric acid mixed with muriatic acid and,
                                                          ;

 nished with  a  bent glass tube communicating with     a   pneu
 matic apparatns, they were gradually heated till the bottom
 of the vessel became red. He suffered to escape the whole
 of the atmospheric air contained in the apparatus, that he
 might obtain, free from mixture, the oxygen gas furnished
 by  the oxide.    Having exposed the matrass to heat for       a
 sufficient time, and waited for the complete reduction of

the mercurial oxide, he suffered the whole to cool, and
diluted it. He then decanted the mercury, and collected the
whole which adhered to the neck of the matrass : its total
weight was 0*81. The receiver which had served to collect
 the oxygen gas was obscure, and indicated that a small

he surrounded the receiver with pounded ice; and when the
receiver had cooled for an hour he conveyed the gas into
another vessel, and collected with care the whole of the mer
 curial oxide which lined the inside of the vessel.          Slight
friction with the finger against the glass was sufficient to
 effect the reduction of    it,  ami to collect    in globules
                                                  it                 in   a
brilliant state. Its weight was 0'02, which with the 0-81
found in the matrass gave 0-83, The neck of the latter
vessel exhibited snrall white crystals, which he collected
with care: their weight amounted to about O'Ol and their:
 taste and other chemical properties convinced him that they
 were hyper-oxygenated muriate of mercury.               A reddish
 powder inclining    to  brown   lined also   part
                                              a     of ihe dome of
 the matrass, which    it  was necessary to break before      could
                                                               it
be collected.    When carefully examined he found in            the
                                                                it

 mentioned in the beginning of this memoir, and which- he
 calls muriate of mercury with excess of oxide its weight

 was 0-03 . By these results        it  seen that the quantity of
                                         is
 oxygen was 0'13.         The same experiments being repeated
«veral times in succession, the results were always the
 same as the preceding.
    A hundred parts of red oxide of mercury, very brilliant
 and well crystallized, and prepared with nitric acid free
 from muriatic acid, were treated in the same manner as in
 the preceding experiments the reduction of the oxide was
                                :
 complete, and the products were exactly 0*82 of mercury
 and 0*18 of oxygen.
    M. Faysse treated in the same manner red oxides of mer
 cury prepared in the Dutch manufactories and those he ob
 tained by  his own trials the proportions of the principles
                            :
 which constituted these oxides, all very brilliant, exhibited
 variations very little sensible. They amounted only to nearly
a   hundredth part ;    so that   it may be considered as certain
 that crystallized  red   oxides  of mercury are indebted for this
 state to a   combination of oxygen with the mercury, the
 proportions of trie former being always between           8

 XXI.   Facts relative to a nondescript Aquatic Animal.
             By Mr. John Snart, Optician.
                        To   Mr. Tilloch.
.Herewith I send you the exact drawing of a very sin
gular aquatic creature 1 have lately discovered residing in
ponds in which the frog, &c. is generated from the first
rudiments or spawn of the parent and brought forth in the
tadpole state; in which stage of being it becomes the prey
of the said creature ; without the persecution of which, I
am persuaded frogs would infinitely more abound than at
present.-
'  The creature   in question is of a most curious construc
tion ; having six legs, with the feet armed with talons, two
palpi or feelers, and four antennae with a bifurcated plu-
mated tail.    The body is divided into ten semi-crustaceous
lobes somewhat like the armadillo (exclusive of the head
and neck, which form two more), by means of the joints of
which he is enabled to inflect himself into almost any posture.
The head is flatted like the scollop, and broad ; the mouth
is of the whole width of the head ; and proceeding from the
sides of the superior mandible or upper jaw spring two ten-
tacula-like forceps, which it opens or closes at pleasure ;
these arc curved and pointed like those of the forficula or
common earwig, and with these it seizes its prey, of which
the tadpole seems to be the principal favourite.       Though
                                                      it it,
tadpoles are frequently found much larger than            yet   it
pursues them with the greatest confidence.       When     over
takes them  it   punctures their skin with its forceps, and,
after lacerating them so as to fetch blood, drags them
towards its mouth   x   into which   it  receives the effusion.
                              14             •               So

136             On a nondescript  Aquatic Animal.
So insatiably voracious is this little water dragon (if may  I
use an appropriate epithet for want of a name), that in the
space of a few hours (anil that in, the night), out of about
eighteen, it had killed, and withal much maimed, no less
than eight or ten tadpoles, most of which were bigger than
itself; and could it have made the same rapid progress in
the water which tadpoles do, I have no doubt they would
all have fallen a sacrifice to this little sanguinary tyrant,
who (with short intervals of rest after a full meal) is inces
santly rovinsj in search of blood !
     At first sight it appeared to be of the binocular class ; but
taking a good magnifier, I observed the eyes to be com
posed of two annular clysters, not reticulated, but each
containing six distinct, roundish, bright, black orbs, at
6mall distances from each other ; the intermediate spaces,
as well as more considerable ones, in the centre of each
cluster, being of a piece with the colour and texture of the
 skin of the other parts of the body, which, with some little
variegated exceptions on the back of the head, is of a co
 lour resembling the mud of the Thames water, of the tex
ture of that of a common shrimp, and like it (when alive)
 of a semi-transparent nature. Indeed the divisions of the
 whole body are more like this than any other creature I
 have yet seen.      But its conformation in all other respects
 is quite as dissimilar as I have stated.
     When it seizes its prey, if exceedingly vulnerable like
 the tadpole, it lacerates it so deep as to make the forceps
 meet and even cross in the punctures, when it amuses and
 gratifies itself by working them in and out until the blood
 flows from the wounds, at which time they are alternately
 withdrawn and applied to the mouth, as if to taste the gore
 with the one, while the captive is detained by the other;
 which if it approves, the poor struggling victim is drawn
  there too ; but if otherwise, it contents itself by repeated
  lacerations uutil its imaginary enemy is dead, as was the
  case with a common earth-worm I threw into the water,
  and several flies, which were never drawn towards the
  mouth at all ; while the tadpoles are exhausted of their
  blood until they become a mere skin with a small propor
  tion of gelatinous matter left in it ; for their adversary seems
  pot to have convenient organs for entire deglutition, or he
  would no doubt quickly destroy the whole subject: but
  owing to the narrowness of the neck, and its crustaceous
  texture, the oesophagus is incapable of expansion to any
  considerable degree ; yet this incapacity on his part is no
              7                                             security

security to the other, seeing they are almost cut in two by
their being brought into    so close contact with the mouth of
their destroyer, and quite drained of their very vitals.
   Thus nature, as if to counteract her wonted profuse fe
cundity in this diminutive scale of beings on the one hand,
seems on the other to have made this formidable nonde
script adversary to thin the race.      So tenacious is he of his
        that, having once fastened on, he will bear to be
Srey,
  rawn quite out of the water, and held for some minutes
suspended by the hold he has taken by the forceps ere he
will let go his victim ; and so determinately undaunted as
to bear to be lashed with a small twig, which he has the
hardiness to endure. The opening of .his forceps seems to
fascinate his victims ; they become, as it were, transfixed
by torpor, and riveted to the spot, though naturally capable
of swimming much faster than their enemy.
   One particular more which I observed may not be amiss
to notice, which          is,
                       the ebbing and flowing of the blood,
which does not appear to circulate through all the parts, but
 by a kind of modulatory motion, or rather pulsation, pro
ceeds and recedes towards and from the head to about half
way down the body in one entire mass. Though without
doubt the whole frame         visited by this vital principle, yet
                                  is
it    in such small quantities as to elude the most minute
     is

                 I                          and   it;           if
                                                     the quantities
were not, indeed, very minute,          could not but be visible

limpid like water, but of so sanguine           tint as to give the

made myself acquainted with,          shall not venture to deter

XXII.   On Elasticity.  By Alexander Tilloch. An
   Essay read before the Askesian Society in the Session
   1802-3.
At    isnot my intention      the present paper to enter upon
                                       in
any inquiry respecting the laws             by
                                      which elasticity acts, as
they have often been investigated already, and are well
known to every one acquainted with the first elements of
mechanics.        mean merely to confine myself to
                      I                                   a  few
thoughts on the physical cause of elasticity, or that pro
perty of bodies which enables them, after any external pres
sure, to restore themselves to their former figure.
   The cause of elasticity has been proposed to be accounted
for in various ways. The Cartesians held that        itwas a ne
cessary consequence    of their  materia  subtilis, or matter   of
the second   element,  making   an effort to pass through pores
too narrow for it.      Thus, when      straight elastic body
                                                 a              is
bent      by
         any force, the pores become contracted on the con
cave side, and,      they were before spherical, become for
                          if
instance elliptical, or of some other form; and the materia
                                                        subtilis,

                               On Elasticity.                      13{)
    subtilis, hindered in its attempt to pass, makes an effort
    to restore the body to its first state.    In this theory there is
    something like the effort of a strong mind when first seizing
    upon a new truth, and endeavouring to reduce it to a de
    pendence on and connection with known or admitted facts ;
    but the defects in the reasoning ought to have convinced
    its supporters, that a more satisfactory way of accounting
    for the phenomenon was still a desideratum. It must be
    obvious to any person who will take the trouble to ana
    lyse the argument, that if the materia subtilis in a spherical
    cavity could by pressure (being hindered at the same time
    from passing off) accommodate itself to the same cavity
    rendered elliptical, that in doing so it has in fact become
    smaller in volume than it was before. The materia subtilis
    is thus assumed to be compressible ; and, as it makes an
    effort to restore the body, or, in other words, its cavities, to
    the first form, it is assumed to be expansive. But what
     does this amount to ? Merely that a body is elastic because
    it contains elastic matter.
        Other philosophers, disliking the materia subtilis of the
     Cartesians, have adopted an ethereal medium. Their mode
     of reasoning, however, is so similar to that of the former,
     that they leave the mind as unsatisfied as before.         Indeed,
     the mere change of a name can throw no new light upon
     the subject.
        Some account for elasticity by supposing that when an
     elastic body is bent or compressed a number of^Iittle vacui
     ties are formed in  it,  anu that on removing the force the
     pressure   of the  atmosphere,     endeavouring to destroy the
•
     vacuities thus formed, restores the body to its first figure.
     This doctrine, however plausible,     is inadmissible,  if   for no
     other, for this one reason — Many bodies require greater
                                     :                       a
     force to bend them to any given degree than can be found
     by multiplying the number of square inches in their surface
     by  14 pounds, the force exerted by the atmosphere on            a
     square inch ;   besides, the phenomena of elasticity manifest
     themselves in vacuo.
        Others assume that all bodies contain air       in their vacui
     ties, and ascribe their elastic property to that of the air in
     closed in them. This       islittle more than  a   substitution of
     air for the materia subtilis, and the ether assumed     by  others.
     But whence has air itself the property of elasticity     ?     This
    is   a  part of the general inquiry, and as necessary to be
     solved as the source whence other bodies derive the same
     property.
        Others account for elasticity from the law of attraction,
                                                                 applied

 UO                       On Elasticity.
  applied with so much success, since the time of Newton,
 to the solution of many other of the phenomena of nature ;
 and we are inclined to think that the more this subject is
 investigated the more will it appear that it acts an important
 part in producing those effects ascribed to elasticity.        Ac
 cording to this theory, when an elastic body is struck or
 bent so that the component parts, or portions of them, are
 moved a little from each other, but not beyond their spheres
 of attraction, they must, on the cessation of the applied
 force, spring back to their natural state.
     Repulsion also has been held to be the cause of elasticity
 in the case of aeriform fluids, and this repulsion is ascribed
 to the presence of heat.      In this case repulsion is not made
use of as the last term of our knowledge, but merely as
expressive of a certain state of action ascribed to another
cause.     Some, however, make use of the expression with
out so denning      it,and,
                          if    they mean any thing at all, use
it  to express an abstract property of which they know not
the cause.      We may therefore observe, in passing, that
this term should be used as seldom as possible in philoso
phical subjects, and never unless the author has defined the
sense in which he employs it.
    Another theory has been proposed, which has been ad
mitted   by  many as sufficient to account for all the pheno
mena,    not  of the elasticity of bodies only, but of matter in
general.     This  theory, which has the celebrated Boscovich
tor its author, supposes that the whole matter of the uni
verse consists of   a  great but finite number of simple, indi
visible, inextended atoms, endued with repulsive and at
tractive forces, which vary and change from the one to the
other according to circumstances pointed out in his System
of Natural Philosophy, of which good account may be seen
                                   a
in the Supplement to the Encyclopcedia Britannica, under
Boscovich. The most sineular part of the system            is, that
his atoms, in their least anJ innermost distances, repel each
other, and this power of repulsion increases as the distances
arc diminished  :   in sensible distances they attract each other,
and this power decreases as the squares of the distances         in
crease, constituting universal gravity   :   between the inner
most repulsive force and the outermost attractive one, in

and attraction begins, increases, lessens, and vanishes, till,
at   a certain increase of distance, the force becomes repul

slowly, sometimes more rapidly, and sometimes one of                the
forces may come to nothing and then return back to the
same kind without passing to the other.            And for all this,
it seems, there is full   room    in   the distances    that are in
sensible to us, seeing     the   least   part   of  space is divisible
in infinitum.
    Assuming all this, and exhibiting         a curve and other ne
cessary appendages    to assist the  mind    in  comprehending his
theory, the author applies it to explain all the phenomena
of the material universe, assuming also in his progress such
forms and arrangements as are required to make the system
apply to the properties possessed by matter in those modi
fications which distinguish and divide it into classes : thus
solid bodies are formed of parallelopipides, fibres, and of ir
regular figures, occasioning a greater cohesion than in fluids,
and preventing the motion of the parts round one another;
so that when one part is moved the rest follow.                Those
bodies whose particles are placed in limits which have strong
 repulsive arches within them are harder ; those are softer
whose particles have those arches of repulsion weaker.
When the particles are placed in limits that have weak
 arches of repulsion and attraction on each side, the body is
 flexible; and, if those arches are short, the particles may
 come to new limits of cohesion, and remain bent : but if
 the arches are longer the repulsion and attraction may act,
 and restore the body to its former position ; nay, in doing
 this with an accelerated velocity, the parts will pass their
 former limits, and then vibrating backwards and forwards
 exhibit that effect which is called elasticity.
    On this theory we shall only observe, that whatever con
 viction it may carry to minds habituated to profound ma
 thematical investigations, it can convey but little informa
 tion to a man who merely aims at a knowledge of the pro
 perties of matter, as consisting, not of inextended atoms,
 but of such moleculae as occupy sensible space.            What the
 wiser is such a man for being told that certain forces exist,
 and that some idea may be formed of their mode of ope
 rating by conceiving them to act in the directions of certain
 curves, and with powers varying according to circumstances?
 He may assent to this ; but as his weak mind can conceive
 nothing of matter inextended, cither in itself or in its atoms,
 he cannot consider his difficulties as solved by merely hav
 ing them staled to him in a new form ; for to him the whole
  of this system appears to be no more at best but a regular
 mathematical statement of those operations of matter, the
 causes of which he still wishes to explore.
                                                            C. Barruel

142                         On Elasticity.
   C. Barruel    has proposed       a   theory different in some re
spects from any of those       have mentioned, — more in ap
                                I
pearance, however, than in reality.    He contends that ca
loric acts a great share in the phenomena of elasticity, and
maintains that it is itself elastic in consequence of the pro
perty which the moleculae of this fluid have of repelling each
other : a property, he says, the more probable as it is ob
served in the electric fluid, with which caloric has so great
an analogy.         " In a word," says Barruel,         "   we may be
satisfied with admitting its elasticity as a fact from which
we may set out as from an incontestable principle." To
enter at great length into this theory, an account of which
may be seen in the sixth volume of the Philosophical Ma
gazine, p. 52, would encroach too much on our present
time.      The author presents, in his memoir on this subject,
some curious thoughts, and well worthy of a perusal. It
is only necessary here, however, to state in few words the
substance of his reasoning.            1st, Every body in nature is
porous, and these pores are proportioned to the density of
the substance : 2d, These pores are filled with different
fluids, and principally with caloric.           But caloric possesses
a strong repulsive force ; from which it follows, that, when
an elastic body is compressed, the caloric in its pores drives
back, by its repulsive power, the displaced parts, and brings
them to their former state.
   On this theory it may be observed, that however true it
may be that caloric acts a distinguishing part in the phae-
nomena of elasticity, the author seems to have made hardly
any other use of the fact than to put that substance in the
place of the materia sitbtilis and ether of the earlier philo
sophers.      He assumes too that it necessarily possesses elas
ticity ; but he ought either to have first proved                it,or at
least to have     demonstrated,     that     if
                                             that property    be  not in
herent    in caloric,   there  could  be no   elasticity  in other  mat
ter. In short, were      it   even proved that caloric      is  naturally
and essentially elastic, and the cause of elasticity in other
matter, still the main question would remain unsolved,
which would then be — What               the physical cause of elas
                                        is
ticity  in  caloric?
   Libes makes elasticity to depend on caloric interposed
either between the molecula? of bodies or combined with
them, and at the same time on the attractive force of these
moleculae.      "  This being premised," says he, " say thatI

bined   effect,  which    depends   in  part  on   the   repulsive force

      I  should have been glad to have been able to have given
 something more of Libes's theory than this short notice,
 especially as this little seems to approach nearer to my ideas
 of the true theory than any thing I have yet noticed ; but
  I   know not in what work it is given. This notice is from
  the Journal de Physique, vol. 1. p. 10. an 8.
       Thus have I given a short account of all the theories that
  have been advanced to account for the phenomena of elas
  ticity ; or, at least, of all I recollect worthy of notice. Some
* of them, we have seen, in
                                   passing, fall entirely short of the
  object they aim at, and are therefore unworthy of further
   notice.     In others, however, the mode of- argument is so
   well managed^ that had their authors attended to a single
   fact or two, which they have overlooked, it is probable that
   the subject would, before this time, have received that full
   elucidation of which I believe it is capable.
        Like those who have gone before me, I may fail in the
   task I have imposed upon myself; but t hope to avoid in
   consistency or unfair assumptions. It does not appear neces
    sary to admit even that elasticity belongs to matter consi
    dered simply. Indeed, I think the contrary is the fact. But
   that my meaning may not be mistaken, I shall explain in
   as few words as possible this part, which may be considered
    as fundamental, of the doctrine I mean to propose.              By
    simple matter I mean the primitive molecular, or atoms, of
    which bodies are formed. However complex may be the
    state in- which Ave find bodies, they consist of elementary
    principles, which principles themselves are formed perhaps
    of others, but ultimately of inelastic atoms of simple mat
    ter.    Let us, for example, take some matter considered as
    simple and elementary, say caloric, I would affirm of it that
    it is not necessarily elastic ; and so of any other simple
    matter.
        But if elasticity be not essentially necessary to matter
     considered simply, whence do bodies derive that property ?
   "I answer, From the same source whence tbey derive almost
     every other quality that belongs to them — from their com
     position and internal arrangement.
         I would have said  all   their qualities, instead of limiting
     the expression to almost all of them, but that they possess
     one property which may, and probably does, depend on some
     other cause, I mean that of attraction.          Of the cause.of
     this we know nothing ; but its existence and the laws by
     which it acts being known, philosophers do not fail to avail
                                                             themselves

 themselves       of them in explaining     those    phenomena   into
 which  they enter.
                                        I
   In our present inquiry, then, mean to derive from at
traction the help it offers in explaining the cause of elasti
city ; and I hope to make it evident, by a due considera
tion of attraction as common to all matter, and of the laws
by which caloric constantly endeavours to maintain an equi
librium, not only among systems of bodies, but throughout
each individual mass, that the efforts of these two, to main
 tain their respective powers over matter, and, in doing so,
 acting according to known and invariable laws, produce all
 those phaenomena to which the term elastic has been applied,
 whether in solid or in aeriform substances.
    I would say, then, that attraction, which pervades all mat
 ter, and caloric, which also pervades all matter, by their pre
 sence, and by an action in which both participate, occasion
 elasticity wherever it exists. Not that elasticity must follow
as a necessary consequence of their presence, for then every
substance in nature would be elastic, which many are not
in the common sense of the word. Certain other conditions
are necessary to elasticity ; but without these two it could
not exist.
    It is admitted by all that attraction is the cause of the
aggregation of the moleculae of bodies. When the state of
aggregation is such, that on the application of a given degree
of mechanical force to the body the attraction of the mole
culae is overcome (or the body broken), it is called brittle :
if the attraction is only partially deranged, the body will be
found to have changed its form, and is then called flexible i
when the body springs back, or, after certain vibrations,
recovers its form, it is called elastic.
    Many metallic bodies which are flexible in the sense just
mentioned, may however by hammering be rendered elastic;
that   is,   merely bringing their moleculas into more inti
             by
mate union, or        by
                      bringing them reciprocally more within
the spheres of each other's attraction.     This        circum
                                                       is   a
stance which ought not to be lost sight of.         Let us for    a
moment then inquire what takes place in the process, be
sides bringing the particles of the body more nearly into
contact, or more of them into actual contact than were in
that state before    ?When bar of metal
                                a             hammered thin

expelled or driven out of it.       Ineed not, however, insist
on its being exactly equal   in  volume, as my present argu
ment only requires that certain quantity of caloric should
                            a
                                                                 be

be driven out of the mass by the operation ; and   believe  I
in the present state of our knowledge that few will be in
clined to dispute it. As it is, however, of som; importance
to establish this point, I shall, before proceeding further
with the main argument, briefly point out some of the cir
cumstances which seem to prove the escape of caloric : The
bar becomes heated by the operation, and where heat ma
nifests itself, it must be either passing off from or into the
body.     If the capacity of the body be diminished at the
same time, and the chemical properties of the body remain
unaltered, which in the instance under consideration is the
case, how can we mistake the direction in which the caloric
moves ?
   I am aware of what has been advanced respecting friction
by men whose names stand high irt the philosophical world,
and that hammering is a species of friction : but names and
opinions should never be substituted for facts j forj if it be
true, which I deny not, but maintain that hammering is a
species of friction, it would not be difficult to show that it
is equally true that friction is a species of hammering.       But
if by •hammering such a quantity of heat may be driven
from the interior to the surface of a bar as will produce
effects similar to those of a combustible body in a state of
ignition, the caloric in this as in every other case must be
something else than mere motion.           It is subject to certain
laws of motion, like every other species of matter j and like
every other species of matter too, when moved from its
place by any force, putting other matter in the space or
spaces before occupied by it, it must take up another resi
dence.     To produce an accumulation of heat by hammer
ing, repeated and a long continued succession of strokes
are not necessary : proportion the mass of metal to the im
pulse to be applied, and with one stroke you may produce
such a heat as will make the part of the metal where it is
accumulated visible in the dark— r-hot enough to set fire to
a combustible body.
    It may here be also observed that heat is propagated even
through what is usually called a vacuum, that         is,  through
spaces absolutely void of every other species of matter,
which could not possibly take place      if caloric were not sub
stantial for motion         non-entity when we attempt to con

ter, and when we speak        of  its existence   the presence of
matter  is  always implied.    This is an   argument in proof of
the substantiality 01 caloric which no powers of argument
can overturn; for, whatever semblance of truth may attach

to reasonings on motion as connected with matter, it v&*
nishes entirely when the continuity of matter is broken, as
in the case we have stated. But if in the cose of the traps-
mission of caloric through a vacuum, caloric is prqved to
exist independently of motion, why in any other case should
the two be confounded ?
   But to return. —A bar o,f metal by being hammered has a
quantity of caloric expressed from it by mere mechanical
means, without undergoing any chemical change. In pthef
Words, its capacity for holding caloric has been abridged,
without its affinity fof that substance being lessened ; and
the aggregation of the mass has. been increased in a ratio
bearing some proportion to the diminution of its capacity
for caloric.
   When the hammer is first applied to the metal/ the latter
is, comparatively speaking, plastic, and gives, but little re
sistance ; but as the parts ace brought into a closer state of
aggregation the resistance increases, and the hammer recoils
in proportion to the force with which it is applied and the
degree of aggregation the mass has acquired : in other
words, the metal has acquired a degree of elasticity propor
tioned to the time it has. been subjected to the mechanical
process. It appears then that by diminishing the capacity
of the metal for heat, while its natural affinity remains un
altered, it acquires the property of being clastic.
   Let us attend a little to the case before us. When the
metal has received a certain degree of compression from the
hammer, it refuses to receive more, and the hammer recoils >

                        On   Elasticity                     U7
portioned to the force that has been applied. Say that the
curved line AaC represents this depression, and the area
AB Ca its quantity : a quantity of caloric equal to the space
ABC a is momentarily displaced by the blow.
   But in this case an attempt is made to separate, by me
chanical means, a portion of that caloric which the mass
demands by its affinity ; and this law, exerting itself to re
store the equilibrium, takes back the quantity thus violently
attempted to be taken away, and with such rapidity that
the hammer is no sooner at a than it is instantly pushed
out by the reimbibed caloric. Nor is this all : caloric, being
matter, must, when put in motion, obey the same laws
that other matter would in similar circumstances.        The re
servoir that furnishes the supply (vi2. the surrounding at
mosphere) being inexhaustible, instead of the caloric ceasing
to operate when it has brought the surface again to coincide
with ABC, it carries it to *, a distance as far above B, or
nearly so, as a was below it ; and it is not till after repeated
vibrations between these points that the surface at last comes
to rest in its first position.  Any one may satisfy himself
of this fact by letting a hammer fall upon an anvil while
he holds the handle easily in his hand ; it will not give one
but several strokes, proportioned to the force employed.
   When the recoil of the stroke, as it is called, has carried
the surface to I, why does not the mass retain the caloric
(represented by the space A b C B) which it has received by
the effort thus made by its affinity for caloric? — .Because the
affinity of aggregation of the mass forbids it. The two af*
Unities — that of the whole mass for caloric, and that of the
moleculae for each other— find their powers balanced when
the surface comes to rest in the line ABC.
    From what has been stated respecting the effect produced
by the blow of a hammer on a hardened mass of metal, it
will not be difficult to trace the effect that will follow if a
soft bar of metal be interposed. We have seen that a quan
tity of caloric is momentarily expelled from a hardened mass
of metal when struck by a hammer, and asquickly reimbibed
with an increase of quantity.     When such a bar is struck
on an anvil with a hammer, there is a displacement of the
caloric from the part struck ; and at the same time an in
crease in the aggregation of the moleculre in the same part,
 that is, an increase of its elasticity.   The quick return of
caloric into the part makes the hammer recoil but the mo
                                               by} the blow, the
leculae having been brought closer together
caloric finds less lodging-room than before, and of course
an increase of temperature follows   ;   for the affinity of the

mass     for caloric is lessened as its molelulx are brought
closer tdgether.     A second blow is followed by a like effect,
which is in like manner increased by succeeding blows.           It
is necessary, however, that these be given in such quick
succession that the bar may not have time between to give
off its caloric to surrounding bodies. If this be attended to.
an accumulation of caloric must take place in the bar ; for
by the second blow a larger quantity of heat is displaced
        by the first, ai>d consequently a larger quantity is im-
  »ibed to be affected by the third blow ; the quantity dis-
than
  laced by each blow being proportioned to that which was
E efore present, and the quantity newly imbibed being pro-
              to what was displaced by the last blow.         This-
  act, with some latitude, will always be found to hold true.

his forge without any other heat than what he can furnish
to himself by mesns of his hammer and an iron rod ?
    In the case which we have just examined the phenome
non appears to depend on the displacement of caloric in a
body by an external force, while the affinity of aggregation
endeavours to retain it. Will this be found to hold in other
cases ? — Yes, making allowance for the difference of cir
cumstances.
    Let AB (fig. 7.) represent a spring of steel or any other
metal.      By any external force let it be bent into the form
CD. It is plain that one side of the. spring has been elon
gated and the other shortened.
    But the spring before flexure had its molecular respec
tively at those distances or in that ai?angemcut in which
they best balanced each other ; that        is,
                                              the mutual effort of
all was to keep the spring     in   the state     exhibited before
                                                  it
any    external  force was  applied ; and  the  quantity of caloric
resident in the mass was distributed throughout            in
                                                           propor
tion to the affinity of all the parts.
    Let the proportion of caloric proper to any part of the
mass in any common temperature be represented                   by
                                                                the
space comprehended between the two parallel lines              and
                                                                A
                                                                b
cd.
  When      the bar  is bent, the lines al and cd are made to
approach each other, as at on the concave side, and to re
                              e
cede on the convex side, suppose to     f  and g, so that they
no longer remain parallel.      In other words,     quantity of
                                                       a
caloric has been displaced from the one side, and has found
lodging-room in the other side of the bar and what;         saidis
of this understood of every other part of the spring. But
        is
the affinity of all the parts for caloric havingw undergone no
             1                                         change,

                           On Elasticity.                     ftg
change, it is plain that when the external force is removed
it must   resume its first position in the mass, and, by doing
so, restore it to its former figure, in effecting which the af
finity of aggregation co-operates ; for we have been sup
posing such a Force only applied as could change the form,
while applied, without overcoming the aggregation of the
mass.
    The vibrations which follow, if the spring be left quite
free after force has been applied, may be explained in a way
perfectly similar to what we have already laid down wlien
speaking of a bar struck by a hammer.           The caloric being
put in motion, a larger quantity of it runs from the plus
side to the side that was minus than the affinity of the latter
demands, and is therefore driven back again, and so alter
nately, till by little and little it ceases its motion as equili
brium comes to be established-
    After the bar AB has by any applied force been brought
into the form CD, the caloric, which in the natural state
of the bar resided between b and d, having been forced to
find lodging-room towards a c on the side now rendered
 convex, and the lines a I and cd, or the portions of metal
which they represent, being brought into contact in the
 point e; or, if the possibility of the perfect contact of the
moleculse be denied, as nearly into contact as possible in
 the point e ; then the said point e (and so of any other point
 of the concave surface) becomes a fulcrum over which the
 bar maybe broken if an increased force be applied; for
 all the caloric that can be removed by mechanical means
 from the concave side having been transferred to some more
 convex part of the bar, it must follow, as a consequence,
 that any attempt to make the metallic matter enter spaces
 already occupied by metallic matter must be vain, and can
"only operate to draw the moleculse on the convex side to
 such a distance from each other as to admit foreign matter
 between them, viz. the atmosphere or other surrounding
 medium, after which it will be impossible for them to coa
 lesce again.
    In this way would we account for that effect which has
 hitherto been ascribed to the moleculse being removed to
 such a distance from each other as to place them beyond
 each others sphere of attraction. It is true they are brought
 into such a situation that their attractive affinity cannot
 again unite them as an aggregate ; but we think their attrac
 tion is not annihilated, as the common mode of expression
 may suggest to those who do not properly examine the
 natter. jThere is only a new affinity brought intp play,
                                 K3                           vi

    150                            On Elasticity,
    viz. that of the metallic     moleculae for the newly interposed
    body ; for, could that new affinity be destroyed, or, in other
    words, could the interposed substance be entirely removed,
    it is probable the affinity of the moleculae would again he
    exerted.     Of this some idea may be formed by attending to
    what takes place when two spheres of lead, a little flattened,
    are pressed together.       In proportion as the air has been ex
    cluded will be the adherence of the two balls.
        We would not wish, however, to be understood to assert
    that in every case a disjoined mass would unite but for the
    newly interposed substance, for several conditions are re
     quisite to this effect which can rarely exjst. Among these
     may be mentioned, that there should be no new arrange
     ment of portions of the broken surfaces by the metal having
     by its tenacity drawn itself out into fibrous ligaments and
     protrusions ; for in that case the points of contact upon
    joining the masses are so limited that the very weight of
     either part, that       its gravity for the common centre of
                             is,
     attraction, will act as    sufficient force to destroy the affinity
                                   a
     which exerts itself to keep them united. We may also here
     remark, that in the confused crystallization of melted masses
     of metal, some of the portions may always be conceived tq
     be under some restraint, as        were, and this must hold also
                                        it
     after the metal has been hammered. Therefore on breaking
     the mass some of these will always protrude, or in some
     way or other change their position         little, so as to produce
                                                a
     an effect similar to that before described — reducing to               a
     comparatively small number the points that can be brought
     into contact. Therefore what we mean to suggest                  only
                                                                       is
     this — thatif   every interposed substance could be entirely
     removed, and    it  were possible to bring the priginal number
     of points into contact, the affinity of aggregation would act
     to unite the parts of the mass.
     I    might apply the reasoning employed in the case of the
     spring AB to other pases of solid bodies; but, from what               I
.    have said, I    think any person may apply my reasoning in
     the same way as    I  would myself, whether he be convinced
     of its truth or not to enlarge further appears therefore un
                             ;
     necessary.   It     proper, however, that
                        is                             should endeavour
                                                         I
     to show how the same doctrine applies to aeriform fluids.
        When air   is  compressed, on removing the force           regains
                                                                  it
     its first volume.     This, however,          conditional.
                                                    is              If the
     compressed air be of        given temperature, say 80°, and
                                   a                                        if
    it  be afterwards reduced to       lower temperature, ,say 32°,
                                       a                                    it
     may so happen that the diminution of volume             by reduction
     of temperature may        more   than counterbalance       the  com
                                                                  pressing

                        On Elasticity.                      151
pressing force that was employed.      In this case, then, a
mere abstraction of caloric annihilates a certain quantity
of elastic force which belongs to the air when the common
temperature is higher.
   Again : Inclose a given quantity of air, not compressed,
in any proper vessel, when the common temperature is 30°,
and it will be round when the temperature becomes high,
say 80°, that it has acquired an clastic force which it had
not before.
   The cause is obvious. The air inclosed at 30° has as
Strong ah affinity for caloric wnep the common temperature
comes to 80° as the air not inclosed, but is prevented by
want of roqm from satisfying itself to the. extent of its affi
nity. On opening the vessel, however, the caloric finds an
easy admission; the volume of the mass becomes increased,
aha a quantity equal to this increase discharges itself,
   But when by force we compress air which is to be again
liberated without waiting for any remarkable change of tem
perature, we only accomplish by mechanical means what
nature effects by a mere change of temperature. We ex
press a certain quantity of caloric from the air, while its
affinity for that substance remains undiminished.       Remove
the restraint, and, the affinity exerting itself, a sudden in
crease of volume takes place, exhibiting that phenomenon,
which is usually called elastic force.
   Again ; When a f6ot-ball is struck (and so of similar
Cases) there is a displacement of caloric proportioned to the
force applied and the nature of the covering.       But this is
Only momentary; for, the affinity of the air for caloric re
maining unaltered, a quantity of the latter, more than equal
to what was displaced by the blow,      is,
                                          for the reason before
pointed out, instantly taken in      by the air, and with such
rapidity as to cause the ball to recoil from the foot in the
same manner as     a   hammer docs when struck on an anvil,
but in a  much more remarkable degree; for the recoil will
always be proportioned to the force employed, compared
with the affinity of the bodies for caloric.
   Before concluding, we may observe generally, that every
body in nature may be considered as in some measure
elastic, though many of them cannot manifest that property
to the extent which those bodies usually called elastic can:
that  is,a  certain force may be applied to all of them with
out destroying their form, and     by  the application of that
force certain quantity of caloric may be first accumulated
     a
in and then given off from them. In every case of this
jcind (and they include every species of friction) caloric    is

  first expressed from, and then imbibed, with a surplus
  quantity, into the parts of the body which undergo the
 mechanical action, and it is this circumstance which has
  so much puzzled some philosophers in certain experiments
  on friction.       But as we may possibly lay before the society
 at a future period a few thoughts confined principally to this
 object, we forbear entering further into it at present.
 XXIII.        On the Production of Muriates by the Galvanic
      Decomposition of Water : with a second Letter on the
      Subject from Mr. W, Peel, of Cambridge.
 In      our last volume, page 279, we laid before our readers
 a letter from      Mr. Peel, of Cambridge, announcing the pro
 duction of muriate of soda by the Galvanic decomposition
 of water.       That communication we considered as extremely
 important, and we suggested that such experiments as Mr.
  Peel was engaged in, might possibly lead to some know
 ledge of the composition of soda and the base of the mu
 riatic acid.
      The letter alluded to was dated the 23d of April last, and
 published in our number for that month.                    We have been
 not a little gratified since in finding that our suspicion has
 been in some degree confirmed by M. Cuvier's report of the
 labours of the Class of the Mathematical and Physical Sci
 ences of the French National Institute from the 20th of
June 1804 to the 20th of June A 805, published on the 25th
 of the last-mentioned month *. One of the articles of this
 report states, that M. Pacchiani, of Pisa,, has discovered,
 the radical of the acid in question, which he states to be
 hydrogep.         By taking from water, by means of the Gal
vanic pile, a portion of its oxygen, he asserts that the water
 was converted into oxymunatic acid ; and that, conse
 quently, " muriatic acid is hydrogen at its minimum of
 oxidation     f;  the oxymuriatic acid, hydrogen in the middle
 state ; and water, hydrogen at its maximum of oxidation."
      The following letter was intended for our last number,
but did not reach us in time.               It will be found as interest
ing to our philosophical readers as Mr. Peel's former com
munication.           The result of his new experiment, so far as
    • Part of this report  is given in our present Number.
    f  In our 6th vol. p. 1.13, we announced that Girtanner maintained hydro
gen to be the radical of the muriatic acid, and that this acid contained lest
oxygen than water.
                                                                         the

|he muriatic acid is concerned, is the same as that before
communicated ; but in this instance he has obtained a dif
ferent alkali, — a kind of proof that the alkalis, as has for
some time been suspected, are not essentially very different
from each other.
                                                               June 4, 1805

Permit me to say, I feel myself much indebted to you for
your suggestions *, which have led me to the discovery I
now send you.
  "   Having proceeded to the formation of water from its
elements, with which to repeat my former experiment, I
found, when the oxygen and hydrogen gases were quite
pure and exactly in due proportion, that no residuum of
air was left, and that the water formed was not in the
slightest degree acidulous.    When the process was not
conducted with great accuracy, or any precaution to have
it accurate was omitted, I then found the water acidulous,
and the acid that caused this acidity to be the nitric acid.
    " The acidulous water thus obtained I neutralized with
lime, from which I distilled the water, and this water I de
composed by the Galvanic process, as in the experiment
detailed in my former letter.
  "    I did not imagine the using water so obtained could
make the least difference on the result of the experiment ;
but as you had expressed a wish to have the trial made, I
again undertook that interesting but very tedious labour.
    " When I came to examine the residuum, to my great
astonishment I found that not muriate of soda hut muriate
 of potash was produced !
  "    I must own I feel myself entirely at a loss how to ac
 count for this, nor shall I attempt it. All I can say                   is,
 that this, as well as my former experiment, was conducted
 with the greatest care and accuracy that       could bestow.

mistake in the experiment detailed in this or in the former
letter j but till some person possessed of as much ingenuity
and patience as Mr. Peel shall prove his experiments to be
erroneous, we shall not question their accuracy*.     Indeed,
we had a suspicion that the result might possibly be affected
by using water obtained from different sources, or distilled
from different substances, and it was this suspicion that
induced us to recommend to Mr. Peel a repetition of the
experiment under new circumstances.
   We may remark here, that Guyton suspects potash to
be composed of lime and hydrogen.        In the present expe
riment lime was employed to neutralize the acid in the
water made use of; and though the water was distilled
from the lime, it does not appear to us impossible that a
small portion of it might be carried over. Indeed, if Guy-
ton's opinion be well founded, it is very probable this was
the case.   Hydrogen the water would furnish by its de
composition.
   We have not been, informed of the nature of the residuum
left by distilling the water made use of in Mr. Peel's first
experiment j that       is,

                                    a
other circumstances coinciding, might be all that was wanted
to determine the kind of alkali to be formed.
   Could the result depend at all on the circumstance of
nitric acid having been previously in mixture with the
water     In the production of nitre (nitrate of potash) from
          ?
the corruption of animal and vegetable substances, possibly
the previous formation of the acid from its elements has
some share in determining the formation of that alkali for
which     has the greatest affinity.

use of to ascertain the nature of the products he obtained.  We are certain
such information, in addition to what he has already given, would prove ac-

conducting such labours may determine the production of
very different substances.
   In short, it seems probable that some of those substances
which in the present state of our knowledge we are obliged
to consider as the most simple elements, such as oxygen,
hydrogen, and azote, are, in fact, compounds ; and it so,
the formation of one or more of these may take place under
circumstances in which we should not expect them to be
present, and may produce such results as those now under
consideration.
   This subject is extremely interesting, and we hope Mr.
Peel and other philosophers will continue to give it that
attention which Us importance seems to demand. — A. T.

 If excursions confined       to the countries of Europe can fur-
 pish matter for so many useful works and for so many va
 luable comparisons, and if slight differences in the physical
 constitution of the soil, in its temperature, and in its pro
 ductions, could give rise in all ages to grand ideas and im
 portant theories, how fertile in the most valuable results of
 every kind must be distant navigations !
    The traveller in voyages of this kind, transported, as we
 may say, on the wing6 of the wind, traverses in a few
 months the most different climates ; distances vanish, and
 small differences disappear along with them. The large
 masses alone can strike hiin ; and they are every where re
 produced with an opposition, and contrasts so great and so
 numerous, that the coldest imagination cannot fail to be
 interested in such a spectacle.         In one place, the summit
 pf the Peak of Teneriffe, which has been rendered celebrated
 by the valuable researches of M. Humboldt, seems to un
 fold before him the history of the grand catastrophes of na
 ture, and of their effects j while in another he sees rising at

 I SO               On some zoological Facts
 he extremities of the Austral world those bulwarks of gra
nite which she seems desirous of opposing to the fury of
<he boundless ocean.      He soon arrives on the barren coasts
of the west and north-west side of New Holland, where
the phaenomenon of the acquisitions made by the land pre
sents itself with all the interest of which it is susceptible.
In vain does he pass along coasts of two or three hundred
leagues in extent ; he every where observes eternal downs
of white sand, which extend into the country as far as one
can penetrate.    The numerous islands he meets with exhibit
to him a similar constitution ; and the banks of sand, so
frequent in these dangerous seas, have no other. But the
fertile mountains of Timor already begin to appear; an
eternal vegetation every where covers them with its rich
productions : they are continued in large gradations, which
rise more and more towards the interior of the land. Every
thing is new in its aspect : he no longer sees those lacerated
forms, those blackened peaks, and those threatening craters
of Teneriffe, and of the Isles of France and of Bourbon ;
those striking and majestic masses of South Cape, Cape
Pele, and Cape Frederick- Henderick         in Van Diemen's
Laud ; much less that monotonous and tiresome aspect of
the sandy coasts of New Holland.        None of these pictures
are applicable to the mountains of Timor.          Their forms,
though large,   are softened ; their prolongations  are regular;
their summits are broad, and sink down gradually by "slight
undulations, which disappear on the sea shore: in a word,
every thing announces here the tranquillity of the tropics,
and the peaceful action of nature and of time.
    Amidst objects so grand, with terms of comparison so
prodigious, the study of nature then more striking, is also
more easy : all the petty objects of detail, the modern effects
of a multitude of secondary causes, disappear, as we may
say, before the grand ensemble of nature, and cease to oc
cupy in our annals the too important part which they
have been so many times made to perform .          But we may
safely affirm, that we shall have no real theory of the earth
till the glorious period when the sciences can reckon among
their votaries men desirous of emulating Humboldt. What
he has done in regard to America ought to be done in re
gard to many distant countries and so many archipelagos
still unknown.      At the head of the latter appears New
Holland, an immense country, hitherto little explored, but
worthy of the attention of the governments much more than
the naturalists of Europe.

Zoological Observations which may excite Doubts in regard
  to the primitive Union of New Holland and Van Diemen's
  Land.
    Of all the observations which may be made in proceeding
from Van Diemen's Land to New Holland, the easiest, no
doubt the most important, and perhaps also the most in
explicable,    is,the absolute difference of the two races who
inhabit these two lands. If wc except, indeed, the meagre-
ness of the extremities, which            observed equally among
                                            is
both people, they have scarcely any thing common in their
manners and customs, in -their rude arts, in their imple
ments for hunting or fishing, in their habitations or piro-
guas, in their arms or language, in the whole of their phy
sical constitution, in the form of the cranium, or                 in
                                                                 the
proportions   of the  face.    This  absolute dissimilarity appears
also in the colour      the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land
                          :
being browner than those of New Holland                appears also
                                                          5   it
in character hitherto considered as exclusive, namely, the
   a
nature of the hair.       That of the inhabitants of Van Die-
men's Land      is short, woolly, and curled that of the New
                                                      ;
 Hollanders straight, lank, and stiff.
    Now how can        be conceived that an island of 60 leagues
                      it
 in extent at most, so near to an immense continent, situ
 ated also at the extremities of the Austral world, and sepa
 rated from every other known land                   by
                                                 the enormous           di
stances of five, eight, twelve, and even fifteen hundred
 leagues, should have        race of men altogether different from
                               a
that of the neighbouring continent           How can we conceive
                                             ?
this exclusion of all relation, so contrary to our ideas in
regard to the communication and transmigration of nations                 ?
How can we account for the darker colour, and curled
woolly hair, in country much colder
                      a                              appears to me
                                                     ?    It
difficult, I  confess, to assign satisfactory reason for these
                                        a
 anomalies.     All these curious facts, which will be detailed
 in the general account of our long voyage, will be new
 proofs of the imperfection of our theories, which are always
suited to the state of the knowledge of the age which gave
birth to them.       At present must be contented with de
                                      I
 ducing from this first part of my observations the important
 consequence, that the separation of Van Diemen's Land
 from New Holland           not one of the modern operations of
                              is
 nature for
       ;       it    probable that
                     is                   these two countries had
                                            if
 been formerly joined they would have had the same race
 for inhabitants, and       would no doubt bave been that which
                              it

 occupies with its ferocious tribes, the whole of the im-*
 mense coasts of New Holland, from Cape Wilson to the1,
 burning coasts of the land of Arnheim and the great gulf
 Of Carpentaria.
   Another zoological fact tends still further to confirm this
distinction, if not primitive at least very old, between New
Holland and Van Diemen's Land. The dog, that animal
so valuable to man, the faithful companion of his misfor
tunes, his travels, and dangers, the indefatigable instrument
of his distant hunting excursions, every where so common
on the continent, ana which we found on all its coasts with
the different hordes we had an opportunity of seeing, doe3
not exist in Van Diemen's Land ; at least we coald observe
no traces of this animal.   We never saw any of them with
the inhabitants, notwithstanding our daily intercourse with
them. The case was the same with M. Labillardiere during
Dentrecasteaux's voyage j and it does not appear that any
other traveller ever saw any. The English whale fishers,
whom I consulted on the subject, confirmed this circunv
stance, that the dog is not found in Van Diemen's Land.
                        Section II.
Zoological Observations tvkich seem to indicate that the
  Summits of the Mountains of Fan Diemen's Land, New
  Holland, and Timor, were formerly covered by the Sea.
    One of the noblest and at the same time most incontest-'
able results of modern geological researches  is,
                                                the certainty
Of the sea having once stood at very considerable elevations
above its present level."  In almost every point of the old
Continent the proofs of this fact are as numerous as they are
evident. They appear with interest in different parts of the
 hew world ;   and M. Humboldt has lately cormrrtmicated to
 us a very  curious circumstance of this kind. In this point
 of view, as well as in many others, New Holland and Van
 Diemen's Land remained to be examined as they might
                                              5
have formed an exception of sufficient importance to induce
a  very rigorous philosopher to deny the universality of the
antient domination of the ocean, however favourable reason
ing and analogy might be to it. Fortunately this deficiency
was one of those which, depending only on the existence of
a  fact, could be easily supplied
                                :   itappears to me thatit   is
completely so at present.    On Van Diemen's Land indeed,
On several points of New Holland, and on the summits of
the mountains of Timor,  I    every where met with those va
luable remains^ which may be considered as irrefragable tes
timonies of the revolutions of nature.

             applicable to the "theory  of the Earth.         159
    In the rapid view which      I am going to take of my result*
in this   respect, I shall treat  in succession of what relates to
fossil shells and zoophites.        One of the principal reasons
of this distinction, the importance of which I shall soon
have occasion to prove, is the almost absolute exclusion of
every large kind of solid zoophites after the 34th degree of
south latitude, beyond which I observed only the difficult
and orbicole tribes of the sponges, the alcyons, flustres, and
 some milleporcs.
                        A. Petrified Shells,
    It would be too tedious and useless to enter here into the
 details   of all my observations on this subject : it will be
sufficient for me to give an account only of the principal
 results.
    At Van Diemen's Land, towards the bottom of the
North River, I observed, at the height of six or seven
hundred feet above the level of the sea, large masses of
 petrified shells, all belonging to the lime genus of Lamarck,
and constituting a species to which I could find none living
analogous in the same places.
    On several points of the east coast of the island Maria
there are seen regular horizontal strata, consisting of a
kind of whitish shelly freestone resting on granitic rocks,
at the height of four or five hundred feet above the level of
the sea.
    At Kangaroo Island, those of St. Peter and St. Francis*
and that portion of the continent situated behind them, I
made similar observations : I found always some remains
sf petrified shells, at a greater or less distance, in the in
terior of the country, and at heights more or less consi
derable.
    Vancouver and Mainzies had before observed some in
Port King George, and in that point also I myself collected
several specimens.
    During the interesting excursion which my friend My
Bailly made into the interior of New Holland, ascending
Swan's River for about twenty leagues, he found every
where, as he told me, the ground covered with quartzy
sand mixed with the remains of shells.
    At the Bay of Seals this phenomenon occurs with more
decisive characters. The whole substance of the barren
isles of Dorre and that of Dirk-Hartog consist of freestone,
sometimes reddish and sometimes whitish, filled with
shells of different kinds.
    This composition becomes still more striking at Timor.
              3                                                On

  160                 On some zoological Facts
 On the summit of        those mountains, already mentioned,
 there is found, at the height of more than 1 5 or 1 800 feef
 above the level of the sea, a great number of shells incrusted
 in the middle of the madreporic masses which they form.
 The most of these shells are in the siliceous state : some of
 them, still in the calcareous state, are more or less altered
 and friable.    There are some monstrous ones among them;
 I have seen several individuals, and every person belonging
 to the expedition might have seen them also, which were
 not less than four or five feet in length.      All these large
 shells evidently belonged to the genera hippope and tridacne
Of Lamarck ; and< whit is more important, the fossil in
dividuals have such a resemblance to those of the same
genus found alive on the sea shore at the bottom of the
                    I
mountains, that have thought proper to consider them as
the same in my General Topography of the Bay of Cou-
parig. Even the gigantic proportions of the fossil tridacnes
are found in the living Ones.        I myself saw a valve which
served daily as a trough to five or sfx hogs.       In the Dutch
fort there is another in which the soldiers of the garrison
wash their linen.      The absolute want of colour, common
to the . fossil arid living tridacnes, is another reason for
their" identity.   The case was the same with several kinds'
of zoophites, which, existing still on the coasts, seem to
be so identic with some of those forming the mountains of
that part of the island, that I made no hesitation in con
sidering them as such. Since my return to Europe, how
ever, having had occasion, in examining the beautiful col
lection* of M. Defrance, to remark how easy it is to be
mistaken in this respect, I must freely confess that I can
no longer venture to warrant this identity, however pro
bable it may appear, as my observations were not made
with that minute attention which the subject deserves, and
as whole specimens are not to be found in our collections;
While I     regret that   I suffered so valuable an observation
to escape me, I must mark Timor as the place most proper
for determining the delicate and interesting question in
regard to analogous living individuals, at least in the last
classes of the animal kingdom.
   Before I terminate what relates to petrified shells, it
deems to me indispensably necessary to say a word of in-
crusted   shells, which are too often confounded with the
former.

B. Of Incrustations of different Kindly and particularly the
•incrusted Shells found in different Parts of New Holland.
  One of the particular advantages of extensive navigations
and long voyages          is,
                           that the theatre of observation         isso
much varied, and        objects so multiplied, that nothing              is
often wanting but           asound judgment to make the most
difficult comparisons, and to deduce from them important
consequences.       What man, for example, can see, with
indifference, around him that succession of beautiful in
crustations so frequent on the shores of Kangaroo Island,
on those of the Archipelago, of St. Peter and St. Francis,
and on the shores of the immense Bay of Seals                ? In one
place  whole   trunks    of  shrubs  are  entirely  covered    witji     a
mixed stratum of freestone and calcareous matter, and in
others are accumulated branches of trees, roots, shells,
zoophites, the bones of animals, and excrements of qua
drupeds, concealed under the same covering.                    " One
might    be tempted    to  believe,"  said the  unfortunate    Riche,
" that new Perseus carried the head of Medusa over these
       a
distant coasts."
    On the sight of so many striking singularities, how can
We forbear inquiring into the cause, and how            is    possible
                                                             it
that it  should not be discovered in the particular nature of
the sand on these shores        ?   The numerous shells, indeed,
produced in these seas being continually              rolled      by
                                                                   the
action of the waves on the neighbouring shore, are thus
reduced to very small fragments, which ""being afterwards
mixed with the quartzy sand, soon form with           it a calcareous
cement of        superior quality.
                 a                      In carefully examining its
materials one might be tempted to believe that Dr. Higgins,
in his ingenious Essay on Calcareous Cements, had stolen
the secret of nature. The proportions, indeed, which he
indicates as susceptible of forming the most solid combina
tion, that is, one part of lime and seven of quartzy sand,
are those which nature seems to have adopted for her ce
ment.      But whatever this composition may be,              it   the
                                                                   is
only agent of those remarkable incrustations of which                   I
have spoken.       On the shore       it soon incrusts every body
thrown upon          testacea, zoophites, galets, are all- agglu

his eyes, thebreches and puddingstones of which the neigh
bouring rocks are composed. Transported bv the winds,
this active matter deposits itself on the nearest shrubs. At

I have brought home a great manv fine specimens of this
sort, and the difficulty of transporting them alone prevented
me from bringing back a more considerable number.                 ¦
   What is most singular in this operation of nature                     is,
the speed with which this kind of metamorphosis              effected.
                                                                  is
I have reason, indeed, to believe, from my own observations,
that   ashell,     amonth after its being cast on the shore, can
no longer be distinguished.          The force of the solar rays,
the vivacity of the light reflected           the white sand of the
                                                by
coast,   are   sufficient   ina  few  days,  with  the sea water, to
deprive       of
             it   its  colour,   and  to  disorganize      in such
                                                             it          a     .
manner, that in the middle of the calcareous stratum which
has already seized      it,  the most experienced eye might mis
take   it,and range    it in the class of the oldest petrified shells.
One may judge of these alterations                by
                                                the different speci
mens — how easily this mistake may be committed, and how
impossible       would be to assign to the most of these shells
                  it
a character proper to distinguish them from real fossils.

 I   have now concluded what relates to petrified shells, or
those merely incrusted        :    seen, that from the most
                                  it   is
southern extremity of the eastern hemisphere to the middle
of the equatorial regions they are found in greater or less
numbers, and at greater or less heights. The case      not the    is

it docs not appear that any other traveller observed any con
siderable number of these animals beyond the same point,
either in the northern or the southern hemisphere. Driven,
as we may say, from the one extremity of the world to the
other,    is in the bosom of the warmest seas that this in
           it
numerable family of animals seem to have fixed their habi
tation and their empire       :   the latter zone in particular
                                  it   is

  the  archipelago of the Low Friendly Isles, Bougainville's
  Island, several points of New Guinea, all the islands scat
  tered on the eastern side of New Holland, and in particular
  the formidable labyrinth which had like to have proved so
 fatal to the vessels of Bougainville and captain Cook ; in
 a word, almost all those innumerable islands dispersed
  throughout the great equinoctial ocean, seem some of
 them entirely, and others only in part, to be the work of
  these feeble animals.    The accounts of all the navigators
 who have traversed these seas are filled with expressions of
 the terror inspired by their labours.   All of them, almost,
 were exposed to the greatest dangers in the midst of the
 reefs which they raise up from the uoltom of the ocean to
 its surface, and no doubt the unfortunate navigator, the
 loss of whom France as well as all Europe deplores, was
 one of their numerous victims
     " The danger they present," says M. Labillardiere with
 great reason,
                 " is the more to be apprehended as they form
 rugged rocks covered by the waves, and which cannot be
 perceived but at very short distances.    If a calm comes on,
 and the ship is driven towards them by a current, her loss is
 almost inevitable : in vain would the crew attempt to save
 her by dropping their anchor; it would not reach the bottom
 even quite close to these walls of coral, which rise in a
 perpendicular direction from the bottom of the waters.
 These polypiers, the continual increase of which obstructs
 more and more the bason of the seas, are capable of
 frightening navigators ; and many shallows, which at pre
 sent afford a passage, will soon form shoals exceedingly
 dangerous."
     Though less common in the seas which we traversed,
 these animals furnished me nevertheless        with subject of
 observations the more valuable, as the general consequences
 deduced from them may be applied with more interest and
 more evidence to the history of the revolutions of our
 planet.
     Thus, as I have said, from the 44th tothe 34th degree
 south, no large species of solid zoophytes are found.       It is
at Port King George, in Nuyts Land, that these animals
appear, for the first time, with those grand characters which
 they affect in the midst of the equinoctial regions.         My
particular observations, indeed, are reduced in this point to
mere fragments, found here and there in the interior parts
of the earth. The case is not the same with those of Niain-
zies and Vancouver. The details, for which we are indebted
to these navigators, are too valuable of themselves, and par-

will furnish us, that I cannot here forbear transcribing what
Vancouver has said on the subject.
    " The country," says he, " is formed chiefly of coral,
and it seems that its elevation above the level or the sea is
of modern date ; for not only the shores and banks which
extend along the coast are in general composed of coral,
since our lead always brought up some of               but   it,
                                                               was     it
found also on the highest hills we ascended, and in parti
cular on the summit of Bald Head, which           at such
                                                        is height  a
above the level of the sea, that       it seen at the distance of
                                            is
 twelve or fourteen leagues.     The coral here was in its pri
mitive state, and especially on       alevel field of about eight
acres, which did not produce the least blade of grass amidst
the white sand with which      itwas covered, but from which
arose branches of coral exactly similar to those exhibited                  by
beds of the same substance above the surface of the sea,
with ramifications of different sizes, some half an inch at
least, and others four or five inches in circumference. Many
of these coral fields,if   I may use that expression, are to be
met with  :   a large quantity  of sea shells, some perfect and
still adhering to the coral, and others at different degrees of
dissolution, arc observed in them. The coral itself was more
or less friable the extremity of the branches, some of which
              ;
rose more than four feet above the sand, was easily reduced
to powder. In regard to the parts which were near or below
the surface,  a   certain degree of force was necessary to de
tach them from the foundation of rock from which they
seemed to arise.  I   have seen coral in many places at     con    a
siderable distance from the sea, but           never saw
                                                 I            any  it
where else so high and so perfect*."
    This, no doubt,   is  one of the most curious facts of this
kind, as well as one of the most important to be verified
and to be examined.       Will now be believed that the two
                               it
vessels belonging to our expedition, the, Geographe and
the Casuarina, remained for nearly          month at anchor in

Head, so valuable to be visited, without any of the three
naturalists, who still remained on board these vessels, being
permitted to go thither    ?
    Fortunately the large island of Timor presented          field a
still wider and more striking for observations on zoophytes.
There every thing attests their power, and the revolutions
effected by  them in nature. They are found on the summits

escape notice. In the excursion, so painful and so laborious,
undertakenjjy me and my friend Lesueur, to huntcrocodiles
at Olinama, we every where observed the same composi
tion; at Oba, Lassiana, Meniki, Noebaki, Oebello, and
Olinama.       At the last-mentioned point we found ourselves
opposite to the grand chain of mountains of Aninfba and
Fatelou, the back of which is uninhabitable on account
of the prodigious number of crocodiles which live in the
marshes of that part of the coast.          This broad plateau,
which commands all that portion of Timor, is entirely
composed of madreporic matters. From Oeana to Pacoula
the whole country, according to the inhabitants, is lime
stone; and this is unanimously confirmed by the Dutch.
    It is not only in this state of death and inactivity that the
zoophytes of Timor ought to excite admiration and interest :
they encumber, in the living state, the bottom of the sea ;
every where in the Bay of Babao they raise up reefs and
islands.     Turtle Island (Rea Poulou), Birds Island (Bourou
Poulou), and Monkey Island (Code Poulou), are exclusively
their work.      Long narrow reefs, which proceed from Point
Simao, confine more and more the entrance of the bay in
that quarter.      They render inaccessible the coasts of Fa-
toume and Soulama, and promote the increase of the
land gained from the sea in all these points.      On the coast
of Osapa one may already, at low water, advance to the di
stance of more than three-fourths of a league on the shore
abandoned by the waves: it is there 'that, with a mixture of
astonishment and admiration, one mav enjoy at ease the
wonderful spectacle of thousands of these animals inces
santly employed in the formation of the rocks on which
one advances.        All the genera are assembled at the same
time at the feet of the observer; they press around him ;
their singular and fantastical forms, the different modifica
tions of their colours, and those of their organization and
their structure, attract, in turn, his attention and medita
tions ; and when, provided with a good magnifying glass,
he contemplates these beings, so weak he can scarcely con
ceive how nature, by means so small in appearance, should
be able to raise up from the bottom of the sea those vast
 ridges of mountains which are continued over the face of
the island, and which seem to form almost its whole sub
stance.     At Timor it would be easy to make a long series
of observations on these interesting animals : the profound

calmness of the sea, its high temperature, the nature of the
shore, on which one may advance at low water, as already
mentioned, to a very great distance, having the water
scarcely up to the knee ; the great abundance of these ani
mals, and their variety, are all favourable to researches of
this kind : they may be observed, described, and drawn in
their natural state, as the. water does not rise above them to
the height of more than a few centimetres, or sometimes
Only millimetres ; they may be seen in their state of con
traction or extreme development ; one may observe, also,
their progressive increase, and its boundaries : in a word,
there can be no doubt that a labour of this kind, undertaken
by one or more enlightened naturalists, would contribute,
in the most effectual manner, to the advancement of this
part of natural history so little known, and which deserves
so much to be carefully examined.

       XXV.      Short Account     of the Life of     the late
                         Dr. Priestley.
Joseph Priestley, LL.D. F.R.S.               and member of many
foreign   literary  societies,  was    born   at Field Head, near
Leeds, in Yorkshire, on March 13, old style, in the year
 1733. His mother died when he was very young; and his
father, who was engaged in the cloth manufactory, marry
ing again, and having a large family, Joseph, when eight
years of age, was taken into the house of a near relation, a
lady eminent for piety and benevolence, who adopted and
educated him as her own son.
    He acquired the rudiments of the Latin and Greek lan
guages under the instruction ot Mr. Hague, a respectable
clergyman, master of a free grammar school in the neigh
bourhood, and during the vacations he applied to'the study
of the Hebrew, Chaldee, and other oriental languages. By
the assistance of Mr. Haggerston, who had been a pupil of
the celebrated Maclaurin, he made a considerable proficiency
in geometry, both speculative and practical algebra, and
natural philosophy.      He acquired also some skill in modern
languages, in order to qualify himself for a merchant's
counting-house,      the delicacy of his constitution rendering
it at one time doubtful whether he would be able to pursue
his studies for a learned profession.
    In his nineteenth year he altered as a student of divinity
                                                               at

                    of the late Dr. Priestley.               167
at the academy of Daventry, which was the successor of
that kept by Dr. Doddridge, at Northampton, and was con
ducted by Dr. Ashworth, whose first pupil young Priestley
is said to have been. When about the age of twenty-two
he was chosen assistant minister to the independent con
gregation of Needham-market,           in Suffolk ; and after a
stay  of three years at  that  place, he accepted an invitation
to be pastor of a small congregation at Namptwich, in Che
shire, where he opened a day school, in the management of
which he exhibited that turn for ingenious research and that
spirit of improvement which were to be his distinguishing
characteristics.    He enlarged the minds of his pupils by
philosophical experiments, and drew up an English gram
mar on an improved plan, which was his earliest publica
 tion.
    On the death of the reverend Dr. Taylor, the tutor in
divinity at Warrington academy, Dr. Aikin was chosen to
 supply his place, and Mr. Priestley was invited to under
 take the vacant department in the belles lettres.       He ac
 cordingly removed to Warrington in the year 1/61, and
 soon after married a daughter of Mr. Wilkinson, of Ber-
 sham foundry, near Wrexham, a lady of an excellent heart
 and a strong understanding, and the faithful partner of all
 the vicissitudes of his life.
    At Warrington the literary career of this eminent person
 properly commenced, and a variety of publications soon an
 nounced to the public the extent and originality of his ta
 lents. One of the first was a chart of biography, in which
 he ingeniously contrived to present an ocular image of the
 proportional duration of existence, and of the chronological
 period and synchronism of all the most eminent persons
 of all ages and countries, in the great departments of sci
 ence, art, and public life.     The favourable reception which
 this work experienced suggested a second chart of history,
 which exhibited in the like manner the extent, time, and
 duration of the different states and empires.
    Having long amused himself with an electrical machine,
 and taken an interest in the progress of discovery in that
 branch of physics, he was induced to undertake a History
 of Electricity, with an account of its present state.    It ap
 pears from his preface, that while engaged in this design he
  had enjoyed the advantage of personal intercourse with some
 eminent philosophers, among whom he acknowledges as
  coadjutors Dr. Watson, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Canton.
  The work was first published at Warrington in 1767, 4to;
  and so well was it received that it underwent a fifth edition
                                  L 4                          in

1 68                 Short Account  of the Life
in 4to in 1794- It is, indeed, an admirable model of sci
entific history; full without superfluity, clear, methodical,,
candid, and unaffected.       The original experiments detailed
 in it are highly ingenious, and gave a foretaste of that fer
 tility of contrivance and sagacity of observation by which
 the author was afterwards so much distinguished.
     His connection' with Warrington ceased in 1768, at
 which time he accepted an invitation to officiate as pastor
 to a large and respectable congregation of protestant dis
 senters at Leeds.     The favourable reception his History of
 Electricity had experienced induced him to adopt the grand
 design of tracing out the rise and progress of the other sci
 ences in a historical form, and much of his time at this
 place was employed in his second work of this kind, enti
 tled " The History and present State of the Discoveries re
 lating to Vision, Light, and Colours;" which appeared in
 two vols. 4to, 1772.      This work, though possessed of con
 siderable merit, did not attain to the same popularity as the
 History of Electricity, and proved to be the termination of
 his plan : but science was no loser by this circumstance, as
 the activity of his mind was turned from the consideration
 of the discoveries of others to the attempt of making disco
 veries of his own ; and nothing could be more brilliant than
  his success.    It appears that at this period he had begun
  those experiments upon air which have given the greatest
  celebrity to his name as a natural philosopher.
     In 1770 Dr. Priestley quitted Leeds; and having been
  recommended by his friend Dr. Price to the late marquis
  of Lansdown, then earl of Shelburne, he lived with his
  lordship in the capacity of his librarian, or rather as his li
  terary and philosophical companion.         During this period
  his family resided at Calne, in Wiltshire, adjacent to the
  country-seat of lord Shelburne.        Dr. Priestley frequently
  accompanied his noble patron to London, and mixed at
  his house with several of the eminent characters of the tirtie,
  by whom he Was treated with every respect due to his cha
  racter and talents.    He also attended his lordship on a visit
  to Paris, where he was introduced to most of the celebrated
  men of letters and science in that capital.
     To give a detailed account of Dr. Priestley's philosophical
  labours would require far more room than can be allotted
  to such an important object in a miscellany of this kind :
  we must therefore content ourselves with the following short
  notice. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1773 he pub
  lished a paper containing observations on different kinds of
  air, which obtained the honorary prize of Copley's medal.
                                                           These

                    ofllie late Dr. gripstlty.                  1C9
These were reprinted, with many important additions, in
the first volume of his Experiments and Observations on
different Kinds of Air, Svo, 1774.         A second volume of
this work appeared in 1775, and a third in 1777.          Some of
the most striking of his discoveries were those of nitrous
and dephlogisticated air, or oxygen gas ; of the restoration
of vitiated air by vegetation ; of the influence of light on
vegetables ; and of the effects of respiration on the blood.
By these publications Dr. Priestley's fame was spread
throughout all the enlightened countries of Europe, and
most of the scientific bodies of Europe were ambitious to
rank him among the number of their members.
     The term of his engagement with lord Shelburne having
expired, Dr. Priestley, with a pension of 1501. per annum,
was at liberty to choose a new situation.        He gave the pre
 ference to the populous town of Birmingham, induced chiefly
by the advantages it afforded from the nature of its manu
factures to the pursuits of chemical knowledge.         It was also
 the residence of several men of science, among whom the
names of Watt, Withering, Bolton, and Keir, are well
known to the public.        With these he was soon upon terms
of friendly intercourse; and their Lunarian Club presented
 a constellation of talent which would not easily have been
 collected even in the metropolis.
     He had not resided long at Birmingham when he was
 invited to undertake the office of pastor to a congregation of
 dissenters near that town, upon which he entered towards
 the close of the year 1760.       The disgraceful scenes which
 took place at Birmingham in 1 79 1, ana which compelled Dr.
  Priestley to leave this situation as a fugitive, are well known
 to the public, and it is not our intention to revive the re
 membrance of them by entering into particulars.          Suffice it
 to say, that the doctor's house, library, manuscripts, and ap
 paratus, became a prey to the flames; and, ihough he re
 ceived an indemnity for this loss, it was far from being an
 adequate compensation.        The result of many years' painful
  research and scientific labour perished by this shameful out
  rage, which every friend to good order and justice deplored.
  J'or some time after this event Dr. Priestley lived as a wan
 derer, till he was invited to succeed Dr. Price in a congre
  gation at Hackney ; but the persecution he had experienced
  lroin the infatuated rabble, added to some family reasons,
  induced him to leave his native country, and to embark for
  America in 1794. The place he fixed on for his residence
  in the new world was Northumberland, a town in Penn
  sylvania, where having collected, by indefatigable pains, a
                                                           valuable

   1 70    Account   of the Life of the late Dr. Priestley.
  valuable apparatus and well chosen library, he returned to his
  former pursuits. By many new experiments on the consti
  tution of airs he became more and more fixed in the belief
  of the phlogistic theory, and in his opposition to the new
  French system of chemistry, of which he lived to be the
  sole opponent of note.      The results of several of his inqui
  ries on these topics were given both in separate publications
  and in the American Philosophical Transactions ; and it is
  but fair to add, that the new theory is indebted to this op
  position for some of the strongest proofs on which it is
  founded.
      Dr. Priestley declined the offer of the chemical professor
  ship in the college of Philadelphia, which was made to him
  soon after his arrival in America ; and likewise another offer,
  of succeeding the late Dr. Ewing as principal of the same
  college, in the spring of 1803 ; preferring a life of retire
  ment and leisure, that he might devote himself entirely to
 philosophical and theological inquiries.       While he lived at
 Northumberland he had the misfortune to lose an excellent
 wife, and a beloved and dutiful son. These afflictions,
 though severely felt, he bore with becoming fortitude and
 resignation.     Till the year 1801 he had enjoyed uninter
 rupted good health, having scarcely ever known what sick
 ness was; but at that period he was attacked at Philadelphia
 by a constant indigestion, and difficulty of swallowing any
 kind of solid food. From about the beginning of Novem
 ber 1803 to the middle of January 1804 his complaint grew
 more serious, and at one time he was incapable of swallow
 ing anv thing for thirty hours.       In the last fortnight of Ja
 nuary Lis legs swelled nearly to his knees, and his weakness
 increasrhg very much, he expired on the 9th of February
 following.
     As theology   is entirely foreign to the object of the Phi
 losophical Magazine, we have not thought proper to say
 any thing in regard to Dr. Priestley's writings on that sub
ject, which are very numerous, nor the theological disputes
 in which he was engaged.         His religious opinions are well
 known to the public, and therefore it is the less necessary
 for us to enter into any observations on them. The prin
cipal part of his other works are : —The History and present

 An Account of the Labours of the Class of the Mathema

                           PHYSICAL PART.
 Almost       all the sciences which engage the attention of the
 society have this year made curious and important acquisi
 tions; and, as is usual, chemistry has obtained the most
 considerable and most numerous.
    Count Rumford has examined heat under a new point of
 view.    He has endeavoured to determine the force of the
 solar rays to produce it. The degree to which it is carried
 when its rays are concentrated by means of a burning glass
 is well known : but is their real power thereby augmented?
 or does the effect arise from their acting in greater number
 on a smaller space ? To ascertain this, count Rumford in
 vented a reservoir of heat, which is nothing else than a
 metal vessel filled with water having a thermometer im
 mersed in it: it receives the solar rays on one of its faces,
 which is blackened, and the water it contains acquires a
 certain degree of heat. Count Rumford suffers these ra^s
 to arrive sometimes       in a parallel direction and sometimes
 concentrated bv a magnifying glass ; but bringing the latter
 nearer or making it recede in such a manner that the rays
  shall strike on a greater or less space of the surface of the
  vessel, though their quantity continues always the same.
                                                             The

                      French National Institute.                              173
The water in       the reservoir always acquires the same degree
of   heat nearly in the same time.               Hence the power of the
rays to produce heat is always proportional to their quantity
whether they are concentrated or not ; or, what amounts
to the same thing, the heat produced is proportional to the
light absorbed.
    It has long been believed that the heat of the earth does
not all come from the sun, but that it is indebted for a great
part of it to some focus concealed in its- interior part ; this
is the old hypothesis of Descartes, which Buffon after
wards made the basis of other systems.                        M. Peron, sent
by the Institute, as naturalist, with captain Baudin during
his voyage of discovery, has made an extensive series of
 researches to ascertain the truth of this fact. He examined
 with an ingenious apparatus the temperature of the sea at
 different depths, and he every where found that it is colder
 the greater the depth. This result, agreeable to that before
 obtained by English navigators in other seas than those
 traversed bv M. Peron, seems to destroy entirely the idea
 of a central fire. It is even probable that the deepest abysses
 of the sea are always frozen, even under the equator, in the
  same manner as the summits of the highest mountains *.
     M. Biot has made a curious experiment in regard to the
 heat forced from bodies by compression.                     Oxygen and hy
 drogen gas, when merely mixed at the ordinary degree of
 the ptessure of the atmosphere, have need, in order to com
 bine, of the action of the electric spark.                  When put toge
  ther in a condensing machine they combined merely by the
  heat which was disengaged, and abandoned one so consi
  derable at the time of their combination that the machine
  burst every time the experiment was repeated f.
      Common air, the medium in which not only the greater
  part of the phenomena of chemistry but those also of or
  ganic life take place, cannot be studied too carefully by
  philosophers.        Its degree of purity, that is to say, the pro
  portion of oxygen it contains, is one of the most important
  points that can be examined. Messrs. Humboldt and Gay-
  Lussac have compared the different means hitherto invented
  for measuring this proportion, and have shown that the
  best of all is that of Volla, which consists in burning hy
  drogen gas.        A hundred parts in volume of oxygen are ne-
     * This reasoning  is very inconclusive.    For, if ihe earth contains heat that
  does  not come from the sun, the water which it warms must ascend to the
  surface, being displaced by that which is colder, and consequently more
  dense. — Edit.

  cessarv to saturate two hundred       of hydrogen, whatever be
  the pressure and temperature.         In this manner one may
  discover the hydrogen contained in any air whatever, even
  if it form only a three-thousandth part.
     Messrs. Humboldt and Gay-Lussac have ascertained that
  there does not exist a sensible portion of hydrogen in the
  lower part of the atmosphere ; and the aerostatic excursion
 of Messrs. Biot and Gay-Lussac, and that of M. Gay-Lus
 sac alone, during which he rose to a much greater height,
 have confirmed that there is no more at the greatest eleva
 tion to which it is possible to rise, and far above that where
 the clouds are formed.       Thus all the systems in which the
 formation of rain and other meteors was ascribed to the
 combustion of hydrogen 'gas, fall of themselves.
     There still remains some uncertainty in regard to the
 number of the new metals which are mixed with platina.
 Were any confidence to be placed in the results hitherto
 announced, there would be, besides iron, copper, chrome,
 and lead, the metal discovered last year by Messrs. Fourcroy
 and Vauquclin, as well as by M. Descotils; two others
 found in it by Mr. Tennant, and two discovered by Dr.
 Wollaston called rhodium, and palladium.
     Dr. Wollaston, indeed, according to letters from Lon
 don, discovered palladium, of which mention was made in
 mv two last reports, and kept the discovery secret, as if to
 entrap chemists.     He pretends that they have fallen com
 pletely into the snare, by imagining that this metal was a
 compound of platina and mercury ; and, indeed, not only
 have the attempts of M. de Morveau to imitate palladium,
 accordingto the process of Mr. Chenevix, been unsuccessful,
 but the case was the same with three German chemists,
 Messrs. Rose, Gehler, and Richter.       This palladium, there
 fore, ought to be a real metal.       Is the case the same with
rlwdium, osmium, and iridium P or do these substances
 enter into the composition of each other, or into those
 discovered by Messrs. Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and Descotils ?
This question can be determined only by time.
     Chemistry, however, appears to have acquired a new
metal named cerium, from the planet Ceres.             It was the
oxide of this metal which M. Klaproth considered as a new
earth, and named ochroite. Two Swedes, Messrs. Hessin-
ger and Bezelius, have supposed it to be a metallic sub
stance; and M. Vauquelin, who repeated their experiments,
is of the same opinion.       Nevertheless, as he was not able
to reduce it completely,     some  doubts still remain.
    We must leave    also to  time the confirmation of a disco
                                                             very

very said, in a letter from Florence, to have been made by
M. Pacchiani, professor at Pisa, of the radical of the mu
riatic acid, one of the most important questions, without
doubt, that still remain to be resolved in chemistry. M. Pac
chiani asserts, that he transformed water into oxygenated
muriatic acid by taking from it a part of its oxygen by means
of the Galvanic pile. The muriatic acid then .will be hy
drogen at its minimum of oxidation; the oxygenated mu
riatic acid, hydrogen in the middle state; and water, hydro
gen at its maximum of oxidation.
   Of all the objects of chemistry animal matters are the
most embarrassing to               it,
                              on account of the great complica
tion of their elements, and because the simplest agent that
can be applied to them produces           them     thousand move
                                                  in        a
ments and transformations, the play of which escapes us,
and of which we judge only                   by
                                       the results.   This     what       is
takes place, for example, when these matters are treated
with nitric acid, — method first employed
                        a                                       by

resting results. The most apparent phaenomenon, then,                               is
the development of         great quantity of azote.

effects vary, according to the strength of the acid, the dura

 to it.

attend them, have found that nitric acid applied to the

the bile, and that which colours the skin and the urine during
the jaundice, is produced also by some combination of oxy
gen with the fibrine matter of the muscles, or with that of
 the blood.
    Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have employed them
 selves also on the analysis of milk; and their researches have
 greatly simplified the theory of it. They have discovered
 that the acid which is developed in                  it,
                                                and which was con
 sidered to be of   a  particular   nature,    nothing but the acid
                                                      is
of vinegar modified      by    some animal substances and some
 salts which it  holds in solution.       Milk, according to them,
must be considered as     a     mixed liquor, consisting of great          a
deal of water and of two kinds of matters, some of them
 really dissolved, as sugar, mucilage, muriate and sulphate
 of potash, and acetic acid others merely suspended, as the

matter of cheese, that of butter, and the phosphates of iron,
lime and magnesia.
    Considering the infinite complication of this first aliment
of young animals, these gentlemen give us new motives for
admiring the providence of nature, which has deposited in
it  all the materials of speedy growth.           The caseous sub
stance  is  almost the same as that of the muscles the phos           ;
phate of iron  is   one of the elements of the blood        and that  ;
of lime forms the earthy basis, and           the cause of the hard-

    These gentlemen also have maJe remark which may bea
interesting to medicine   :    it      is,
                                      that the whey does not con
tain phosphoric salts, but when             can dissolve them

    There are in chemistry some questions, which though on
the first view they seem entirely particular, yet the solution
of them may extend to so many different objects that                                it
might produce       a  revolution in the whole system of our
knowledge.       Such,     for example, are the deposits formed
by organized      bodies    of substances which we consider as
simple, and which,        as  appears, these bodies, under several
circumstances, could not acquire from without, but must
have produced       by combination.
    Do  animals   form   lime, and vegetables argil and silex, as
some    naturalists  assert
                          ?      The generation of stones and that
of  mountains,     and  the   whole  history of our globe, depend
in  some measure on this problem.                 to   we may refer
                                                      It    is   it

which   is formed in* the bamboo.
    Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have found, as was said
some years ago, that     it   is almost pure silex. But how could
                                                                silex

•ilex be dissolved, and absorbed by ihe plant ? How could
it circulate in   the sap r For all this must have been neces
sary  before   it could  be deposited in the knots of the stem.
Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin are of opinion that potash
has served as the solvent, and that it has carried with it into
the sap these particles of silex.    According to them, there
fore, tabasheer proves nothing in favour of those who be
lieve that silex can be produced merely by the act of vege
tation.
    These indefatigable chemists have carried their researches
to a phenomenon of disease in vegetation, interesting by
its singularity, and long known by the damage it occasions.
They 1nave endeavoured, in consequence of a memoir pre
sented to the Institute by M. Girod-Chantrans, to deter
mine the nature of the smut in wheat. They have found
in it an oil of a green colour and of the consistence of but
ter ; phosphoric acid, in part combined with magnesia, and
lime, ana ammonia ; charcoal, and a vegeto-animal sub
stance perfectly similar to that produced by the decomposi
tion of the gluten of wheat by putrefaction.       They thence
conclude that the smut is a residuum of farina decomposed
by putrid fermentation, and suppose that it arises from a
superabundance of animal manure, and a too hot and moist
temperature at the time of sowing, or when the grain is in
flower.      If agriculturists should acknowledge that these
 circumstances determine in reality a greater quantity of
 smut, it might be possible to prevent, in some cases, this
 scourge.
    Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have analysed likewise
 a mould found at the depth of more than fifty feet in some
 desert islands of the South Seas, and which is employed as
 manure on the coasts of Peru, where it is called guano.
This analysis has so great a resemblance to (hat of pigeons'
dung, that there is reason to believe, with Mr. Humboldt,
who brought this guana to Europe, that it is nothing but
 the excrement of birds, which frequent these islands in im
 mense numbers.
    This substance, as may be seen, is an object of very li
 mited utility ; but chemistry has long endeavoured to pro
 cure one to agriculture which would be of more universal
 importance, namely, sugar extracted from indigenous plants.
 We gave an account, at the time, of the efforts of M. Achard,
 of Berlin, to obtain it from beet-root. M. Proust, a cele-
 lebrated Spanish chemist, has extracted it from grapes; he

cess   of M. Acharu has been there much simplified ; and
this problem, so interesting in the present state of society,
and which      can scarcely fail to change the state of nations,
is not far from being solved.
    M. de Coss'.gny, a correspondent, has endeavoured to
get more directly to this result.         He is of opinion that the
sugar cane might be cultivated in the southern provinces of
1' ranee.    It has, indeed, been cultivated at Nice for some
time without producing sugar; but he asserts that this was
owing to the juice being extracted too late, and to its hav
ing already undergone fermentation when boiled. He made
very gooq sugar from canes cultivated in the Jardin des
Platitesf but in a hot-house.
    Wc have already spoken several times of the labours of
M. Seguin in regard to the chemical arts and medical che
mistry. He has continued them this year, and treated three
important branches.
    He first employed himself on the analysis of opium, in
order to determine which of its component principles it is
that gives it its medical properties.          This celebrated juice
exhibited three very distinct substances : a little acetous
acid ; another acid, which may be only the acetous or main?
modified ; a crystalline matter which appears to be new ; an
extract soluble in water and in alcohol ; another extract so
luble only in alcohol, acids, and alkalies; a vegetable oil a
little concrete, and a sort of starch. Nothing remains but
to try separately each of these substances, and to determine
their respective effects on the animal body.           M. Seguin is
employed      on  this at  present,   and   he has promised that he
win sobn communicate to us the result of his observations.

 sented to the Societa Italiana ; and have led me to a know-*
 ledge of the constituent elements of an acid which has hi
 therto proved refractory to all the efforts of chemistry.               I
 speak    of the muriatic acid, hitherto tortured in vain * with
 the electric spark, caloric, and all the play of affinity. You
 are perfectly acquainted with the different and discordant
 opinions of the most recent and approved writers concern
 ing the nature of this acid ; some of them considering it as
 a simple combustible body, others as formed of an unknown
 base combined with oxygen; and, lastly, others as a simple
 substance naturally acid. But these opinions have not con
 tributed to the advancement of science, and are justly
 esteemed as mere hypotheses destitute of proof.
     "   Having, however, neglected these hypotheses, and
 considered the means by which the discovery of the nature
 of this acid has been hitherto attempted, it appeared to me
 that one had not yet been tried, viz. the continued action
 of the pile of the celebrated Volta, and I suspected that it
 might assist in leading me to discoveries which had hitherto'
 escaped the research of experimental philosophers.               As far
 as I can judge, my endeavours have been crowned1 with
 success, and 'have furnished me with satisfactory evidence
 of the nature of the constituent principles of muriatic acid.
     " The simplicity of the apparatus, and of the means
 adopted to attain my views, the care with which I endea
 voured to avoid every source of error, have, I hope, suffi
 ciently secured me against those illusions which frequently
 deceive young men ardent in the pursuit of science, and
 even those practised in the art of extorting from nature her
 secrets.       Want of time prevents me from relating the series
 of experiments by which I arrived at the discovery I have
 mentioned ; but you may see it by perusing the manuscript
 of mv memoir, which will be immediately published, to
  submit my researches and their results to the judgment of
 the learned. For the present, I shall select from the expe
  riments and facts therein described those which are decisive,
 and which establish, in an evident manner, the following
  truths :
     " I. Muriatic acid is an oxide of hydrogen, and conse
 quently composed of hydrogen and oxygen.
     "   II. In the oxygenated muriatic acid, and therefore, a
fortiori, in muriatic acid, there is a much less proportion
  of oxygen than in water.

  been in some measure anticipated by Mr. Peel! of Cambridge.— Note of the

    * III.     Hydrogen is susceptible of very many and dif
ferent degrees of oxidation, contrary to what is universally
believed by pneumatic chemists, who assert that hydrogen
is susceptible only of one invariable degree of oxidation,
that in which it forms water.
    "   Having at first examined the phenomenon of the de
composition or water by the Galvanic pile, and having, by
accurate experiments, ascertained the true theory, I readily
discovered a very simple and exact apparatus, in which I
could distinctly perceive the changes which happen to water,
which, from the continued action of the Galvanic pile, is
continually losing its oxygen at the surface of a wire of very
pure gold immersed in it.
    " I therefore proceeded to examine these gradual changes
of water thus losing its oxygen; and I at last observed a
very singular fact, which unequivocally indicated the forma
tion of an acid.         In other antecedent experiments I had ex
amined the nature of the air obtained before arriving at this
remarkable point, and I always found, by means of the eu
diometer of Giobert, that it was very pure oxygen *, as the
residuum scarcely amounted to one-vixtieth.
    "   Having thus examined the nature of the air formed in
various experiments from the first moment of decomposi
tion, until there were evident indications of the formation
of an acid, I began to endeavour to determine, in a more
positive manner, the existence and nature of this acid.
    "   When the water, or, to speak more accurately, tho
residual fluid, occupied about half the capacity of the re
ceiver, which at first contained the water, this residual fluid
presented      the  following    characters    :
    "   Its colour was an orange yellow, more or less deep,
according as the bulk of the residual liquor was greater or
less, and it resembled in appearance a true solution of gold.
    " From the inferior orifice of the vessel, which was closed
with a piece of taffety, and then with double bladder, there
escaped a smell which was easily recognised to be that of
oxygenated muriatic acid.
    " The gold wire had in part lost its metallic lustre, and
its surface appeared as if corroded hy a solvent.
    "   The bit of taflcty which had been in contact with the
coloured fluid, in consequence of its action, was easily torn,

as  is usual  with  similar  bodies when half burnt       (semi-
combusto).
   " Around   the edges of the vessel, on the bladder, there
was formed a deep purple ring, which surrounded a circular
space rendered entirely colourless, or white.
   "  A drop of this fluid tinged the skin of the hand, after
some hours, with a beautiful rose colour.
   "  Having obtained, in various successive experiments,
the same liquid, possessing constantly the same properties,
I chose that obtained in the last experiment to subject it to
chemical examination.       The very able chemist of this uni
versity, Sig. Giuseppe Branchi, had the goodness to enter
zealously into my views ; and in his laboratory we easily
proved,
   " 1. The existence of a volatile acid by the white va
pours which were formed by ammonia placed near it.
   " 2. That this acid was certainly oxygenated muriatic
acid, since it formed in nitrate of silver a curdy precipitate,
the iuna cornea of the antients, or the muriate of silver of
the moderns.     From these facts we may draw the following
positive and undeniable results:
   " 1 . Muriatic acid is an oxide of hydrogen, aud is there
fore composed of hydrogen and oxygen.
   " 2. Oxygenated muriatic acid, and of course muriatic
acid, contains less oxygen than water does.
   " 3. Hydrogen has not one degree of oxygenation, but
many.     One of these constitutes water, another below it
oxygenated muriatic acid, and, below this, there is another
which constitutes muriatic acid.
   " I shall mention the other degrees in another memoir,
which will be published immediately.
   " These, my much esteemed friend, are the decisive facts
and experiments, which exclude every doubt, and which
confirm my fortunate conjectures.       It is long since experi
mental philosophy may     be  said to have   become a source of
wonders.     The transmutation     of azote   into nitrous acid,
anil of hydrogen into water, appears to me truly wonderful,
and your genius will enable you readily to judge whether
the same epithet may be applied to the metamorphosis of
water into the true solvent of gold and platinum, into that
volatile substance which attacks and neutralizes pestilential
miasmata, and presents so many resources to philosophy
and the arts.
   "  After having thus discovered the elements of this re
fractory substance, I am engaged in determining their pro
portions by experiment and calculation.

covered that infusion of litmus was reddened by the one

the formation of nitrous acid and ammonia; and only a

  ately confirmed by the evidence of professor Pacchioni, of
frazine
 Pisaf, who, without any knowledge of the experiments
made in this country, attained similar results by the use of
precisely the same means. There is one considerable point
 of difference, however, between the English and the Italian
 chemist, viz. that by passing a continued current of tjic
 Galvanic fluid through water, Mr. Peel obtained muriate of
 soda; while professor Pacchioni, having employecl an in
terrupted gold wire for the same purpose, produced niu-

   riate of gold. These experiments cannot fail   to have excited
   an ardent interest in the mind of every chemist in this coun
   try, and an anxious expectation of the issue of the process
   in the hands of other experimentalists.      For this reason I
   communicate to you the following account, though not
   perfectly conclusive, with a request that you will suppress
   it if more satisfactory testimony should reach you from any
  other quarter.
      " The apparatus which I employed was such as would
  occur to any person having the same object in view j viz.
   a glass tube 4$ inches long and *35 inches diameter, in
  which were secured, by means of corks, two slips of platina
   (cut from a piece which was given to me, long ago, by Mr.
  Tennant) with their extremities at a proper distance from
  each o.ther.    The water, at the outset, amounted to two
  drachms ; and was reduced, by six days' exposure to the
  current, (in part probably by evaporation, though carefully
  covered with pasteboard,) to a quantity which left half an
  inch of the tube unfilled.    It had been most attentively pu
 rified, first by simple distillation, and again by a second
  distillation, after the addition of nitrate of silver.   At the
 close of the experiment it was found to become opalescent
 in a few seconds by the mixture of nitrate of silver, and
 afterwards to undergo, when exposed to the light, the usual
 change of colour, indicating the presence of muriatic acid.
 To ascertain whether muriate of platina were present, I
 added a solution of muriate of ammonia to one portion,
 and to another carbonate of soda ; but no precipitation en
 sued.      This, however, might possibly be owing to the very
 dilute state of the solution ; and I was proceeding to reduce
 the remainder by evaporation, with the view to further ex
 periments, when the whole was unfortunately lost by acci
 dent.
     "   The repetition of this process requires the careful obr
 servance of one precaution, which is extremely likely to be
overlooked.       The water employed must, on no account,
 come into contact with the fingers of the operator; fori
 have found that from the surface of the skin there is a con
stant and copious excretion of muriate of soda, with, per
haps, a little muriate of ammonia.        Of this any one may
be satisfied by observing the change effected by nitrate of
silver on pure distilled water after being poured on the palm
of the hand ; and if a glass tube, containing distilled water,
be frequently inverted in a cup of the same, "by means of the
thumb or a finger, the water will be found to be precipitated
by nitrate of silver.    Suspecting that the corks might have
                                                       furnished

              Formation     of muriatic Acid          fcy   Galvanism.             185
furnished some muriatic salt, added nitrate of silver to por
                                         I
tions of pure water       which corks had been kept immersed
                             in
2-1 hours    but instead of opalescence being produced, the
              ;
colour of the liquid passed through successive shades to that
of Port wine, and the tingcing matter remained in solution,
insteaJ of settling to the DOttom like muriate of silver. In
future experiments on the synthesis ol muriatic acid          will            it
therefore be expedient to employ an apparatus in which the
water shall neither come into contact with the fingers nor
with corks. For transmitting the metallic wires, perforated
glass stoppers, one of which has an aperture large enough
to allow the water to escape as the gases arc generated,
would answer the purpose sufficiently.              desirable also
                                                             It   is
that the water employed should be well freed from air, and
that the atmosphere should be excluded for,               muriatic
                                                             ;           if
acid be generated,      will otherwise remain to be proved that
                           of it
azote   is not one      its components      and this presumption
                                                      ;
is  tv en confirmed       the extreme minuteness of the portion
                             by
of muriatic acid winch seemed to be produced             my expe         in
 riment.       writer contain all the elements of that acid, and
               If
 nothing more be required to effect its transmutation than                           a
 change of their proportion, we might expect         considerable    a
 ami unequivocal production of muriatic acid           the process     by
 of Galvanism.      Another circumstance suggesting the pre
 sence of azote in this acid             is,
                                    that on examining the liquor
 obtained         by
                detonating impure hydrogen and oxygen gasea
 in close copper vessels, Mr. Keir found that small quantity     a
 of muriatic acid accompanied the nitrous acid thus formed.

                   The error arose from the employment of iron flings con
taminated with muriatic acid, from which     required repeated washing with

    Mr. Henry's suggestions arc of great importance, and
we doubt hot will receive due attention from experimen
talists.   From all that has yet occurred on this subject, a
strong presumption is furnished that we are on the verge
•of perhaps more than one important discovery in chemistry.
At such a crisis, in particular, every phaenomenon that by
even the most remote analogies may appear connected with
this'ihquiry, should be communicated by chemists for the
benefit of science. For ourselves, we can only say we shall
faithfully discharge the duty which devolves on us, to lay
them carefully ana correctly before the public.
                           TRAVELS.
    Dr. Bolschoi,  who, in the quality of physician, accom
 panied  a Russian  and Bucharian caravan, which in the year
 1 803, on its way from Troizk to Bucharia,    wa3 plundered
by the Truchmens and Karakalpaks, and who on that oc
casion was taken prisoner, returned to Petersburgh about
the beginning of November 1804, after undergoing various
vicissitudes and sufferings.    The following particulars re
specting the Kirgisian Cozaks, communicated by this gen
tleman, are worthy of particular notice, as they relate to a
people interesting to the Russian trade, but who have hi
therto been highly prejudicial to it.
    When the Kirgisians had divided by lot the booty which
they obtained from this rich caravan, Dr. Bolschoi was esti
mated at the value of a camel.       These plunderers cut to
pieces the mathematical instruments, watches, telescopes,
 and other things of the like kind, that each might have a
share ot them/ They did the same in regard to the medi
 cines. The roots, powders, pills, and mixtures, were all
 divided into equal parts. Each person then threw his por
 tion together into a vessel ; and this they considered as the
 most valuable part of the plunder.      When the Kirgisians
 found that their prisoner was a physician, and consequently,
 according to their idea, a kind of sorcerer, they thronged
 in crowds around him, that he might feel their pulse, in
order to tell them, from the nature of    it,
                                            whether the horse
they had lost, the cow that had strayed, or the camel that
 was missing, would be again found    :   nay, some of them
even wished him to tell from the nature of their pulse whe
 ther their absent sick mother, wife, sister, &c. would re
 cover. If his answer turned out to be true, the prophet was
r  .warded but      in
                    the contrary case, he was often subjected
U the discipline of the wiiip. J "
          ;
    A violent storm having once taken place, the whole body
                                                        began

                            Travels.                       187
 began to murmur ; anil a genera! suspicion fell on the captive
 doctor, who was considered as an adept in the art of witch
 craft.  It w as immediately resolved that the sorcerer should
 be put to death : and this would certainlv have been the
 case had not the storm fortunately subsided ; so that the
 supposed sorceix,r escaped with a slight correction.
   As Mr. Bolschoi was considered as a man of a higher
order, he was not sold into Bucharia with the other cap-
tire?, but kept in the steppe. Daring his enptivity he served
as a common domestic, exposed to cold and hunger, and
obliged to perform all those menial services which are al
lotted to the slaves of the Kirgisians. As he did not un
derstand the language of his tyrants, he was beaten till he
was able to tell the names of the most necessary articles in
Kirgisian. He, however, did not long remain with one
master, but was transferred from one person to another till
he came into the service of the kan. With him he remained
three monilis, but was exposed to no less hardship than
under his former masters.     The kan, however, in the hope
of obtaining for him a large ransom, carried him to the
Orenburg lines ; at the distance of ten versts from which
he gave him a rich Kirgisian dress, and in that state he was
ransomed.
   As some incorrect accounts of the Russian embassy to
Ohina have been published m various journals, the follow
ing particulars, which appear to be correct, are taken from
an extract of a letter written by a naturalist who was des
tined some time ago for a journey to Thibet, but who now
is to accompanv the embassy **—" Count Potocki, well
known by his historical works, has been appointed the
chief of this important mission.      The principal naturalist
is Mr. Adams, who accompanied count Mussin-Puschkin
on his tour to the Caucasian mountains; Rcdofsky, for
merly botanical gardener to count Alexis Kazumofsky, is
appointed physician, botanist, and entomologist ; Pansner,
mineralogist and geologue; Schubert, astronomer; and
Klaproth junior, prulologue.     The whole of the scientific
men, with their assistants, draughtsmen, artists, and a de
tachment of fifty soldiers, were to set out on the 4th of
May : the embassy was to set off somewhat later. The
route of the former was to be through Mosco, Nishney-
Novgorod, Rasan, Ekaterinenbourg, and south from To
bolsk to Omsk, Kolywan, Irkutsk, to Kiachta, the Russian
staple on the frontiers of Chinese Tartary.    Here they will
wait for the embassy, and for the Chinese Ta-tschins who
                                                            are

 -are to  escort the embassy, which will now consist of more
  than a hundred persons, through the desert of Robi and
  Yellow Mongolia to the city of Pekin.
      M.  Bergman, who has lately communicated to the public
  an interesting account of his long residence among theKal-
  mucs, is now preparing for another journey in the little
  frequented districts of Asia, which he has been invited by
  government to undertake, with the most liberal allowance
  for liis support.   M. Bergman has been appointed an as
  sessor of the colleges ; and leave has been given him to
  choose a physician, naturalist, and draughtsman, to accom
  pany him. The benevolent Alexander nas made provision
  for the wives of the travellers, in case any of them should
  die in the course of their journey.
      M. Herman, professor of natural history at Dorpat, who
 last year made a tour through a part .of Russian Finland, is
 about to return to that country with a draughtsman.         It is
 supposed that on his return he will publish a journal of
 these two tours.
      M.  Giesecke, a Prussian mineralogist, has been for some
 time at Copenhagen.         It is believed that the government
 proposes    to  send  him   to Greenland, where he will spend
 some years in examining that country in a mineralogical
 and geological point of view.       Hitherto the Moravian mis
 sionaries have been the only persons who have ventured to
 reside for several years in Greenland.
                            ANAacrriES.
     One   of the  houses   of the city of Pompeii, buried under
 the lava of Vesuvius in the 79th year of the Christian aera,
 has been discovered by clearing away the lava, and a great
 many antique vases, coins, musical instruments, and a
brazen Hercules, with several excellent paintings in fresco,
 have been found     in it.
     Some further account of this discovery is contained in the
following letter, dated Naples, May I, 1804: — "During
the course of a search by digging, begun about seven years
ago, the workmen discovered the capital of a pilaster, which
was supposed to be the lateral face of a large gate.         Last
winter, the labour being resumed, the corresponding pU
laster was found.        The brazen hinges of the gate were
transported to the Museum at Portici. The house to which
this gate conducts is large and commodious, and richly or
namented with paintings and mosaic.          It is surrounded by
                                                       a beautiful

                           Vaccination.                               189
a beautiful wall of cut stone, the joinings of which are so
close, and the cement so perfect, that it has the appearance
of a solid mass. The alley which serves as an entry is
twelve palms in length ana ten in breadth ; it leads to a
court, the walls of which are covered with stucco of diffe
rent colours.       The capitals and cornices are in very fine
preservation.        I remarked on them a large rose, which is
a master-piece of elegance and design.               Ail the chambers
are ornamented with beautiful paintings on a red, blue, or
yellow ground.           They exhibit small exceedingly delicate
columns, with flowers, candelabra, and other ornaments
in the best taste. On the left are two apartments which
in all probability were those of the master and mistress of
the house.
   "    The painter had given full scope to his imagination in
 the composition of all these pieces, which I beheld with
 inexpressible pleasure.           Nothing can be more attracting
 than a dance of masked personages; nothing more elegant
 than a small bird pecking at a basket of figs.            In the mid
 dle of the court is a cistern, or impluvium of the Romans.
 On a marble pedestal is a young Hercules seated on a small
 fawn of bronze.           These two pieces, one of which may
 weigh about twenty and the other forty pounds, are of the
  finest workmanship.          From the mouth of the fawn water
  fell into a beautiful     conch    of Grecian marble. Behind the
  pedestal    was  a  table,  the   feet of which, of antique yellow,
  represent the     claws   of   an   eagle. These works have also
  been conveyed       to  the Museum.        A lateral corridor, on the
  right   hand,   conducts      to  a  second court, which was sur
  rounded by a portico, as appears by octangular columns
  coated with stucco."
      Near the town of Fiesole, not far from Florence, a beau
  tiful amphitheatre has been also discovered. The earth has
  already been cleared away from the greater part of            it, and
it    appears  that
                  it     was   capable   of containing  at least 30,000
  spectators.
                              VACCINATIOK.
      We hear that Dr. Jenner engaged in collecting reports
                                  is
   from the different states of Europe, and from many of the
   other quarters of the globe, respecting the effects of vaccine
   inoculation on the mortality occasioned        by    the small-pox.
   In several of the largest cities on the continent, we are in
   formed that he has already received the pleasing intelligence
   of the small-pox being either nearly or totally subdued.
   Among them is Vienna.              But how melancholy   is    the re
   flection, that while the great and populous city of Vienna,
    which for time immemorial had been subjected to the                in

XXIX.       Account of Experiments made on a Mineral called
     Cerite, and on the particular Substance which it contains,
     and which has been considered as a new Metal.          By
     M. Vauquelin *.
M.    Kr. APttOTrir wrote to mc, about ci'ght months ago,
that he had discovered, in a mineral of Batsnacs, in Swe
den, a new earth to which he had given the name of ochroit,
on account of the red colour which ii assumes by calcina
tion.   He even sent me in a letter a small specimen of this
substance ; and having discovered   in                   it,
                                                several trials,by
the presence of     considerable quantity of oxide of iron,
                       a                                                    I
started  some doubts, in        note which
                                a              read in the Insti
                                                      I
tute, in regard to the colour of that earth.         observed also
                                                               I
in the same note, that this substance had as manv metallic
properties zs earthy characters      but that the small quantity
                                      ;
6£   itwhich    had in my possession did not allow me to give
                I
any decisive opinion on this subject                 f.
    Some time after, Messrs.' Berzclins and Hisenger, having
been informed,        their correspondents at Paris, of M. Klap-
                       by
roth's labour, wrote to me to claim         priority, stating that
                                                     a
they had sent to M. Klaproth the specimens of that mineral
which he had employed for his experiments, and that at
the same time they had announced to him that they had'
found     new metal in it.
          a                        can give no opinion oh this
                                     I
difference.      Ishall only observe, that the well known de
licacy of M. Klaproth, and the high reputation he has justly
acquired        by
               his numerous and important discoveries, render
it  very improbable that he would appropriate to himself the
discovery of another.       M. Klaproth must, no doubt, have
received from another quarter the mineral in question          and      ;
his labour was perhaps terminated before he acquired any
 information respecting that of the Swedish chemists. What
 seems to justify this opinion             is,
                                       that they obtained results
 entirely different.
    Every thintr, therefore, seems to show that M. Klaproth
 of Berlin, and Messrs. Berzelius and Hisenger of Stock
 holm, made experiments at the same time on the same
 mineral without having any communication               with each
 other; and that each may have had the honour of the dis
 covery.

there   is disengaged carbonic acid as well as nitrous gas
 when nitric acid is employed.
   After ebullition of half an hour the action of the acids
appears to be exhausted, and there remains at the bottom
of the vessel a dust more or less coloured, which is the silex
contained in the mineral.
    When cerite is treated' with eight or ten times its weight
of acid it is entirely decomposed by one operation, and
without the necessity of beginning a second time ; yet it
is impossible by these means to obtain silex perfectly pure :
it always retains a certain quantity of metallic oxide. It is
only by fusing this earth with an alkali, and then combining
it with an acid, that it is possible to obtain it pure, and free
from all colouring matter : it generally forms about seven
teen hundredths of the mineral.         When the solutions of
this matter are evaporated to dryness and the residuum is
dissolved in water, there is formed a slight white precipi
tate, which appears to be a little silex which the acid held
 in solution.
    Solutions of cerium are of a yellowish red colour, like
that of the oxide of iron at its maximum of oxygenation ;
but when cerium is little oxidated they are only of a rose
 colour, similar to those of manganese and cobalt.
    These solutions, decomposed by ammonia, furnish a very
voluminous precipitate, which has the appearance of alu-
mine mixed with oxide of iron, but which greatly differs
from it in its properties : when dried in a gentle heat this
 precipitate is reduced to a granulated powder of a pale vel-
 low colour, which becomes of a brick red by calcination.
The matter simply dried in the air redissolvets readily in the
nitric and muriatic acids ; but the red oxide, that which
has not been calcined, is scarcely attacked, and does not
dissolve in muriatic acid without producing a very consi
derable quantity of oxygenated muriatic acid.
   The nitric solution readily crystallizes : the salt which it
furnishes is soluble in alcohol : in regard to the muriatic
solution it is very difficult to obtain crystals: this salt when
dried is deliquescent.
   The nitric and muriatic solutions are decomposed by al
kaline sulphates, phosphates,       borates, oxalates, tartrites,
and carbonates : with sulphates there are formed yellow pre
cipitates too soluble in water to be subjected to analytical
experiments : besides, a part of the iron oxidated to a max
imum is precipitated at the same time. The precipitate
formed by the borates is still more soluble in acids : that
produced by oxalates is attended with the inconvenience of

precipitates when washed retain their white colour in dry
ing, and dissolve in acids with effervescence : carbonic acid
is disengaged, but not an atom of hydrogenated sulphuretj

hydrogen.
     Zinc, tin, andiron, immersed in a solution of muriate
of cerium, do nor effect a reduction of               it.

    Having made these preliminary trials on cerite, and ascer
tained the principal properties of the particular substance
which     it  contains,       undertook to analyse
                                 I                               it,
                                                         in regard to
quantity,     in  the  following   manner         :
    A hundred parts of this mineral in fine powder were
mixed with ten times their weight of nitro-muriatic acid,
and subjected to ebullition for an hour           the mixture being
                                                      :
diluted with water, and filtered, left on the filter brown                 a
dust, which was dried, and fused with caustic potash. The
mixture being diluted with water, and then dissolved in
muriatic acid, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in
water, left         powder .which when collected on
                     a                                           filter,   a
                                                              washed,

                    made on a   Mineral called Cerite.              19?
   washed, and calcined, weighed seventeen parts : it was
   silex, still slightly coloured yellow.
      The nitro-muriatic solution being evaporated to dryness,
   and its residuum redissolved in water, left about one part
   of silex coloured by a little oxide of cerium.
      The same solution freed from silex, and united to the
   washings of the silex, was decomposed by ammonia : the
   Oxide of cerium and the oxide of iron precipitated by these
   means, were separated from the liquor by filtration.            The
   oxalic acid added to this liquor formed a precipitate which
   by calcination gave two pdrts of lime.
      The metallic oxides, united and calcined, weighed seventy
   parts : they had a beautiful reddish brown colour.           To se
   parate the iron of the cerium the whole was dissolved in
   muriatic acid : the solution being concentrated to evaporate
. the excess of acid, then diluted with water and decomposed
   by tartrite of potash, thefe Was formed a very abundant
   White precipitate) which being washed till it contained no
   more foreign salts, then dried, and calcined, gave sixty-
   seven parts of oxide of cerium.
      The water from the washing of the tartrite; of the cerium,
  being united and mixed with hydro-sulphuret of potash)
  gave a precipitate which became black in the air.             It was
  Oxide of iron, the weight of which after calcination was two
  parts.

      Though the specific gravity of cerite, the varied colours
  assumed by the particular matter it contains, and the oxy
  gen disengaged during its solution in muriatic acid, afforded
  great probabilities in regard to the metallic nature bf this
  Substance ; yet, as it was possible that these properties and
  these phasnomeha might be owing to the presence of some
  known metal, to manganese for example, I endeavoured
 to discover it by all the means Which appeared to me proper
 for accomplishing that end ; but I did hot find any sensible
 traces of it.     It therefore appears to me altogether impro
 bable that mangahese Should contribute any thing towards"
 the properties exhibited by the matter of cerite.          The Case
                                 N3                                 is

1 gs                Account  of Expetiments
is not the same with iron.      I must confess that when any
traces of it remain in the cerium it communicates to it a
darker red colour; but as this matter, when disengaged
 from iron, as far as chemical means will allow, assumes
 still a reddish colour by calcination, and as in this state it
 furnishes as much oxygenated muriatic acid as before, it is
 equally impossible to ascribe these phenomena to the iron,
which, as is well known, produces no oxygenated muriatic
 acid.
     Thus as cerium, in which the slightest sign of the pre
 sence of iron, or of any other foreign matter, could not be
 detected by any means whatever, always assumes a red
 colour by calcination, and then gives oxygenated muriatic
 acid during its solution, 1 am forced to consider it as a
 metallic oxide rather than an earth, as M. Klaproth has
done.       Hitherto, indeed, chemists were not acquainted
 with any earth weighing five times as much as water, which
has a colour of its own, which absorbs oxygen, and which,
dissolving in common muriatic acid, produces oxygenated
muriatic acid.
     I had great hope that the reduction of this matter to the
metallic state by the action of a strong heat would confirm
 the above probabilities, and convert them into certain truths j
but this operation was not, attended with all the success I
expected.
     In the first attempt, in which I had put into a charcoal
 crucible oxalate of cerium reduced to a paste with oil, the
whole was volatilized by the violence and duration of the
heat : at the bottom of the crucible I found only a metallic
grain scarcely so large as the head of a pin, and which was
an alloy of iron and cerium.      This experiment, if it fur
nished no metal, proves at least that oxide of cerium is vo
latile ; and I do not know that an earthy substance was ever
thus volatilized.
    In the second operation I put into a luted porcelain retort
a paste made with lartrite of cerium, a little lamp-black and
oil, in order that I might collect the metal if it should be
volatilized as before ; but as the form of my apparatus did
not permit me to give as much heat, the matter was not
reduced : it remained in its natural state mixed with the
charcoal.
    There were seen, however, on the sides of the retort a
         number of small globules which had. metallic bril-
  lancy, and the substance of which had been manifestly
fjreat
volatilized.    Some of the largest of these globules having
been detached and broken, exhibited in the inside a white
                                                        colour

                     made on a    Mineral called Cerite,                  199
colour and a Foliaceous texture. There was also in the. neck
of the retort a slight reddish covering, the taste of which
 was exceedingly acrid and metallic : the quantity of the
matter which formed this covering was too small to be sub
jected to experiments capable of determining its nature.
    Three of these small metallic globules, which weighed
together scarcely a fourth part of a grain, being put suc
cessively into nitric and muriatic acid, were not sensibly
attacked : to effect the solution of them the union of these
two acids was necessary.          The solution being evaporated,
and its residuum dissolved in water, had no colour ; its taste
was sensibly saccharine; and by the oxalate of ammonia
and the prussiate of potash it gave white and flaky precipi
tates.     It appears, then, that these globules, which I sus
pected to be iron, are reallv cerium.           What is certain            is,
that these globules are much more fragile, whiter, and less
liable to be attacked        acids than cast iron.
                             by
    These experiments prove that cerium            volatile at high
                                                       is             a
temperature, and that         it probably only at the moment of
                                   is
its volatilization that      it reduced, unless we suppose that
                                  is
it   israther volatilized in the state of oxide. This         propose
                                                                  I
 to ascertain       by
                    new trials.
    Recapitulating what has been said             the course of this
                                                      in
 notice,  it    seen, 1st,
               is           That   cerium, freed   from the foreign
 matters which accompany            in the mineral,

                                                             is   a
 susceptible    of uniting   with   two  quantities  of  oxygen very
 distinct.
    2d, That with the first quantity          forms
                                                 it       white sub

 stance, soluble in acids, without any disengagement of ox
 ygen.
    3d, That with the second portion          assumes

 colour, combines only with difficulty with acids, and con
 stantly produces       considerable quantity of oxygenated mu
                         a
 riatic acid    bydissolving iri common muriatic acid.
    4th, That these oxides do not dissolve              alkalies but
                                                            in        ;
 that when boiled together they no longer become coloured
 by  the contact of the air      and that those which are red be

 come white         byslight heat, without, however, combining
                         a
 with the alkalis.
    5th, That their combinations with the sulphuric, phos
 phoric, oxalic, tartareous, and prussic acids arc white, and
 insoluble in water.
    6th, That, on the other hand, those which they form with
 nitric, muriatic, and acetic acids are very soluble in water
 And in alcohol, and are even deliquescent.

saccharine taste.
    8lh, That a good process for separating the iron of cer
rium          is,
           to precipitate the latter from its nitric or muriatic
solution       oxalate of ammonia or tartrite of potash, put
                    by
ting  into  the    liquor     slight excess of acid

better,         is,
             to calcine the muriate of cerium, to redissolve its
residuum in the muriatic acid, to calcine again, and to re
peat this three times, in order to sublime entirely the mu
riate of iron which succeeds very well.
                         ;
    9th, That cerium does not unite with sulphurated hydro
gen, like the other metallic oxides.
     Oth, That,

not      metal,

for these reasons we shall place                         it,

better fitted to any other kind of matters.
    12th, In the last place, that                        by
                                           some lucky chance, or

                                  of
     of October 1804. By M. Pekon, Naturalist to the Ex
     pedition for making Discoveries in Australasia.
                                       [Concluded from   p.    1GG.]
A   have now terminated the general history of petrified and
living zoophytes we have seen them cantoned, as we say,
                                  :
in that zone of the globe comprehended between the 34tb
degree of north and south latitude, where they fill the sea
•with dangerous    reefs, form new islands, enlarge the old
ones, and every where increase the domain of the land at(
the expense or the ocean which nourishes them in its bo
som we have seen their antient labours rising over the sur
          :
face of the waves, and appearing again at great heights above
their present level.    The last phenomenon deserves our at-
                                      6                                        tuition

             applicable to the Tluory   of the Earth.          201
iention for a moment; and two questions here present
themselves      to be resolved.     Have the madrcporic moun
tains been formed in the bosom of the sea? and, supposing
this to be the case, what revolutions were capable of effect
ing so prodigious a change, either in their antient state or
in that of the waves ?
     There can be no doubt that the former of these questions
may, and ought to be, answered in the affirmative.             Ob
servation, — indeed experience, reasoning, and analogy, all
unite to prove that these pelagian animals, the vast remains
of which cover our continents with an organization similar
 to that of families now existing, have had the same origin
 and the same country.        No objection has yet been made
 against   this  general assent.   But If any doubts of this kind
 had been formed in regard to the different banks of testacea,
 or even of zoophytes, disseminated throughout the large
 continents at considerable distances from the sea shore, the
 consequences could not be extended to those reefs, those
 islands, and those archipelagoes, several of which still de
 clare their origin by the little elevation they have acquired
 above the place where they were formed.           It may therefore
  be considered as an incontestable fact, that all the mad re -
  poric productions we have seen raised more or less above
  the present level of the sea, were formed in its bosom.
      The second questiou, it appears, may be resolved with
  as little difficulty.   I shall here observe, to make use of an
  expression of the Nestor of the French navy in regard to the
  enonnous bones seen at the Malouines at a considerable
  distance in the interior, — tlw land has cither been raised «/>,
  or the sea has sunk down.       In the first supposition, we can
  not conceive any other cause susceptible of raising up si
  milar masses, but volcanic eruptions as frequent as energetic.
  But independently of a multitude of other reasons which
  tend to make us reject a cause of this kind, do we not know
   that these grand convulsions of nature always leave behind
   them indelible traces of the disorder and confusion by which
   they are exclusively characterized? But nothing of this kind
   is observed in the madrcporic countries.           1 have
                                                             already
   spoken of the regular forms and insensible gradations of
   the island of Timor, an image and production at the same
   time of the calmness of nature : 1 have already quoted the
   ingenious observations of captain Vancouver, which alone
   are sufficient to show how peaceable was the cause which
                                                                      *
   left these madreporic eminences uncovered, whether its

  SOl               On some zoological Fads
 nished us with Valuable facts on the same subject : aruf
 M.   Fleurieu himself, having given the opinion of these
 two naturalists, expresses himself as follows : — " To which
 of our common systems can we refer the origin of that pro
 digious number of small spots, either scattered or formed
 into groupes, or united into archipelagoes, which, accord
 ing to the most accurate researches, appear to be still in a
 state of increase ? These islands are met with at the di
 stance of 1500 leagues from the continent and from large
 islands, and in the middle of a sea the depth of which can
 not be measured with the sounding-line.         The attentive
 eye of the enlightened observer has discovered nothing ire
 these low islands which indicates the former existence,   re
 mains, or traces of burnt-out volcanoes, or volcanoes swal
 lowed up by the sea; nothing which can show that they were
 produced by any convulsion of the globe : every thing, on
 the contrary, announces that they have been the production
 of ages; that the work is not yet completed; and that a
gradual increase in theih must take place: but that a long
 succession of years is necessary to render it sensible." The
unanimous opinion, therefore, of all observers, while it re
jects every idea of volcanic origin, destroys thereby every
other opinion which might suppose that the earth itself
 could rise above the surface of the waves.    This immediate
consequence then results, that the water must have sunk
down below its antient level.
    A very delicate but interesting question here occurs r
What became of the water of the sea when it abandoned
the summits of the mountains formed in its bosom ? The
solution of this question appears to me to have an imme
diate dependence on another of the same nature, and no"
less difficult : — Whence arises that enormous quantity of
calcareous matter, which, as we see, performs so extensive
a part in the revolutions of the earth ? Here, also, an im
mense field is opened to imagination and hypothesis.      Sa
tisfied myself with having collected, compared, and ar
ranged the most correct observations, that I might deduce
from them the most general and most certain consequences,
I shall give, in a few words, those which I conceive to re
sult from the numerous facts here stated.
    1st, From the absolute difference of the two races, in
New Holland and Van Diemen's Land, as well as from -the
absence of the dog in the latter, 1 think myself authorized
to conclude that the separation of these two countries must
have taken place at a period much more remote than may
at first be supposed.

          applicable to the Theory    of tlie Earth.         203
   2d, The exclusion of all relation between these two races ;
the darker colour of the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land ;
their short, woollv, and curled hair, in a country much
colder than New Holland, where the contrary is the case ;
appear to me to be new proofs of the imperfection of our
systems in regard to the intercourse of nations, their trans
migrations, and the influence of climate on man.
   3d, From the petrified shells and zoophytes which I ob
served in different places and at different heights in Van
Diemen's Land, New Holland, and Timor,          I
                                                infer that the
sea formerly covered that part of the Austral lands which
reaches from the 44th degree of south latitude to the oth,
over an extent of 700 leagues from south to north : a result
the more valuable, as this immense region was the only one
which remained to be known under this point of view.
    4th, Having given this explanation as simple as satisfac
tory in regard to the formation of those beautiful calcareous
incrustations so frequent on the south-west and north-west
coasts of New Holland, I have taken an opportunity of
   roving how difficult itis, in certain cases, to distinguish
E odies altered in this manner from those which arc really
fossils.
  5   th, In my observations on solid zoophytes     Ihave con
firmed their almost absolute exclusion from the most Austral
seas of the Antarctic hemisphere      ;  have proved that this
                                          I
important family of animals     is banished    bynature to the
 middle of the warmest seas, to the. most peaceful equi
 noctial regions, and those which border on them.
     6th, We saw them there, in the state of petrifactions,
 forming all the low islands of the great equinoctial ocean,
and some, at least, of the highest in that sea and in the
 Indian Ocean.
 .   7th, We found them there,       inthe living state, inter
 spersing the sea with new dangers, multiplying the reef's,
 enlarging the islands and archipelagoes, encumbering the
 harbours and ports, and every where throwing up new cal
 careous mountains.
     While man, therefore, who styles himself the king          of
 nature, rears, with labour, on the surface of the earth those
 frail monuments of his pride, which the breath of time
 must soon destroy; feeble animals, which have so long
  escaped his observation, and which he still disdains to no
  tice, multiply at the bottom of the ocean those immense
  testimonies of power which brave ages, and which our
  imagination itself can hardly conceive.

  considerable number of these have been described, or men-'

               Buffon, Pennant, and other writers.             But the
  ornithology of the North American continent                 very im    is
  perfectly understood. Many of our birds have never beefi
  correctly,   ifat all, described.      Some of these undescribed
  species  are large  birds  ; such   as     species of plotus, called
                                                a
  in Carolina the snake-bird not to mention others. But

 is   amatter of more consequence           to study the manners of
  those birds that have already been discovered, than merely
  to detect new species.       I flatter myself that        have made
                                                                    I
  considerable progress in the study of the mores of our birds.
I   have been particularly attentive to their instincts as wtr
  call them, and have evert digested my collection of facts ort
 this subject into order. These facts will form               part of    a          a
 large work on the Instinct of Animals.                    now com
                                                               It   is
 pletely ascertained that some of the American species of
 swallows remain among us in               torpid state.
                                            a              They retire-
 into the crevices of rocks, into the hollows of trees, and
 other similar situations, and rest, for some months, in                            4
 lethargic sleep more or less profound.              The species con
 cerning which      I have the most correct information, as to
 what regards their torpidity, are the purple martin {kirund&
purpurea), and the chimney-bird (hirundo pelasgia) . Both
 of these specieSj      Irepeat it, do sometimes become torpid
 in the climate of Pennsylvania.                    probable that the
                                                    It    is
 other species do the same.         But still adhere to my former
                                            I
 opinion  I
          :    contend that the great body of American swal
lows, of different species, are really migratory birds that                   ;
is, they leave the climates of the United States- on the
coming on of cold weather, and retire southward, to more
favourable latitudes.       These facts show us how much birds
can accommodate themselves to different situations, and
give weight to an opinion which have long enterfainedy
                                                I
that all animals are capable of the torpid condition.            Evert
the little humming-bird {trdchilus colulris), which                un         is
questionably        a(generally) migratory bird,           sometime*is
overtaken     by the colds of our climate, and, on such occa-'
sions, has been known to fall into the torpid state.
                                                                           I   lately

                On the Natural History          of North America.              505
     I
     lately ascertained a fact in ornithology, at once singular
and interesting.      It is well known that the anas sponsa of
Linnaeus, called in the United States summer duck, breed*
in the hollows of trees, on the banks of rivers, or in islands
at a considerable height from the ground. The young ones,
soon after they are hatched, descend the sides of the tree,
and thus make their way into the water. 1 do not know
of a similar fact in the history of birds.
   I have read, with much pleasure, count Morozzo's letter
to you respecting a parrot hatched at Rome*.           1 am sorry,
however, to mid so sensible a writer adhering to the para
dox, that " the parrots both of the old and new continent
never pass the tropics, and seem confined to a zone of 93°
on each side of the equator ; and that " in their wild state
they never pass these limits, which nature seems to have
prescribed to them." The parrots of America are, I assure
you, much greater voyagers than count Morozzo supposes.
They sail far beyond the tropics. They are frequently found
in immense flocks upon the river Ohio as high as the lati
tude of 40° : nay, a verv ItKge flight of these birds has been
seen, on the eastern side oi the United Slates, as high as
the laitudeof 42°f.
    From the birds I pass to the oviparous quadrupeds and
other amphibia.       The American animals of this class have
been very imperfectly investigated.        Notwithstanding your
labours in your inestimable work on the Quadrupeds Out-
pares, and the labours of Schoepf, we possess several spe
cies of testudo which have entirely escaped your attention.
In the western parts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, 8te. there
is a species of this genus considerably allied to, hut stall
different from, the one which you have called la wolle. The
new species is called bv some of our Indians pi-si-li-Tul-p»%
which literally signifies " the soft-shelled turtle." They
are very prolific, and both their flesh and eggs are deemed
excellent eating. Our western rivers, such as the Ohio and
its branches, likewise possess a very remarkable undesc ribed
species of lacerta,             if,
                          indeed,   l>e not entirely a new g«,nur>.

  this is a doubtful point.        Several  of our species of rana    are
  entirely undescribed by naturalists.           I may, with great con
  fidence, make the same observation concerning our ser
  pents.      The little black rattlesnake, which inhabits the
  marshy grounds,      is,
                         I     think,  a   new species.     This species
 is   seldom more than       a    foot in length, and      isdeemed ex
  tremely venomous.      I     suspect the species described         Mr.by
  de Beauvois (in the Transactions of our Society), and which
  he calls crotulus adamavtimts,       is   the same as that which             is
  found in South       America.   I     think    it    not quite certain
                                                      is
  that the crotalus horridus, the most common species of
  North American rattlesnake, extends to South America.
  But do not wish to be understood as speaking positively
      I
  on this subject.
     The history of the rattlesnake         is  by no means complete.
I   have, within the last two years, devoted               great deal of
                                                           a
 attention to this curious subject.         I   have had      number of
                                                               a
 living   rattlesnakes   under   my  immediate      care.  I  have  made
 a considerable number of experiments to ascertain the ef
 fects of the venom of- this reptile upon different animals.
It    isunquestionably   a   most powerful poison.            often kills
                                                               It
 in very few minutes. The effects of the poison are very
     a
 various, not only in different species of animals, but even
 in different individuals of the same species.             It sometimes
 induces most violent pains, which,           if   we may judge from
 the cries of the bitten animal, continue nearly to the close
 of its life. At other times, the poison induces death with
 out creating any or but very little pain.           Hitherto my prin
 cipal experiments have been made with warm-blooded ani
 mals, such as dogs, cats, and rabbits.            I    am inclined to
 think that the venom exerts very inconsiderable effects upon
 cold-blooded animals. Warm-blooded animals that have
been most violently affected      by   the poison, sometimes strug
gle through      the danger,    and  perfectly recover, although no
remedy      has   been   applied. This may serve to show how
many     inert  vegetables have acquired the reputation of curing
the bite of the rattlesnake.     I    have ventured to apply        por a
tion of the undiluted venom of              a    rattlesnake, recently
thrown from its fang, to my tongue.              I    made this experi
ment in the presence of several gentlemen. But do not               1
think shall venture to repeat the experiment.
          I                                                      did not
                                                                   I
find the venom insipid, as the abbe Fontana and his servant
did the venom of the viper.            It    had, on the contrary,             a
peculiarly     pungent   taste,  and  left,   fora   considerable time,
a  pretty strong sense of heat upon my tongue and fauces.
My observations have extended to every' thing that might
                                                                            tend

tend to illustrate the history of this wonderful reptile.           I
have found that its powers of digestion are very strong.
Even the bony fabric of the animals which it devours is
completely digested, or reduced to the state of a fluid mortar.
This I   have several times observed.         Great, however, as is
the faculty of digestion in this reptile, it is capable of living
a very long time without any food, unless, perhaps, a small
quantity of water. One of my rattlesnakes lived, without
having ate one grain of any solid food, from the 28th of
April to about the 9th of March following.            It then died ;
but upon examining it I found it very fat. I have now two
of these reptiles in my possession.       One of them has eaten
nothing since the middle of October last.           The rattlesnake
sheds its skin at least once every year.            During the two
summers that I have been making observations upon these
animals, the old ones have shed their skins only once each
year, viz. about the end of July. A young one, however,
shed its skin twice in the course of the year, and that with
in five weeks. A rattle, or bell, is formed with each cast
ing of the skin. It appears, therefore, that the full grown
reptile generally acquires one bell annually.             But 1 have
elsewhere shown* that we cannot, with confidence, calculate
the age of the animal from the number of its bells. I have,
after much inquiry, ascertained the period at which these
reptiles copulate. The Indians arc my authorities.              They
assert that it is when the Indian corn (zea mays) is in
flower; that is, about the 10th or 15th of July, between
the latitudes of 39° and 41°.
   I have had a number of very fine drawings made to repre
sent the anatomical structure of the crotalus.           These draw
ings it is my intention to have engraved, by some of the best
of your artists, for my Anatomy arid Physiology of the Rat
tlesnake; a work which I hope to publish in three or four
years.    It will contain every thing 1 have observed, or have
been able to collect, relative to the structure, the functions,
the manners &c. of the crotalus horridus; together with
observations on some other species of the same genus, and
on various species of coluber, &c. all natives of the United
States.
   Perhaps no country of equal extent is richer in insects
than the United States.       In no country is it an object of
more importance to attend to the history of these ammals ;
for among them are enlisted some of the greatest enemies
to the labours and industry of man. The heats of our cli-

 mates are extremely favourable to the generation arttd in
crease of insects : our colds are not sufficient to destroy
them.      We do not cultivate one important vegetable that
is not exposed to the devastations of some highly injurious
species of insect.         Our wheat, you know, has for many
years greatly suffered by a species of tipula, called by us
the Hessian fly.        This, at present, is much less formidable
in its ravages than it has been. The curculio, or weavil,
which it      is highly probable we received from Europe, is
still very destructive in the southern parts of the United
States.     A species of cimex, not, I think, described, as
sists other insects in destroying the finest of all the cerealia;
I mean the zea mays, or Indian corn. Partly owing to the
ravages of insects, it is to be feared that, in the course of
a very few years, there will be a great scarcity of that fine
fruit the peach in our country *.               I could mention a hun
dred other insects of the most pernicious kinds.                       It is a
melancholy       fact,  that    the  industry     of my  countrymen        has
been much more exerted in destroying the insects which'
infest one of the vilest of plants, I mean the tobacco, than
in endeavouring to stop the ravages of any of those species-
which lay waste the most useful of our Crops !
    You must not, however, suppose, from what I have said,
that the study of entomology is entirely neglected in the
United States. On the contrary, this vfery important branch
of natural history (for such, when it is properly cultivated,
it unquestionably is,) has several votaries, some of them ar
dent votaries, in our country.               The principal of these is
the reverend Mr. Valentine Melscheimer, a clergyman, who
employs a portion of his time in the cultivation of this sci
ence, which has always been deemed favourable to religion.
This gentleman has discovered several hundred new species
of American insects, a catalogue arid description of which
may, perhaps, be published.              I must still regret, however,
that it is chiefly the nomenclature of the North American-
insects that i» attended to. Other more important parts 6f
their natural history are too much neglected.                     Some pro
gress, however, has already been made in discovering re
medies against the ills which result from these animals.
Moreover the useful properties of several other species have
been discovered.         Various species of the gemis lytta of Fa-
bricius inhabit our country.            The lytta vittata of this eri-

cacious substitute for the cantharides of the, shops, and is
now employed, with this view, by many of our physicians.
    I shall conclude this part of my letter by observing, that
I still continue my inquiries into the natural history of the
North American tribes. On this subject I have read before
our Philosophical Society a discourse, which it is my inten
tion to publish in a much more enlarged and perfect shape.
Since the publication of my New Views, I have made great
progress in collecting and comparing the! languages of the
American tribes with one another, and with thelanguages-
of Europe and Asia. Every step I take only serves to con
firm me in my former opinion, that the (known) radical
languages of North America are very few in number, and
that all the Americans are of Asiatic origin.        I have lately
received from Mexico an inestimable treasure, — a collection
of a number of vocabularies of the old Mexican dialects.
Between these and the dialects of Asia I find great affinities,
sufficient to convince me that the Mexican nations (con
trary to the paradox of Camper) are not of European ori
gin ; much more than sufficient to excite in me the greatest
surprise that the learned abbe Clarigero, after leisurely
comparing the Mexican languages with those of the old
world\ should have found no affinity between them. The
affinities, 1 repeat  it, are very great.
    Of all the branches of natural history, none,   I    think, is
so little cultivated in the United States as mineralogy. This
is  the more remarkable, not merely           reason of the great
                                             by
utility of this branch of the science, but because its sister
science,I    mean chemistry,     is ardently cultivated in dif
 ferent parts of the country, particularly in Philadelphia.
Mineralogy, however,        not entirely neglected
                            is                     in  the United
States.  It    possesses, among other votaries, an ingenious
cultivator   in Dr. Adam Seybert, to whom we are indebted
for the discovery of   a  mineral which      issupposed to be co
rundum or adamantine spar. This         is fouud to be abundant
in the neigh bourliood of Philadelphia.          Mineralogy and
chemistry, and    I  may add the other branches of natural
history, have lately sustained   a  loss, not perhaps easily to
be repaired, in the death of Mr. Thomas P. Smith,       a  young
man of the most capacious mind, and of the warmest en
thusiasm for the attainment and promotion of science.

210        On the "Natural History          of North America.
    Mines of various kinds          are very abundant in the United
States.      We     are extremely rich in iron, -copper, and lead.
The iron mines of Pennsylvania are, perhaps, inexhaustible.
 Prodigious quantities of copper, nearly in a native state,
 have been discovered near Lake Superior.                      A bed of cin
 nabar has been discovered in Virginia; and several veins of
 plumbago have been detected in Pennsylvania and other
 parts ot the Union.           As to gold and silver, these, as yet,
 are principally to be found in the fields that are cultivated
 by the virtuous hand of agriculture. Our country is ex
 tremely rich in coal. This useful article has hitherto been
 found in the greatest abundance in the western parts of the
 United States, beyond the Alleghaney mountains.                         It is in
 this same part      of the  continent that     the principal     salt  springs,
 and mines of sal-gem or rock-salt, are found. In a few years
 we shall, in all probability, be able to do without the salt
 of Europe. Hitherto very little sal-gum has-been detected
 within the limits of the United States.                I am not, indeed,
 certain that any has been detected.                   It must, however,
abound -at no great distance from the immense salt springs,
 which are now found in so many parts of our country. Of
 sal-gem, however, prodigious quantities have been disco
 vered in the country that is watered by some of the branches
 of  the Missouri, west of the Mississippi*.
     I have lately returned from a three months tour (which
had been principally undertaken for the recovery of my
 health) through the western parts of Virginia. I have visited
many of the most interesting natural objects in that part of
 the United States, and have brought home a veTy considera
 ble collection of vegetables.            In travelling over some of the
principal ranges dt our mountains, particularly the Blue
*idge and the North Mountain, I have not observed that
any of them are purely granitical. The -stone composing
 these mountains is, indeed, various ; but I -think the pre
 dominant species is a petro-^ilex, of different degrees of
 hardness. Veins of schistus are sometimes found upon
some parts of these mountains ; but such veins aTe princi
pally abundant about their bases. I have paid particular
attention to the declivities of the mountains.                    These I'find
to be much less regular than Mr. Kirwan's ingenious ob
servations (concerning mountains in general) would lead us

             is                          Jn some places the
 riofth-west and       othersinthe south-east sides are the
 steepest. The valley which    comprehended   between the

 North Mountains, and the Blue Ridge    principally calca         is

   with the mountains, that                    is,
                                       north-east and south-west.
 When the        nearest mountain varies from this direction,                        J
   observed that the adjacent strata in the valley do the same.
   These strata are sometimes perpendicular in their position,
   but never horizontal.           remarkable, however, that most

    It    has long been conjectured that the calcareous valley

   since my late researches have convinced me that the calca-
   reous strata abound with mariue. exuviae of various kinds.
 It     is   circumstance very remarkable, that marine vestiges
             a
   are much less abundant in the calcareous strata that are
   nearest to the present ocean, than in those which are at                            a

XXXII.         On feeding     Cattle with green Food; together
    with    other   ingenious and valuable Observations in Agri
    culture.     By    Mr. Edward Powrs*.
A conceive the principal object respecting agriculture in
the present state of this country, is to procure the greatest
possible supply of the necessaries of life within the kingdom
itself, and one principal means of doing this            to raise the       i3,
greatest produce       from    given quantity
                               a                of land.
    To effect this, every encouragement should be given                                        by
land-owners to the cultivation of grain and turnips               be                       ;
cause I   look upon the produce of an acre of grain to be, to
the produce of an acre of grass, in the proportion of at least
fifteen to two, in furnishing the necessaries of life.           sup                  I
pose the grain made into bread, and the grass digested by
a  feeding beast, and changed into an increase of weight.
    One great means of increasing the growth of gram and
turnips,   I  think, would be to encourage the farmer to make
as much manure as possible.              This would be effected                                by
allowing him to sell all his wheat and rye straw, with the
restriction of laying out the whole price in manure and                               ;        by
gentlemen, who have land in their hands, trying the expe
riment of keeping their cattle and horses in the house upon
green food great part of the summer.
    For these last six years have sold all the wheat straw
                                            I                                                  I
did not want for thatching and the beds of certain kinds of
horses, and can assure you that the same farm has pro
 duced for some years back one-third more grain, and keeps
double the live stock          did six years ago..

 thrown into low cratch (or receptacle, with staves on each
 side) for my pigs, which have generally been from 25 to
 40. My horses and pigs, thus fed, have eaten, between the
 beginning of May ana corn harvest, ham 2£ to 3-J- acres,
 according to the goodness of the clover.            My horses have
 been, by this means, in much better condition than            turned                 if
 into a  field  ; there has been      saving of at least eight or ten

    The first year     I  tried the experiment the manure made
was estimated by a good farmer at 20l. ; but I wish to make
allowance for the value of the straw, and the manure that
would have been made by the horses standing in the stable
the usual hours in summer.
    I must endeavour to remove an objection that may per
haps be made to this experiment, by observing, that I can
 not think land injured any more by the green food being
cut by the scythe, than by cattle or horses ; and as to the
dung that is dropped in summer, it breeds flies, and does
more harm than good. I have ever thought land exhausted
infinitely more by its produce being suffered to ripen and
seed, than by its being cut in a green state.                   The advan-   ,
tage I had derived from this experiment, induced me last
summer to try whether cattle might not be treated in the
same way.
    I began with putting into stalls 19; I afterwards increased
my stock fed in this manner to 50, consisting of horses,
feeding cattle, milking cows and colts, besides a large quan
tity of pigs.
    The horses, as usual, answered well.
    The feeding cattle came on much faster than I ever saw
them in summer.            The milking cows fed very much, and
milked very well. The colts did well, and lived chiefly
upon the refuse of the cattle. The pigs, as usual, ate the
refuse of the horses.
    The quantity of land run over with the scythe for this
purpose    was   :
    Fourteen acres of trefoil, very moderate, on account of
the clover root having died in winter.
   Two acres of vetches, very moderate^ on account of the
severe winter.
    Five acres of very good grass.
                                    O 3                                 The

214                 On feeding Cattle with green Food.
   The cattle were turned out late at night for about six or
 seven hours.
   The trefoil caused some trouble, on account of the cattle
 sometimes swelling, but brought them on very well, though,
 they throve best upon the winter vetch or tares, and upon,
 the grass.   The daily expense was one old man of more
 than 70, to feed and clean them, another young man to
 cut, rake, and carry the food with a single horse cart.
  If this stock had been turned out I should suppose they
would have run over at least 60 acres, if the crop had been
good, and much more, if the indifferent trefoil id consi
dered.

 servation, but from that also of several farmers and but
 chers, who came through curiosity or business frequently
 to visit them.      The most feeding green food          wintef               is
 vetches ;   and the most advantageous mode of cultivating
 them,   I  think,    to plough up clean stubble (that
                         is                       a           in                         is
 tended for turnips), manure         and sow    it,with vetches     it
 soon after corn harvest.     When the vetches are all cut                                         in;
 May and June, or rather in the latter month, the field may
 be ploughed and sown with turnips for        winter crop.      a
     From com harvest till September 22, my cattle were all
 out in the fields at grass.    then took up thirty into stalls,
                                       I
 and fed them with turnips which had been sOwn early in
 May, and which had arrived at very good size. My first
                                                 a
 field of turnips has been carried off, ploughed and sown
 with wheat, which has been above the ground some time,
 and looks very promising.
 I     have practised this scheme of sowing turnips in May,
 carrying them off before the beginning or end of the fol
lowing November, and then sowing the piece with wheat,
for these last three years.     And have found this wheat
                                                 I
                                                          much

               On feeding Cattle with grew Food,              81$
Much more productive: than any sown after any other crop,
or fallow.     I am sneaking of dry sown land.
    One year I got up all the turnips of a field, topped and
hutted them (throwing the tops and butts in heaps by them
selves)^ carried the top* inwaediately as they were cut to a.
bare stubble for my cattle and sheep, and l.yd the butts up
m. large heap* either under cover or in say stack-yard, with
straw over them.       Where there was no straw in layers be
tween them, they kept for two or three mouths ; some that
had layers of straw every foot or half yard perpendicular,
soon began to decay aear the straw, which was made to
hsat by the moisture from the turnips.
    From these experiments upon turnips, and from observ
ing J.hai dry land of my own, though it produced crops of
grain or turnips for many years together, with the change
of clover (mown twice in the same year) only once in five
years, did not lose any of its power, I have conceived that
much more grain might be produced upon well cultivated]
farms.     Wet land that is well cultivated might bear, iu
regular succession, crops of turuips, wheat, and barley or
oats. Dry sound land may also bear the sa.n*e succession
when an early crop of turnips is wanted ; and when turnips
are wanted to stand the winter, a succession of turnips,
barley, and wheat.
    I think it is much more advantageous to cany all the
turnips to cattle in stalls (except a very few left for sheep)
 than to eat them on the land, because they furnish much
 more food and manure.        I ant aware that many gentlemen
 of landed property will object to this constant tillage : in
 answer to which I shall only observe, that it has been rny
 opinion and practice uevcr to have any grass land that is
 not worth 40s. an acre; never to plough my grass land,
 but to till the rest constantly, with the intermission now and
 then of turnips and clover, the latter onlv for one year.
    The farm I have above alluded to is about 240 acres, of
 which I have in grass land about 90 acres ; in tillage for
 grain and turnips about 1 20 acres.       The rest is generally
 clover, unless I have a single fallow for wheat upon a field
 of wet land.
    I repeat it once more, that the interests of the public, of
 the landlord, and tenant, (for I know of no distinction when
 many years are taken into consideration) are united in the
 greatest produce of the necessaries of life ; and that it arable
 land is ktpt clean and full of manure, it receives no injury
 from producing the greatest quantity of grain.         The in-

216          On feeding Cattle luith green Food.
creased produce of land benefits the public in too obvious a
manner to enlarge upon.       It benefits the landlord, by his
being able, at the expiration of certain fair intervals, to raise
the rent of his farm ; and the tenant or occupier, by getting
more profit from a given quantity of land, and with nearly
a given capital.
   I have recommended turnips once in three years, because
I think land requires cleaning once in that time, and be
cause it is thus effected without losing the benefit of a crop
in any year.
     Much  has been lately said about the superior advantage
of cattle over horses in fanners' teams. I think some horses
must be kept for the farmer to take his grain to market,
and to carry his coal and lime.        Ifhe is so near a large
town that he can draw at least two load of dung in a day,
he will also want them for that purpose. Other team-work
may very well be done by cattle. But "I think cows are
much more useful and beneficial than oxen, and that it
would be an advantage to the kingdom       if few or no oxen
were  reared.   The uses of cattle are to work, milk, and
feed. I have seen barren cows work as well as oxen ; they
require less keep, and walk faster.   Oxen are of no use to
the dairy, and they will not feed so fast as cows.
     When first I commenced farmer  I followed the example
of my   predecessor, in feeding chiefly oxen; but I soon
found that cows fed much faster and on less meat, and for
some years past have carefully avoided having any oxen in
my stalls.
                           Meadows.
   It should be considered as a great object of every land
lord, or his steward, to procure watered or flooded mea
dows.
   The best means of doing this      is,to place the farm-yar4
on such an eminence of the farm that       stream can be pro
                                            a
cured to run through     it, and afterwards over the greatest
quantity of meadow land.
   Common meadows ought to be well manured once in
three years, and will then produce one ton and         ahalf of
hay per acre, and  a  pasture from the middle of September
to Christmas.
   Good watered meadows will bear to be grazed from the
beginning or middle of August till May following, and will,
between that time and hay harvest, produce one-fourth of
hay more than the other.

   The difference of the profit of watered meadows over

    One-third of b\. (the expense of manuring an

    But besides the produce and profit, there are two other
very great advantages in watered meadows. Theone,saving
manure for arable land, the other keeping the pastures free
from stock the beginning of spring.
    I have hitherto only mentioned a stream that runs through
a farm-yard, but I have frequently observed very great ad
vantages derived from nothing but clear spring water being
 turned over grass land.
    If a farmer has a greater command of water than he
wants for his meadows and pasture land, he may occasion
 ally till some of them for two or three years, and they will
 produce great crops without manure.       I saw this practised
 with great success, this last summer, by the late Mr. Bake-
well, of Dishley, Leicestershire.
                           Size  of Farms.
    Much has     been lately said upon the size of farms, from
 the   high price of grain being supposed to arise from the
 opulence of the farmer, and his being able to keep back
 his grain from the market. 1 might combat this assertion
by the well known fact, that at the harvest of 179-4 there
 was not a fortnight's consumption of wheat in the king
 dom, and yet the price was moderate.       I might also add,
 that there never was so much wheat brought to market be
 fore Christmas as has been for these last two years, and that
 it has only been when wheat was plentiful that any of the
 stock remained in stacks at harvest ; but I think the high
 price is known by sensible thinking people to arise from
 other causes.     I shall therefore proceed to observe, that
 farms of from SOOl. to SOOl. per annum, and upwards, are
 much more beneficial to the public, the landlord, and te
 nant, than farms of from 50l. to lool. per annum.          The
 public are benefited by fewer people and horses being kept
 upon one farm of 300l. per annum, than upon six of 50l.
 each to do the same work, and therefore by a greater pro
 duce being left, after the supply of the families, for the
 consumption of the kingdom at large.

       The landlord
                  is benefited by having fewer buildings to
erect and repair, and  by having more opulent tenants. The
benefit of a large  farm  to the occupier I need not enlarge
upon.     The misery of the small farmer, under 50l. per an-
num, is extreme.      He has not constant employment for
himself and family       at all large) upon his farm
                              (if                        he    in           ;        is
general   above working   day   labour,  is unable to exert him
self and improve his small tract of land, and sits            the                   by
fire-side with his family great part of the winter, lamenting
that his farm and his capital are not larger, and brooding
nothing but discontent and indolence.
   But while am making these observations upon the ad
               I
vantage of large over small farms, let me notice the great
benefit and comfort that the common workman, in any
line, derives from sufficient grass land being attached to
his dwelling to keep a cow in summer and winter. The
landlord win also receive benefit, as well as self-satisfaction,
from being the cause of the plenty that the produce of                                    a
cow makes in      large and poor family.
                    a
  I   can from experience assert, that the cottager can afford
to give his landlord one-third,      not one-half, more for that

a isgenerally more than one year's rent, and the addition of
   small cow-house           is
                         trifling expense.
                              a
 I    cannot help recommending this the more strongly, be
cause    Iknow well, from experience, the astonishing com
fort and advantage that     poor family receives from the pro
                                    a

the charcoal it gives out but little caloric ; and on the other
hand, to the difficulty of imparting a certain degree of heat
to a mixture into which a large quantity of a body that is so
bad a conductor of heat as charcoal enters.       To remedy the
first of these defects, 1 had already proposed to increase the
 proportion of charcoal a little, and to incorporate with the
mixture of charcoal and sulphate of barytes a twentieth of
nitrate of potash. To remedy the second, Mr. Goettling
advises to add muriate of 3oda to the mixture, which serves
at the Same time as a conductor of heat and a flux.         The
following is his method :
     Four parts of native sulphate of barytes in fine powder
are to be mixed with one part of muriate of soda ana half a
part of charcoal powder. This mixture is to be pressed hard
into a Hessian crucible, and exposed for an hour and half
to a red heat in a good wind-furnace.        After it has grown
cold, the mass is to be reduced to a coarse powder, and
bojled for a moment with sixteen parts of water.         The li
quor is then to be filtered, and kept in well stopped bottles.
     The time of "exposure to heat may be shortened to one
half, if the quantity of muriate of soda be doubled, and the
matter occasionally stirred. In this case, too, double the
quantity of water should be used to lixiviate the mass.
     To prepare muriate of barytes with this lixivium of sql-
phuret of barytes, which at the same time holds in solution
muriate of soda, muriatic acid is to be added in separate
portions till sulphurated hydrogen gas is no longer extri
cated. The liquor is then to be filtered, a little hot water
is to he poured on the residuum, and the liquor is to be
evaporated to a pellicle.      The lixivium being then filtered
afresh, is to be Set to crystallize ; the muriate of soda, which
is much more soluble in water than the muriate of barytes
and not more soluble with heat than without, is not depo
sited by cooling, and the muriate of barytes crystallizes
alone.
     The remaining lixivium is to be evaporated and set to
crystallize again, and this is to be repeated till no more
crystals of muriate Of barytes are formed.
     The barytic salt thus obtained, if care be taken not to
employ an excess of muriatic acid, is perfectly white on
account of the hydro-sulphuret, by which the iron and
other metallic substances are precipitated.         To be more
certain that it contains no muriate of soda, the different
 products of the crystallization should be mixed together
jliissolved, and re-crystallized.

  XXXIV.        Report on the Means of measuring the initial
      Velocity of Projectiles thrown from Cannon, both in an
     inclined and a horizontal Direction.             Read in the Phy
     sical and Mathematical Class of the French National
     Institute in the Month of December 1504*.
  JL he class charged Messrs. Bossut, Monge, and myself,
 to give in a report on the means for measuring the initial
 velocity of projectiles thrown from cannon, proposed by
'colonel Grobert, who constructed an apparatus of such di
 mensions that we could employ it for our preliminary ex
 periments. This apparatus was as follows :
     A  horizontal revolving axis, of about .34 decimetres in
 length, has at eadh of its extremities a disk or circle of
 pasteboard placed perpendicular to the axis, the centres of
 which are-in the same axis, to which it is fastened in such
 a manner that the whole system can turn rapidly without
 the respective positions of its different parts being deranged.
    The rotary motion is communicated to the axis and to
 the disks by means of a weight suspended at the extremity
 of a rope, which, after passing over a pulley raised ten or
 twelve yards above the ground, rolls itself round the arbor
 of a wheel and axle fixed at the same level as the disks. An
 endless chain, which passes round on the one side the wheel
 of the axle, and on the other a pulley fixed on the axis of the
 disks, transmit to that axis the motion which the weight
 communicates to the wheel and axle during its fall.
    This apparatus, as is seen, has the merit of being simple;
 and without entering into further details it may be readily
•conceived how it can be employed for measuring hori
 zontal velocities.       Let us suppose that the two disks are
 at rest, and that a ball traverses them in a direction pa
 rallel to the axis or the line passing through their centres :
 it is manifest that this axis will be in the same plane with
 the holes made in the disks ; but if the disks turn around
 their axis while the ball passes from the one to the other,
 the plane containing the axis of rotation and the first hole
will not coincide with the second hole ; and if a second
 plane be made to pass through the second hole and the axis,
 the angle formed by these two planes will be the measure
 of the arc described by any point of the disks, while the ball
 or bullet passes over the interval by which they are sepa
 rated.

  The question then            is,   to   measure   the    velocity   of       the
bullet.
   1st, To impress an angular, uniform, and known velo
city to the system of the axis and the two disks.
   2d, To measure the arc comprehended between the two
planes passing through the axis, and each of the holes or
passages which the bullet has opened through the disks.
   In the experiments which were made, the motion became
sensibly uniform when the weight had arrived nearly at the
half of the vertical space which    traversed itthis was ascer
                                                          :
tained     measuring at two periods the time elapsed during
           by
the third and fourth quarters of the fall, and then comparing
these times with the corresponding spaces passed over. For
these measures we employed two excellent time-pieces that
beat seconds     one
                 ;        by
                          Louis Berthoud, and the other                         by
Breguet.
    In almost the whole of the experiments we substituted
for the measure of the vertical space passed over                      theby
weight,    that   of the number     of  turns  and    fractions  of turns
made       by the arbor of the wheel and axle during                given
                                                                      a
number of seconds, which in every respect was much more
precise and convenient.
    Then, to measure the arc passed over              by the disks while
 the ball went from the one to the other, we placed before
 each of these disks       a  screen or fixed piece of pasteboard,
 which was at very small distance from
                     a                                it  so that the ball
                                                          ;
 during    its  passage  first traversed   the  first   screen,  then the
 first disk  ;  then the second screen, and afterwards the se
 cond disk.       When the piece was discharged the hole of
 the first disk was brought opposite to that ot the first screen,
 and these two holes were            in
                                     the same straight line with that
 made in the second screen                wire, directed horizontally,
                                          ;   a
 through the centre of the latter hole, pierced the second
 disk;    and the arc, having its centre in the axis of rotation
  comprehended between the extremity of that wire and the
  centre of the hole made          the ball in the Second disk, gave
                                     by
  the  measure     of  the  angle described         bythe system of the
  two disks, while the ball had passed over the length of the
  axis.
        may be readily seen that the fixed screens, which give
    It
  the absolute direction of the ball in space, furnish the means
  of making an allowance for the want of parallelism, there           if
  be any between that direction and the axis of rotation of
  the disks.
     The cannon employed for throwing the projectile was
  placed horizontally and parallel to the arbor of the disks, at
                                                                 a    sufficient

   222         Means    of measuring  the initial Velocity
  a sufficient distance from the first disk, that the motion
  given to the air by the explosion of the powder should not
  hurt the motion of that disk.
      An apparatus exactly similar to the above was established'
  by colonel Grobert in a place belonging to the School of
  Bridges and Causeways, where, with the commissioners,
  he made, a few years ago, a great number of experiments,
   at which were present several officers of the engineers and
   artillery, among whom were general Marescot and the se
   nator La Martiliiere.
      This apparatus was far from having those dimensions and
  that perfection of which it was susceptible, and which the
  author proposes to give it. The object of the commis
   sioners, therefore, was not so much to furnish results useful
   to the artillery, as to ascertain what advantage might be de
  rived from it when constructed as it ought to be.
      It is proper, before we speak of our experiments, that we
   should resolve a difficulty which naturally occurs to all men
  who are in the least acquainted with this subject, and which
  arises from the enormous difference supposed to exist be
  tween the velocity of a projectile thrown from a cannon
  and the angular velocity that may be given to the disksv
  It is concluded, indeed, from the experiments already
  known in regard to artillery, that the time employed »>y
  the ball or bullet in passing over the distance of th*ee or
  four metres between the disks must be smaller than the
  hundredth part of a second, and it can hardly be conceived
  that during so short a time the disks can describe a sensible
  arc.
      The solution of this difficulty is as follows : — .When the
  motion has become uniform, the wheel and axis make ge
  nerally 0*833 turns per second, and the axis of the disks*
  7*875 turns, which thus made 6*56 turns per second, cor
  respond to each turn of that wheel : therefore a point placed
  on one disk at the distance of a metre from the axis passed
  over about 41 metres per second, which gives for l-ioodth
  second 41 centimetres, a length more than sufficient ito
  furnish very exact measures.
      The experiments were made with a common infantry
  musket and a horse musketoon, the barrels of which were
  respectively 1*137 metres and 0"765 of interior length..
  They were charged with cartridges furnished from thearse-
.•nal.     The first series of experiments having been more -re
  gular   than  was presumed, they were encouraged to employ
 .more precision in the charges and more care in the proofs.
  The bails were weighed exactly : their mean weight was*

    824      Means     of measuring       the t7iilial Velocity
        The mean velocity deduced from the ten preceding expe1-
   riments is 390*47 metres, nearly the same which results
    from the whole of the experiments. The mean value found
   for the velocity per second of balls thrown from-the infantry
   musket was 428 metres, the ratio of which to the preceding
   is as 1 1 to JO. These experiments seem to indicate that the
   infantry musket might be shortened without much lessening
   its range ; but besides that the commissioners had no inten
   tion of deducing from these first trials any conclusions ap
   plicable to artillery, it is proper to observe, that some mili
   tary considerations, besides those of range, are in favour of
   length in an infantry musket.
        If we wished to select from the accurate experiments hi
  therto published in regard to the projectiles of artillery some
  proper for being nearly an object of comparison with those
  mentioned above, we might take from the work r! doctor
  Hutton those which he made with a cannon of the smallest
  dimensions, and which he marks No. 1, the bore of it
  being 7 decimetres in length and about 51 millimetres in
 diameter. The general results consigned to a table formed
  from the whole of the experiments, give for the case, when
  the weight of the charge of powder           is,as above, one-half
 that of the bullet, an initial velocity of 435 metres per se
 cond, which differs very little from the velocity found with
 the infantry musket. Dr. Button's pieces numbered                2,
                                                                   3",
 and 4, and which were longer, gave mean velocities more
 considerable.
      The commissioners made some trials with half charges,
 that is     to say, expelled the ball with the fourth part of its
weight of powder the mean value of the velocity of the
                    :
 ball thus projected was found for the infantry musket to be
 254 metres, and for the musketoon 252.              These two velo
cities     are  sensibly equal, and  exceed  the halves 214 and 195
                                           ¦
of     those      by
               given     whole  charges.
      There is reason to presume that these circumstances de
pend chiefly on the complete inflammation of the powder
which takes place when there         is  only half charge.
                                                     a
      In the last place, the commissioners, to multiply their
trials on the application of colonel Grobert's apparatus to-
horizontal firing, wished       to   obtain some data in regard to*
the resistance offered     by    the air to the motion of the ball,
the diameter of which was 15 or 16 millimetres.                 The
mouth of the barrel, which was first at the distance of 2-35'
metres from the first fixed screen, was removed to that of
1  8-44 metres,   by     means of which its distance from the first,
fixed screen was 20-79 metres. In this position the velocity
                                                                  with

                of Projectiles tltrown from         Centrum.        225
Vith which the ball thrown from            the infantry musket passed
  over the interval between the one disk and the other, was
 found at a mean value to be 315 metres per second instead
 of 428. The diminution is in the ratio of 42 to 34. The
 experiments of the last kind arc few in number, and wc
 shall deduce from them no conclusion : we shall not say
 any thing either of some trials which were made to deter
 mine the loss of velocity which the ball experiences in
  traversing the two first leaves of the pasteboard ; as the
  principal object of our trials was not, as already said, to
 employ this first apparatus for the advancement of the
 science of artillery, but to acquire some idea of the advan
 tage which this science might derive from it when con
 structed with that perfection of which it is susceptible.
     One of the most important changes which the author
 proposes       to increase the diameter of the disks and the
              is,
 length   of  their  axis         in
                                such       manner as to render them
                                                a
 proper   for determining     the  initial velocities of cannon balls
 of different calibres.           would be difficult to assign previ
                                  It

 mentation compatible with the possibility and exactness of
 experiments but there
                    ;              no doubt that the apparatus we
                                       is
 used might be made of much greater dimensions, and such
 as might render        fit to be employed for trials with cannon.

     Colonel Grobert proposes another change, which derives
 its principal utility from that already mentioned.           The ob
ject of  it   isto afford the means of traversing the disks by
 throwing balls in different directions,, from the horizontal
 to that which forms half             right angle with the vertical
                                            a
 line. To accomplish this end ne has invented the follow
 ing mechanism, which             simple and easilv constructed —
                                       is                           :
 He does not make the disks revolve around common axis, a
 but gives to each of them              particular horizontal axis, to
                                            a
 which  a   pulley    affixed. The axis of the windlass has two
                        is
 equal wheels corresponding to two pulleys, and two endless
 chains, each of which passes round                wheel and
                                                    a          pulley.
                                                                a
 The rotary motion which the windlass receives from the
 descending weight          thus communicated to the disks, and
                             is
 the dimensions of the wheels and pulleys must be well re
 gulated to make the disks turn together and to perform ex
 actlv the same number of revolutions in the same period.
 This condition being fulfilled, the supporter of one of the
 disks (that which         furthest from the cannon)
                             is                              disposed

link to the chain corresponding to that disk, in order to

SS8         Means    of measuring the  initial Velocity
give it sufficient length ; and by lowering the cannon it is
thus possible to traverse the disks in different directions in
clined to the horizon.     It may be remarked that the pro
jection of the surface of the disks on the plane perpendi
cular to the line of firing decreases more and more in pro
portion as that line inclines ; but this is a very small in
convenience, as the greatest decrease which takes place in
the ratio of about 7 to 5, leaves still a sufficient field for
pointing with all the precision requisite.
    It will not, perhaps, be so easy as might at first be be
lieved to adjust the wheels, the pulleys, and the engage
ment, in such a manner as that the two disks may turn ex
actly together ; we are, however, of opinion that there is
nothing in this part of the apparatus which may not be
made by any careful ingenious workman.            Besides, if the
machine be strong, and the parts well executed, there are
means of avoiding the errors resulting from the want of co
incidence which might exist in the motion of the disks.
These means consist in counting the turns of the wheels
made from the moment when the piece is fired till that
when the machine stops, and causing these wheels to make
the same number of turns in a contrary direction, and in
such a manner that the wheels shall be brought to the
same respective positions in which they were when the
piece was fired.
    We shall suppress several details relating both to the in
clined range ana to different pieces of mechanism invented
hy colonel Grobert for supplying the attention and hand of
man in the experiments.       By means of these pieces of me
chanism the moving power, when it arrives at that point of
its course where its motion becomes uniform, rests on two
triggers, one of which causes a pendulum that swings se
conds to oscillate in order to count the time, while the
other establishes a communication between the motion of
the windlass and that of a system of toothed wheels and
pinions, furnished with an index to count the revolutions
of the wheels. The weight, when it arrives at the lower
extremity of its course, presses on other triggers which
serve to set fire to the cannon, and to stop th£ counter of
time and that of the number of turns. These different
means may be useful, but it is sometimes attended with
 inconvenience to add too many parts to a piece of mecha
 nism, and to make it so complex that it becomes liable to
be deranged.
    As the above explanation will be sufficient to give an idea,
 of the utility that may be derived, from the apparatus of co«-

               of Projectiles throiun from Cannon.               227
lonel Grobert, we shall now add a short account of the me
thods hitherto employed in researches of the same kind.
    It is only about sixty years ago that mathematicians be
gan to apply to the theory of projectiles.           Benjamin Robins
appears to us to have opened the way, or at least to have
             the first experiments worthy the attention of phi-
  osophers, and to have employed, for determining the initial
})ublished
velocity of musket bullets, a pendulum, against which he
threw his projectiles, and the sought-for velocity was de
duced from the amplitude of the oscillation : the same ma
thematician, when about to make particular experiments on
gunpowder, deduced his results from the recoil of a small
cannon attached to the lower part of the same pendulum *.
    The chevalier d'Arcy, of the Academy of Sciences, about .
eight or ten years after Robins's work appeared, published,
in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1751, a paper on the
theory of artillery, containing a series of experiments made
with great skill and care, and for which he employed, nearly
in the same circumstances, two pendulums ; against one of
these he fired the ball, while the other, from which the
small cannon was suspended, served to measure the recoil.
In this manner he made those important experiments re
lated in Essais d'uite Theorie de I Arlillerie, published by
the same author in 176O.
     Fifteen years after, Dr. Hutton, of the Royal Academy,
Woolwich, made new experiments with the pendulum and
projectiles, much heavier than those employed by Robins.
An account of them may be seen in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1778.
    About the same year count Rumford resumed and im
proved the method of making such experiments by means
of a pendulum. He discovered a very simple way of sus
pending the cannon, in such a manner that the recoil took
place without the axis ceasing to "be horizontal.         Dr. Hutton
bestows great praise on these experiment,              which are de
 tailed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1 78 1 , and which
 have since been printed with considerable additions in a col
 lection entitled Philosophical Papers, &c. London 1802.
     In the last place, Dr. Hutton was employed during the.
 years 1783, 1784, 1785, and 1 7b6, on a numerous series
 of experiments, made with great care and expense, in regard
 to both kinds of pendulum. The collection of his memoirs,

228        Means   of measuring   the   initial Velocity
Iated into French by colonel Villantroys, may be considered
as the most complete and most instructive treatise on ba-
hstic experiments that ever appeared.
    The apparatus proposed by colonel Grobert, as may be
 seen, is very different from those employed by the authors
 above mentioned ; and whatever merit may be due to expe
 riments made with pendulums, it must no doubt be allowed
 that it may be of some utility to make new ones by a very
ingenious method, in which simplicity and ceconomy are
united, and which leads to the proposed end in the most
 direct manner, as the velocities sought for are deduced
merely from the observation of the time employed by a
moving body to make a certain number of revolutions
around a fixed axis : an observation free from those dynamic
calculations which are required by the method of Robins.
    We have said nothing of the labours of Antoni in regard
to the object of this report, and yet we cannot omit men
 tioning a machine which he speaks of in his Essai sin- ta
Poudre, a French translation of which was published by
M. de Flavigni in 1773. This machine, which Antoni
 says was invented by a mechanician named Mathey, consists
Of a horizontal circle supported by its centre on the upper
extremity of a vertical axis, and serving as a base to a hollow
 cylinder of paper.     A rotary motion is given to this cy
linder by means of "a weight affixed to a cord which passes
over a pulley, and the projectile, thrown in a horizontal. di
rection, when the angular velocity has become constarit in
 the vertical plane of that axis, traverses the paper cylinder
in two points. The distance of the second point from the
diameter passing through the first, serves to measure the arc-
described by the system during the passage of the projectile
 in the interior of the hollow cylinder.
    It is incontestable, after this description, that the funda
mental idea of the process, by which a circular is compared
with a rectilinear motion, belongs to Mathey ; but without
entering into any detail on the inconveniences of this ma
chine, which no doubt have been the cause of its being
little used, we shall content ourselves with observing that
the apparatus of colonel Grobert differs from it essentially.
    1st, By the horizontal position of its axis of rotation.
The result of this difference     is, that the axis can never be
met   by  the projectile
                      ;   which makes     iteasy to ascertain the
solidity and regularity of the position and motion of the
disks.
    2d, The projectile does not traverse  acylindric surface, but
                                                              two

                   ef Projectiles thrown from Cannon.                         999
two vertical planes, the extent and distance of which may
be considerable, and which              therefore      may give very accu«
rate measures.
     3d, By the advantage it affords, not to be found in any
other kind of apparatus yet known, of measuring the velo-.
city of bullets of different sizes thrown in directions in
clined to the horizon.
     It icmains for us to give an account of some experiments
made to ascertain that the ball underwent no sensible devia
tion in traversing the disks.                It is manifest from the first,
principles of dynamics, that the moment when the ball is
in the plane of one disk in motion, it receives perpendicu
larly to its direction an impulse which, according to certain,
mathematical hypotheses, would give it parallel to the plane
of the disk a velocity almost equal to that of the point
where it meets (the mass of the ball being very small in,
regard to those of the different moving parts of the ma
chine) ; and, then the velocity of the ball, calculated accord-,
ing    to the formula before          given, would be infinite.              The
effective     phenomena differ considerably from those deduced
from similar hypotheses, considering the compressibility of;
the disks, their little hardness, and the prodigious rapidity
with which they are penetrated* (the duration of the pas
sage of the semi-diameter through the disk not being the
40,00Odth part of a second) ; but it is no less important to
 determine exactly the influence which they have on the re-,
suks.        One of the commissioners is employed in analysing
a dynamic problem, from which this determination may be
concluded a priori; but as such a conclusion would not rest
ou physical data sufficiently certain, he preferred verifying
by experiment whether the deviation was appreciable or not.
For this purpose he placed three fixed screens at equal dii
stances from each other ; the second and third being placed
respectively before the first and the second moveable disks.
    * It is
            here proper to give the reasoning on which these assertions are
founded.      Every body in n tture being more or lets compressible, the state
of final motion, resulting from the action of two bodies on each other, is not
acquired even at the moment of contact, but after a fixed term, which is
»ery short; and bodies during their contact page through all the interme-
diate states of motion between initial and final. From these incontestable
facts, if one of the bodies escapes the action of the other before the moment
when by the natural consequence of the shock they would have ce; »ed to
press each other mutually, the state of motion at which that body will really
 arrive in that case will differ so much less from its initial state, and so much
more from that in which it would have been had the shock been consum*
 mated, as the contact has been of less duration, and this duration may be so
 short that the initial state is not sensibly modified. This itthe case of the
experiment* mentioned in the text.
                                       P3                                       It

 830        Velocity of Projectiles thrown from Cannon.
 It   may be readily conceived that in the hypothesis of devia-.
 tioii   the hole made by the ball in the third fixed screen
  ought not to be in the same vertical plane with those made
  in the first and second screens ; and thus this deviation be
  comes easy to be ascertained and measured.
      Several balls were fired, the apparatus being arranged as
 here described.      Each time a plumb-line was placed before
  the centre of the hole made in the first screen ; and taking
¦ in a line this thread- and the centre of the hole made in -the
  second screen, it was very easy to see whether the centre of
  the third hole was in the vertical plane containing the other
  two centres.      These observations were made with care and
  precision, and yet it was not possible to perceive the devia
  tion estimable in the direction of the line passing through
  the centres of the three holes : thus the motion of the ball
  through the moveable disks is sensibly the same as if these
  disks were at rest.     We are of opinion, however, that it
  will be useful to employ always three screens, disposed as
  above, in the experiments made in future on this subject :
  by these means we may either ascertain whether there be
  any deviation, or discover whether it be sensible; and there
  can be no doubt that it will be so, either in the case when
  small velocities are communicated to the projectile, or, in
  general, in those where the ratio between that velocity and
  the resistance which the bullet experiences in traversing the
  disks shall exceed certain limits.
 t- It is proper to add, that the distance of the cannon from
  the furthest distant screen was about twelve metres, and
  that there was' no reason to apprehend the inflections ob
   served by Robins in distances of about a hundred metres,
   which according to him render rigorously the trajectory a
   curve of a double curvature.
      What we have said on the insensible effect which the
   action of the disk has upon the ball to make it deviate,
   proves that the re-action of the ball on the disk cannot di
   minish its velocity by a sensible quantity : this conclusion
   might be deduced, besides, from other facts, relative both to
   the mechanism of the apparatus and to the data furnished
   by the experiments, and particularly by the measure of time
   before and after the discharge of the piece : — but it is need
   less to enter into further details.
      To conclude : we are of opinion that the means to mea
   sure the initial velocity of projectiles thrown by fire-arms,
   in directions both horizontal and inclined, proposed by co
   lonel Grobert, and conformable to the summary description
   found in the above report, merit the approbation of the
                                                             class.

 an apparatus of larger dimensions, and executed with more
 care than that employed by the commissioners, might fur

        MY DEAR FRIEND,
 N,Iature      seems to have thrown an impenetrable veil over
 the development      of vegetable parts. In vain have botanists
 made    efforts to surprise her ; in vain do they watch her ;
 she eludes      their efforts, and laughs at their indefatigable
 patience.      If it has been impossible, however, to accom
 plish by observations this end, which was the object of so
 much care and labour, their researches have still conducted
 them to a multitude of other valuable discoveries, which
 have assisted us in the study of the structure and interior
 ceconomy of plants, and have shown to us the causes of
 several phenomena before considered as inexplicable.
    The opinions of those who have endeavoured to discover
 in what manner nature develops one vegetable organ from
 another may be ranged into two classes.
    Some have imagined that it is the pith, which makes its
 way through even the hardest wood to produce the ramifi
 cations of plants, and that it lengthens itself still to form
 the most essential parts of the vegetable body.
    Others, and those the most recent, rejecting this opinion,
 have ascribed to the bark and cortical strata what their pre
 decessors gave as the product of the pith.                   They have
 thought    also   that the increase     in  length    and thickness de
 pends  on   the   same  organs.
    Placed between these two opinions, and though each of
 them was supported by great names, yet being unwilling
jurare in verba magistrt, I resolved to examine lioth with
 out prejudice, and to give an opinion supported by my
 own observations.        I did so ; and discovered that Linmeus
 and Hales, who had maintained the former opinion, were
             * From the Journal <lc Physique, Florcal, an 13.
                                   P 4                               not

    g3g       On the Buds and Ramifications    of Plants.
    not far from the truth ; that their error was very excusable,
    for they might easily take for pith the reproducing organ,
    which will be mentioned in the course of this letter, and
    the herbaceous substance of which has a resemblance to
    that of this spongy organ.     It may be said further in their
    favour, that they had not before them the experiments of
    Desfontaines, Coulomb, Hedwig, Mirbel, and Medicus,
    and so many other philosophers who have thrown light on
    a great number of points hitherto inexplicable in regard to
   the interior ceconomy of vegetables.
      The observations which this study gave me an opportu
   nity of making, have conducted me to results so unex
   pected, that I did not think proper at first to trust to my
   own eyes.     Convinced without being persuaded, and dis
   trusting my own senses, especially in an experiment the
   results of which were in open contradiction to what we are
   taught by the greatest masters, I resolved to submit to you
   these observations, and to give them at the same time pub
  licity, in order to call the attention of the most enlightened
  botanists to the new phenomenon which I think I have
  perceived. I must, however, say, that it is the force of con
  viction, the desire of instruction, and not a vain spirit of
  controversy so unworthy of a real naturalist, which induce
  me to think differently from several celebrated men superior
  to envy, and to whom I readily pay the tribute of my gra
  titude for the benefit I have received from their works.
      Before I give my observations on the origin of buds,        I
  shall first rectify some ideas generally adopted in regard to
  these organs.
      " The name of bud is
                                 given in botany to small bodies
 more or less round or ovoid, and covered with scales hol
 lowed out like a spoon, or with a down more or less thick.
 These organs are formed gradually in the spring season in.
 the eyes of the leaves of most trees, shrubs, and plants of
 the dicotyledons, especially in climates where the winters-
 are pretty severe.     They contain and conceal the rudiments
 destined to be developed the following year into branches,
 leaves, and flowers.      They have received from nature the
 faculty   of resisting cold and humidity : several of them may
 be preserved, like a great many seeds, during one or more
 years, by remaining in a state of torpor until the develop
 ment of their parts is excited by favourable circumstances."
     These are the principles commonly received in regard to
buds in general; but it appears to me that they are suited
properly but to one species, that of most trees and shrubs
in countries where the winter is pretty severe.
                                                          I shall

            On the Buds and Ramifications   of Plants.       233
    I shall  now explain what, in my opinion, ought to be
comprehended under the denomination of the buds
                                                        of pha-
negoram plants. I give this name to all the organs of these
plants which contain tlie rudiments or germs of stems
 branches, leaves, flowers, and even roots: each of these
parts separately, or several of tliem united ; or, in a word
 the whole together.      This name belongs to them whatever
be their size ; their number ; that of the different parts of
which they are composed ; the time of their appearance •
their property of being preserved ; the species which
                                                            pro
duces them, and the place of their insertion :
                                                  modifications
and peculiarities which depend on the different structure of
the plants as well as the circumstances under which they
are placed.
    The definition    I have given seems to me to Unite several
advantages    :  it embraces not only the whole of the organs
together, even. in regard to their origin; it dispenses also
with the inconvenience of admitting a great number of ex
ceptions in the uniform progress of nature; exceptions
which no doubt prove that they have not been sufficiently
examined.       It is pretended that shrubs are distinguished
from bushes or trees by their ramifications not
                                                      being the
result of buds. This distinction is merely arbitrary, since
these plants really produce them ; but their buds are
                                                            very
small, exceedingly thin, destitute of dry scales, and some
times almost entirely concealed till the spring under the
bark of the branches.
    Admitting (he definition I have proposed, it will be ob
served that buds differ from each other by a great
                                                        number
of characters in the various species of plants. I shall here
mention only those traits which are indispensably necessary
to support my definition.
    In the ligneous monocotyledon plants the whole course of
life is confined to the development of the first bud,
                                                         arising
from the neck of the root or place where it is joined to the
stem. This bud contains the germs of all the organs which
appear above the earth, and the end of its development is
 the term also of the life of the same plant.     These plants
however, generally live one, and even several, centuries.
    The propagation of plants by scions, by bulbs, and by
other similar organs, which is very common to the herba
ceous monocotyledons, is not essentially differen f from
                                                            that
by buds, as has been completely proved by M. Mirbel and
several other botanists.      Scions and bulbs are real buds •
they are organs which contain the principles of new stems'
 benches, leaves, flowers, and roots. The part of the plant
                                                          which

    234         On the Buds and Ramifications   of Plants.
   which produced them,        and some modifications in their
   structure, make them, however, be considered as species
    different from every other.
        In the dicotyledon plants and the herbaceous monocotyle
   dons the summit of the root bears during the early age of
   the plant a single bud, named then plmnula.           This bud
   differs from that of the monocotyledon trees, as its deve
   lopment is ended before the death of the individual, and is
  followed by other buds, in consequence of the development
  of which the plant ramifies. The monocotyledon trees
  produce also secondary buds, but with this difference, that
  these buds are pushed out by the primitive bud itself, and
  that they fade much sooner than that from which they pro
  ceeded.
       In annual plants the development of all the buds of the
  individual is completed in the space of a year.       In the bi-
¦ennial plants it is terminated at the end of two years at most.
  Plants with a vivacious root biif annual stem push out every
  year another bud from the neck of the root : from the de
  veloped parts of this principal bud other buds then issue,
  which make the ramifications of the vegetable appear.
      The buds of the three sorts of plants here mentioned are
 not all, or very rarely are, covered with other organs to pro
 tect the germs against the intemperance of the weather.
 Here nature, in general, may dispense with them, hecause
 these buds develop themselves in the course of a very short
 time, and almost always in the best seasons; and the plants,
 or at least the stems, to which they are indebted for their
 birth, perish iu the winter, or even sooner.
      In most of these plants, as well as in bushes and some
 shrubs, the buds are small, thin, and pointed, as in the vi
 burnum, the rhamnus (buckthorn), the heliotrope, the cor
 nel tree, the gramineous plants, the artemisia, &c.
     The ligneous dicotyledon plants in general push forth
 their buds only in spring.      Their buds in winter remain in
 a state of inaction, and do not open* till the return of
spring.       From this rule, however, are excluded all trees and
bushes called evergreens, a great number of which perpe
tually send forth buds, so that the development of the
leaves, branches, and even sometimes the flowers, never
ceases during the life of these plants.
     In almost all the dicotyledon trees and shrubs of the cold
and temperate climates, the buds are formed in the eyes of
the leaves, and always before the approach of winter.        Bo
tanists consider the most exterior folioles of these buds as
aborted foliolesy because they are dry and even sometimes
                                                        sonorous

           On the Buds and Ramifications    of Plants.      235
sonorous under the fingers. They are called scales, on ac
count of their usual form.      These organs are almost always
covered with a resinous matter, which cements them verv
closely to each other, and which contributes not a little to
defend the tender germs contained in the buds from the cold
and moisture of the severe seasons.                          ,
     In a great number of Irushes and shrubs these scales are
entirely wanting; but their place is supplied in several
species by a down, which sometimes is pretty thick, and
which affords sufficient protection to the buds against the
rigour of the winter, as in the viburnum and the ptelea. In
other buds of similar plants the parts still herbaceous and
tender have neither down, nor scales, nor resinous matter,
nor any other kind of covering, and they nevertheless with
 stand the intemperance of the seasons, unless it be exces
sive. Among the latter there are some the folioles of which
 cover each other firmly, as in the common lilac, the hazle,
$tc. ; and there are some also in which the exterior folioles
 are neither so thick nor so fiimly applied to each other as
 to be able to oppose the entrance of humidity, as is the case
 }n the cornel tree.
      The buds of several ligneous dicotyledon plants remain,
 in regard to their base and a great part of their body, con
 cealed during winter under the bark, and their summit does
 not entirely open a passage for itself till the following
 spring.     Here the bark serves as bandages to the tender
 elements of the new ramifications, as' we see in a great
 number of shrubs.
      Nature incloses the buds in several shrubs, as in the ber-
 leris vulgaris, with petioles very close to each other j it co
 vers them also on one side by the branch from which they
 have proceeded, and on the pther by the flat base of the
 prickles.
      In the last place, there are some ligneous dicotyledon ve
 getables the buds of which are concealed and sheltered from
  the pernicious influence of the weather in a manner as sin
 gular as wonderful. The buds, unprovided with scales, but
  covered with a fine and thick down, form themselves under
 the concave base of the supporters of the leaves.       During
  winter these supporters remain in their place in several
  plants; but when the sap ascends, the eye, becoming larger,
  rejects the tutor, of which it has no longer need.      Some
  times shocks, and other accidents, make them fall earlier:
  in this case, the bud, being still secured by its natural pe
  lisse, escapes generally the severe cold of winter.
      I have observed that the supporter in question differs ac

  it    is not hollowed out in grooves at its upper surface, but
    entirely round because its substance

    herbaceous,      though     itfalls annually; and because        forms
                                                                         it

    tached. Similar supporters are found in the rhus coriaria,
    the acer negundo, the robinia, &c.
        About three years ago         I   made this observation on the
    shumac    ;  and   I   have reason to believe that no one ever
    made      before me, since in vain consulted on this subject
             it                      1
    all my books on botany.           I  proposed to make         series of
                                                                   a
    researches on this subject       ;  and, indeed, they convinced me
    that nature covers in this manner the buds of several lig
    neous dicotyledons considered hitherto as not heariit<; any.
    It was my intention net to publish my observations until                        I
    had sufficiently repeated them, which could not be done
    till had examined

  briefly as possible.

influence of the rays of the sun and of the air, and that they
then no longer afford a free passage to the ascending sap. It
is supposed that the fluids stop, and are accumulated at the
base of these leaves, and that they thereby give birth to
cambium, which occasions the ring or swelling there ob
served.     It is pretended also that this cambium produces
new vessels, which, obeying the impulse they daily receive
from the ascending sap, become lengthened towards the
surface of the bark, and force themselves to pierce it ; after
which they give birth to the bud.
    This explanation, though ingenious, appears to me to
be only a bold hypothesis, supported by facts which have
not been examined with sufficient care.              Instead of begin
 ning by   an  explanation,    it would   have  been  better to discover
first all the facts and all the circumstances by which this
 phsenomenon is accompanied.              And still we shall succeed
 as little in penetrating into this operation as we have done
 ¦in regard to all the rest, the secret of which nature seems
 to have reserved to herself: the formation of the individuals
 and of their organs will be always inexplicable to us.              Na
 ture, however, far from precluding ns from researches, ex
 cites us rather to watch her; and it is then that, by attend
 ing with assiduity and without prejudice, we often discover
 facts which form one step towards the truth.                 It may be
 objected    to  this  explanation,      that  there  are, indeed,   buds
 which do not pierce the bark m the eyes of the leaves, anfl
 that the eye shows itself already at the time when the leaves
 have lost none of their vigour.
     I shall now return to my own observations. In exa
 mining; with attention the ligneous dicotyledon plants                rft
 the different seasons,    it   will be observed that     a  body alhiost
 always soft, herbaceous, and green, when- issues from the
                                                     it
 wood, enters into the bud destined to develop flowers or              a
 branch, and that this body forms in reality the centre or
 axis of the bud.      The same observation will be made when
 the wood of the branch which throws out the bud               is already
 formed of several annual zones.            It   will be perceived also
 that this herbaceous body       is rarely alone that
                                                 ;        it has, for the
 most part, on each side, and at very small distance -from

  Stance as itself: these lateral herbaceous bodies are smaller
 than it,' and never penetrate into the substance of a- bud
  which produces branches or flowers they enter into those
                                            :
  only of the leaves   ;    that is  to say, into those    a   petiole or
  leaf of which  is   destined to develop itself, which we observe
  at the base of a twig     in    several shrubs and bushes.       There
                                                                       is

     is sometimes also at the base, and very near the largest
     herbaceous body, a similar body, which penetrates with it
     into the same bud. All these herbaceous bodies are produced
     each separately in a medullary sheath,                  and never in the
     bark, the liber, or the alburnum, nor in the annual zones
     of the wood. They are indeed tlie prolongations of' the
     bundle's of tubes of the medullary sheath*.
        The herbaceous bodies of which I here speak, in passing
     into the wood are not always in a horizontal direction : I
     mean, that they do hot form in all the plants which I have
     examined a right angle with the medullary sheath : in se
     veral trees and shrubs they leave it much lower than tha"
     pla*ce where the bud issues from the bark, as is the case
     in the shumac, plane-tree, willows, &c.
        When the bark, with the bud, has been removed, these
    herbaceous prolongations present themselves under different
    forms, according to the species to which they belong, the
    age of the branch, the place even where they are, and the
    angle at which they have traversed the wood.                      This is the
    reason why the figure of their section in the exterior zone
    of the wood varies from the form of a line or stroke to that
    of a point entirely round ; sometimes there are several of
    them united, so that altogether they form scarcely a single
    line or oblong point.           At the place where these herbaceous
    bodies traverse the wood, the ligneous fibres are separated
.., from each other; and though they press them more or less,
    they still leave them a sufficient passage.                 This separation
    of the tubes and fibres of the wood is more apparent in the
    zones near to the medullary case, than in those which are
    more distant, and consequently nearer to the bark.
        The thickness of these bodies differs also in the different
    species of plants.          In those the wood of which is hard and
    compact they        are   smaller, and at the same time less cylin-
    dric than in those the wood of which is light. Those de-»
    stined to push forth buds for twigs and flowers have more
    volume than those which produce leaf-buds.
        They do not always remain green : they lose that colour
    as they change into wood.             But they are found herbaceous,
    and filled with green substance, at least, until the bud has
    expanded into a flower-bud ; and I have observed that they
    are still green and herbaceous,           even in the twigs and young
    branches, if the wood of the species from which they have
    proceeded be white and light.

           On the Buds and Ramifications     of Plants.        239
    The same prolongations are found in herbaceous plants
 with a ramified stem : for example, in the adult stems of
 the common cabbage, &c, where one may be convinced
 that the branches have no other origin there than that of
 the medullary sheath, and that they issue from real buds.
    It seems to result, from what I have here said, that the
 reproducing organ of buds in the dicotyledon plants, is
 effectively and exclusively the case or sheath which contains
 the pith: it is even in the herbaceous          monocotyledon
 plants, the spaces between the knots of which form empty
 tubes : nature, to produce branches, has formed in these
 prants solid knots or articulations, the structure of which
 is almost the same as that of the stems of plants the canal
 of which contains pith.
    The opinion that the medullary case is the only organ
 which gives rise to buds, and consequently to brandies, is
 confirmed by the observations which I made on the inser
 tion of old branches even in trunks entirely dry.        For this
 purpose I carefully examined the branches of the pine fir
 and primus spinosa (sloe-tree), shumac, oak, apple-tree,
 &c, and every where I observed the same result. It
 is true, that in the old branches the prolongations are more
 herbaceous, and on that account are difficult to be distin
 guished, because the one which has penetrated into the
 principal substance of the bud, from which the branch has
 proceeded, has become ligneous : the small lateral ones are
 not even dried, and are still entirely covered and concealed
 both by the base of the branch, and by the annual strata of
 the wood, which had been formed after these prolongations
 had thrown out petioles or leaves.     The perpendicular sec
 tion of a branched trunk always shows, whatever be the
 number of the concentric strata of the ligneous body, that
 the medullary sheath of the branch proceeds from the
 medullary sheath of the trunk ; that the branch never forms
 in the trunk an inverted cone, the summit of which is con
 cealed by the strata of that part ; and that the branch of a
 tree can never be compared, as has been done, to a plant
 the roots of which are in a ligneous soil.    The different an
 nual strata of a branch never cover each other, in any case,
 at their respective bases ; and they are never separated from
 those of the trunk.     These strata are in immediate com
 munication with those of the trunk, in such a manner that
 the strata of the branch seem to have arisen from a pro-
Jongation of those, of the trunk.      It is very difficult to di
 stinguish' whether the medullary sheath takes its origin
                                                             from

 S40        On the Buds and Ramifications         of Plants.
from that of the trunk, when the medullary canal of that
part is filled with ligneous strata, which is the case in se
veral bushes and shrubs where an interior liber is formed
annually of the pith, until the canal which contains it has
altogether disappeared, as in the ash, the oak, shumac,
&c. ; but it is principally in the latter that we may be con
vinced that it is never by the medullary sheath, nor by the
interior cambium, that these internal zones are produced.
   The increase in length of buds and twigs is ascribed to
an erection of the tubes of the liber.             If the bark of a
young   branch    be  separated  as  far  as  the  terminal   bud in a
young   poplar,   for  example,   and   particularly    before winter,
or in the following spring, it will be found that the inner
bark has never become lengthened.              The upper part of a
branch and a flower-bud is formed only by the pith, the
medullary sheath, and the bark.            I think I may conclude
from this observation, that the increase of the stems or
trunks,     and the ramifications,       depends merely on the
elongation of the vessels of the medullary sheath. The
alburnum, the tubes of which have a direction perfectly
straight, presents itself at the upper part of a branch under
the form of separate fibres, which lose themselves at the
surface of the medullary sheath. This observation explains
to us also why the zones of the upper part of a branch are
in number inferior to those of the base. It confirms also
what I have said in regard to the birth of buds ; for, if we
examine the bud of a small branch in any tree whatever,
we shall be convinced that it is the medullary sheath with
out exception that composes alone the interior of that
organ.

  XXXVI.         Method of olviating the Necessity of lifting
     Ships. By Mr. Robert Seppings, of Chatliam Yard*.
  J. he .following is a description of an invention by Mr.
 Robert Seppings, late master shipwright assistant in his
 majesty's ,.yard at Plymouth             (now master shipwright at
  his majesty's yard, Chatham), for suspending, instead of
 lifting, ships, for the purpose of clearing them from their
 blocks, by which a very great saving will accrue to the pub
 lic, and also two-thirds of the time formerly used in this
 operation.
     From the saving of time another very important advan
 tage is derived, namely, that of enabling large ships to be
 docked, suspended, and undocked, the same spring tides.
 Without enumerating the inconveniencies arising, and,
 perhaps, injuries, which ships are liable to sustain, from the
 former practice of lifting them, and which are removed by
 the present plan j that which relates to manual labour de
 serves particular attention ; twenty men being sufficient to
 suspend a first-rate, whereas it would require, upwards of
 500 to lift her. The situation which Mr. Seppings held in
 Plymouth-yard, attached to him, in a great degree, the
 shoring ana lifting of ships, as well asthe other practical
 part of the profession of a shipwright.                 Here he had an
 opportunity        of observing,   and    indeed    it was   a subject of
 general regret,      how  much   time,     expense,    and  labour, were
 required     in lilting ship, particularly ships
                         a                               of the  line. This
 induced him to consider whether some contrivance could
 not be adopted to obviate these evils.              And it occurred to
 him, that if he could so construct the blocks on which the
 ship rests, that the weight of the ship might be applied to
 assist in the operation, he should accomplish this very de
 sirable end. In September 1 800, the shoring and lifting
 the San Josef, a large Spanish first-rate, then in dock at
 Plymouth, was committed to his directions ; to perform
 which, the assistance of the principal part of the artificers
 of the yard was requisite. Ih conducting this business, the
 plan, which will be hereafter described, occurred to his
mind; and from that time, he, by various experiments,
 proved his theory to be correct : the blocks, constructed by
him, upon which the ship rests, being so contrived, that
the facility in removing them, is proportionate to the quan
tity of pressure; and this circumstance is always absolutely

           the Tramaclions of the Society  of Ar.ts,  who voted him the yold

under command, by increasing or diminishing the angle of
three wedges, which constitute one of the blocks ; two of
which are horizontal, and one vertical.      By enlarging the
angle of the horizontal wedges, the vertical wedge becomes
of consequence more acute ; and its power may be so in
creased, that it shall have a great tendency to displace the
horizontal wedges, as was proved by a model, which ac
companied the statement to the society; where the power
of the screw is used as a substitute for the pressure of the
ship.
   Mr. Seppings caused three blocks to be made of hard
wood agreeable to his invention, and the wedges of various
angles. The horizontal wedges of the first block were
nine degrees ; of the second, seven ; and of the third, five ;
of course, the angle of the vertical wedge of the first block
was 162 degrees; of the second, 166; and of the third, 170.
These blocks, or wedges, were well executed, and rubbed
over with soft soap for the purpose of experiment.        They
were then placed in a dock, in his majesty's yard, at Ply
mouth, in which a sloop of war was to be docked : on exa
mining them after the vessel was in, and the water gone,
they were all found to have kept their situations, as placed
before the ship rested upon them.       Shores in their wake
were then erected to sustain the ship, prior to the said
blocks being taken from under the keel. The process of
clearing them was, by applying the power of battering-
rams to the sides of the outer ends of the horizontal wedges;
alternate blows being given fore and aft ; by which means
they immediately receded, and the vertical wedges were
disengaged.     It was observed, even in this small ship, that
the block which was formed of horizontal wedges of nine
degrees, came away much easier than those of seven, and
the one of seven than that of five.   In removing the afore
said blocks by the power of the battering-rams, which were
suspended in the hands of the men employed, by their
holding ropes passed through holes for that purpose, it was
remarked by Mr. Seppings, that the operation was very la
borious to the people ; they having to support the weight
of the battering-rams, as well as to set them in motion.
He then conceived an idea of affixing wheels near the ex
tremity of that part of the rams which strikes the wedges.
This was done before the blocks were again placed ; ana it
has since been found fully to answer the purpose intended,
particularly in returning the horizontal wedges to their
original situations, when the work is performed for which
they were displaced; the wheels also giving a great increase of

        to the rams, and decrease of labour to the artificers j
  esides which, the blows are given with much more exact
Eower
ness. The same blocks were again laid in another dock, in
which a two-decked ship of the line was docked.       On exa
mination they were found to be very severely pressed, but
were removed with great ease. They were again placed in
another dock in which a three-decked ship of the line was
docked.     This ship having in her foremast and bowsprit,
the blocks were put quite forward, that being the part which
presses them with the greatest force. As soon as the water
was out of the dock, it was observed that the horizontal
wedges of nine and seven degrees had receded some feet
from their original situations.    This afforded Mr. Seppings'
a satisfactory proof,    which   experience has since demon
strated (though many persons before would not admit of,
and others could not understand, the principle), that the
facility of removing the blocks or wedges, was proportionate
to the quantity of pressure upon them. The block of five
degrees kept its place, but was immediately cleared, by .ap
plying the power of the battering-rams to the sides of the
outer ends of the horizontal wedges. The above experi
ments being communicated to the Navy Board, Mr. Sep
pings was directed to attend them, and explain the prin
ciple of his invention ; which explanation, further corro
borated by the testimonials of his then superior officers,
was so satisfactory, that a dock was ordered to be fitted at
Plymouth under his immediate directions.        The horizontal
wedges in this, and in the other docks, that were afterwards
fitted by him, are of cast iron, with an angle of about five
degrees and a half, which, from repeated trials, are found
equal to any pressure, having in no instance receded, and,
when required, were easily removed. The vertical wedge
is of wood, lined with a plate of wrought iron, half an inch
thick. On the bottom of the dock, in the wake of each
block, is a plate of iron of three quarters of an inch thick,
so that iron at all times acts in contact with iron.

the wedges, and battering-rams, &c. ; also the process of
taking away, and again replacing, the wedges of which the
block is composed, are also exemplified by a model.
    The dock being prepared at Plymouth, in August 1801
{he Canopus, a large French 80-gun ship, was taken in,
and rested upon (he blocks ; and the complete success of
the experiment was such, that other docks were ordered to
be fitted at Sheerness arid Portsmouth dock-yards, under
Mr. Seppings's directions. At the former place a frigate,
                                                           and

                  'the Necessity      of lifting Ships.           845
and at the latter a three-decked            ship, were suspended    in
like manner.        This     happened      in December     1802,  and
January 1 803     ; and the reports were so favourable, as to
cause directions to be given for the general adoption of these
blocks in his majesty's yards.                 This invention being
thought of national consequence, with respect to ships, but
particularly those of the navy, government has been pleased
to notice and reward Mr. Seppmgs for it.
    The time required to disengage each block is from one to
three minutes after the shores are placed : and a first-rate
 sits on about fifty blocks.             Various are the causes for
 which a ship may be required to be cleared from her blocks,
 viz. to shift the main keel ; to add additional fasle keel j to
 repair defects ; to caulk the garboard seams, scarples of th
 keel, &c. Imperfections in the false keel, which are so
 very injurious to the cables, can, in the largest ship, hi
 remedied in a few hours by this invention, without adding
 an additional shore, by taking away blocks forward, amid
 ships, and abaft, at the same time ; and, when the keel is
 repaired in the wake of those blocks, by returning them
 into their places, and then by taking out the next, and so
  on in succession. The blocks can be replaced in their ori
  ginal situations, by the application of the wheel battering-
  rams to the wedges, the power of which is so very great,
  that the weight of the ship can be taken from the snores
  that were placed to sustain her. There were one hundred
  and six ships of different classes, lifted at Plymouth dock
  yard, from the 1st of January 1798 to the 31st of Decem
  ber 1 800 j and, had the operation of lifting taken less time,
  the number would have been very considerably increased j
  for  the saving of a day is very frequently the cause of saving
  a spring" tide, which makes the difference of a fortnight.
  The importance of this expedition, in time of war, cannot
  be sufficiently estimated.
      This invention may be applied with great advantage,
   whenever it is necessary to erect shores, to support any
  great weights, as, for instance, to prop up a building during
   the repair of its foundation, &c.             Captain Wells, of his
   majesty's ship Glory, of 98 guns,           used wedges of Mr. Sep-
   pings's invention      for  a  fid  of  a  top-gallant mast of that
   ship.    In  1803,    the  top-gallant    masts  of the Defence, of
   74 guns,    were   fitted   on   this  principle by Mr. Seppings :
   and, from repeated trials, since she has been cruizing in the
   North Sea, the wedge fids have been found in every respect
   to answer.
      JJut it is Mr. Seppings's wish that k should be under-

a top-gallant mast originated with captain Wells,        who
well understood the principle, and had received from him a
model of the invention.
   When it is required to strike a top-gallant mast, the top
ropes are hove tight, and the pin which keeps the horizontal
wedges in their place is taken out, by one man going aloft
for that purpose; the other horizontal wedge is worked in
the fid, as shown in the drawing and model that accompany
this statement.    The upper part of the fid hole is cut to
form the vertical wedge.     The advantage derived from fid-
ding top-gallant   masts  in  this way               is,
                                           that they can be
struck at the shortest notice, and without slacking the rig
ging, which   isfrequently the cause of springing and carry
ing   them   away, particularly those with long pole heads.
The angle of the horizontal wedges for the fids of masts
should be about twenty degrees.          .

following process. A sufficient number of shores are placed
under the ship to sustain her weight, and set taught, sta
tioned as near the keel as the working of the battering-
rams fore and aft will admit.     Avoid placing any opposite
the blocks, as they would      that case hinder the return of
                                 in
the wedges with the battering-rams.       A blow must then
be given forward on the outer end of the iron wedges with
the "battering-rams in    afore and aft direction, which will
cause them to slide aft, as shown in the plan.     The batter
ing-rams abaft then return the blow, and the wedges again
come forward   ;     bythe repetition of this operation, the
wedges will be with great ease cleared, and the angular

the angular blocks, it is proposed to leave a few of them
out forward and aft, and stop the ship up, by laying one
iron wedge on the other, as shown at Fie. 1 , Plate IV.
   To facilitate the business, blocks may oe cleared forward
and aft at the same time, sufficient to get in place one
length of false keel . If the false keel should want repairing,
it may be done without any additional shores, by clearing one
block at a time ; and when the keel is repaired in the wake
of that block, return the wedges, as above directed, and
clear the next, &c.

XXXVII.          On the Variations      of the Terrestrial Magnetism
    in different Latitudes.          By Messieurs Humboldt and
    Eiot.       Read   ly M. Biot,          in the Mathematical and
    Physical Class of        the    French National Institute 26lh
    Frtmaire, An 13*.         (1  7 th December 1804.)
An       inquiry into the laws of terrestrial magnetism is no
doubt one of the most important questions that philoso
phers can propose. The observations already made on this
subject have discovered phaenomena so curious, that one
cannot help endeavouring to solve the difficulties they pre
sent ; but notwithstanding the efforts hitherto employed, it
must be confessed that we are absolutely unacquainted with
the causes of them.
     It was difficult to obtain on this point any precise know
ledge at a time when the construction of the compass
was still imperfect ; and so little time has elapsed since
the discoveries of M. Coulomb have taught u* to render
them completely exact, it needs excite no astonishment that
so few facts in the observations of travellers have been
found worthy of confidence.
    The expedition which M. Humboldt has terminated has
procured for this part of philosophy a collection no less
valuable than those with which he has enriched the other
branches of human knowledge.                 Furnished with an excelr-
Jent dipping-needle,        constructed     by Le.Noir on the princi-?
pies    of   Berda,  M.    Humboldt        has  made more than three
hundred observations on the inclination of the magnet, and
on the intensity oi' the magnetic force in that part of Ame
rica which lie traversed.            By adding to these results those;
which he had already obtained in Europe hefore his de
parture, we shall have for the first time a series of correct
tacts on the variation of the magnetic forces in the northern
part of the globe, and in some points of its southern
 part.
     The friendship which M. Humboldt has testified for me
 since his return having given me an opportunity of commu
nicating to him some experiments on this subject, which
 I made this year in the Alps, he immediately offered to,
unite his to mine in a memoir.                 But if friendship and a
 desire of making known new facts induced me to accept
 this offer of M. Humboldt, justice forbids me to take ad
vantage of it to his prejudice ; and I must here declare, that
 a very small part of it belongs to me.

       On the Variations   of the Terrestrial Magnetism.    949
   To place in order   the facts and consequences which may
be deduced   from them, it is necessary to consider the ac
tion of terrestrial magnetism under different points of view,
corresponding to the different classes of the phenomena
which it produces.
    If we consider it first in general, we find that it acts on
the whole surface of the globe, and that it extends beyond
it. This last fact, which was doubted, has been lately
proved by one of us, and particularly by our friend M. Gay-
Lussac, during his two aerostatic voyages.        And if these
observations, made with all the care possible, have not
shown the least sensible diminution in the intensity of the
magnetic force, at the greatest height to which man caa
attain, we have a right to conclude that this force extends
to an indefinite distance from the earth, where it decreases,
perhaps, in a very rapid manner, but which at present is
unknown to us.
    If we now consider magnetism at the surface even of the
earth, we shall find three grand classes of phaenomena,
which it is necessary to study separately, in order to have a
complete knowledge of its mode of action. These pheno
mena are ; the declination of the magnetic needle, its incli
nation, and the intensity of the magnetic force, considered-
either comparatively in different places or in themselves,
paying attention to the. variations which they experience.
It is thus that, after having discovered the action of gravity
as a central force, its variation, resulting from the figure of
the earth, was afterwards ascertained in different lati
tudes.
   The declination of the magnetic needle appears to be
that phenomenon which hitherto has more particularly
fixed the attention of philosophers, on account, no doubt,
of the assistance which they hoped to derive from it in de
termining the longitude ; but when it was known tha!t the
declination changes in the same place, in the course of
time, when its diurnal variations were remarked, and its
irfegular traversing, occasioned by different meteors ; in a
word, the difficulty of observing it at sea, within one de
gree nearly, it was necessary to abandon that hope, and to
consider the cause of these phaenomena as much more com
plex and abstruse than had been at first imagined.
   In regard to the intensity of the magnetic force in diffe
rent parts of the earth, it has never yet been measured in a
comparative manner.       The observations of M. Humboldt
pn this subject have discovered a very remarkable pheno
menon j it is the variation of the intensity in different lati
                                                         tudes,

  250         Variations     of the Terrestrial Magnetism
 tudes, and its increase proceeding from the equator to the
 poles.
     The compass, indeed, which at the departure of M.
 Humboldt gave at Paris 945 oscillations in 10 minutes,
 gave no more in Peru than 811, and it constantly varied in
 the same direction ; that is to say, the number of the oscil
 lations always decreased in approaching the equator, and
 always increased in advancing towards the north.
    These differences cannot be ascribed to a diminution of
 force in the magnetism of the compass, nor can we sup
 pose that it is weakened by the effect of time and of heat;
 for, after three years' residence in the warmest countries of
 the earth, the same compass gave again in Mexico oscilla
 tions as rapid as at Paris.
    There is no reason, either, to doubt the justness of M.
Humboldt's observations, for he often observed the oscilla
 tions in the vertical plane perpendicular to that meridian j
but by decomposing the magnetic force in the latter plane,
and comparing it with its total action, which is exercised in
the former, we may from these data calculate its direction,
and consequently the. direction of the needle*.                     This in
clination, thus calculated, is found always conformable to
that which M. Humboldt observed directly.                         When he
made his experiments, however, he could n6t foresee that
they would be subjected to this proof by which M. La
Place verified them.
    As the justness of these observations cannot be contested,
we must allow also the truth of the result which they indi-
   * Let HOC (plate V. fig.
                               1.) be the plane of the magnetic meridian pass
ing through the vertical O C; let O L be the direction of the needle situated in
that plane, and OH a horizontal.      The angle LOH will be the inclination
of the needle, which we shall denote by I. If F represent the total mag
netic force which acts in the direction OL, the part of this force, which act*
according to O C, will be F sine of I : but the magnetic forces which deter
mine the oscillations of the needle in any plane, are to each other as the
squares of the oscillations made in the same time.    If we denote then by M,
the number of the oscillations made in H)' of time in the magnetic meridian,
and by P, the number of oscillatisns made also in 10', in the perpendicular
plane, wc shall have the following proportion.
                                F sin. I      P*
                                             M«
from which we deduce
                                 Sin. I  -    P"
   The inclination then may be calculated by this formula, when we have
oscillations made in the two planes.
   In like manner, by making a needle oscillate successively in several vertical
planes, we might determine the direction of the magnetic meridian.
                                                           5              cate,

                        in different Latitudes.                 251
cate, and which is the increase of the magnetic force pro
ceeding from the equator to the poles.
   To follow these results with more facility it will be proper
to set out from a fixed term, and it appears natural to make
choice for that purpose of the points where the inclination
of the magnetic needle is null, because they seem to indi
cate the places where the opposite action of the two terres
trial hemispheres is equal. The series of these points forms
on the surface of the eacth a curved line which differs very
sensibly from the terrestrial equator, from which it deviates
to the south in the Atlantic Ocean and to the north in the
South Sea.     This curve has been called the magnetic equa
tor, from its analogy to the terrestrial equator, though it is
not yet known whether it forms exactly a great circle of the
earth. We shall examine this question hereafter; at pre
sent it will be sufficient to say, that M. Humboldt found
this equator in Peru about 7*7963° (7°       of south latitude,
                                              l')
which places        for that part of the earth, nearly in the
                  it,
spot where Wilke and Lemonnier had fixed it.
   The places situated to the north of that point may be            di
vided into four zones; the three first of which, being nearer
the equator, are about 4* 5° (4°) of breadth in latitude;
while the latter, more extensive and more variable,         XtPis
(14°).    So that the system of these zones extends in Ame
rica from the magnetic equator to 25*5556° (23°) of north
latitude, and comprehends in longitude an interval of about
56° (50°).
   The first zoneextendsfrom7'7963° (7° l") of south latitude
to 3-22° (2° 54'). The mean number of the oscillations of
the needle   inthe magnetic meridian in 10' of time     there,
                                                          is
211*9:    no observation  gives less than  211, or  more than
214.    From M. Humboldt's observations one might form
a similar zone on the south side of the magnetic equator,
which would give the same results.
   The second zone extends from 2-4630° (2° 137) of south
latitude to 3*61° (3° 15') of north latitude. The mean term
of the oscillations      there, 217*9: they are never below
                         is
220, or above 226.
   The fourth zone, broader than the other two, extends
from 10*2778° (9° 15') to 25*7037" («3°         of north lati
                                                    8')

                                         it
servation below 229, or above 240.
   We are unacquainted, in regard to this part of the earth,
with the intensity of the magnetic force beyond the latitude
of 26° (23°) north; and on the other hand, in Europe,
where we have observations made in high latitudes, we
                                                                have

 552        Variations    of the Terrestrial Magnetism
 have none in the neighbourhood of the equator : but we
will not venture      to compare these two classes of observa
 tions, which may belong to different systems of forces, as
 will be mentioned hereafter.
    However, the only comparison of results, collected in
America by M. Humboldt, appears to us to establish with
certainty the increase of the magnetic force from the equa
tor to the poles ; and, without wishing to connect them
too closely with the experiments made in Europe, we must
remark, that the latter accord so far also with the preceding
as to indicate the phenomenon.
    If we have thus divided the observations into zones pa
rallel to the equator, it is in order that we may more easily
show the truth of the fact which results from them, and
in particular to render the demonstration independent of
those small anomalies which are inevitably mixed with
these results.
    Though these anomalies are very trifling, they are, how
ever, so' sensible, and so frequently occur, that they cannot
be ascribed entirely to errors in the observations.              It ap
pears  more   natural   to   ascribe tbem  to the influence   of   local
circumstances, and the particular attractions exercised by
collections of ferrugineous matters, chains of mountains,
or by the large masses of the continents.
    One of us, indeed, having this summer carried to the
Alps the magnetic needle employed in one of his late aerial
excursions, he found that its tendency to return to the
magnetic meridian was constantly stronger in these moun
tains than it was at Paris before his departure, and than it
has been found since his return.          This needle, which made
at Paris 839° in 10 minutes of time, has varied in the fol
 lowing manner in the different places to which it was car
 ried;

    These experiments were made with the greatest care, con->
jointly with excellent observers, and always employing the
 Same watch verified by small pendulums, and taking the

mean terms between several serieses of observations, which
always differed very little from each other.          It appears
thence to result that the action of the Alps has a sensible
influence on the intensity of the magnetic force. M. Hum
boldt observed analogous effects at the bottom of the Py
renees ; for example, at Perpignan.        It is not improbable
that they arose from the mass of these mountains, or the
ferrugineous matters contained in them ; but whatever mav
be the cause, it is seen by these examples that the general
action of terrestrial magnetism is sensibly modified by local
circumstances, the differences of which may be perceived
in places very little distant from each other. This truth
will be further confirmed by the rest of this memoir.            *
      It is to causes of this kind, no doubt, that we must
ascribe the diminution of the magnetic forces observed in
some mountains ; a diminution which, on the first view,
 might appear contrary to the results obtained during the last
aerial voyages.      This conjecture is supported by several ob
 servations of M. Humboldt. By making his needle to oscil
 late on the mountain of Guadaloupe, which rises 676 metre*
  (338 toises) above Santa-Fe, he found it in 10 minutes of
 time give two oscillations less than in the plain. AtSilla, near
  Caracas, at the height of 2632 metres (1316 toises) above
  the coast, the diminution went so far as five oscillations ;
 and, on the other hand, on the volcano of Antisana, at the
  height of 4934 metres (2467 toises), the number of oscilla
  tions in 10 minutes was 230; though at Quito it was only
  £18: which indicates an increase of intensity.      I observed,
  indeed, a similar effect on the summit of Mount Genevre,
  at the height of 1600 or 1800 metres (8 or 900 toises), as
  may be seen by the numbers which I have already given;
  and it was on this mountain that I found the greatest in
  tensity of the magnetic force.     I saw on the hill of La Su-
  perga,    in the neighbourhood  of Turin, an example of these
  variations equally striking.     Observing, with Vassali, on
  this hill, at the elevation of about 600 metres (300 toises),
  we found 87 oscillations in 10 minutes of time. On the
   side of the hill we had 88-8 oscillations;     and at the bot
   tom, on the bank of the Po, we obtained 87*3.         Though
  these results approach very near to each other, their differ
   enceis,   however, sensible, and fully shows that their small
   variations must be considered as slight anomalies produced
   by local circumstances.
       This examination leads us to consider the intensity of
   magnetism on the different points of the surface of the
   globe, as subject to two sorts of differences. One kind are
                                                         general   :

 S54        Variations  of the Terrestrial Magnetism
general : they depend merely on the situation of the places
in regard to the magnetic equator, and belong to a general
phenomenon, which is the increase of the intensity of the
magnetic forces in proportion as we remove from the equa
tor : the other kind of variations, which are much smaller
and altogether irregular, seem to depend entirely on local cir
cumstances, and modify either more or less the general results.
    If wc consider terrestrial magnetism as the effect of an
attractive force inherent in all the material particles of the
globe, or only in some of these particles, which we are far
From determining, the general law will be, the total result
of the system of attraction of all the particles, and the small
anomalies will be produced by the particular attractions of
the partial systems of the magnetic molecular, diffused irre
gularly around each point ; attractions rendered more sen
sible by the diminution of distance.
   It now remains to consider the inclination of the mag
netic needle in regard to the horizontal plane. It has long
been known that this inclination is not every where the
same: in the northern hemisphere the needle inclines to
wards the north; in the southern towards the south; the places
where it becomes horizontal form the magnetic equator; and
those where the inclination is equal, but not null, form on
each side of that equator curved lines, to which the name of
magnetic parallels has been given from their analogy to
the terrestrial parallels.   One may see in several works, and
particularly in that of Lcmonnier, entitled Lois du Mag
netism, the figure of these parallels and their disposition on
the face of the earth.
   It evidently results from this disposition that the inclina
tion increases in proportion as we recede from the magnetic
equator ; but the law which it follows in its increase has
not yet, as far as appears to us, been given. To ascertain
this law, however, would be of great utility; for the in
clination seems to be the most constant of all the magnetic
phaenomena, and it exhibits much fewer anomalies than the
intensity. Besides, if any rule, well confirmed, could be dis
covered on this subject, it might be employed with advan
tage at sea to determine the latitude when the weather does
not admit an observation of the sun ; which is the case in
various places during the greater part of the year.         We
have    some   reason  to  expect  this   application when   we
see the delicacy of that indication in the observations of
M. Humboldt, where we find 0-65° (35' 6") of difference
between two towns so near each other as Nismes and Mont-
pellier. These motives have induced us to study with great
                                                        interest

                            in different Latitudes.                                                         255
interest the series of observations made by M. Humboldt
in regard to the inclination ; and it appears to us that they
may be represented very exactly by a mathematical hypo
thesis ; to which we are far from attaching any reality in
itself, but which we offer merely as a commodious and sure
mode of connecting the results.                                  p
    To discover thislaw, we must first exactly determine the
position of the magnetic equator, which is as an interme
diate line between the northern and the southern inclina
tions.    For this purpose we have the advantage of being
able to compare two direct observations; one of Lapey-
rouse, and the other of M. Humboldt. The former found
the magnetic equator on the coasts of Brasil at 12- 1 666°
(10° 570 of south latitude, and 28-2407° (25° 25') of west
longitude, counted from the meridian of Paris.         The latter
found the same equator in Peru at 7*7963° (7°           of south                                 l')
latitude, and 89' 6481° (80° 41') of west longitude, also
reckoned from the same meridian.          These data are suffi
cient to calculate the position of the magnetic equator, sup-

and longitudes reckoned from the magnetic equator.             The
latter, being reckoned from the node of that equator in the
South Sea, I could first perceive hy these calculations that
the position of that plane determined by our preceding re
searches was pretty exact ; for some of the places, such as
Santa-Fe and Javita, where M. Humboldt observed incli
nations almost equal, were found nearly on the magnetic
parallel, though distant from each other more than 6-6666°
 (6°) in longitude *.
     When these reductions were made, I endeavoured to re-
          the signs of the inclinations observed, and to leave as
  ittle to chance as possible.
firesent                             I first tried a. mathematical
hypothesis conformable enough to the idea which has hi
therto been entertained in regard to terrestrial magnetism.
     I have supposed in the axis of the magnetic equator, and
at an equal distance from the centre of the earth, two ceni-
tres of attractive forces, the one austral and the other boreal,
in such a manner as to represent the two opposite magnetic
poles of the earth : I then calculated the effect which ought
to result from the action of these centres in any point of the
surface of the earth, making their attractive force recipro
cally vary as the square of the distance; and in this manner
I obtained the direction of the result of their forces, which
ought to be that also of the magnetic needle in that latitude.

258            Account  of a  Case   of Hydrophobia.
ing   case of hydrophobic, requesting a line or two, if you
think it deserving your attention.
    On July 4, 1S03, at nine o'clock in the evening, I was
desired to visit Thomas Brothers, aged 28 years.           I was
informed by the person who came for me, that he had been
bitten by a dog, which his friends suspected to be mad. I
found him in the hands of four young men, who were en
deavouring to confine him, and thereby prevent him from
injuring himself or friends.          He recognised me, and re
quested me to give him my hand, which he made a violent
effort to draw within his mouth. Conscious of his inclina
tion to bite, he advised his friends to keep at a distance,
mentioning that a mad dog had bitten hiin.
     His symptoms were as follow : viz. a dull pain in his
 head, watery eyes, dull aspect, stricture and heaviness at
 the breast, and a high fever.
    Believing, as you do, that there is but one fever, I de
termined to treat this case as an inflammatory fever.           I
therefore drew twenty ounces of blood ; and, as he refused
to take any thing aqueous, I had him drenched with a large
 dose of calomel and jalap.
    July 5th, four a. m. Finding the symptoms worse, I took
 away sixteen ounces of blood, and applied two large epi-
 spastic plasters to his legs, hoping thereby to relieve the op
 pression of the praecordia and other symptoms.
    Twelve m. Was informed that one of his friends had
permitted him to take a stick in his mouth, which he bit
 so as to loosen several of his teeth.       As he craved some
thing   to bite, I desired  his   friend  to  give him a piece of
lead, which he bit until he almost exhausted his strength.
    One p. m. Finding but little alteration, I drew eighteen
ounces of blood, and had him drenched with the antimo-
nial powders.
   Two p. m. He slept until half after three, when he
awoke, with the disposition to bite, oppression, &c, but
not so violent.
    July 6th, eight a. m. Found him biting the bed-clothes;
his countenance maniacal, his pulse synocha, with a stric
ture of the breast, difficult deglutition, laborious breathing,
and a discharge of saliva.      I took away twenty-four ounces
of blood, gave him a dose of calomel and jalap, and con
tinued the powders.
   Twelve m. Drew sixteen ounces of blood, and gave him
laudanum.

                  Account  of a  Case  of Hydrophobia.        259
       Five p. in. Found him in a slumber; his skin moist, and
  his fever and other symptoms much abated.
       July 7th, eight a. in. Was informed that he had only
  two paroxysms during my absence, and that he had lost
  sixteen ounces of blood agreeably to directions.      Notwith
  standing the favourable aspect which the disease wore, I
  resolved to bleed him twice more, and then to induce an
  artificial fever by mercury, which would predominate over
  the hydrophobic.       I therefore drew ten ounces of blood,
  and requested his friend to take eighteen ounces at night ;
 to rub in a small quantity of mercurial ointment, and to
 give a mercurial pill every four hours.
      July 8th, nine a.m. Found him convalescent, but con
 tinued the mercurial unction and pills.
      July 9th, ten a. m. Found his gums sore, and discon
 tinued the mercurv.
      July 15th, one p.m. Found him well, but with a con
 siderable degree of debility.
   , It would be doing injustice to you not to mention that I
 was indebted to your lectures for the successful treatment
 ef this disease.

         DEAR SIR,
     Accept of my congratulations upon your rare triumph
 over a case of hydrophobia.          I give you great credit for
 the boldness of your practice.         You have deserved well of
 the profession of medicine.
      In order to render your communication more satisfac
tory, permit me to request your answer to the following
questions:
      1. On what part of the body of your patient was the
wound inflicted ; and how long was the interval between
the time of his being bitten and the attack of his fever ?
     2. Did he discover any aversion from the sight of water?
and did he refuse to swallow liquids of all kinds ?
     3. What were the appearances of the blood drawn? Did
it differ in the different stages of the disease ?
     Your answer to the above questions will much oblige
your sincere friend,

      SIR,
  I   regret that business of an indispensable nature pre
vented me from being more particular in my communica
tion.      I
           drew it up in a hurry, intending to transcribe                        it,
and insert such other notes as would throw light on the
case  ; but being called out a few hours before the post set
out from this place,        was obliged to forward the commu

nication      the manner in which you received it.
               in
    The part of the body of my patient on which the wound
was inflicted was      little above the union of the solaeus and
                          a
 gastrocnemius muscles, which form the tendo-achillis. The
 interval between the time of his being bitten and the attack
 of the fever was twenty-four days.
    He was,      was told, dull and solitary   few days previous

 him two hundred vards from the house, apparently in                              a
 deep study.     He has informed me, since his recovery, that
 he had      slight pain in the wound, attended with itching,
              a
 and an uneasiness in the inguinal gland, several days before
 the fever.
    He refused to swallow liquids, and the sight of water
threw him into           a   convulsive agitation.
   With regard to the appearances                      of the blood drawn,       I

At      time like the present, when there
          a                                   every appear          is
ance of some important discoveries in chemistry being made
by the help of Galvanism, any experiment connected with
this subject that      not generally known (and especially such
                          is
 as relate to the  decomposition of water, and that in more                  a
rapid manner     than      usually done
                               is                      by
                                            Galvanism) must be
acceptable  to  persons engaged    in this branch of science.                    I
therefore  take   the liberty of troubling you  with the follow
                                                                                 ing

                                                                          26 i
                          ty meatts   of Galvanism,
  ing account of some experiments I made, about a year and
  a naif ago, with a Galvanic trough containing fifty pair of
  plates four inches square.          If you think   it worthy     of a place
  in your Philosophical Magazine, you will insert it therein.
      Being desirous of ascertaining whether water would be
  decomposed or no, if the wires, which were connected with
 ^he ends of the trough, were at a considerable distance from
  one another, I inserted two short silver wires through corks
  into the ends of a glass tube 36 inches long, and which was
  filled with water: the ends of the wires were about 34 inches
  asunder, which distance was too great tor any visible de
  composition of the water to take place ; yet that wire which
  was connected with the zinc end of the trough, gave a very
  faint whitish cloud which descended *. With a shorter tube
  the decomposition of the water commenced when the end9
  of the wires were at the distance of 18 inches. It then
  struck me, that if a wire was interposed between the two
  end wires of the long tube a decomposition might possibly
  be effected at two places in the tube at the same time, and
  that the quantity of gas evolved would be greater than if it
  was evolved at only one place.              I therefore introduced a
  piece of iron wire between the end          wires,   in such a manuer
  that its ends came within an inch of them. When a corn-*
 munication was made with the trough there was a very
  copious evolution of gas at both ends of the interposed wire,
 and at that end wire that was connected with the coppef
 end of the trough ; and a red oxide of iron was formed at
 one end of the iron wire, while a black oxide was formed
 at the other.
      To try if any increased effect would take place if there
 was a greater surface of the wires opposed to one another,
 I pushed the end wires further into the tube till their ends
passed about an inch beyond the ends of the interposed
wire : when a communication was made between them and
the ends of the trough, a very rapid" evolution of gas took
 place throughout the whole extent of the parts of the wires
 that were opposed.
     Finding trie quantity of gas much increased by this ma
nagement, I introduced a wire into each end of a tube about
 16 inches long.          Each" of these wires passed nearly the
whole length of the tube without touching one another, so
that the length of the opposed parts was 14 inches.. When
these were connected with the trough, there was a very co-
    * With a
             battery of troughs containing 400 pair of plates 4 inches square,
the decomposition took place when the wires were withdrawn to the ends of
the tube.

pious evolution of gas through the whole length of the tube.
The wires used in this were iron, and the red and black,
oxides were formed in considerable quantity*
    Seeing the quantity of gas evolved with a given power is
in proportion to the quantity of surface of the wires oppo
sed, many contrivances might be used to increase the effect
to a considerable degree.        If
                                thin plates of metal were used
instead of wires, a greater surface would be opposed, and in
all probability the effect would be increased.    Several wires
or plates might be arranged in the same tube, and alternately
connected with the end^ of the trough ; or, if wire cloth was
used instead of plates, probably the effect would be still
further increased.

XL.   New Observations      on     Volcanoes and their       Lava.   By
                          G. A.    Deluc*.
   V olcanoes have been so numerous on the surface of
  our continents, when they were under the waters of the
  antient sea; and as this class of mountains, raised by sub
  terranean fires, manifest themselves still on the shores of
  the present sea, and in the middle of its waters, it is of
 importance to geology and the philosophy of the earth to
 obtain as just ideas of them as possible.
     I have attended a great deal to this subject from my own
 observations ; and 1 have snown, at different times, the
 errors into which several geologists and naturalists, in
 treating ofit,   have fallen.
     This class of mountains, in particular, requires that we
 should see them, that we should behold them during their
 eruptions, that we should have traced the progress of their
 lava, and have observed closely their explosions      that we
                                                             ;
 should have made     a    numerous collection of the matters
which they throw up under their different circumstances,
 that we might afterwards be able to study them in the ca
binet, and to judge of their composition according to the
phaenomena which have been observed on the spot.
    This studyis    highly necessary when we apply to geology
and the philosophy of the earth, in order that we may avoid
falling into those mistakes which make us ascribe to sub
terranean    fires what does not belong to them, or which
leads us to refuse them what really belongs to them.

           Observations   on Volcanoes and their  Lava.      263
    We   read in  the Journal de Physique for January, 1 804,
under the title,     On the cause of Volcanoes, the following
assertions  :
   "  What     is the nature of the matters which maintain
these subterranean fires?     We have seen that Chimboraco,
all these enormous volcanoes of Peru, and the Peak of
Teneriffe, are composed of porphyry.
    " The Puy-de-D6me is also composed of porphyry, as
well as the Mont-d'Or and the Cantal.
    " ^Etna, Solfatara, and Vesuvius, are also of the por
phyry kind.                           »
    " These facts prove that the most considerable volcanoes
with which we are acquainted are of porphyry."
    This opinion, that the fires of volcanoes have their cen-*
tres in such or such a rock, and that their lavas are pro
duced from these rocks, has always appeared to me not to
be founded on any certain data.         Opinions also on this
subject have varied ; some having placed the origin of lava in
horn rock, others in granite or schist, and at present it is
assigned to porphyry.
    I have always been of opinion that nothing certain could
be determined in regard to this point.      It ever remains un
certain whether the seat of the matters of which lava is
formed be in compact rocks, or in strata in the state of
softness, pulverulent, and muddy.
    Those who see lava issue from a volcano in its state of
fusion and incandescence, and in its cooling, are convinced
that the nature of every thing is changed, that it exhibits a
 paste in which nothing can be known, except the sub
stances which the volcanic fires have not reduced to fusion.
    But these substances contained in the paste of lava,
and those which are the most numerous, show us, that the
strata from which they proceed cannot be similar to those
exposed to the view,xnor even to the most profound strata
 to which we can penetrate.
    The schorl of volcanoes, which was named augite, and
then pyroxene, an octaedral prism with two biedral pyra
 mids, is not found in the strata with which we are ac
 quainted j and the case is the same with the leucite or white
 garnet, a crystallization of a round form, with twenty-four
 trapezoidal faces.     And these crystals, which are observed
 perfectly insulated in lava, are found there also, united in
 groups, which are likewise insulated, having no marks of
 former adhesion.
    Here then we have two species of crystals exceedingly
numerous in several kinds of lava.          Those of ./Etna are
                            .  B 4                         tilled

464               Obsenations on Vokanoes and their Lava.
 filled with schorl ; and those of Vesuvius, particularly the
 antient, contain schorl and leucites in great numbers*.
     I shall make no mention of other . substances, such
 as    chrysolites and olivins,      because their form is not
 sufficiently   determined  to enable us to decide whether they
 are found or not in the exterior strata.
     It is not the lava of Vesuvius and ./Etna alone which
 contains one or other of these crystals, or both of them to
gether.     Most of the lavas of the antient volcanoes in the
neighbourhood of Rome are filled with myriads of leucites.
Several of the lavas of the Brisgau contain schorls in great
quantity.      The gravel of the volcanic lake of Andernach is
filled with them. They are found in thebasaltes of the circle
of Lewtomeritz in Bohemia, and in the scoria? of the crater of
Puy-de-la-Vache in Auvergne.              I mention only the lavas
of which I possess specimens, most of them collected by
myself on the spot, or which were sent to me by my bro
ther, who collected them in his excursions to the old volca
noes of Germany.
     Are these two crystals so numerous in lava, the jchorls
of volcanoes, and leucites, found in any porphvry, granite,
or horn rock ? They arc not found there : the question
then is decided ; lavas do not derive their origin from por
phyry, nor from the two other rocks.
     What, in all probability, has led to the contrary opinion,
is the appearance of several kinds of lava, which, by the in
sulated substances they contain, have a porphyroid appear
ance, though they arc not porphyritic.
     Leucite is said to have been found : — Is this crystal, of a
round form, with twenty-four trapezoidal faces, really that
substance?       If it in what kind of rock was found
                            is,                               it    Is       ?
it  found there        by
                      myriads, as  in  lava   Were
                                                ?     this  the  case,
must       not have been long since known
             it                                      And ?          be if    it

sequence, compared with the grand fact presented                lava.   by
 I     have said that      uncertain whether lava proceeds from

     •The biedral pyramids of schorl are subject to several varieties, but
never to that of the prism, which has always eight faces: these faces vary
in their size like those of rock crystal. Some are frequently seen which have
two opposite faces broader than the rest;      a   variety which       observed
                                                                       is

crystals, the schorls of volcanoes, and leucites, are found in
such great number in their paste, all insulated, and without
bearing any marks of adhesion to any rock ; when we con
sider also, that these schorls are found insulated one by one
in myriads, mixed with the small scoriae, thrown up by
the mouths which vomited forth the enormous lava of
./Etna in 1669; that this lava itself i3 filled with it, — it   not

 rock.  It   is still more difficult to conceive that fires capable
 of fusing granite, horn rock, and porphyry, should spare
 schorls, leucites, and some other substances, which are
 fused and reduced to glass in our furnaces.
      The volcanic mountain of Viterbo exhibits lavas where
 the leucites are so near each other that they occupy
 between them more space than the paste of the lava which
 contains them.
      The lava of ./Etna contains, besides schorls and some
 olivins,a     multitude of crystalline laminae, whitish, and
  semi-transparent.        They are named without hesitation
feld-spur, which appears to me not so certain as            is sup
  posed.
      These laminae are two or three lines in breadth, and
  about half line in thickness.

• those with which we are acquainted, and that they should
  not be found mixed with any fragment larger or better de
  termined, which might indicate in       a     certain manner that
  origin.
       Admitting the hypothesis, that the strata from which the
   lavas proceed are in a     pulverulent and muddy state, con
   taining elements of all these small crystals, one may con
   ceive how they are formed there, insulated, grouped, or
   solitary, and are found then in the lava in that state of in
   sulation.
       The fragments of natural rocks thrown up       by    Vesuvius
    are not of the same kind as the matters of which the lava
 is     composed.      Most of these fragments are micaceous
    rocks, with laminae of greater or less size, and of kind of

  white quartzy rock; it is found sometimes of calcareous
  rock.
     The most probable idea that can be formed in regard to
  the origin of these fragments is, that they have been carried
 from the borders of the strata through which the lava, that
 comes from great depths, has opened for itself a passage*
 These fragments are carried to the surface ot the lava as far
 as the bottom of the chimney of the crater, whence they
 have been thrown out by explosions, mixed with fragments
 separated, or rather torn, from the lava; for it is not by the
 lava that they have been brought forth to view, but by ex
 plosions.
    Some of these fragments of natural rocks have not been
 attacked by the fire ; others have more or less ; which de
 pends, no doubt, on the place which they occupied in the
 volcano, and on the time which they remained in it. The
 most of the latter have retained at their surface a crust of
 lava, and this crust contains substances which are not the
 same as that of the fragment it covers.
    On Vesuvius the strata pierced by eruptions are lower
 than the surface of the soil; in Auvergne and several places
of Germany they are above ; for this reason there are seen
there in their place schists or granites, which the eruptions
have broken to form for themselves a passage.
    No volcano rests on natural strata ; they sometimes show
themselves on the exterior; but they have been opened by
eruptions, and their ei'ges have remained in their place.
    The focus of no volcano exists or has existed in the cone
which appears above the surface of the ground.        They have
been raised by eruptions, which, proceeding from great
depths, have thrown them up through the upper strata.
When it is said, therefore, that the volcanic mountains of
Auvergne rest on granite, this is a mistake, and an incor
rect expression has been used by those who have not form
ed a just idea of the phaenomenon.        Lava may have flowed
upon granite or any other rock, and rested upon it ; but
this is never the case with the volcano itself: its bases are
below all the rocks visible.
    It is from the bosom ev.en of the lava, when in a state of
fusion in the interior of the volcano, that all the explosions
proceed.      In that state of fusion they contain all the mat
ters which produce fermentations, and the disengagement
of expansible fluids.
    I have been enabled to ascertain this on Vesuvius as far
as was possible.       The continual noise which was heard
through the two interior mouths of the crater which I had
                                                          before

           Observations  on Volcanoes and their  Lava.     267
before my eyes,       was that of an ebullition,  accompanied
with inflammable vapours,      and the gcrbes of burning mat
ters which they threw up at intervals were separated pieces
pf the lava in its state of fusion. I saw several of them in
the air change their form, and sometimes become flat on
the bodies which they struck or embraced in falling.      And
among the most apparent of these fragments there are al
ways a multitude of small ones of the size of peas and nuts,
and still smaller ones, which show at their surface, by their
asperities, all the characters of laceration.
    The name of scorice has been given to these fragments to
distinguish them from compact lava, though their compo
sition be the same as that of the hardest lava ; and it is for
want of reflecting properly on this point that it has been
said that it is the compact part only that we must observe,
in order to judge of their nature. The pieces which I took
from the flowing lava with an iron hook, have at their sur
face the same lacerations and the same asperities as the frag
ments thrown up by explosions, and both contain the same
substances.
    This separation, by tearing off the parcels of the lava
effected by fermentations ana explosions which proceed
from their bosom, serves to explain those columns, some
times prodigious, of volcanic sand which rise from the
principal crater. When seen with a magnifying glass, this
sand exhibits nothing but lava reduced very small, the par
ticles of which, rough with inequalities, have the bright
 black colour and the varnish of recent lava.
    Parcels of substances which exist in our strata, such as
fragments of quartz, scales of mica, and crystals of feld
 spar, are found sometimes in lava. Similar matters must
no doubt be disseminated in the composition of our globe,
without there being reason to conclude that the strata
 from which they proceed are the same as the exterior strata.
 It is neither in the granites, the porphyries, nor the horn
 rock, and still less in the schists and calcareous rocks that
 the schorls of volcanoes, the leucites, and perhaps olivins,
 will be found. These small crystals are brought to view by
 the lava, otherwise they would be unknown to us.
    These lavas contain a great deal of iron, which they ac
 quire neither from the granite nor porphyries.      Might not
 one see in the ferruginous sand which is found in abun
 dance on the borders of the sea near Naples, and in the
 environs of Rome, specimens of that kind of pulverulent
 strata from which lava proceeds ?
    I have here offered enough to prove that it cannot be

 determined that lava proceeds , from strata similar to those
with which we are acquainted. The operations of volca
 noes, those vast laboratories of nature, will always remain
 unknown to us, and on this subject our conjectures will al
 ways be very uncertain.
    What is the nature of that mixture which gives birth to
 these eruptions, that produce lava and throw uprhountains|?
 What we observe as certain is, that the introduction of the
water of the sea is necessary to excite these fermentations,
 as containing marine acid and other salts, which, united to
 the sulphuric acid, the bases of which are contained in
 abundance in the subterranean strata, determine these fer
mentations, which produce the disengagement of fire and
 other fluids, and all the "grand effects that are the conse
quence.
    Several naturalists have believed, and still believe, that
 fresh or ram water is sufficient for this purpose j but they
are mistaken : this opinion is contradicted by every fact
known. To be convinced of this, nothing is necessary but
 to take a short view of them.     I have done it several times,
 as it is necessary to consider them often.     I shall here enu
 merate the principal ones : — No burning mountain exists
in the interior part of the earth ; and all those which still
burn are, without exception, in the neighbourhood of the
 sea, or surrounded by its waters.     Among the deliquescent
 salts deposited by the smoke of volcanoes, we distinguish
chiefly the marine salt, united to different bases.     Several of
the volcanoes of Iceland, and Heckla itself, sometimes
throw up eruptions of water, which deposit marine salt in
abundance. No extent of fresh water, however vast, gives
birth to a volcano. These facts are sufficient to prove that the
concurrence of sea-water is absolutely necessary to excite
those fermentations which produce volcanoes.
    I shall here repeat the distinction I have already made
between burnt out volcanoes and the antient volcanoes,
that I may range them in two separate classes.
    When we simply give the name of burnt out or extin
guished volcanoes to volcanic mountains which are in the
middle of the continents, it is to represent them as having1
burnt while the land was dry, and inhabited as it is at
present ; which is not a just idea.       These volcanoes have
burnt when the land on which they are raised was under
the waters of the antient sea, and none of them have burnt
since our continents became dry.        It is even very apparent
that most of them were extinct before the retreat of the'
sea, as we find by numerous examples in the present sea.

           Observations  on Volcanoes and their  Lava.       269
     Those which I denominate extinct volcanoes are such as
no longer burn, though surrounded by the sea, or placed
on the borders of it. They would still burn, were not the
inflammable matters by which they were raised, really ex
hausted and consumed.         Of this kind is the volcano of
Agde, in Languedoc.         Of this kind also are many of the
volcanic islands which have not thrown up fire since time
immemorial.
     M. Humboldt, in his letters written from Peru, speaks
of the volcanoes which he visited, but what he says is not
 sufficiently precise to enable us to form a just idea of them.
 He represents Chimboraco as being composed of porphyry
 from its bottom to its summit, and adds, that the porphyry
 is lgootojses in thickness; afterwards, he remarks, that it is
 almost improbable that Chiinboraipo, as well as Picchincha
 and Antisana, should be of a volcanic nature : '• The place
 by which we ascended," says he, " is composed of burnt
 and scorified rock, mixed with pumice-stone, which re
 sembles all the currents of lava in this country."
      Here are two characters very different.   If Chimbora^o
 be porphyry from the top to the bottom, it is not composed
 of burnt and scorified rocks, mixed with pumice-stone;
 and if it be composed of burnt rocks, it cannot be porphyry.
 This expression, burnt and scorified rocks, is not even exact,
  because it excites the idea of natural rocks, altered in their
  place by fire, and they are certainly lava which have been
  thrown up by the volcano.       But the truth must be, that
  ChimboraQo, and all the other volcanoes of Peru, are com
  posed of volcanic matters, from their base at the level oi
  the sea to the summit.
      I have just read in the Annates du Museum d'Histoire
  Naturelle*, a letter of the same traveller, written from
  Mexico, on his return from Peru, where, speaking of the
  volcanoes of Popayan, Pasto, Quito, and the other parts of
  the Andes, he says,    f Great masses of this fossil {obsidian)
  have issued from the craters ; and the sides of these gulphs,
  which we closely examined, consist of porphyry, the base of
  which holds a mean between obsidian and pitch-stone
   (pechstein)."    M. Humboldt therefore considers obsidian,
   or black compact glass, as a natural fossil or rock, and not
   as volcanic glass.
      Father de la Torre, who resided at Naples, and has written
   on Vesuvius, believed also that the interior of its mouth
   was composed of natural rocks and strata like every other

  mountain : he calls them strati naturally sassi naturally
  though every thing there be the work of fire.
     If M. Humboldt had been a witness to the birth and
 formation of the craters of which he speaks, he would soon
 have given them up entirely to the volcanic empire.             The
 violence of the fire ; the explosions and burning lava with
 which that empire would have reclaimed them, would soon
 have silenced all Neptunian pretension, and confirmed that
 these masses, which he calls porphyry, and their bases,
 holding a medium between obsidian and pitch-stone, are
 lava and vitrifications belonging to Vulcan. M. Humboldt
 derives his objection against the opinion that obsidian is
 volcanic glass, from its swelling up and becoming spongy
 and fibrous by the least degree of heat of a furnace, whence
 he concludes that it cannot be the production of fire.
     An attentive examination of volcanic productions shows
 that their state and appearance depend oh the nature of the
 matters which have been subjected to the action of the
 fires, on the degree of heat, the time and place where it has
 been exercised.       Therefore a degree of heat which has been
 able to reduce any substance to compact glass, would not
be sufficient to put it into a state of ebullition, and at that
moment could not be carried to a degree capable of pro
ducing that effect : to this the want of free air may contri
bute.      But there are some circumstances, even pretty fre
quent, of volcanic fires giving fibrous and puffed-up glass.
I possess a vitrification from Lipari, the centre of which is
compact glass, and the inside in laminae, bubbles, and
threads, like pumice-stone.         I have in my possession an
other, part of which is glass nearly compact, and part glass
very much puffed up.              I found on the sea-shore,
near Messina, two pieces of four or five inches in diameter,
formed merely of vitreous laminae, elongated, undulated,
and full of puffed up places.           I have two fragments of
obsidian, or black compact glass of Ischia, one of the en
tire faces of which evidently shows by the circular undula
tions of the one, and the rounded inequalities of the other,
that they have been in a state of fusion*       I saw at Vulcano
a vitreous mass, from which I broke a large fragment, the
glass of which is compact in some parts, and full of puffed
up places, some of them large and others small.             Of this
kind   is the black   compact glass  of the volcanoes  of  Iceland.
    Another objection of M. Humboldt is, that obsidian is
found in such large masses that it may be compared to a
quarry.     But why should this be an objection ? Vitreous
lava   does  not differ from any other lava, but by more perfect
                                                     vitrification;

vitrification ; and in regard to the size of the masses, it
mav be said that it has no bounds, since JEtna., a volcano
much less considerable than those of Peru, throws up lava
several leagues in extent, and of a very great thickness.
    Obsidian, therefore, or the black glass of the volcanoes
of Peru, is as certainly a production of their fires as the lava
which is seen to issue from the bottom of every crater.

In     the sitting of 25th April last there was read an inte
 resting paper on an artificial substance possessing the prin
 cipal characteristic properties of tannin, by Charles Hat-
 chett, Esq. a member of the society.
    The author, after mentioning the labours of Mr. Deyeux
 and Mr. Seguin, the former of whom first separated this
 substance from galls, the characteristic property of which,
 to precipitate gelatin from water, was ascertained      by the
 latter; and after mentioning the experiments of Mr. Big
 gin, Mr. Proust, and Mr. Davy, remarks that no one had.
 hitherto supposed that it could be produced by art, unless
 the fact mentioned by Mr. Chenevix, that " a decoction of
 coffee berries did not precipitate gelatine, unless they had
 been previously roasted," might be considered as an indi
 cation of it.     Recent experiments have, however, shown
 him that tannin may be formed by very simple means, not
 only from vegetable, but from mineral and animal sub
 stances.
    In the course of his experiments on lac and resins, he
 observed the powerful effects of nitric acid on these sub
 stances, and has since observed that by long digestion
 almost every species of resin is dissolved, and so completely
 altered that water does not cause any precipitation, and that
 by evaporation a deep yellow viscid substance is obtained,
 equally soluble in water and in alcohol.         In his experi
 ments afterwards, on the bitumens, he observed a material
 difference between their solutions and those of resins.
 With bitumens, nitric acid, by long digestion, formed a
 dark brown solution ; a deep yellow coloured mass was se
 parated, which, by subsequent digestion in another portion
 of nitric acid, was completely dissolved, and, by evapora

 tion,  was converted into a yellow viscid substance similar
  to that obtained from the resins. Mr. Hatchett therefore
  concluded that the dark brown solution was formed by the
  action of the nitric acid on the uncombined carbon of the
  bitumens; that the deep yellow portion constituted the
  essential  part of the bitumens;       and therefore that the
  dark solution was in fact dissolved coal.     He accordingly
  tried pit coal, and, by a similar treatment, obtained the
  same dark brown solution in great abundance, but not
  when he used coals which contained little or no bitumen.
      Having by means of nitric acid obtained solutions from
  asphaltum, from jet, pit coals, and charcoal, he evaporated
  each to dryness, very slowly, to expel the remaining acid
  without burning the residuum, which in each was a glossy
  brown substance, exhibiting a resinous fracture, soluble in
  water and in alcohol, and highly astringent.       Exposed to
 heat, they smoked but little,, swelled, and yielded a bulky
 coal. Their solutions reddened litmus paper, and precipi
 tated various metallic and earthy salts, and also glue or
 isinglass, yielding a precipitate insoluble in water, either
 hot or cold — and consequently possessing all the properties
 of tannin, uncontaminated with gallic acid.
     Mr. Hatchett then reduced some animal substances to
 the state of charcoal, and by a treatment similar to the
 above obtained from them tannin.
     Some kinds of coal, which in their natural state yielded
 little or no tannin, on being brought to a red heat in a close
 vessel, and then digested with nitric acid, were almost
 wholly converted into that substance.       The result was the
 same with various kinds of wood ; — when charred they
yielded a great quantity of tannin, though before under
going that process they would yield none.
     This ingenious paper contains other interesting details on
matters connected with this subject, all tending to show
 that different substances yielded tannin in proportion to the
            of their original carbon, and that substances re-

     On the 4th of July was read a paper by W. Hyde Wol-

servations on other substances found with plalina.

by precipitation,      had   an     opportunity of examining
the various impurities usually           mixed with the pre.

                      Royal  Society of London.               273
  This   led him to the discovery of the new metal which he
  named rhodium, and also to the discovery which forms the
  principal subject of this paper.     He mentions also having
  found blended with platina the ore of another metal, which
  has hitherto passed unobserved from its great resemblance
  to the grains of that metal. These grains he considers as
  the ore of iridium, the new metal discovered by Mr. Ten-
  nant. They are insoluble in nitro-muriatic acid, are harder
  than platina, brittle under the hammer, and break with a
 laminated fracture.     Mr. Tennant has undertaken the ana
  lysis of a portion of this ore.
     The author mentions having separated from the ore of
  platina, by a current of water, some very minute red cry
 stals, the quantity of which was too small to admit of ana
 lysis ; but from such an examination as he could give them
  he concludes them to be hyacinths.
     Having separated these and other impurities from the
 ore of platina, as far as practicable by mechanical means,
 dissolved the ore, and obtained, in the form of a yellow
 triple salt, all the platina that could be precipitated by sal-
 ammoniac, clean bars of iron were used to separate the re
 maining platina.      This precipitate, consisting of various
 metals,    was subjected again to exactly the same treatment,
 when the precipitate obtained by sal-ammoniac was found
 to be not of so pale a yellow as before : bars of iron were
 also again used to precipitate what remained suspended.
 A repetition of the same process on this second precipitate
 led to the discovery of palladium ; for Dr. Wollaston found
that a portion of it resisted the action of the nitro-muriatic
 acid, though this powder had been twice completely dis
 solved before. The solution was very dark in colour, yielded
by sal-ammoniac only a small quantity of precipitate, and,
instead of becoming pale by the precipitation of the platina,
retained the dark colour which it had acquired from the
other metals held in solution.       The second metallic preci
pitate, therefore, became the subject of investigation. Lead,
iron, and copper, were detected in it by muriatic acid. Di
lute nitrous acid separated a further portion of copper, form
ing, as usual, a blue solution ; but when a stronger acid
was used for the purpose of separating the remaining cop
per, the dark brown colour of the solution gave evidence
that some other metal had been dissolved. A small portion
of the solution was put on a surface of platina ; and on ap
plying a clean plate of copper a black precipitate was ob
tained, soluble in nitric acid, and consequently neither gold
nor platina. The solution in that acid was red, therefore
the metal was neither silver nor mercury ; and having been

precipitated by copper, it Was none of the other known
metals. Mercury, agitated in a warm nitrous solution of
this metal, acquired the consistence of an amalgam, which
when exposed to a red heat left a white metal — palladium ;
which gave a red solution, as before, with nitrous acid,
 could not be precipitated by sal-ammoniac or by nitre, but
yielded a yellow precipitate with prussiate of potash, and
in the order of its affinities was precipitated by mercury, but
not by silver. The author, however, adopted afterwards
another process for obtaining palladium, depending on one
of its most distinguishing properties, by means of which it
may be obtained with the utmost facility.           To a solution
of crude platina, whether neutralized by evaporation of the
redundant acid, or saturated by any of the alkalies, by lime
or by magnesia, by mercury, copper, or iron, and a'so whe
ther the platina has or has not been precipitated from it by
sal-ammoniac, it is only necessary for the separation of the
palladium that prussiate of mercury be added to the solu
tion. In a short time it becomes turbid, and a flocculent
precipitate is gradually formed of a pale yellowish white
colour.    The prussiate of palladium thus obtained, when
heated, yields thai metal in a pure state.

   Wc    have in commerce three kinds of strong glue, those
of England, Flanders, and Paris.        The first is the best, and

the third the worst.        M. Seguin, having accurately com
pared their degrees of goodness, that is to say, of tenacity,
has examined the difference of their chemical principles.
He has always found in the glue of Paris an insoluble mix
ture of gelatine and calcareous soap, which is deposited
when the glue is dissolved : in that of Flanders, a coagu
lated albumen, which deposits itself also : that of England
alone is free from this mixture and deposit.        Nothing re
mained but to discover a sure method of making glue si
milar to that of England.
   M. Seguin first saw, that of all the animal parts capable
of giving glue, skins furnish the best, and particularly the
skins of adult animals killed by the butchers. He then saw
that every thing depends on the method of freeing them
from the hair.      The worst glue is produced by skins freed
from the hair by lime.; that of skins freed from the hair by
alkalies is a little better ; but the most tenacious is obtained
  from skins freed from the hair by gallin, and particularly
  by the successive action of gallin and diluted sulphuric acid.
  But gallin is rare, and too dear for such an application.
  M. Seguin, there! ore, did not obtain a complete solution
  of the problem which he proposed, but by finding out a
  substitute for gallin, which is moistened malt.
     The name of degras is given to a matter employed for
  currying leather, and which is obtained in the preparation
  of shammy leather. There are two kinds of it ; that of
  the country and that of Niort, which is better and dearer
 than the former.      The degras of the country, according to
 Seguin, is composed of oxygenated oil, soap, and gelatin
 in particular states. The two latter principles hurt Tts ef
 fect. The degras of Niort contains none of these sub
 stances, and is only oil in a certain state.   M. Seguin imi
 tates  it,the colour excepted, by treating oils with nitric
 acid and the product he obtains proves
    ;                                           a substitute, at
 less expense, for the degras of Niort;
    M. Sage has shown us some singular products of the
 chemical art in foreign countries.     The Chinese make fur
 naces which are as light as pasteboard, and which are in
 combustible, because they are made of amianthus.           The
 same nation employ zinc for coin,   a   semi-metal which did
 not seem proper for such     a   purpose. The same chemist
 continues, with indefatigable ardour, to describe those ob
jects interesting to geology which are contained in his col
 lection.   He has shown us this year several curious fossils
 belonging, for the most part, to the class of shells, such as
terebratulae, orthoceratites, nummularia, &c.

276                French National Institute.
    The voyage of M. Peren, among the infinite number of
interesting objects it has procured, has furnished us with
two proper for throwing light on the history of these fossils.
The shell called by naturalists nautilus spirula was among
those still found alive the nearest to the cormia ammonis,
the spiral camerines, and nummularia.         M. Peron brought
home the animal, and we have seen that it is not contained
in the shell, but, on the contrary, that it contains the shell,
as the cuttle-fish contains its bone.     This animal belongs,
therefore, to the genus of the cuttle-fish. It gives us reason
to believe that the cornua ammonis and nummularia belong
to it also, and he explains every thing that remained em
barrassing on this subject. The same traveller has brought
back also an animal near a-kin to the medusa;, which con
 tains in its inside a cartilaginous disk entirely analogous in
 its structure, to the concentric uuininularia.     M. Sage ob
 served in a piece of coal the impression of a disk, which
 must have resembled that of this medusa still more than
 these nummularia themselves.
     M. Cuvier, who has made known to the class these two
 results of M. Peron's collections, presented to it also two
 facts interesting to geology, discovered by himself.
     The first is, that among the numerous animals of un
 known genera with the remains of which the plaster quar
 ries in the neighbourhood of Paris are filled, there is found
 a kind of opossum, a genus still existing, but only in the
 new continent : the other is, that the remains of a hyasna,
 very similar to that of the Cape of Good Hope, are scattered
 throughout the edrlh in different parts of France and Ger
 many.
     M.Desmarets has contributed also to extend this curious
 part of the natural history of animals known only by their
 remains.     He has presented to us two sorts of fossil shells
 of Angoumois hitherto unknown to naturalists : he has read
 to us also a treatise on the different sorts of vegetable earth,
 their characters, and their origin.        We have had like
 wise in mineralosrv      a Description    .of Guadaloupe by
 M. I'Escalier. This island is in part volcanic and in part
 madreporic.
    •M. Humboldt has given ns a view of the geologic com
 position of the heights of the Cordilleras.     M. Rainond has
 added new observations to those which he before made on.
 the Pyrenees.
     M. Lelicvre has taught us that the kind of mineral called
pinite has been discovered in Fiance by Cordier, who found
 it in minerals collected in the environs of Clermont in Au-

     Botany continues to be enriched with an increasing num
ber of new species. The superb work on ihe Jardin de Mal-

by M. de Beauvois ; that of the Lies de France ei de Bour

 M. de Bellardiere, are prosecuted with success. Messrs.
de Humboldt and Bonpland have published the first number
of that of South America.
  ¦ M. Desfontaines has
                             published a catalogue of all the ve
getables in the Jardin des Plantes ; a valuable work, not
only for those who frequent that celebrated school, but also
for all botanists. M. Broussonet has also given that of the
Jardin de Montpellier.
   » Botany for a long time has been accustomed        to honour
those who cultivate and patronize             it,
                                               giving their names

to the new genera      it discovers  ;and experience has proved
that such monuments are the most durable of all.
    No person deserved this honour more than the empress,
who takes so much pleasure in that agreeable science, and
who promotes its progress so much.            The Spanish bota
nists, Messrs. Ruiz and Pavon, had already paid her this
honour    by   giving the name of her family to          beautiful
                                                         a
plant of South America.
    M. Ventenat, charged by her majesty with making
known to the public all the new species of the garden of
Malmaison, has consecrated to her second, the Josephina,
                                              a
originally from New Holland, and near a-kin to the digi-
talia and the pedalia.      The elevation of its stem and the
beauty of its flowers will make        be cultivated in pleasure-

gardens.
     M. de Beauvois has dedicated to the emperor Napoleon
tree of the country of Oware, in Africa, distinguished            by a
its splendour, and the size and singularity of its flower.
     M. de Humboldt during his travels enriched the natural
history of plants with general and very new considerations        :
he has traced out  a    sort of geography of them, in which he
determines     the limits of each species in latitude and in ver
tical height          the temperature which stops them in both

they    extend   more in breadth, or rise higher, on the moun
tains, according to this difference; which may serve as sure a
guide to agriculture        inthe choice of the plants which      it
destines to each position.

  tory of animals.      He has described several new species,
  among      which we   have to remark in particular one of the
  fish thrown up sometimes by the volcanoes in South Ame
  rica. Do they live in subterranean lakes which have a
'
  communication with the sea ?
      M. Peron has communicated to us two observations ex
  ceedingly valuable in regard to the natural history of man.
  The first relates to the celebrated apron of the Hottentot wo
  men; denied by some, and differently described by others.
  M. Peron proves that it is a natural excrescence, which
  forms one of the characters of a particular race known
   under the name of the Boschmen.            The other observation
   relates to the strength of the savages.       A number of expe
   riments, made by Regnier's dynamometer, has shown that
   they are sensibly weaker, cceleris paribus, than the people
   of civilized nations.
      We long ago announced the celebrated work of Berthollet
   entitled Statique Chiihique.      M. Pinel has written another,
   the title of which is Statique Anatomique. • We have an
   other of the same kind written in the century before last
   by the celebrated Borelli ; but mechanics and anatomy have
   both since that period made so much progress, that Borelli's
   work, excellent for its time, is at present superannuated'.
      A particular object of anatomy, namely, the teeth, has
   been long studied by M. Tenon.          This profound anatomist
   has made so many discoveries on this subject,that it is more
   indebted to him than to any person who preceded him. He"
   has lately read to us a memoir on a substance peculiar to the
   teeth of certain herbivorous animals, such as the horse and
   elephant, which envelops the enamel.
      The same physician has communicated to us a great work
   on diseases of the eyes, which he will soon publish, and
   another on the diseases peculiar to hatters.      The latter arise
   chiefly from the use which hatters make of mercury to ren
   der common hair fit to be manufactured into felt, since we
   were deprived of beaver skins by the loss of Canada. These
   diseases cannot be prevented but by weakening as much as
   possible the mercurial liquor employed, or by endeavouring
   to discover some other kind of hair which may be converted
   into felt without that liquor.
       M. Tenon has read to us also several memoirs on surgery,
    concerning the different methods hitherto used to prevent
    or correct those accidents which are inseparable from our
   nature. Of this kind are instruments proper for extirpating
    polypes of the nose ; and a method, by compression, of
    stopping haemorrhages of the mouth.

  lnv.Jlhemeine Uteratur-Zeitung, of 24th of July, re-
 mar^ thiii      " it has been shown in some of the German
 publications on the cow-pock, that this method of
                                                            inocu
lation was known in Germany before it was recommended
 by Dr. Jcnner ; and the case appears to be the same in
 France.      M. Audouard of Castres, now at Paris, secretary
 to the society of the practice of medicine at Montpellier,
 has discovered that the method of vaccine inoculation was
                                  S 4                     practised

   280                   Vaccine  Inoculation.
   practised in some of the departments of France long before
   the attempts of Dr. Jenner.       M. Audouard'will publish a
   work on this subject, in which it is expected he will give
   proofs that this method belongs originally to France." On
   this we may observe, that we have no doubt of the fact, for
   it was also practised in England by solitary individuals ; but
  this does not lessen at all the merit due to Dr. Jenner, who
  was the first to point out the proper use that might be made
  of the fact ; nor of Drs. Pearson, Woodville, and others,
  who seconded his views, and have laboured with such in
  cessant zeal to promote its general adoption, not only in
  this country, but in every part of the world — and with so
  much success, that at no very distant period we may expect
  to see the small-pox, the most dreadful scourge with which
  the human race were ever afflicted, banished from the face
  of the earth.
                                                   Ragusa, June 30th.
      The vaccine  has at length been adopted at this place,
  owing    to the exertions of that indefatigable physician
  Stulli, and the repeated instigations of Dr. de Carro of Vi
  enna, to whom we are indebted for this benefit. Dr. de
  Carro's Catechism on the Vaccine, translated into the Illyric
 language, and distributed in the town, and by the country
  clergymen, has contributed greatly to dispose the inhabi
 tants for receiving it.    The vaccine matter of Vienna has
  succeeded very well : in the course of a few weeks Stulli
 has vaccinated a hundred children ; a great many for this
 country, which in some late years, and particularly in 1802,
 lost a great many children by the natural small-pox.           This
 happy discovery is making great progress among the Dal
  matians and Turks.
>                                                Manheim,  July 28th.
      According  to the last accounts received by Dr. de Carro,
 at Vienna, respecting the progress of vaccination in the
 East Indies, the governor, by a public notice, dated Janu
 ary j 9, 1803, requested the Europeans and natives belonging
 to the presidency of Fort St. George to take advantage of
 this salutary discovery.      It results from the official reports
 of the board of medicine, that from the 1st of September
 1802 to the 30th of April 1804, there were inoculated with
 success 145,840 persons, namely 165 Europeans, 4,141
 Bramins, 41,806 Malabarese, 40,022 Gentoos, 10,926 Ma

              Proposal   for encouraging Vaccination.          281
 The    raja of Tanjore encourages vaccination as much as pos
  sible, and thedewar-of Travancore has himself submitted
  to it.
  PROPOSAL      FOR   ENCOURAGING THE PRACTICE            OF VAC
                               CINATION.
     The great number of persons who have taken the small
  pox in the present year shows plainly that so many have
  not been vaccinated as halh been represented.         Indeed, we
  have long more than suspected that accounts given by
  many practitioners to the public of the number inoculated
  by each of them was not exact.         A practitioner is too apt
  to assume consequence from the long list he produces, and
  this it is makes him apt to plume himself upon the credit
  given to him for the number rather than for the accu
  racy and nQvelty of his observations ; or it induces him to
 strive to swell his list of number, rather than to bestow the
  labour of observation.         Hence too it has happened that
  many persons      have   taken   the small-pox subsequently to
  the practice of such inexact inoculators for the cow-pock.
  It is decisive that the numbers given to the public are ex
  aggerated, not only for the reason just set forth, but he-
 cause the .total united sum from the different lists exceeds
 the sum on any reasonable calculation which the population
 affords to be inoculated.        If we remove a cypher from the
 figures containing the numbers asserted, the sum remain
 ing will be less remote from the most accurate calculation
 of the real number vaccinated : for instance, in some state
 ments, instead of 10,000 say 1,000; for 5,000 say 500, and
 so in proportion.
    The late prevalence of the small-pox has not only led to
 the above remarks, but to the consideration of the means
 of rendering vaccination effectual for extinguishing the
 small-pox.      Supposing that when the cow-pock is duly
 excited, a person has as great a chance of security as after
 due inoculation for the small-pox, it was announced at a
 public meeting — the annual one of the original Vaccine
 Pock Institution, Broad Street, on the 7th February J 803, —
that a plan would be brought forward to show the necessity
of laws for the inoculation of every subject within a cetv
tain period after birth, as well as for the immediate prohi
bition of the inoculation of the small-pox.          It was con
tended that the prohibition of the small-pox inoculation
alone would be inadequate to the purpose of extinguishing
the small-pox ; and it was maintained that it was not more

  283            Proposal   for  encouraging Vaccination,
 cow-pock inoculation universal, than to prohibit, as already
  proposed, the small-pox inoculation*. The same gentle
  man (Dr. Pearson) who made these observations, has lately
  explained to the Vaccine Institution that he had been dis
  couraged     and induced to lay aside his plan,             from the opi
  nion of    a great  number of friends, who almost universally
  disapproved      it as impracticable in the execution, and im
  prudent    for   the   author.    He has accordingly lately pro
  posed    two    things,    by  way     of rendering vaccination less
  liable to failures, and more extensively practised.
      1. That each person Inoculated at the Institution shall
  have a ticket signed by three members of the medical esta-
  Dlishment, attesting that the vaccination has been duly un
  dergone; and that if the person so attested shall subsequent
  ly take the small-pox, such person shall be entitled to ten
 guineas from the Institution.
      2. It is proposed that the medical establishment               f  shall
 grant certificates, which may have the effect of diplomas to
 qualify pupils, by attending the practice and lectures at the
  Institution.
     It is remarkable, and indeed singular, that notwithstand
 ing the Institution has been established near six years, not
 a single authenticated          case of small-pox subsequently to
 the cow-pock        has  occurred   in the practice.
  Of the   inoculation of persons who have undergone the cow-
     pock 30 to 50 years ago; ivith some anecdotes of Farmer
     Jest?/, the Vaccinator of his family in 1774.
     Mr. Benjamin Jesty, farmer, of Downshay, accompanied
 by his son Mr. Robert Jesty, lately visited the Vaccine
 Institution in Broad Street, where he proved, by authen
 tic evidence of various kinds —
     1 . That he took the cow-pock from, his own cows about
 50 years ago, and although he had been often in the way of
 the small-pox, he had remained unsusceptible.                    He has a
 scar on one hand from the cow-pock.
     2. That knowing many instances besides himself of
 persons never taking the small-pox who had taken the
 cow-pock in dairy farms ; and that it was a harmless com
 plaint ; also being of opinion that he should avoid ingraft
 ing diseases of human subjects, such as evil, lues, mad-

               Proposal      for encouraging Vaccination.       SB3
ness,   &c,   by inoculating from the cow, he determined to
prefer vaccination in his own family.       Accordingly, when
the small-pox prevailed in the town and neighbourhood
of Yetminster, in 1774, where he then lived, he inoculated
his wife, Mrs. Jesty, and his two sons Robert and Benja
min, with matter from his cows. Benjamin showed a
large cicatrix, on the middle of the upper arm, left by this
inoculation 31 years ago.       The two sons were inoculated
for the small-pox, without effect, 13 years ago; and they,
asf well as Mr. Jesty, have been often in contact with per
sons in the small -pox in the course of 31 years.       To give
further satisfaction, Mr. Robert Jesty, without hesitation,
agreed to the proposal of being again inoculated while in
town for the small-pox. Accordingly variolous limpid matter
was very carefully inserted by four punctured places in the left
arm, immediately from a child in the 6th day of the erup
tion. Red pimples appeared in the punctured parts the day
after inoculation, which continued for two or three days,
and then died away without any attending pain of the arm
or arm-pit, or any constitutional disorder.
    Mr. Jesty's aversion to the small-pox " humour," as he
called     occasioned him to prefer being tested with vaccine
         it,
matter.     Accordingly he was inoculated in four places in
one arm with matter immediately from          subject in the Qth
                                                 a
day of vaccination.
    The farmer described how much he was censured by his
neighbours for inoculating his family from "            hecsl —
                                                                "
                                                            a
brute creature without any soul           ;"
                                         and he was called          a a
hard-hearted man :" but lie answered that the brutes were
free from many disorders of men         and he saw that " there
                                            ;
were many Christians who were greater brutes than the
cows."
  It    isworthy of notice, all the four parties in the cow-
pock   inoculation  have enjoved an uncommonly good state
of health, and are all athletic subjects. Mr. Jesty, who            is
70 years old,       fresh-looking man, and has the usual ap
                    is   a
pearance   of   man
                a    of fivc-and-fiftv, or at the most of sixty.

                                            is
teeth.
    To gratify the public, and to preserve for posterity this
interesting part of the history of cow-pock inoculation, the
Vaccine institution have had           whole length picture of
                                        a

                                     BOTANY.
    A private individual in the government of Astracan, has
 sent to the Russian minister of the interior the roots and
 leaves of a plant which grows there in great abundance, to
 gether with meal and bread prepared from                      these roots. The
 accompanying memoir states that these                          roots have beeiv
 long used by the Calmucs as food ; that                        the bread made
 from them is wholesome and well tasted ;                      that in case of a
 scarcity, occasioned by a bad crop, it might be employed
 as a  good substitute for common bread, and that the plant
 is easily propagated by seed.
    Further examination has shown that this plant is nothing
 else than the butomus umlellatus,     Linn. ; in English the
jitnuering rusk or water gladiole ; in French lutome a om-
 belle jonce fleuri; in Tartaric sussaiok; in Ostiak russ; in
 Russian sussac, sotschnoj koren.    It grows in every part of
 Europe, in Siberia, and in the neighbourhood of Peters-
 burgh, and particularly in marshes and rivers. The Cal
 mucs roast the roots or dry them, and use them in that
 manner as food.      According to the elder Gmelin, they are
 used also for the same purpose by the Ostiaks and neigh
 bouring people.      In former times a healing power was
 ascribed to this plant.
    Meal has been prepared at Petersburgh from the roots,
 and bread baked of it.    We are informed that the meal in
 kneading has all the properties of common meal. The
 dough rises very easily when leavevi is added to it ; and the
 bread is very little inferior in colour, taste, or smell, to
 wheaten bread ; the only difference          that    is,not so   it    is
 tough, and readily breaks, in consequence of the fine fibres
 of the roots which remain           in
                                   and    it,
                                           has also  little bit
                                                     it            a
terness.
       From all   these facts   itappears that this plant may become
   substitute for corn          and  ifthe bread be as whofesome as
is a
                            ;
    asserted, this discovery deserves the utmost attention,
and particularly      places which do not produce corn, and
                       in
where this vegetable production can be cultivated.
   The minister of the interior has announced this discovery
to the emperor, who was greatly pleased with       and order      it,
ed    present
       a       to be given  to the person who transmitted the
roots to Petersburgh.

accountable defect, which has frequently been objected
to the science of botany, will be in some degree removed
by the new work lately announced by Mr. H. C. Andrews
of Knightsbridge, the merits of whose Botanist's Reposi
tory, and Engravings of Heaths, ire well known.        It is to
be a complete Monograph of the Genus Rosa, and will con

Andrews.
                           LECTURES.
    At  the  Theatre of Anatomy, Blenheim-street,         Great
Marlborough-street,     the Autumnal Course of Lectures on
Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery, will commence on
Tuesday, the first of October, at two o'clock in the after
noon, by Mr. Brookes.
    In these Lectures the structure of the human body will
be demonstrated on recent subjects, and further illustrated
by preparations, and the functions of the different organs
will be explained.
    The surgical operations are performed, and every part of
surgery so elucidated, as may best tend to complete the ope
rating surgeon.
    The art of injecting, and of making anatomical prepara
tions, will be taught practically.
    Gentlemen zealous in the pursuit of zoology will meet
with uncommon opportunities of prosecuting their re
 searches in comparative anatomy.
    Surgeons in the army and navy may be assisted in re
newing their anatomical knowledge, and every possible, at
tention will be paid to their accommodation as well as in
struction.
    Anatomical Converzationes will be held weekly, when
 the different subjects treated of will be discussed familiarly,
 and the students' views forwarded. — To these none but
 pupils can be admitted.
    Spacious apartments, thoroughly ventilated, and replete
 with every convenience, will be open in the morning for
 the purposes of dissecting and injecting; where Mr. Brookes,
 attends to direct the students, and demonstrate the various
 parts as they appear on dissection.
    An extensive Museum, containing preparations illustra
 tive of every part of the human body, and its diseases, ap
 pertains to the Theatre, to which students will have occa-
 »ional admittance. — Gentlemen inclined to support this

 school by contributing preternatural or morbid parts, sub
jects in natural history, &c. (individually of little value to
 the possessors,) may have the pleasure of seeing them pre
served, arranged, and registered, with the names of the donors.
    The inconveniences usually attending anatomical inves
tigations are counteracted by an antiseptic process, the re
 sult of experiments made by Mr. Brookes on human sub
jects at Paris in the year 1782; the account of which was
delivered to the Royal Society, and read on the 17th of June
 1794.    This method has since been so far improved, that
 the florid colour of the muscles is preserved,       and even
 heightened. — Pupils may be accommodated in the house.—
 Gentlemen established in practice, desirous of renewing
 their anatomical knowledge, may be accommodated with
 an apartment to dissect in privately.
    The first Monday in October next will commence a
 Course of Lectures on Physic and Chemistry at the Labo
 ratory in Whitcomb-street,       at the usual morning hours,
 viz. ou Therapeutics at a quarter before eight, on the
 Practice of Physic at half after eight, and on Chemistry
 at a quarter after nine o'clock.
    These Lectures are delivered every morning, except on
 Saturdays,    when at nine o'clock a Clinical Lecture is
given   on the  cases of Dr. Pearson's patients in St. George's
 Hospital.

                      TRAVELS IN AFRICA.
    By letters received, we learn that the celebrated traveller
 Mungo Parke, with his companions Messrs. Anderson and
 Scott, who sailed from Portsmouth in the Crescent trans
 port, about six months ago, having touched at the islands
 of St. Jago and Goree, arrived at Kayay, on the river Gam
 bia, on the 14th of April, whence they were to proceed in
 a few days into the interior of Africa, to effect the business
 on which they were dispatched, and which we believe to be
 of a very important and extensive nature. The heat was at
 that time so excessive, that the thermometer was constantly
 at ] 00 degrees and upwards in the shade, and for two or
 three hours after .sunset continued at from 82 to 92 de
 grees.    We are happy, however, to hear that notwith
 standing this excess of heat the whole party had enjoyed
 perfect health : they ;iad only lost one of the fifty men they
 had received from the African corps at Goree, though
 they had been above fourteen days in the river ; and this
  man had been unwell before they left the island.
     Mr. Seetzen, another traveller, arrived on the 4th of
  March at Aleppo; but intended in fourteen days to set
  out for Damascus, whence he was to proceed through
  Egypt to the interior parts of Africa.

      on Colours, and several of their singular Appearances."

      French NatiorChl Institute, Fentose 13, An 13.                 By
      C. A.   Prjeur*.
   J.  he author of this memoir          endeavours      to account for
  several    phasnomena   which appear to him not to have been
  before properly explained : or, rather, his object is to give
  a general theory, by the help of which all the cases of co
 loured appearances, and even the most singular, may be
 referred to certain principles.
      He sets out from known opinions in regard to the diffe
  rent kinds of luminous rays; on the mixture resulting from
  several of these rays taken at different places of the solar
  spectrum, and among others on that very remarkable case
 when the rays are so chosen that their union produces on
 the organ of sight the sensation of whiteness, even if two
 kinds of rays only be employed.
      For these ideas we are indebted to the discoveries of the
 immortal Newton; and they flow immediately from the
 method which he proposed for determining what colour
 will be obtained from the mixture of any given quantities
 of other colours.
      If we are desirous of comprehending fully what takes
 place in the vision of colours, it is first indispensably ne
 cessary that we should be familiarised with knowing the
 shades composed of different simple rays, and with forming
correct ideas of black and white, and the complication which
they produce in coloured appearances ; and in particular to
 make ourselves acquainted with the correspondence of co
 lours, which, taken two and two in a certain order, are sus
ceptible of forming, by their union, white or any other
complex shade at pleasure.
     Two colours which have this kind of relation are called
complementary colours ; one of them being given, the de
termination of the other may be made, with more or less
precision, by experience, calculation, or mere reasoning ;
and the consideration of them may be applied with much
utility to a great number of cases, as will be seen hereafter.
     Several details are here given, which those versed in
optics, or habitually acquainted with the mixture of co
lours, may readily supply : besides, the rest of the me-

200                Considerations on Colours,
moir, of which     we have undertaken to give an account,
will afford us    an opportunity or mentioning what will be
most necessary for ..iiderstanding the subject.
   These preliminary observations are followed by some re
marks on contrasts. The author employs this, word to
characterize the effect of the simultaneous vision of two
substances    of different colours when brought together
under certain circumstances.        The contrast here, then, is a
comparison,    from   which   there   results a sensation of some
difference, great    or  small.    It   is very generally known,
and painters know it well, that a, coloured matter which
occupies a pretty extensive space, and brought near to, or
surrounded by, some othfer colour, has not the same appear
ance as when it has near it other colours.           But whence
docs this difference arise ?
   Before we answer this question, let us make an essential
distinction.    It either relates to homogeneous colours, that
is to say, formed of one kind of rays, or to complex colours,
arising from a mixture of heterogeneous rays, that is to say,
composed of different sorts.
   In regard to the first case, it must be confessed that we
are ignorant whether the bringing together different simple
colours would produce any alteration in their respective
appearance.     As one can rarely enjoy the sight of such
colorations, and as it is not easy to dispose of thein to our
wish, no experiments have yet been made on their contrasts.
This subject, however, deserves to be studied.
   In regard to the cases of compound colours, (which is
that of almost all the natural or artificial bodies, as the au
thor shows in the sequel of his memoir,) the new colours
manifested by the contrast are always conformable to the
shade which would be obtained by suppressing from the
colour proper to one of the bodies, the rays analogous to
the colour of the other body.
   Thus, if we place on red paper a small slip of paper
painted of an orange colour, it will appear almost yellow.
Removed then to yellow pa;;cr, the same orange slip will
become almost red. " After this, if it be put upon violet pa
per, it will resume a yellowish shade, but different from the
preceding; and, in the last place, applied to green paper
it will assume a new degree of a red colour.
   The explanation of these examples according to the pro
posed rule is easy, if we suppose that the orange colour of
the small slip observed arises (as is commonly the case)
from an union of all the kinds of rays except the blues.
   A multitude of combinations of colours placed thus
                                                            above

             and several    of tlieir singular Appearances.             291
 above each other produce the colour of contrast indicated
 by the rule here given; but there are several circumstances
 which render the effect of it more striking, or modify the
  result.
     It  sometimes      depends on the degree of the brightness
 with which        the observed bodies are affected : they may be
 uniformly illuminated, or one of them more than the rest.
 The quantity of light which has entered simultaneously into
 the eye by the whole field of vision has also an influence*
 If  the bodies consist of several rows, like a series of decreas
 ing circles placed one within the other, the colours of each
 will re-act respectively on each other. At each junction
 there will be on both sides a border coloured by the con
 trast of the neighbouring body : these borders will extend
 more or less according to the splendour of the objects. The
 effect of one may become dull, or extinguish all the rest.
    The colours of contrast show themselves also with more
vivacity after some moments of observation, or if the ob
jects have been agitated a little, as if to make them move
slowly over the retina.           It would appear that a certain fa
tigue    of the   eye, either instantaneous       in regard to the inten
sity   of the   light,  or  more   slowly by prolonged vision, con
curs to produce the appearances in question.                    But exces
 sive fatigue of that organ would occasion a degeneration of
 the colours belonging to another mode.
    We ought not, then, to refer to contrasts those impres
sions mentioned by Epinus, which are propagated in the
eye with a certain duration and a particular period of shades,
when one has looked with intensity at a very brilliant light,
 such as that of the sun.
    But the colours called by Buffbn accidental, and respect
ing which Scherfer has given an interesting memoir, belong
to the class of contrasts, or at least constantly follow the
same law.
    Coloured shadows are also a phenomenon of the same
kind. Count Rumford has placed this truth beyond all
doubt in two memoirs, in which he has treated this subject
in an interesting manner*.
    The author of that which we here analyse is of opinion,
that we must ascribe also to contrasts those appearances of
the solar light received through a hole in a coloured cur
tain, which general Meusnier remarked in consequence of
their singularity.        He assimilates to this also several cases-
of colours exhibited by opals, or more generally by bodies
       •

6og                 Considerations on Colours,
containing sensibly opake parts disseminated throughout a
pellucid substance.   By the same reasons he explains the
colours under which the grayish dust collected by age on
old paper or coloured stuffs shows itself, and deduces the
same consequences    in regard to the blueish appearance of
the veins of the human body.
   He proposes, likewise, a new method of rendering very
sensible the colours of contrasts more lively even than by
the known process of accidental colours, and yet without
occasioning extraordinary fatigue to the eye.    The latter
condition is of importance, for it is known that it is dan
gerous to expose to forced exercise an organ so delicate as
the eye.
   This method consists simply (when one is in an apart
ment and in the open light) in placing before the window
the painted pieces of paper on which you intend to observe
the contrasts, as in the example before mentioned.           As the
coloured paper, then, which serves as a field has a semi-
transparency, and by these means is more illuminated,
while the small band of another colour placed over it            on  is,
account of the double thickness, more opake and in the
shade  ;   the colour arising from the contrast becomes thus
more striking.
  It   isthis disposition which produces the singularly strik
ing  effect  of the contrast of small piece of white card ap
                                  a
plied successively to paper, glass, or stuff of any colour
whatever. When the transparent body                 red, the opake
                                                     is

                                           is
                                      ;
blue  if  the ground be orange    j then of     sort of violet on
                                                 a                         a
yellow ground,      or green  on crimson,   &c.    always accord
                                                     ;
ing  to  the   exact correspondence   of the   complementary    co
lours.
  It   ishere to be observed, that according to the rule in
dicated,    if from the white which        formed
                                            is            by
                                                         the union
of all the coloured rays we suppress, for example, the red
rays, the remaining bundle ought to be seen under the co
lour of     a verv pale blueish green     but as the small white
                                          is ;
                                         in the shade, the black
piece in the preceding experiment
which results from      it may be of the degree proper for de
stroying the effect of the white, and then the blueish green
appears of      abright shade.    The same reasoning         appli
                                                               is
cable to the cases of all the other colours.
   To produce well the effects here announced, in repeating
these experiments,      it  necessary, when the opportunity of
                             is
clear weather has been obtained, to guard against the reflec
tions of neighbouring bodies, and against double contrasts.
                                                                    Thus,

           and several of their singular appearances.          2Q3
Thus, when     the bright light conveyed through a window
surrounds the transparent paper, it may increase very sensibly
the splendour of the colour of contrast, or injure it by pro
ducing another shade according to the colours of the bodies
subjected to observation.      In a word, one may always re
move this inconvenience by concealing the troublesome
objects by a piece of black pasteboard or stuff, or by look
ing through a blackened tube which confines the field of
sight to the extent necessary.
   This knowledge of contrasts may be applied with great
advantage    to those arts which have a relation to colours.
The painter knows that one cannot be placed indifferently
in the neighbourhood of another. But when one knows
the law to which their re-action is subject, one knows bet
ter what must be avoided or done to increase the splendour
of the colour which it is necessary to heighten : a successive
comparison of them furnishes also valuable indications in
regard to their nature or their composition.          This is what
                                                                   "
the author himself put in practice with advantage in his
manufactory of colours and paper-hangings.
   These considerations in regard to contrasts led him to
the examination of a very singular case proposed and treated
of by Monge with his usual sagacity*; namely, the white
appearance under which a coloured body is sometimes seen
when viewed through a piece of glass of the same colour ;
some uncertainty remained in regard to the circumstances
really necessary for producing this effect.         The author de
termines them by the help of his particular experiments,
and enumerates those which have a favourable influence, or
the contrary.     He concludes that, when one experiences
the sensation of whiteness in these cases, it arises merely
from the action of contrasts, by which the impression of the
colour is lessened or annulled, while that of a certain bright
ness still exists, and* is remarked by the opposition of a
greater degree of obscurity.        This manner of considering
the subject leads to a new definition of whiteness, in which
there is certainly nothing-repugnant : white to us is the sen
sation of light when no particular colour predominates or is
perceived.
   In the subsequent part    of his memoir the author employs
himself in particular with the coloration of different opake
or transparent bodies ; that is to say, he endeavours to dis
cover what are those luminous rays which any coloured
 body is really susceptible of reflecting or transmitting.

29-1                    Considerations on Colours,
    His means of making experiments are simple. If the
body be opake, it is. placed on a piece of black stuff" in order
to be observed with the prism.     He endeavours to give it a
rectangular form ; or, if it is not susceptible of being cut,
it is covered with a piece of black pasteboard pierced with
a hole of that form. The coloured fringes, then, manifested
on the two opposite edges indicate the kind of rays which
are reflected, and consequently those which are absorbed
when the nature of the illuminating.bundle is known; on
which it is still to be remarked that, as the fringes them
selves are of complex shades, we must separate the simple
kinds.    When a p< rson has had some practice, a bare in
spection will be sufficient. He may be formed to this habit,
 and the want of it may be supplied by guiding himself by
 cards representing each kind of rays placed over each other
in order, removing them gradually agreeably to the different
refrangibility ; or he may employ a plate or board, con
 structed according to Newton's method, for determining
 the shades composed of different elementary colours.
    If the body subjected to examination be diaphanous, it
will be proper to view it through the aperture of the card
 before spoken of, in order to exclude extraneous light, in
 such a manner that the prism may show the fringes. Also,
by placing yourself in the dark, a flame such as that of a
wax taper will show through the transparent body, and,
by the help of the prism, a series of coloured images corre
 sponding to the rays transmitted.          '
    By proceeding in this manner, the author found that
many opake bodies which he had at hand of different kinds
and of all colours, either yellow, orange, or red ; or green,
blue, or violet, were indebted for their coloured appearance
to the following conditions :
    1st, Each of the bodies always absorbs rays of the com
plementary kind of the prevailing colour.
    2d, The absorption, in regard to some of them, compre
hends, besides the complementary kind, other rays colla
teral to that species, and more or less numerous.
    3d, The darker the same colour           the fewer kinds of
                                              ip,
reflected   rays   it   presents.
  It must here be understood that we do not allude to
mixed colours, but only to those which form a homoge
neous compound or       real combination, according to the
                                a
meaning attached           by
                      chemists to that word.         It
                                                     also to
                                                          is
be remarked, that we must not confound the colour reflected
from the interior of the moleculae susceptible of bright or
dark shades with the light sent back from the anterior sur

less the proper colour, it                  is,
                                 however, easy to lessen the
effects of it, and to distinguish them in experiments.
   Another remark proper to be made                         is,
                                          that the expression
predominating colour ought not to signify that the rays of
that colour are more abundant than the rest this would be         :
an error.    Several kinds of ravs may co-exist in the bundle
which produces the colour, without any kind being, on
that account, more abundant.          Strictly speaking, all the
elements of the bundle are dissimilar, and consequently
none of them        in greater quantity.
                         is                 But the general tone
of the colour remains analogous to that of the rays distin

to retain this expression, provided an exaggerated significa
tion be not given to it.
    The author observed also transparent bodies, such as
glass of different colours, and liquors contained            flask         in   a
having two broad parallel faces.        By these he found law                    a
of absorption similar to that of opake bodies, but still more
striking, and without any ambiguity.
    This law     constantly regular.

density and thickness.            also determined
                                       It   is          the light      by
of the illumiuating body, either in regard to its force, or to
 the two kinds of rays which compose it.
    The absorption always begins with the rays most opposite
to the predominating colour of the illuminated body.                                  It
continues           by
                those which are next in the order indicated
 by  the spectrum.       thus extends gradually, and never by
                              It
jumps, to the last kind consequently the body becomes
                                       :
more and more obscure, and always terminates                being           by
black.     Sometimes       extends from one side only of the
                                  it

                    it
 from the right and left, or         advancing more rapidly on
                                                  by
one   of the sides.
   If  each element be separately varied, there will be in the
effects    peculiar progression. That depending on the densi
           a
ties  isnot always similar to that arising from the changes
of thickness. By receiving also on the same body different
kinds of light, the progress of the absorption      differently       is
modified, and consequently the colours changed.
   The author quotes examples of all these cases. He de
rives them from the numerous experiments which he made
with coloured glass, with acid or alkaline metallic solu
tions, with the liquid tinctures of infusions or vegetable

1 296                Considerations on Colours,
   decoctions.    They exhibited curious peculiarities; but we
   shall not detail them, both for the sake of brevity, and be
  cause they may be easily tried.
      In short, very important consequences in regard to the
  reciprocal action of bodies and light arise from the whole
  of these observations, and perhaps they will throw some
  light on the grand question of the cause to which their per
  manent colours ought to be ascribed.
      After these researches the author concludes with an exa
  mination of different phoenomena of various kinds.         He
  indicates the modifications experienced in their coloration
  by burning coals at different degrees of incandescence. His
  remarks are applicable also to other bodies, such as iron in
  a state of ignition, or a long series of reverberated lamps
  seen during foggy weather, or a white light seen through a
  piece of glass Dlackened by progressive strata of smoke.
 In all these cases, the colours necessarily pass through a
  series of shades, which proceed from white to yellow, to
 orange and to red, more and more dark; the reason of which
 he explains.
     Metallic oxides have also a gradation of shades according
 to the proportion of oxygen.       A certain continued altera
 tion in vegetation produces one in some of the parts of
 plants.    The arts or chemical processes present one also
 under a multitude of circumstances.
     The manufacturer may, with advantage, derive from them
 indications either' in regard to the progress of combinations,
 or to enable him to judge of the moment proper for per
 forming certain operations of his labours'.
     The author then dwells more particularly on the appear
 ance of the coloured clouds, and especially those seen near
 the time of the rising and setting of the sun. This phe
 nomenon, so generally known, had hitherto never been ex
 plained, though the ablest philosophers had made it an ob
ject of their research.
     It does not arise from the refraction of the rays of the
 sun, but the successive absorption of these rays when they
 strike the lower parts of the atmosphere and those most
 charged with vapours.
     This absorption follows laws analogous to those already
mentioned. As the quantity of the vapours, and even their
nature, are not similar for two days in succession, this irre
gularity produces corresponding differences in their effects.
     In general, the first rays attacked by these vapours are
blue approaching to violet.       Soon after, they absorb the
contiguous rays, gaining with more rapidity the blues pro
                                                           perly

            and several of their singular Appearances.        297
 perly so called, then the greens and yellows, and continuing
 thus to the red : hence the yellowish, orange, and red co
 lours, under which the clouds appear.           This period of
 shades, namely, the evening, manifests itself gradually in
 proportion as the sun approaches the horizon. Terrestrial
 objects, the part of the air near the sun, and even that lu
 minary itself, are tinged with the same shades.       When his
 rays can be received on a prism, it is seen that the rays
 really absorbed correspond to the general coloration of the
 moment.
     In consequence of the successive increase and density of
 the vapours traversed by the light, clouds differently placed
 must at the same instant be tinged of different colours.
 The highest maybe white, while the rest, at a less elevation,
 will be yellow, and others still lower will be proportionally
 redder. At an equal elevation, the most distant from the
 point where the sun sets will incline to red, and the nearest
 to yellow.
     One may then see on bodies naturally white, blue or
 green shadows, as Buffon atid other philosophers have re
 marked.      They are only, as has been already said, the
 effect of the contrast of tjie actual colour of the illuminated,
 and the obscure part.
     Contrasts may also, render complex the colour of the
 clouds ; for example, when a great portion of the heavens
 shows a blue colour.       There are some the colour of which
 arises merely from this cause, and some are observed some
 times during the day by those who are on a high mountain,
 or in any other situation which secures the eye from the too
 strong direct or reverberated action of the solar light ; but
 in this case the clouds have only a yellowish shade, exactly
 of the complementary colour of the sky-blue.
    It is under a similar colour that the moon is sometimes
seen, when she is very high, a little before or after the sun
has passed the horizon.        It seems, also, that she appears
thus,   or even altogether  white,  when there exist at the same
time in the atmosphere clouds variously coloured by the
vapours of the east or the west.       By this concourse of cir
cumstances we have a new proof of the difference of the
causes to which these colorations are owing.
    We must remark, in the last place, that by the irregu
larity of terrestrial localities, and the state of the atmo
sphere, these phaenomena       may be concealed, or subject to
different interruptions.     In our climates, the coloration of
the clouds for the most part does not attain to its utmost
term. On. certain evenings, however, if the sky is very se-

                          CONCLUSION.
     Notwithstanding the many fine discoveries already made
 in regard to light, the theory of the production of colours
 has not yet acquired that generality which renders it appli
 cable to all cases, and to that simplicity of principles to
 which we are always conducted when we discover the real
 laws of nature. Many phaenomena' have never been ex
 plained ; and the explanation given to several necessarily
 requires to be rectified.    The author proposes to establish
 changes in theory, the want of which he points out.         He
 founds his reasoning partly on the doctrine and facts gene
 rally admitted, and partly on other information less diffused,
 though* long known, and on his own observations. But he
 is far from flattering himself with the idea of having pre
 sented these objects properly in a sketch such as this me
 moir. He even was soon sensible that a subject so exten
 sive and complex would require more time and labour.
     To fill up many vacuities, to develop several points, and
to rectify and extend others by researches, new experi
ments, and profound reflection, — such is the ample task of
improvement.       If his health and occupations permit, he
 will endeavour to undertake it.
     It would be of utility, and also just, to give at the same
time a short account of what we are indebted to the great
Newton, who opened this career in so admirable a manner,
and to the philosophers who have discovered new points,
and removed difficulties.      Greater precision ought also to
be employed in the language relating to colours, proportioned
to the increase of our knowledge, and the present state of
science and the arts. In a word, it would not be too much,
in such a branch of science, to add the resources of calcula
tion and geometry to all the riches of experience, and, if
possible, to the advantages of the best method.

XLIV.       On the Variations of the Terrestrial Magnetism

J.   he calculation is as follows : — T suppose that the point B
(fig. 3.) is the north   magnetic pole or the earth, and that
the point A is the south magnetic pole :       suppose also that  I
there is in the point M, at the surface of the earth, a mo-
lecula of the austral fluid which is attracted by B and re
pelled by A in the inverse ratio of the square of the di
stance;     and                     be the direction of the
                     I require what will
power resulting   from these two forces acting on that mole-
cula.   It is evident that this direction wilt be that also
which would be assumed in the point M by the needle of
a compass treely suspended : for, in consequence of the
smallness of the needle in comparison of the radius' of the
earth, the lines drawn from its points to one centre, Bor A,
may be considered as parallel, especially if the points A
and    B    are near the centre            of   the earth ;           which   is the case
with nature, as may be seen.
   I shall first suppose that the earth has a spherical figure,
and that the two poles A and B are .equal in force; I shall
then examine how far the latter supposition agrees with the
results observed.
   Let AM then = D', BM = D, CP = x; PM = w,
the angle MCP = a, CA = CB=n, and I shall make
a = Kr; r being equal to the radius of the earth, and K a
constant but indeterminate quantity.
   Let X,Y, also be the forces which attract M in a direc
tion parallel to the axes of the co-ordinates, and /3 the angle
which the resulting force makes with the axis ABC.
   We shall first have the following equations, in which
F is the magnetic force, at a distance equal to unity.

   These equations determine the direction of the magnetic
needle in regard to each point M, the distance of which
from the magnetic equator is known ; but it is seen that
this direction depends on the quantity K, which represents
the distance of the magnetic centres from the centre of the
earth : this distance being expressed in parts of the terres
trial radius, we must therefore first determine this quantity
from observations.
   To do it in the manner of approximation, and thus ac
quire a first idea of the value of K, I have chosen an obser
vation made by M. Humboldt at Carichana in 7'2978° (6°
34' 5") of north latitude counted from the terrestrial equa
tor, and 78-111° (70° 18') west longitude reckoned from
                                                                      the

                          in different Latitudes.                       301
the meridian of Paris; which gives 16-526° (14° 5^ 25")
of latitude counted from the magnetic equator, and 53-7300*
(48° 21' 53") of west longitude proceeding from the node
formed by that equator with the equator of the earth. The
inclination of the magnetic needle was observed in that
place by M. Humboldt in the month of Messidor, year 8,
and found to be equal to 33*78° of the centigrade division*.
A comparison of this result, with the other observations
of M. Humboldt, shows that it may be indeed considered
as agreeing to that latitude.
    To make use of it I have successively given to K different
values in the formula : I have calculated the inclinations
resulting from that latitude ; and, comparing these results
 with that which M. Humboldt really observed, the progress
 of the errors naturally led me to the most proper supposi
 tion. The following is a table of these trials :
       Values of K.          Inclination, of the Needle.      Error*.
       K=       l                       T 73°                 2604°
        K   = 0-6                      18-80                  14-97
        K   = 0-5                     22-04                   11-73
        K = 0-2                       29-38                     439
        K = o-l                       30-64                     313
        K   •=  o-ol                  31-04                     2-73
        K = o-ool                     3107                      fi-7
     The first value of K would place the centre of the mag
 netic forces at the surface of the earth and the poles of the
 magnetic equator.           It is seen that this supposition cannot
 be admitted, because it would give an increase of inclina
 tion much less rapid than that indicated by observations.
 The case is the same with the following results, which
  place the centres of action on the terrestrial radius at
 different distances from the centre of the earth': but it is
 seen also, in general, that they approach more and more to
  the truth in proportion as this distance becomes less; which
  evidently shows that the two centres of action of the mag
  netic forces are situated near the centre of the earth. All
  the other observations of M. Humboldt would also lead to
  the same consequence.
     The most proper supposition would be to make K null,
  or so small that it would be needless to pay attention to it ;
  which amounts to the same thing as to consider the two
  centres of action placed, as we may say, in the same mo-
  lecula. The result, indeed, obtained in this manner is the
 -most exact of all ; it is equal to 31-0843° : this value is still
     * All the measures of inclination which I have given in this memoir will
  be expressed, like those of M. Humboldt! in decimal parts of a quadrant.
                                                                      a little

 302                Variations   of the Terrestrial Magnetism
 a little loss          than that which M. Humboldt observed, and
 the difference is equal to -•69; but it must be considered
 also that the formula from which we derive these values
 supposes the position of the magnetic equator to be per
 fectly determined ; but it may not he so with the utmost
 exactness, according to the onlv two observations of Lapey-
 rouse and Humboldt, which we have employed. It is there
fore by studying the progress of the formula, and comparing
it with the observations, that we are able to appreciate it
justly; after which we may think of remedying the small
errors with \\ hich it may be accompanied.
    To obtain the result I have here mentioned, and which
is-, as it were, the limit of all those which may be obtained
by giving to K different values, it is to be remarked that
the quantity

becomes                     when     K    is   null, but                by    applying        to   it   the
methods of known quantities                          it    will     be found that its value
in this supposition              is   really determinate and equal to                                     .

ot the terrestrial surface; but by
                                      calculating from this for
mula the inclination for the different latitudes, I
                                                          have found
precisely the same numbers as M. Humboldt observed either
in Europe or in America : and it is not his
                                                observations only
that are represented in this manner ; but those
                                                         which have
been made in Russia, and at Kola in
                                            Lapland, during the
last transit of Venus, are also comprehended under
                                                            the same
law.     This is' proved by the table annexed to this
                                                            memoir
in which I have calculated the observations of
                                                          Mallet and
Pictet, ,with a part of those of M. Humboldt, which
                                                                I took
at random, but, however, in such a manner as
                                                      to include all
the rest in the intervals.
    It is seen that the results of the formula deviate very
                                                                  little
from the observations; but these differences
                                                 may be rendered
still smaller.    By examining, indeed, the progress of the
errors, it is seen that the numbers given
                                              by calculation are a
little too small in America for the low latitudes,
                                                          and a little
too great for the high latitudes ; which shows that
                                                           the whole
may be allowed, with some slight modifications,
                                                            either by
changing, however little, the node and inclination of
                                                                     the
magnetic equator, which two observations cannot
                                                           determine
with the utmost exactness, or by
                                         displacing ever so little
our small magnet, leaving, however, its centre
                                                        in the plane
of the magnetic equator, and placing it in such a
                                                              manner
that it shall be a little nearer America than
                                                    Europe         It is
by the observations themselves, when we shall have a greater
number, that we must be guided in these small
                                                               correc
tions
    In a word, it must not be expected that we can represent
in a rigorous manner, by a mathematical
                                                  law, all the in
clinations observed ; for the phenomenon of the
                                                         inclination
though more regular than the other magnetic effects, is not
tree from some anomalies : this
                                     may be easily seen on con
structing the curve given by the observations themselves.
 I hus, tor example, the inclination observed at Popavan
                                                                       is
0 10 greater than at St. Carlos del Rio
                                                  Negro, thoueh
the magnetic latitude of the latter is 0-6852°
                                                    (3*7') greater
The case is the same with observations made
                                                      at Javita and
Santa- Fe. Other anomalies are discovered in
                                                      the compara
tive progress of the observations and
                                           formula.       This is the
case in regard to Carichana, St. Thomas de
                                                   la Guyane, and
Carthagena.       The increase of the inclination from
                                                              the first
to the second of these points is by no
                                              means in harmony
with the increase from the second to the
                                                third ; and if we
                                                             compare

  304          Variations    of t fie Terrestrial Magnetism
 compare together the intensities observed in these dif
 ferent places, the anomalies they exhibit announce in
 some measure those which the inclination ought to ex
 perience.
     The cause of these anomalies becomes evident from what
 has been already remarked ; they are merely the effect of
 local circumstances, and arise from the small systems of
 attraction by which the general phaenomena are modified.
 This must be sensible in particular for that part of America
 which M. Humboldt travelled over, and which is traversed
 throughout its whole length. by the grand chain of the Cor
 dillera of the Andes.           It is also in these places that the
most considerable differences exist. Popayan, for example,
 is situated near the volcanoes of Sotara and Pourace ; it is
joined to basaltic mountains abounding with magnetic iron.
 Near Sulumito, to the east of Popayan, these basaltic co
 lumns have very striking poles : in like manner Mexico is
 situated at the height of 1 160 toises on the ridge of the
 grand cordillera of Lenschiitlan : the ground there is co
vered with porous basaltes and amygdaloids, which are
 almost all charged with magnetic iron.             Must not all these
 causes have a sensible influence on the inclination of the
magnetic needle ; and must not the different dispositions of
the ferruginous masses, or their change of slate, in conse-                •
 quence of the action of nature, produce also variations ?
M. Humboldt made on this point a decisive observation :
the earthquake of the 4th of November 1 799 changed at
 Cumana the inclination of the needle.             On the 1st of No
vember it was 43° 65' j on the 7th it was only 42° 75' ; and
ten months after it returned to 42° 85' : but it did not re
gain its former value ; the intensity of the magnetic force
was not changed by the effect of this earthquake.
    It is proved, then, by these observations, that local cir
cumstances may have on the inclination a sensible influ
ence ; and this influence is remarked in the countries tra
versed by M. Humboldt*.
    It appears, therefore, that the mathematical hypothesis
which we have employed really expresses the law of nature
at least to the north of the magnetic equator ; for, though the
first results observed towards the south seem to bend to it also,
the uncertainty t-inder which we are in regard to the true
cause of these phenomena must stop our conjectures, and

                 us from extending too far the consequences of the
     Iirevent
       aw's which we observe*.
      • From the
                      preceding results, we may calculate the points
'
    where the axis of the magnetic equator pierces the terres-
    trial surface; for their latitudes are equal to the comple
     ments of the obliquity of that equator, and their meridian is
    at 100* of longitude from its nodes.               The north magnetic
    pole     is found  also at  97'7975° (79° l'4") of north latitude,
    and at SS'STIQ0 (30° & 5") of longitude west from Paris,
    which places it to the north of America.                The other mag
    netic pole, symmetric to the preceding, is situated in the
    same latitude south, and at 66-6281° (149° 67' 55") of lon
    gitude east from Paris, which places it amidst the eternal
    ice : indications entirely analogous to those of Wilke and
    Lemonnier.
         If we could reach these poles, the compass would be seen,
    vertical ; but if any confidence can be placed in the law
    which we have discovered, this would be the only difference
    which would be observed in regard to the inclination, and
    we should be still as far distant as in Europe from the real
    centres which produce it.            This result might appear to be
    of such a nature as to diminish the interest one might have
    in visiting these horrid regions, had we not also the hope of
    discovering there new phaenomena in regard to the inten
    sity of the magnetic force, and the influence of meteors.
         These consequences         do not entirely accord with the
    opinion pretty generally received, and which ascribes the
    increase of the magnetic effects towards the north to the
              quantity of iron dispersed throughout these regions ;
   freat
       ut it appears to us that this opinion is not agreeable to the
   truth.        The cordillera of the Andes contains an enormous
   quantity of magnetic iron : the native iron of Chaco, that
   problematic mass analogous to that of Pallas, and those of
   Xacateras in Mexico, is found even under the tropics f.
        * Since thu
                    memoir was read, we can advance something more positive.
  Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, and New Hol
   land, by different navigators, are very exactly represented by our formula ;
   and it follows, that it extends also to the austral hemisphere. We hope
   soon to have numerous and very exact observations on the inclination of
  the needle in that part of the earth. But we have thought it our duty to
  add to our table such results as relate to it, and which we have been able
  to procure.      We have inserted also two observations on the intensity, made
  with great care by M.Rossel, during the expedition of d'Entrecasteaux, which
  #re very important, as they .prove that the terrestrial magnetic force in
  creases also in the austral hemisphere in proportion as one removes from the
  equator. — Note by the Authors of the Memoir.
       f We may now add to the preceding considerations this decisive fact, that
  the intensity also increases when one approaches the south pole. — Note by
  the Avthen of the Memoir.
        Vol. 22. No. 88. Sept. 1805.            U                           On

306         Variations  of the Terrestrial Magnetism
   On seeing    the inclinations of the compass so exactly re
presented    in  our hypothesis, we endeavoured     to discover
whether it could he applied also to the intensities observed
by Ml Humboldt ; but we found that it did not apply. It
gives, indeed, an increase of the magnetic forces from
the equator to the pole ; but this increase, which at first
is too slow, becomes afterwards too rapid : I have not yet
been able to try whether the small displacement of the ter
restrial magnet will contribute towards representing them
better : but it must be remarked, that the series of the inr
tensities is extremely whimsical, and contains an infinite
number of anomalies ; so that local phenomena may have
on this phenomenon a much more sensible influence than
on the inclination.
   On reviewing the results which we have given in this.
memoir, it is seen that we have first determined the posi
tion of the magnetic equator by direct observations, which
bad never been done, before ; we have then proved that the
magnetic force increases in proceeding from that equator to
the poles : in the last place, we have given a mathematical
hypothesis, which when reduced to a formula satisfies all the
inclinations hitherto observed.
   Supposing, as we have done in this formula, the small
corrections of which it is susceptible, its utility becomes
evident, either for making known, in the course of time, the
variations which may take place in the action of the terres
trial magnetism, or to ascertain or even foresee the value of
the inclination, which in a great many cases is of great im
portance.
    For example, near the magnetic equator, the increase or
diminution of the inclination will indicate to a vessel on a
voyage whether she has gained or lost in latitude by cur
rents. This knowledge of the latitude is sometimes as im
portant as that of longitude.        On the coasts of Peru, for
example,    the  currents tend  from  Chiloe to the north and
north-east with such force, that one may go from Lima to
Guayaquil in three or four days, and two, three, and some
times five months are necessary to return.         It is conse-
          of the greatest importance for vessels coming from
?uently
  !hili which stretch along the coast of Peru, to know their
latitude.     If they go beyond the port to which they are
bound they must work to the southward, and every day's
progress requires often a month of return.      Unfortunately*
the fogs which prevail during four or five months on the
coasts of Peru prevent navigators from distinguishing the
form of the coast : nothing is seen but the summits of the
                                                         Andes,

                      in different Latitudes,                 -.  307
  Andes, and that of the peaks which rise above that stratum
 of   vapours ; but the figure of it is so uniform that pilots
 fall into mistakes. They often remain twelve or fifteen days
 without seeing the sun or the stars, and during that interval
 they come to anchor, being afraid of overshooting their port :
 but if we suppose that the inclination of the magnetic
 needle in the ports to the south of Lima is known, for
 example at Chancay, Huaura, and Santa, the dipping needle
 will show whether it be, in regard to Lima, to the south or
 the north.     It will show at the same time opposite what
 point of the coast a vessel is ; and this indication will be
 attended with more exactness than one could hope for, be
 cause in these seas the inclination varies with extraordinary
 rapidity.     M. Humboldt, to whom we are indebted for
 these remarks, observed in these seas the following values t,
       Places.            South Latitut^s.          Inclinations.
     Huancey          -        10° 4f         -          6,80»
     Huaura           -        II   3         -          9,00
     Chancay          -        11   33        -        10,35
    These observations prove that the errorof three or four
degrees in the inclination in these seas would produce but a
 degree of error in latitude; and, on account of the tranquil
lity of the Pacific Ocean, the inclination may be observed
to within a degree nearly.        Frequent instances of such re
sults may be seen in books of voyages.         In like manner, it
one knew exactly the inclination at the mouth of the Rio de
la Plata, it would be very useful to navigators, who, when
the Pamperos blow, remain fifteen or eighteen days without
seeing the heavenly bodies, and go on different tacks for
fear of losing the parallel of the mouth of that river.
    In a word, the inclination may indicate also the longi
tude in these seas : and this method may be employed when
others fail.    A  vessel which sails there in the direction of
a parallel could not find its longitude either by a chrono
meter or the declination of Halley, unless a star could be
seen in order to take an horary angle or the magnetic azi
muth.       The dipping needle, then, throws light on the lon
gitude amidst the thickest fogs. We point out this method
as one of those which have only a local application ; but
hitherto little attention has been paid to it. These ideas
may be extended and rectified by able navigators.
    In general, if the inclination of the needle, and the law
we have tried to establish, could be depended on, to observe
the inclination and the terrestrial latitude would be suffi
cient to determine also the longitude : but we have not yet
examined the extent of the errors of which this method may
                                US                                be

be susceptible, and consequently we confine ourselves      to a
mere indication of it.
   The phenomenon of the inclination has in maritime ob
servations a particular and very remarkable advantage,
namely, that of not being subject to those great progressive
variations which affect the declination. Without repeating
what we have.already said above on the supposed constancy
of this phenomenon, it may be remarked that our formula
even affords a new proof that it may comprehend in the
same law the observations made thirty-six years ago in
Lapland, (hose which Lacaille brought back in 1751 from
the Cape of Good Hope, and those which M. Humboldt
has lately made in America.
   In short, when we tried to represent the inclinations in,
different latitudes by the supposition of a magnet infinitely
small, very near the centre of the earth and perpendicular
to the magnetic equator, we did not pretend to consider
that hypothesis as any thing real, but only as a mathema
tical abstraction useful to connect the results, and pro'per to
ascertain in future whether any changes exist. In regard
to the declination and intensity, we freely confess that we
are entirely unacquainted with their laws or their causes;
and if any philosopher is so fortunate as to bring them to
one principle, which explains at the same time the varia
tions of the inclination, it will no doubt be one of the
greatest discoveries ever made.     But this research, exceed
ingly difficult, requires perhaps before it be attempted more
observations, and in particular more precise observations
than have hitherto been collected.         For this reason we
thought we might present to the class the preceding re
searches, imperfect as they are, begging it to receive them
with indulgence.     Should we be so happy as to find that
our results appear of any utility, we propose to unite all the
exact observations which have been made on this subject,
in order to give the utmost degree of precision to the law
we have discovered.

     Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.                 K.B. P.R.S.*
          MY DEAR SIB,
At   is well known that the fluid, generally called the sap, in
trees, ascends in the spring and summer from their roots,
and that in the autumn and winter it is not, in any consi
derable quantity, found in them ; and I have observed in a
former paper, that this fluid rises wholly through the al
burnum, or sap-wood.        But Du Hamel and subsequent
naturalists have proved, that trees contain another kind of
sap, which they have called the true or peculiar juice, or
6ap, of the plant.     Whence this fluid originates does not
appear to have been agreed by naturalists; but I have of
fered some facts to prove that it 'is generated by the leaf't ;
and that it differs from the common aqueous Sap, owing to
changes it has undergone in its circulation through th.it or-
       and   have contended that from this fluid (which Da
    fan

  lamel has called the sue proprc, and which        will call the

the tree,   derived.
             is           shall endeavour in the present paper
                              I
to prove that this fluid, in an inspissated state, or some con
crete matter deposited            by   it,
                                exists during the winter      the       in
alburnum,, and that from this fluid, or substance, dissolved
in the ascending aqueous sap,        derived the matter which
                                             is
enters into the composition of the new leaves in the spring,
and thus furnishes those organs, which were not wanted
during the winter, but which are essential to the further
progress  of vegetation.
   Few persons at all conversant with timber are ignorant,
that the alburnum, or sap-wood, of trees which are filled in
the autumn or winter,       much superior in quality to that
                                  is
of other trees of the same species which arc suffered to

                                                  :   it   is
and tenacious in its texture, and mpre durable. This su
periority in winter-felled wood has been generally attributed
to the absence of the sap at that season; but the appearance
and qualities of the wood seem more justly to warrant the
conclusion-, that some substance has been added to, instead
of taken from        and many circumstances induced me to
                        it,

 3i   0       State in which the true Sap        of   Trees
 suspect that this substance is generated, and deposited within
 it, in the preceding summer and autumn.
    Du Hamel has remarked, and        isevidently puzzled with
 the ci^jumstancc, that trees perspire more in the month of
 August, when the leaves are full grown, and when the an
 nual shoots have ceased to elongate, than at any earlier
 period   ;and we cannot suppose the powers of vegetation to
 be thus actively employed, bnt in the execution of some
 very important operation.     Bulbous and tuberous roots are
 almost wholly generated, after the leaves and stems of the
 plants, to which they belong, have attained their full growth      ;
 and   I  have constantly found, iu my practice as       farmer,
                                                              a
 that the produce of my meadows has been immensely in
 creased when the herbage of the preceding year had re
 mained to perform its proper office till the end of the au
   tumn, on ground which had been mowed early iu the sum
   mer.    Whence have been led to imagine, that the leaves,
                  I
   both of trees and herbaceous plants, are alike employed,
   during the latter part of the summer, in the preparation of
   matter calculated to afford food to the expanding buds and
   blossoms of the succeeding spring, and to enter into the
   composition of new organs of assimilation.
      If the preceding hypothesis be well founded, we may ex
  pect to find that some change will gradually take place in
   the qualities of the aqueous sap of trees during its- ascent in
  the spring; and that any given portion of winter-felled
  wood will- at the same time possess   a  greater degree of spe
  cific gravity, and yield  a larger quantity of extractive mat
  ter, than the same quantity of wood which has been felled
  in the spring or in the early part of the summer. To ascer
  tain these pointsI     made the experiments, an account of
  which   I  have now the honour to lay before you.
     As early in the last spring as the sap had risen in the
  sycamore and birch,   I    made incisions into the trunks of
  those trees, some close to the ground, and others at the
  elevation of seven feet, and readily obtained from each
                                I                                  in
  cision as much sap as I    wanted. Ascertaining the specific
 -gravity of the sap of each tree, obtained at the different
  elevations, I   found that of the sap of the sycamore with
-very little variation, in different trees, to be 1,004 when
 extracted close to the 'ground, and 1.008 at the height of
 seven feet.     The sap of the birch was somewhat lighter          ;
 but the increase of its specific gravity, at greater elevation,
 was comparatively the same.          When extracted near the
 ground the sap of both kinds was almost free from taste           ;
 but when obtained at greater height,
                        a                   itwas sensibly sweet.
                                                                  The

                  is deposited during Winter.               31 1
The shortness of   the trunks of the sycamore trees, which
were the subjects of my experiments, did not permit me to
extract the sap at a greater elevation than seven feet, except
in one instance ; an<Tin that, at twelve feet from the ground,
I  obtained a very sweet fluid, whose specific gravity was
1.014.
    I conceived it probable, that if the sap in the preceding
cases derived any considerable portion of its increased spe
cific gravity from matter previously existing in the alburnum,
I  should find some diminution of its weight, when it had
continued to flow some days from the same incision, because
the alburnum in the vicinity of that incision would, under
such circumstances, have become in some degree exhausted :
and on comparing the specific tjravity of the sap which had
flowed from a recent ana an old incision, I found that from
the old to be reduced to 1.002, and that from the recent one
to remain 1.004, as in the preceding cases, the incision
being made close" to the ground.         Wherever extracted,
whether close to the ground, or at some distance from         it,
the sap always appeared to contain    a large portion of air.
    In the experiments to discover the variation in the spe
cific gravity of the alburnum of trees at different seasons,
some obstacles to the attainment of any very accurate re
sults presented themselves.      The wood of different trees of
the same species, and growing in the same soil, or that
taken from different parts of the same tree, possesses
different degrees of solidity; and the weight of every part
of the alburnum appears to increase with its age, the ex
 ternal layers being the lightest.  The solidity of wood varies
also with the greater or less rapidity of its growth.      These
sources of error might apparently have been avoided           by
cutting off, at different seasons, portions of the same trunk
or branch but the wound thus made might, in some degree,
          :
have impeded the due progres of the sap in its ascent, and
 the part below might have oecn made heavier      by the stagna
 tion of the sap, and that above lighter     by privation of its
 proper quantity of nutriment.      The most eligible method
 therefore, which occurred to me, was to select and mark in
 the winter some of the poles of an oak coppice, where all
 are of equal age, and where many, of the same size and
 growing with equal vigour, spring from the same stool.
 One half of the poles which   I   marked and numbered were
 cut on the   3 1st of December, 1803, and the remainder on
 the 5th of the following May, when the leaves were nearly
    1
 half grown.      Proper marks were put to distinguish the
 winter-felled    from the summer-felled       polos, the bark
                                                            being

 Sl$          Stale in which the true Sap   of    Trees
  being left on all, and all being placed in the same situation
  to dry.
      In the beginning of August I cut off nearly equal por
  tions from a winter and summer-felled pole, which had
  both grown on the same stool j and both portions were
  then put in a situation, where, during the seven succeeding
 weeks, they were kept very warm by a fire. The summer-
  felled wood was, when put to, dry, the most heavy; but it
 evidently contained much more water than the other, and,
 partly at least, from this cause, it contracted much more in.
 drying.     In the beginning of October both kinds appeared
 to be perfectly dry, and I then ascertained the specific gra
 vity of the winter-felled wood to be 0.679, and that of the
 summer-felled wood to be 0.609 ; after each had been im
 mersed five minutes in water.
     This difference of ten per cent, was considerably more
 than I had anticipated, and it was not till I had suspended
 and taken off from the balance each portion, at least ten
 times, that I ceased to believe that some error had occurred
 in the experiment : and indeed I was not at last satisfied till
 I had ascertained by means of compasses adapted to the
measurement of solids, that the winter-felled pieces of
wood were much less than the others which they equalled
in weight.
     The pieces of wood, which had been the subjects of these
experiments, were again put to dry, with other pieces of the
same poles, and I yesterday ascertained the specific gravity
 of both with scarcely any variation in the result. But when
 I omitted the medulla, and parts adjacent to         it,and used
the layers of wood which had been more recently formed,
I   found the specific gravity of the winter-felled wood to be
only 0.583, and that of the summer-felled to be 0.533 and   ;
trying the same experiment with similar pieces of wood,
but taken from poles which had grown on          adifferent stool,
the specific gravity of the winter-felled wood was 0.588,
and that of the summer-felled 0.534.
    It    evident that the whole of the preceding difference in
         is
the speciiic gravity of the winter and summer-felled wood
might have arisen from     a   greater degree of contraction in
the former kind, whilst>drying;     I    therefore proceeded to
ascertain whether any given portion of     it,   by
                                                  weight, would
afford    agreater quantity of extractive matter, when steeped
in water. Having therefore reduced to small fragments
1000 grains of each kind,      7    poured on each portion six
ounces of boiling water and at the end of twenty-four
                          ;
hours, when the temperature of the water had sunk to 6o°,
                                                          I found

                   is deposited dvring Winter.                 3 13
I  found that the winter-felled wood had communicated a
much deeper colour to the water in which it had been in
fused, and had raised its specific gravity to 1.002. The
specific gravity of the water in which the summer-felled
wood had in the same manner been infused was 1 .00 1 . Tha
wood ia all the preceding cases was taken from the upper
parts of the poles, about eight feet from the ground.
    Having observed, in the preceding experiments, that the
sap of the sycamore became specifically lighter when it had
continued to flow during several days from the same incision,
I   concluded that the alburnum in the vicinity of such in
cision had been deprived of a larger portion of its concrete
or inspissated sap than in other parts of the same tree : and
I   therefore suspected that I should find similar effects to
have been produced by the young annual shoots and leaves ;
and that any given weight of the alburnum in their vicinity
would be found to contain less extractive matter than an
 equal portion taken from the lower parts of the same pole,
where no annual shoots or leaves had been produced.
    No information could in this case be derived from the
difference in the specific gravity of the wood ; because the
substance of every tree is most dense and solid in the lower
parts of its trunk : and I could on this account judge only
from the quantity of extractive matter which equal portions
of the two kinds of wood would afford. Having therefore
reduced to pieces several equal portions of wood taken from
 different parts of the same poles, which had been felled in
May, I poured on each portion an equal quantity of boiling
 water* which I suffered to remain twenty hours, as in the
 preceding experiments : and I then found that in some in
stances the wood from the lower, and in others that from
 the upper parts of the poles, had given to the water the
 deepest colour and greatest degree of specific gravity ; but
 that all had afforded much extractive matter, though in
 every instance the quantity yielded was much less than I
 had, in all cases, found in similar infusions of winter-
 felled wood.
     It appears, therefore, that the reservoir of matter deposited
 in the alburnum is not wholly exhausted in the succeeding
 spring : and hence we are able to account for the seve
 ral successions of leaves and buds which trees are capable of
 producing when those previously protruded have been de
 stroyed by insects, or other causes ; and for the extremely
 luxuriant shoots, which often spring from the trunks of
 trees, whose branches have been long in a state of decay.
     T have also some reasons to believe that the matter depo
 sited in the alburnum, remains unemployed in some cases
             7                                              during

314          State in which the true Sap     of Trees
during several successive years : it does not appear probable
that it can be ail employee! by trees which, after having been
transplanted, produce very tew leaves, or by those which
produce neither blossoms nor fruit.          In making experi
ments in 1802, to ascertain the manner in which the Duds
of trees are reproduced, I cut off in the winter all the
brandies of a very large old pear-tree, at a small distance
from the trunk ; and I pared off, at the same time, the
whole of the lifeless external bark. The age of this tree,      I
have good reasons to believe, somewhat exceeded two cen
turies : its extremities were generally dead ; and it afforded
few leaves, and no fruit ; and I had long expected every
successive year to terminate its existence.      After being de
prived of its external bark, and of all its buds, no marks of
vegetation appeared in the succeeding spring, or early part
of the summer : but in the beginning of July numerous
buds penetrated through the bark in every part, many leaves
of large size every where appeared, and in the autumn every
part was covered with very vigorous shoots exceeding, in
the aggregate, two feet iu length.        The number of leaves
which, in this case, sprang at once from the trunk and
branches appeared to me greatly to exceed the whole of
those, which the tree had borne in the three preceding sea
sons ; and I cannot believe that the matter which composed
these buds and leaves could have been wholly prepared by
the feeble vegetation and scanty foliage of the preceding
year.
   But whether the substance which is found in the al
burnum of winter-felled trees, and which disappears in part
in the spring and early part of the summer, be generated in
one or in several preceding years, there seem to be strong
grounds of probability, that this substance enters into the
composition of the leaf: for we have abundant reason to
believe that this organ is the principal agent of assimilation ;
and scarcely any thing can be more contrary to every con
clusion we should draw from analogical reasoning and com
parison of the vegetable with the animal economy, or in it
self more improbable, than that the leaf, or any other organ,
should singly prepare and assimilate immediately from the
crude aqueous sap, that matter which composes itself.
   It has been contended* that the buds themselves contain
the nutriment necessary for the minute unfolding leaves :
but trees possess a power to reproduce their buds, and the
matter necessary to form these buds must evidently be de
rived from some other source : no* does it appear probable
that the young leaves very soon enter on this office j for the

                   is deposited during Winter.              315
experiments of Ingenhousz prove that their action on the
air which surrounds them is very essentially different from
that of full grown leaves.       It is truS that buds in many
instances will vegetate and produce trees, when a very small
portion only of alburnum remains attached to them : but
the first efforts of vegetation in such buds are much more
feeble than in others to which a larger quantity of alburnum
is attached ; and therefore we have, in this case, no grounds
to suppose that the leaves derive their first nutriment from
the crude sap.
    It is also generally admitted, from the experiments of
Bonnet arid Du Hamel, which I have repeated with the
same result, that in the cotyledons of the seed is deposited
a quantity of nutriment for the bud, which every seed con
tains ; and though no vessels can be traced * which lead
immediately from the cotyledons to the bud or plumula, it
 is not difficult to point out a more circuitous passage, which
 is perfeetly similar to that through which I conceive the
 sap to be carried from the leaves to the buds in the subse
 quent growth of the tree ; and I am in possession of many
 facts to prove that seedling trees, in the first stage of their
 existence, depend entirely on the nutriment afforded by the
 cotyledons ; and that they are greatly injured, and in many
 instances killed, by being put to vegetate in rich mouldv
     We have much more decisive evidence that bulbous and
  tuberous footed plants contain the matter within themselves
  which subsequently composes their leaves ; for we see them
  vegetate even in dry rooms on the approach of spring ; and
  many bulbous rooted plants produce their leaves and flowers
  with nearly the same vigour by the application of water
  only, as they do when growing in the best mould. But
  the water in this case, provided that it be perfectly pure,
  probably affords little or no food to the plant, and acts only
  py dissolving the matter prepared and deposited in the pre
  ceding year; and hence the root becomes exhausted and
  spoiled : and Hassenfratz found that the leaves and flowers
   and roots of such plants afforded no more carbon than he
   had proved to exist in bulbous roots of the same weight,
   whose leaves and flowers had never expanded.
      As the leaves and flowers of the hyacinth, in the pre
   ceding case, derived their matter from the bulb, it appears
   extremely probable that the blossoms of trees receive their
   nutriment from the alburnum, particularly as the blossoms
   of many species precede their leaves : and as the roots of
   plants become weakened and apparently exhausted, when
                               * Htdwig.

 they have afforded nutriment to a crop of seed, we may sus-
       that a tree, which has borne much fruit in one season,
   ecomes in a similar way exhausted, and incapable of af- -
 Kect
 fording proper nutriment to a crop in the succeeding year.
 And I am much inclined to believe that were the wood of a
 tree in this state accurately weighed, it would be found spe
 cifically lighter than that of a similar tree, which had not
 afforded nutriment to fruit or blossoms, in the preceding
 year, or years.
    If it be. admitted that the substance which enters into the
composition of the first leaves in the spring is derived from,
matterwhich has undergone some previous preparation within
 the plant, (and I am at a loss to conceive on what grounds
this can be denied, in bulbous and tuberous rootea plants
at least,) it must also be admitted that the leaves which are
generated in the summer derive their substance from "a simi
lar source j and this cannot be conceded without a direct
admission of the existence of vegetable circulation, which          is.
denied       by
              so ntany eminent naturalists.         Ihave not, how

                                              a fact  to disprove its
existence, nor any great weight in their arguments, except
those drawn from two important errors in the admirable'
works of Hales and Du Hamel, which have noticed inI                 a
former memoir.            shall therefore proceed to point out the
                          I

and the experiments of Bonnet and Du Hamel leave little
grounds of doubt, but that the new matter which                isadded
to the point of the root descends from the cotyledons.             The
first motion therefore of the fluids in plants is downwards,

to carry them, are of the same kind with those which arc

coloured infusions, when its point was taken off, and I wa9
totally unable to discover any alburnous tubes, through
which the sap absorbed from the ground, in the subsequent
growth of the tree, ascends : but when the roots were con
siderably elongated, alburnous tubes formed ; and as soon
as they had acquired some degree of firmness in their con
sistence, they appeared to enter on their office of carrying
up the aqueous. sap, and the leaves of the plumula then,
and not sooner, expanded.
   The leaf contains at least three kinds of tubes : the first is
what, in a former paper, I have called the central vessel,
through which the aqueous sap appears to be carried, and
through which coloured infusions readily pass, from the
alburnous tubes into the leaf-stalk.     These vessels are al
ways accompanied hy spiral tubes, which do not appear to
carry anv liquid : but there is another vessel which appears
to take its origin from the leaf, and which descends down
the internal bark, and contains the true or prepared sap.
When the leaf has attained its proper growth, it seems to
perform precisely the office of the cotyledon ; but being ex
posed to the air, and. without the same means to acquire, or
the substance to retain moisture, it is fed by the alburnous
tubes and central vessels?      The true sap now appears to
be discharged from the leaf, as it was previously from the
cotyledon, into the vessels of the bark, and to be employed
in the formation of new alburnous tubes between the,base of
the leaf and the root. From these alburnous tubes spring
other central vessels and spiral tubes, which enter into, anu
possibly give existence to, other leaves ; and thus by a re
petition of the same process the young tree or annual shoot
continues to acquire new parts, which apparently are formed
from the ascending aqueous sap.
    But it has been proved by Du Hamel that a fluid, similar
to that which is found in the true sap vessels of the bark,
exists also in the alburnum, and this fluid is extremely ob
vious in the fig, and other trees, whose true sap is white, or
coloured.     The vessels, which contain this fluid in the al
burnum, are in contact with those which carry up the
aqueous sap ; and it does not appear probable that, in a
body so porous as wood, fluids so near each other should
remain wholly unmixed.        I must therefore conclude, that
when the true sap has been delivered from the cotyledon or
leaf into the returning or true sap vessels of the bark, one
portion of it secretes through the external cellular, or more
probably glandular substance of the bark, and generates
                                                    "           a

 new epidermis, where that is to be formed ; and that the
 other portion of it secretes through the internal glandular
 substance of the bark, where one part of it produces the
 new layer of wood, and the remainder enters the pores of
 the wood already formed, and subsequently mingles with
 the ascending aqueous sap ; which thus becomes capable
 of affording the matter necessary to form new buds and
 leaves.
     It has been proved in the preceding experiments on the
 ascending sap of the sycamore and birch, that that fluid
does not approach the buds and unfolding leaves in the
 spring, in the state in which it is absorbed from the earth :
and therefore we may conclude that the fluid, which enters
into and circulates through the leaves of plants, as the
blood through the lungs of animals, consists of a mixture
of the true sap or blood of the plant with matter more re
cently absorbed, and less perfectly assimilated.
    It appears probable that the true sap undergoes a consi
derable change on its mixture with the ascending aqueous
sap ; for this fluid in the sycamore has been proved to be
come more sensibly sweet in its progress from the roots in
the spring, and the liquid which flows from the wounded
bark of the same tree is also sweet ; but I have never been
able to detect the slightest degree of sweetness in decoctions
of the sycamore wood in winter.        I am therefore inclined
to believe that the saccharine matter existing in the ascend
ing sap is not immediately, or wholly, derived from the
fluid which had circulated through the leaf in the preceding
year ; but that it is generated by a process similar to that of
the germination of seeds, and that the same process is al
ways going forward during the spring and summer, as long
as the tree continues to generate new organs.     But towards
the conclusion of the summer I conceive that the true sap
simply accumulates in the alburnum, and thus adds to the
specific gravity of winter-felled wood, and increases the
quantity of its extractive matter.
    I have some reasons to believe that the true sap descends
through the alburnum as well as through the bark; and         I
have been informed that if the bark be taken from the
trunks of trees in the spring, and such trees be suffered to
grow til] the following winter, the alburnum acquires a great
degree of hardness and durability.      If subsequent experi
ments prove that the true sap descends through the albur-
uiim, it will be easy to point out the cause why trees con
tinue to vegetate after all communication between the leaves

object.    These two images will be more or less separated
in the proportion of the distance of the centres of the semi-
lenses from each other, which distance is shown in revolu
tions and parts of a revolution of a finger-screw that sepa
rates them.    For this purpose a circular head is fixed on.
the finger-screw, the edge of which is divided into a hun
dred parts ; and in order to know the number of revolutions,
a small slip of brass (that passes over the graduated surface
of the head, and serves as its index for showing the cente
simal parts of a revolution) is fixed to the eye-tube, and
has  its chamfered edge also divided, each division ,being
equal to one entire revolution of the screw.
                       To adjust the Telescope.
     Having, by drawing out the eye-tube more or less, ad
justed the telescope to distinct vision, turn the finger-screw
 till the two images of the same object appear in one, and the
 edge of the head together with the division numbered lOO
 will be found at the hrst division on the index that shows the
 revolutions.

   Having directed the telescope to the vessel chased, turn
the finger-screw till the two images of some well defined part
of the vessel appear to have their extreme edges in contact
with each other ; then read off the number of revolutions
of the screw shown on the chamfered edge, also the parts of
a revolution shown on the edge of the head : then        after if,
some time,      be required to know whether we have gained
               it
or lost in the chase, again bring the edges of the images
of the same object in contact as before. If the number of
revolutions and parts of the screw be the same as was shown
before, we have neither gained nor lost in the chase.     But
if the number of revolutions and parts be less, the distance
from the chased vessel will be greater in the proportion of
 the difference of these numbers to the former.        On the
contrary,     the number of revolutions and parts be greater,
              if
we come nearer the vessel in the proportion of the difference
 of these numbers to the number of revolutions and parts of
 the first observation.

                                 [Concluded from       p.   241.]
-Dut     may be said,
        it               these observations on the origin
                                     if
of buds are founded in nature, how comes     to pass that               it
herbaceous and so tender bodies should penetrate through
a  considerable number of ligneous zones, which must be
the case in branches of two or three years of age, which,
though rarely, produce, however, sometimes buds              ap              ?   It
pears to me very probable, that at the period when the hud
becomes expanded,       period which corresponds with the
                                 a
elongation of the medullary sheath,         certain number of a
the bundles of the tubes of    that  sheath   proceeds laterally
from interval to interval towards the bark.      Soon after, the
first cambium of the bud appears between the medullary
sheath and the bark, and separates these two parts from
each other.    This cambium does not long retain its muci
laginous  form     ;  soon metamorphosed into the first liber
                       it   is
or bark.    The bent vessels of this first liber, in hardening
and becoming every day straighter, proceed towards the
medullary sheath, rouna which they compress themselves,
and form there the first alburnum, which becomes then the
first ligneous zone.     The prolongations of the medullary
                                  the formation of this first

stratum of the wood ; for the latter quits its mucilaginous
state slowly, and its tubes have not straightened themselves
by a great effort : on the contrary, they retain their curva
ture around the prolongations, as may be readily seen. The
straightening, however, and compression of the tubes of the
liber one against the other, ought to be attended with this
necessary consequence, that the prolongations should be
more or less pressed } and as this is repeated every year in
the formation of the new ligneous strata, the result must be,
that not only a certain number of prolongations are at length
stitled, but also that the quantity increases in proportion as
the twig becomes a branch, and as the latter acquires more
size.    This opinion appears to me to be very well founded,
for we observe that the number of the buds is generally in
the inverse ratio of the age of the branch : nature will have
it that this number should decrease more and more every*
year, and she fixes a period at which branches generally
cease altogether to produce any.         On this rule, modified
according to the nature of each species of vegetable, and
according to the particular circumstances under which the
plants are placed, depends in a great measure the habitus of
the vegetables.      Nature rarely deviates from this law: there
arc, however, some exceptions ; and it sometimes happens
that it retains, in case of need, some of these prolongations,
which have not expanded into buds during the first years of
the branch.       If, for example, the sap rises in too great
abundance, or if it be too nourishing, especially when the
tree cannot sufficiently discharge it,   such of these prolonga
 tions as are not stifled acquire vigour, lengthen themselves
towards the bark, pierce    it,   and give birth to gluttonous
branches, or branches with false woody which often preserve
the tree from plethoric diseases which might become mortal.
The birth of these twigs explains to us, in my opinion, why
 the buds from which they have been produced are always
 thin and herbaceous ;     why they almost always expand ve«y
 speedily,  and  often   out of season and why they do not
                                       ;
adhere firmly to the tree.   It   appears besides, that my opi
nion on the question itself   is   confirmed       the considera
                                                  by
tion, that  if  nature forms more wood than usual, and very
 thick zones, the branches commonly give fewer buds the
 following year but nature seems then to gain on the one
                 :
 hand what  it  loses on the other ;   for itmultiplies then the
 number of the young branches, which, as we know, produce
more buds than any other part of the vegetable.          Another
 observation, which renders my opinion still more probable,
 is, that
        I    have seen at the lower part of the branches, and
                                                             the

  the twigs    of several trees and shrubs, such as the young
  branches of the common willow (salix caprea) , a considera
  ble number of small herbaceous prolongations of the me
  dullary sheath, which were as insulated and dispersed
  throughout the ligneous body, and which had neither
  pierced nor raised up the bark that covered them. They
  appeared to me to be prolongations reserved to form, in
  case of need, leaves or branches.
     But how can we account for the origin of buds from a
  trunk the interior part of which is rotten, and where the
  medullary sheath no longer exists ? and how comes it to
  pass that the branches of a hollow tree, or those grafted on
  another tree, vegetate with the greatest vigour?    It appears
 to me that the answer to this question presents no difficulty.
 These phaenomena will soon be explained,if we shall be able
 to prove that the prolongations of the sheath may be pre
 served, and live, when they are separated by art or by nature
 from the sheath whence they have arisen. In these cases
 the branches must receive the sap by other tubes than those
 of the sheath.       But does not the observation made by
 Coulomb, that in sound trees the sap ascends chiefly by
 the tubes which surround the pith, oppose what I have
 said ? I do not think it : on the contrary, I am of opinion,
 that, if the observation of that celebrated philosopher had
 still need of being corroborated, it certainly would be by
 my experiments on the prolongations of the sheath.         It is
 in these organs indeed, more than in any other, that we
 are to search for the proof that the sap ascends chiefly in
 the vessels of the medullary sheath of a sound tree, because
when cut transversely they are always found, as long as they
are not ligneous, more or less filled with juices.    But is the
medullary      sheath  the only way by  which  the sap proceeds
from the root to the extremities of the vegetable ? Has na
ture confined herself within so narrow limits, or has she
established     other canals to conduct the nourishing juices
from the root to all the ramifications of the plant ? The
existence of so many hollow trees will furnish us with an
answer.      In hollow trunks it is only bv the liber, and be
fore the birth of that organ by the alburnum, that nature
makes the sap to ascend. It happens also, but more rarely,
that the bark is provided with small tubes which convey a
       of that limpid liquor.   If we examine the hollow wil-
  ows on the approach of spring, it will be observed that the
f>art
alburnum is full of juice.      It we cut the stems, branphes,
and stalks of the vine, euphorbia, &c. we shall see the tubes
next the bark emit not only their own juices but also an

  aqueous    humour, which is the ascending sap.          The liber,
  alburnum, medullary sheath, and sometimes the tubes of
  the bark, are the only organs which nature employs in the
  cotyledons to convey the sap to the ramifications of the
  trunk.    But after the sheath has produced the prolonga
  tions or germs of the buds, the liber and alburnum secure
  in preference the preservation of the individual ; for, when
  the new production of these organs is prevented, the plant
  infallibly dies : on the other hand, if nature destroys the
  sheath, the tree very often vegetates as before; and to be
  fully convinced of it we need only mention the enormous
  boabab of the coast of Africa.         Besides, the ingenious ex
  periments of Mirbel have fully        shown  how, by the help of
  the pores and fissures with which almost all the tubes
  and cells of vegetables are pierced, the sap may be conveyed
  to all the parts ; and how nature, to convey the juice from
  one organ to the other, may find ways which to us appear
  extraordinary. Hence we are obliged to believe, that in the
 case where the sheath does not exist, or a graft has suc
 ceeded, and where the pith is converted            into wood, the
 prolongations      may receive  the nourishing liquor with which
 they   are filled, from the  living tissue with which they are in
 immediate contact.        In plants, even the interior part of
 which is very sound, the sap cannot be conveyed imme
 diately from the tubes of the sheath of a trunk to those of
the sheath of an old branch.          In this case, the prolonga
 tions are not composed of tubes ; they have become entirely
 ligneous, and their vessels, changed into fibres, no longer
 c onvey the juices.      There is no longer any organic com
 munication but by means of the alburnum, the liber, the
 medullary radii, and the bark : even the latter rarely serves
 for conveying the sap. It thence follows, that the sap of
 the trunk ascends in the sheath, passes thence into the
 liber, or the alburnum, to be conveyed to the sheath of the
 branch through the cellular and vascular tissue. When it
reaches the sheath of the branch, it is conveyed to the fol
lowing ramification in the same manner as from the trunk
to the principal branch.
    The origin of buds, of which I have spoken, enables us
to conceive, the cause of the firm insertion of the branch
into the trunk.       The bud has been produced by a prolonga
tion of the medullary sheath : the first stratum of the wood
is formed while that bud has been elongated into a branch :
the trunk has produced one at the same time; the ligneous
zones have succeeded regularly from year to year in the
trunk and in the branches, and each zone of the branches
                      3                                          is

          On the Buds and Ramifications      of Plants.     325
is in an uninterrupted    relation with another zone of the
trunk,   and seems to be thii3 produced by the prolongation
or increase of the latter.     It appears to me that the cause
is explained by the following observation : — It is generally
known that the cambium, of which the liber is formed, has
its birth in the alburnum and bark, and that the latter,
during the formation of the cambium, is altogether sepa
rate from the alburnum even at the base of the branch.       By
these means the cambium of the trunk and that of the
branch are never divided ; on the contrary, they adhere to
each other, and the result is, that the wood thence arising
forms thus an uninterrupted zone.       The old trunks of the
pine, fir, oak, &c. seem, however, sometimes to show the
contrary ; for it is not uncommon that the branches, even
those covered with bark, traverse a greater or less part of the
wood of the trunk, without being there united to the exterior
zones.    Nevertheless, if such a trunk be cut vertically, it
will be seen that all the zones of the branch have an im
mediate reference to as many zones of the trunk ; the reason
of which is, that this branch has been cut, or has ceased to
grow, and that the trunk, which has continued its zones,
has surrounded and inclosed the branch sometimes even en
tirely.
   It may perhaps be asked, why all the germs of a twig do
not pierce the bark at the same .time the first year.      This
question I am not able to answer, because I cannot unveil
the mysteries of nature, and, in regard to the birth of buds,
know only the above phaenomena.            It may, however, be
conjectured that in the expanded buds there were germs,
that is to say, prolongations of the medullary sheath, dif
fering in size and vigour ; and that, besides, the time of
their respective development depended on external circum
stances, the most of which are still unknown to us.
   It is observed sometimes in shumac, the plane-tree, &c?
that the lateral prolongations are entirely dried and ligneous,
though that in the middle be still perfectly herbaceous. In
this case the petiole which covered the great prolongation,
and below which the bud that produces the twig must have
been formed, has been torn or dropped off the preceding
spring, or at least before the autumn.
   The means which nature has made choice of to nourish
the buds during the winter have been the object of several
hypotheses.     1 shall abstain from mentioning them all, in
order that 1 may attach myself to the only one which merits
particular consideration.     The interior of the bud has been
compared    to the embryo   of a seed, and it has been asserted
                                                            that

 that the body of this bud was nourished by the scales which
 cover    it, as the embryo          is   by
                                        the cotyledons.           shall not
                                                                       I
 here examine whether the embryo be really nourished by
 the cotyledons        but must deny that the bud
                       ;         I                               nourished

 by   the  scales,  sometimes     very arid, which protect it.           On
 the contrary,         itnourished

                                                        I
 ties of remarking that the motion of the sap does not en
 tirely cease in the interior of. the tree but when the cold                          is
 severe, and the buds are then preserved without having need
 of nourishment. To insure the conveyance of the sap to
 the buds, and by these means to shelter them as much as
            from the cold, nature, perhaps, has caused the pro-
  ongations of the sheath to be traversed

 zones of wood.
    In regard to the symmetry which nature exhibits in the
 disposition of the prolongations of the sheath and the buds,
it   isas yet inexplicable to us        the hypothesis that the bud
                                          :
pierces the bark at the place where             is thinnest, as for ex
                                                    it

                                                   is
truth. The question is, to know how the prolonged tubular
bundles of the medullary sheath which                   directed towards
                                                            is
the bark, may meet that thin place without having crept
along the interior side of that organ. A thousand other
questions might be added, which present difficulties equally
great.
  It    appears to me very probable that Hales, Linnaeus, and
several other observers who had adopted the hypothesis that
the pith    is  the most active organ in the interior ceconomy
of plants, the reproducing organ of the ramifications of
the trunk, were not far from discovering the tubular pro
longations of the sheath, which            discovered
                                              I               chance. It

appears    to  me  also  that the  green   substance    contained    in the
medullary      sheath   has     different

to it; and that in regard to the medullary radii, to which
Daubenton has given the name of medullary prolongations,
they are very different from the organs to which               have given
                                                                  I

                                      of
    My researches in regard to these organs have made mc
                also  pbaencmena respecting the origin of
                       some
 eaves, which were
!>erceive           entirely unknown to me.     These organs
are considered as expansions of the herbaceous tissue of the
bark, and of the tubular tissue of the liber. This opinion                            is
among the number of those which cannot be admitted. A
leaf, whatever be the place of its insertion, can never be
torn off without finding, exactly at the place where       was              it
                                                        fixed,

fixed, one or more prolongations of the medullary sheath
penetrating the wood, and sinking into the petiole, or into
the base of the leaf to which they convey sap.       In the spec
cies of the family of the pinnifera one single prolongation of
the like kind enters into the petiole : in all the other vege
tables which I have examined, I found two, three, and even
more.
   The fall of the leaves is explained, not only by the in
fluence of the air and the sun, but also by the mechanism
of nature, which, according to the opinion most generally
admitted, prevents the sap from ascending from the branch
to the petiole.    " The tubes of the liber        said) in daily
                                                     (it   is

consequence transport themselves towards the centre of the
vegetable    at the same time the bark, which dilates itself,
             ;
recedes ;  and the necessary result of these two movements
 is,that the leaves no longer receive sufficient nourishment."
There   isno doubt that the influence of the air and the sun
contributes powerfully to harden the substance of the leaves,
as well as to approach towards the ligneous state,         which    in
the passage of the juices ceases, and then the leaves no
longer transpire or absorb. But do not believe that the
                                             I
mechanism in question can in any manner prevent the
ascent of the sap. But do we not, indeed, see that in        great   a
number of plants some leaves drop at the period when the
liber has not yet been changed into alburimm, and while
the sap  is still in full motion     In word, when the bark

which have conveyed the nourishing juice from the stem,
to the leaves, are still green and herbaceous, and have sus
tained no injury   ; which seems to prove that they were not ¦
choked, nor attracted with force. They dry             long timea
after, and acquire very slowly the consistence of the wood
in which they are placed.

 immortal vaccine matter, discovered on the nipples and
 udders of some cows in England by that illustrious doctor,
Jenner; whereby that loathsome, painful, and fatal small

JL   his new genus, introduced into the system,      is com
posed       three species, two of which have never been
            of
described, and the third cannot be exactly known but by
means of the illustrations which I am about to give. It
was first found in the waters of Chili by Molina, who pub
lished an account of it under the American name of coypou:
it has since been met with only by Felix d'Azzara, who, has
given a long description of           itf
                                  under the name of quouyia,
by  which  it is known  in the province of Tucuman.

son   ; and it would then have been more perfectly known,
had that respectable and indefatigable naturalist lived long
enough to publish the immense materials with which he
enriched natural history.       There was found, indeed, among
Commerson's papers, a drawing of this singular animal re
duced only to half its size : he had been indebted for it to
"   M. Bougainville de Nerville, governor of the Malouine
Islands, an enlightened amateur of natural history." These
are the words of the note which our respectable correspon
dent put at the bottom of the drawing which had been given
to him. The name myopotamus bonariensis, which he pro
 visionally gave to this species, proves that he then consi
 dered it as the type of a new genus.
     I have not employed the same denomination as Com-
 merson.      It appeared to me more proper to prefer that of
 hydromis, composed nearly of the same radicals, because it
 presents the same termination as the names already em
 ployed to denote the most of the analogous genera, such as
 those of pteromis, pliascolomis, lagomis, cheiromis, &c.
     We long neglected the drawing of the myopotamus,
 either because, not having been executed by Commerson
 himself, it did not inspire us with sufficient confidence, or
 because our mistrust was authorized by the difficulty of
 comprehending it in the genera already established.
     It was only after examining the rich collection of furs of
 M. Bechem*, where I found a considerable quantity of the
 skins of an animal which appeared to me to be unknown to
 naturalists, that I recollected the drawing of Commerson.
 M. Bechem informed me that these skins had been intro
 duced into commerce about nine or ten years before ; that
 they were transmitted by the way of Spain ; that he never
 received fewer than a thousand at a time; and that in some
 years the number amounted to fifteen or twenty thousand.
 M. Bechem found that they had an affinity to the beaver
 skins, and could be applied to the same purposes : he sold
 them under the denomination of racounda, which he derived
 from that of racoon, the name given by the English to an
  animal of North America.         They are sought for in com
  merce, and are employed in particular by the manufacturers
  of hats. Thus our arts were supplied with, and a part of
  our dress was formed of, the hair of an animal with which
 we were unacquainted, and which, however, was sufficiently
 different from others of the same genus to deserve to be
  elassed in a small particular tribe.

 outstripped by commerce, that I could not help embracing
the earliest opportunity of endeavouring to discover to what
 animal this useful fur belonged.           Among the number of
 skins which M. Bechem possessed, I had the good for
 tune to find a sufficient number entire, to enable me to hope
 that I should be able to determine this point.           I soon per
 ceived that the description of the quouyia of M. d'Azzara
 corresponded to them perfectly, and that this description
could be exactly applied also to the drawing of the myopo'
 tamus.     I should have been sooner conducted to this com
 parison, had I not found, in the French translation of
Mi d'Azzara's work, the epithet of red twice substituted for
that of ruddy : the author, by the Spanish word rubro, had
denoted only the latter quality.
    It was with reason that Commerson had provisionally
considered his animal of Buenos-Ayres as a new genus : it
belongs to the order of the rodentia by its two strong incisor
teeth jn each jaw ; but not to any of the .genera of that
order, in consequence of its tail and its hind feet.               The
conjecture     of Commerson     is now    fully justified by   the  ex
istence of two other species in New Holland, which have
exactly the same combinations of form : such are the three
animals which I comprehend under the same generic deno
mination of hydromh.
    To be able to subdivide with "more precision the order of
the rodentia, and particularly the numerous genus of rats,
we have attended to the consideration of the molar teeth,
the form of which has furnished us with excellent charac
ters, which have gone hand in hand with the different con
figurations of the feet and the tail. Thus, all the rats ana
logous to the field rat, the water rat, &c. have the molar
teeth formed of laminae placed one before the other, and
the tail short and hairy: on the other hand, those which
have a relation to the common rat, &c. Norway rat, &c.
are distinguished by molar teeth with a simple crown, and
by their long tail, which is in part naked and scaly ; others,
such as the hamster, have these teeth single, and the tail
short and hairy.
   My first care, after these observations, ought to be to at
tend to the molar teeth of my three species, and deduce
from them characters applicable only to them.               I was de
prived of the means of doing this in regard to the American
species.     M. d'Azzara neglected to speak of its molar
teeth :  Molina,    however, has in part supplied this defi
ciency,  if   it be true  that he extended his remarks to their
number.      We    have  reason  to believe this from the extract
                                                                     ia

        New Genus        of Mammalia called Hydromis.         331
iii regard to the rnus coypus, which Gmelin made from the
account of that Jesuit. M. Gruvel in the French transla
tion must, then, have omitted this important character.
    However, the following are the observations, in regard to
the teeth, which I made in the two species of New Hol
land.
    These molar teeth present themselves first in a number
worthy of remark : there are only two on each side, which
carries the whole number to eight.         Their form exhibits no
less singularity : the length of each is double its breadth :
the enamel traverses it in the middle, turning round in such
a manner, that the section forms pretty nearly the figure 8,
which is rendered sensible in particular by two excavations,
pretty deep, corresponding to the vacant spaces which exist
in that figure.
    The feet of the hydromis have five toes ; those of the fore
feet are very short, and almost entirely enveloped : the other
 toes are free.     On the other hand, those of the hind feet
are engaged in a membrane : the external toe only is at
liberty, because the general membrane which extends over
it,  and which borders the interior side, arises only from the
 extremity of the metacarpian bone of the annular toe         ;   it
 forms on the last       small interior border, which does not
                         a
 retain
       it
       in     its deviation.    The nails are compressed, pretty
 long,   hooked,    and  very sharp.
    The head, as far as could be judged from the remains
 whichI    examined,        broad and depressed like those of the
                             is
 beaver and the water-rat         :the muzzle appears to be less
 obtuse the neck
       ;                   thick and short
                          is               ;   the ears small and
 round ;   the whiskers long and thick.
    The hair of two kinds, as in the beaver under the long
             is                                  ;
 silky hair is   a short felt, thick, and exceedingly fine.
    The hydromis has resemblance also to these animals
                             a                                    by
 the proportions of its body, and particularly       by  the short
 ness of its paws    ;but they differ sensibly  by  the form of the
 tail, which is   almost as long as the body, perfectly round,
 and terminating     in  apoint.
     In general, there can be no doubt that in the natural
 order these animals ought to occupy an intermediate place
  between the beaver and the water-rat: being destitute of
 membranes on the hind feet, they would naturally belong
 to the tribe of the latter or,   ;   iftheir tail had the form of
 that of the beaver, they might be united with the species of
 that genus.
     1st. The Hydromis Coypou. — have said that

  332      New Genus     of Mammalia called Hydromis.
  made    known by Molina. His description comprehends
  pretty well the essential points, but is not sufficiently mi
  nute. This traveller speaks of the coypou as a species of
  water-rat, of the size and colour of an otter.        Gmelin has
  confined himself, in what he has said of the mus coy pus, to
  copying Molina.       M. d'Azzara, on the other hand, ha»
 given a complete description of that species, with the mea
 sures of the different parts of the body ; and, in general, has
 not omitted what relates to the molar teeth.
    The coypou is distinguished in particular from the two
 other species, of which we shall speak hereafter, by its
 great size.

    The  general tint of the hair and on the back is a chestnut
 brown.     This colour becomes brighter on the flanks, and
 passes  to  bright red ; under the belly it is only a dirty and
 almost dark russet.      Yet this colour is sufficiently change
 able according to the manner in which the coypou raises or
lowers its hair.     This mobility in the tone ot its fur arises
from each hair being of an ash-coloured brown at the root,
and bright red at the point.
    The felt concealed under the long hair is an ash brown,
of a brighter tint under the belly. The long hair on the
back has the points only reddish, and that on the flanks is
of the latter colour throughout the half of its length.
    As in all animals which go frequently into the water, the
hair of the tail is thin, short, stiff, and of a dirty red colour;
in its naked parts it is scaly.
    The contour of the mouth and extremity of the muzzle
are white ; the whiskers, which are long and stiff, are also
white, some black hairs excepted.
    Among the great number of skins which form part of
the collection of M. Bechem, I saw some belonging to ani
mals which had no doubt been affected with the albine dis
ease ; in one of these the silky hairs were entirely russet, so
that the back appeared of the same tint as the sides and the
belly ; in another, the grand dorsal stripe, instead of being \
chestnut, had passed entirely to a red colour, the flanks
being of a very pale red.      I cannot believe that these varie
ties, on  the  one hand,   were  the character of youth or of the-
female,   because   these  accidents  were rare, considering the
                                                                great

great number of skins which I examined ; and on the other,
because M. d'Azzara has expressly told us that the female
is entirely similar to the male.
   Molina and d'Azzara agree in regard to the mild qualities
by which the coypou is distinguished.       It eats every thing
given to       it,
              and seems to attach itself to those who take care
of "it.     may be easily tamed, and soon becomes accus

    2d. The yellow-bellied Hydromis. — This species              nearly           is
half as srnall as the coypou. The length of its body                one                is
foot, and that of the tail two inches six lines.
    Its long hair       not sensibly distinguished from the felt
                          is                                                                    j

of this hydromis more valuable than that of the coypou                                          :
there are few furs thicker, or softer to the touch.           The hair
in its apparent part       above
                               is  of   chestnut  abrown,   and  below
of most beautiful orange colour. At the root
      a                                                            ash-       it

coloured, and gray under the belly. The tail                   entirely      is
covered with very short and stiff hair           towards the root
                                                               :                                it
is   pretty large, and well furnished with hair: in three-
fourths of its length its colour            the same as that of the
                                                      is

 is always sufficient to justify itself, and consequently does
 not need any apology.        I therefore proceed.
    The pyrometer long ago has demonstrated to the satis
 faction of every one in the least acquainted therewith, that
"all bodies, whether in a fluid or solid state, expand by heat,
 and contract by cold, and from a very obvious cause ; viz.
 because the particles of that fluid element, (fire,) by insi
 nuating themselves between the component parts of such
 bodies, not only fill the most minute interstices, and per
 vade every pore with the greatest facility, but absolutely dis
 unite or separate the constituent particles themselves, and
thereby make them, in the aggregate, of a greater volume ;
 and ultimately render such substances (if capable of fusion)
a fluid, or running mass : in which state such substances
occupy their greatest possible extension,
                                               — unless they were
volatilized, or changed into vapour.
    Thus much for the laws of fusion themselves.           The ap
 plication and inferences from them are quite appropriate.
    Tt is while the greatest possible degree of expansion of
 tbe vitreous matter exists, that the portion which forms this
 molten tear or drop I am about to treat of, is separated and
 made.      In fact, its fusion is the radical consequence of its
 extreme rarefaction, or expansion, being physically and me
 chanically superinduced thereby.         For, by the introduction
 of the accumulated igneous particles, a separation of the
 once continuous particles of the glass takes place, until the
 attraction of cohesion entirely ceases, and fluidity eventually
 ensues.
     Now, at this instant of extreme excitation it   is, that, with
a   sudden and forcible jirk, the artist ejaculates or throws   it
 forth to be suddenly quenched in cold water when    ;          is it
 evident, that the parts which first came into contact with
 the water will become cooled and indurated first, — which        is
 the exterior surface. And this stratum (if may so speak,
                                                 I
 and suppose the whole composed of           a  number of strata)
 having taken its form and dimensions, no internal mutation
 or exertion it   iscapable of can either alter or lessen its form.
 But as all bodies, as was said before, must contract in cool
 ing, the interior parts (contrary to gradual cooling) must
 give way: they therefore become vacuous, of necessity.
 And because the central parts cannot coalesce, they being
 the last which feel the refrigerating quality of the water,
 they remain longest in    a    fluid state and as there
                                         :                 is  nota

 the space it   did when in an ignited or rarefied state, the
 parts which are most fluid, being     * most easy to move, and

                       Our ev'ry act depends upon its aid.
    Itis true, the same event happens to other bodies, upon
being brought into a state of fusion and suddenly quenched,
as to glass.   Thus, if a bar of steel be overheated in our
attempts to harden              it,
                         we see upon breaking       that the in   it
terior parts have changed their position, and formed them
selves into   kind of irregular crystals, for the same reasons
                   a                                                              :
yet, as no substance but glass         so generally impermeable
                                               is
to all agents, except fire, the result         not so satisfactory
                                                       is
as when this material          used   because, on account, of its
                                      is    ;
diaphanous nature, or transparency, the appearances are
more ocular, consequently less doubtful.          For here, with
out analogy or hypothetical inference, our senses are called
to witness the most complete vacuum in nature and, as                  ;
far as relates to heterogeneous effluvia, quite perfect.
   A vacuum not of the Boylcan kind, where that air
¦which    isdriven out           is
                            ejected     means of that which re
                                                by
mains behind; but of the Torricellian kind, yet infinitely
more perfect       the very formation of which precludes the
                       :
possibility  of  the  most subtle agent in nature (except fire)
insinuating    one   particle of its substance therein.       And,
¦were    it
          possible   that  we   could make   this vacuum   subser
vient to our experiments on the mechanical pressure of the
air, (whether incumbent or lateral,)         am persuaded, from
                                                      I
what  I  have herein discovered, that we should have        greater    a
result than (the maximum allowed) 14 or              lbs. per inch
                                                              1 5
for its energy. The excess of which energy would be in                           a
direct ratio to the peifection of this vacuum, in comparison
with that of the barometer and those of the air-pump
                                           :
cannot stand one moment in competition, for the reason
assigned   above.
    And  yet so well grounded were the antient philosophers
"  in all space being occupied                 by
                                  some agent or other," that

mum."       And although I will not take upon me to justify
all  their decisions, or even this dogma itself upon their
principle ; yet as this seems the ne plus ultra of human
means to procure one, and which, after all, appears not to
be absolutely so, I think their assertion is not remote
enough from truth to justify a rash contradiction on our
part, or to arraign the profunditv of their knowledge.        But
to return:    How great must be the velocity, how great
the mechanical collision, to rend asunder with such force
so well compacted a substance as the glass of which these
granades are made, even after making every reasonable
allowance for its want of annealing, wnich no doubt in
creases its fragility, while it hardens the surface ! There
must be something more than mere mechanical influx, or
consequent collision, to rend asunder and reduce to powder
an impregnable mass, which is capable of resisting the
weight of many tons, sustaining the force of a large vice,
or the rude strokes of a hammer (after allowing for the
geometric resistance on the external attack, and the want of
the same in the internal force) used in breaking them, be
fore this phrenomenon will be satisfactorily explained.
   And without giving a more elaborate definition than the
thing is obviously susceptible of, I conceive this cause to be
electricity : and that, in the formation of the drop, after the
caloric particles have pervaded the glass and subsided, this
matter, like a lambent flame, attaches to and lines the inte
rior surface or cavities, 'as in the Leyden jar ; and by this
hermetic accident (for it is not properly art) may remain
prisoner for many centuries ; but yet, though pent up, (being
perfectly insulated) is not diminished : therefore, upon
opening the conduit pipe of communication in the tail, the
affinity the inclosed effluvium has with that in the air, our
hands, or whatever else breaks them, causes that violent de
tonation, and the destruction thereof considered therewith to
take place, and the force of the explosion is (cczierhs paribus)
in a compound, direct, ratio with the capacity of the cavi
ties, and the strength of materials.
   Thus is  is,  when a   vacuum   isinduced of necessity, and
of materials which, while thev are extremely friahle on the
one hand, are impervious to both influx and efflux on the
other; (hence the want of these appearances in breaking
steel, &.c.) and void of every other occupant than this
elastic vapour, which     isgenerated in their first formation,
which, like seed in the womb, stems to be the very germ or
rudiment of elementary fire, and only waits the invitation
of excitation to manifest itself and whenever this excita-

tlon is begun, how irresistible are the effects produced by
it!     I believe nothing in nature (if small things might be
compared with great) is more analogous to an earthquake
than the bursting ot one of these little tears of glass, or
more like it in its cause ; for both arise from a sudden
combustion of a latent and inflammable principle contained
in their interior parts ; and both alike cause a derangement
of the parts which heretofore formed their orbicular prisons.
   To ascertain whethei they were charged plus or minus*,                    I
placed them in an insulated situation, on a large flint glass-
condensing receiver; and with a hammer of the same kind
of glass (both being well excited) I broke some of them at
the small end : but, contrary to my expectation, the result
was the same as if broken in my hand.
    I next placed some of them on a table, which I knew to
be a good conductor, and with my glass mallet or hammer
 I broke several more with precisely the same effect.
    I  also broke some with a conducting,                 i. e, a common
hammer, upon the excited receiver, but there was no diffe
 rence in the effect : for all the means I made use of (how
ever varied) were productive of the same appearances as
when broken in my hand, or by the collision of a conduct
ing substance, while they were placed upon another con
ductor.
    And now, having varied the experiment by all the means
I could devise, except I had tried the air-pump, (which                      I
could not do, as I had not got an open receiver,) I began to
doubt whether electricity had any share in this pbaenome-
non or not, and to conclude the effect must be purely me
chanical (for I would not call it a lusus naturee) ; when
what compensated all my trouble, and put the matter past
doubt, was this :
    I darkened the room entirely, having previously furnished
myself with a clear strong glass receiver to prevent the ac
cident of the pieces flying into my eyes ; then directing
these organs of vision by the feel, 1 broke several in this in-
closure, where they uniformly produced a bright corrusca.-
tion like lightning; which, together with the more than
mechanical snap they make upon breaking, quite satisfied
   * To those who are unacquainted with the
                                                history of electricity, it may
be needful to observe, that the terms plus and minus,      + — ; positive ana
negative; vitreous and resinous; are not six different electrical qualities;
but three sets of equivalent terms, in different systems of the same science,
indicative of the two or contrary principles which reciprocally attract each
other, and cause what is called the electrii shock.     There are also other
terms by way of designating the same principles, as terrene and atmospheric ,-
but these arc not so common.

  striking    the internal surface which so forcibly rends them
  asunder, but a compound effect of that and electrical affi

  actual experiments, makes me believe the phenomenon of
  these little philosophical enigmas is nearly explored.              And
  although I would not say the subject is entirely exhausted,
  yet this solution has so satisfied my mind, that I cannot

 improperly be denominated ranamalguSj or frog-sucker.

       DEAR SIR,                   No. I, Hinde-street, Manchester-square.

       Case    of Consumption    cured by    Hydro-azotic Gas.
    James Davis,     set. 25, living with Mr. Chambers, banker.
Bond-street, as groom, had all the marked symptoms of a
confirmed galloping consumption, violent cough, frequent
 pains in the side, shortness of breathing, the expectoration
very copious, of an opaque appearance, night sweats con
stantly, wasted almost to a shadow, and extremely weak,
arising from a cold proceeding from putting on a damp
shirt, and being wet through, in March 1805.                    The vio
lence of this disease had existed two months.                He was re
commended by Joseph Workman, who had been similarly
affected, servant of captain Bond, also cured by the same
plan.      This patient inhaled the hydro-azotic gas, and he
took at the same time tonic medicines, as bark, eolumbo,
with myrrh, with occasional aperients ; and, following
                                 Y4                                  this

 this plan for six weeks, he was restored to perfect health.
 The patient is now before me, Sept. 14, 1805 ; ami in
excellent health, looks well, is fat, has since had no com
 plaint of any kind, and is an additional proof of the virtue
 of the aerial remedy.

    Observations on tlus Case. — The same opinions arise here
as  in other cases : but the pneumatic practice is more par
ticularly necessary, as tonics would only augment the
malady, if applied alone, as the lungs are locally inflamed ;
and the lowering plan would only nave aided the debility
induced from this local cause, exciting an immoderate mor
bid secretion from the lungs.
LII. A simple       Method   of making   Tubes of elastic Gvm or
  Caoutchouc,     to avoid the Expense    of Solution in AZther.
Oplit     a stick  of cane, and then apply together again the
split  pieces,   but with a slip of whalebone interposed be
tween them.        Cut the elastic gum into slips fit for twist
ing over the prepared cane, so as to cover it ; then, by duly
heating the surface of the cane covered with the caoutchouc,
it will melt so as to form one piece.      When cold, draw out
the interposed whalebone from between the split cane ; by
which means, without difficulty, the whole substance of the
cane may then be readily withdrawn from under the cover
ing, thus leaving the tube formed as desired.
   Some recommend winding small thread                 round the
twisted gum clastic, to help to unite the joinings, and em
ploy the heat of boiling water.

ject   deserves to meet with a favourable reception.        This
 observation, in our opinion, is very applicable to the pre
 sent work, as it relates chiefly to a country interesting to
 Great Britain, uHtler various points of view, and which, in
 the present situation of public affairs, may again afford
British soldiers an opportunity of showing what they are
 able to achieve, when commanded by able and experienced
officers.
     These sketches are divided into three parts. The first
        the medical history, or rather the journal, of the exped
fives
   ition : in the second, the author, after attempting to as
sign the causes of the diseases which prevailed, proposes
some modes of prevention : and in the third, some account
of   the diseases is given.
     " The   first division of the army intended for the expedi
tion to Egypt, under colonel Murray, sailed from Bombay
in January, 1801. Their voyage was rather a tedious one,
and the small- pox and a remittent fever broke out among
them. They touched for refreshments at Mocha and at
Jedda, and on the 16th May, 1801, came to anchor in
Kossier-bay ; the prevailing winds in the Red Sea, at this
time, rendering it impossible to get so far up as Suez. .
     " The second division of troops (originally intended for
another time) , under colonel Beresford, sailed from Point
de Galle, in Ceylon, on the 19th February ; and on the 19th
May disembarked at Kossier.
     " The last division, under colonel Ramsay, sailed from
Trincomalee, in Ceylon.          They were later of arriving at
Kossier, and were not able to cross the desert before July.
     " At Kossier there is a fort and a town, if they deserve
the name.        They are built of mud, and the Arabs inhabit
them only at the season when caravans arrive with the
pilgrims for Mecca, and with corn for that and the other
ports on the opposite Arabian coast."
     Soon after the arrival of the troops at Kossier, they were
all attacked with a diarrhoea, occasioned by the water, which
contained much sulphate of magnesia. At first the men
were greatly debilitated by it ; but as they became used to
the water, it ceased to affect their bawels : on the whole,
however, it appeared to have produced salutary effects, and
tbe army for some time was uncommonly healthy.
    On the 19th of July, 1801, the 88th, with two companies
of the 80th regiment, under the command of colonel Beres
ford, as the advance of the army, commenced the march
across the desert ; but as they had the digging of wells, and
other duties to perform, they did not reach tbe banks of the
                                                             Nile

                   Notices respecting New Books.
  Nile until the next month.      The rest of the army marched
  on the following davs, the marches being always performed
  by night, and the army, with very inconsiderable loss, reached
  the banks of the Nile in a very healthy state.     The course
 it pursued was nearly that travelled by Mr. Bruce. During
  almost the whole of July the army was encamped on the
  banks of the Nile, which now began to overflow its banks
 near Ghenne; they, however, soon prepared to move, and
 detachments went up to Thebes, Luxor, and the cataracts, to
  press all the boats; and about the end of the month the
 army began to move to Lower Egypt. The lOtb regiment
 marched to Girge, the capital of Upper Egypt, sixty miles
 below Ghenne, and on the 27th and following days the rest
  of the army was embarked in boats. The thermometer
 had a wide range at Ghenne ; in the author's marquee it va
 ried from 71° to 108n, on the 20th it rose to 1110, and in
 the open air the heat was from 70° to 1 1 5°.
     By tl»e 1 2th of August, the greater part of the army,
 after a navigation on the Nile of nearly four hundred miles,
 arrived at Ghiza. As they landed, the troops were uncom
 monly healthv ; but in three weeks the sick of the army ex
 ceeded one thousand.       A considerable number of ophthal
 mic cases occurred, but the prevailing disease was fever; in
 general it was of short duration, of two, three, or five days-
 at most, and rarely proved fatal.      In the month of Sep
 tember the plague made its appearance in the hospital of
 the 88th regiment, in the neighbourhood of Rosetta, which
 rendered it necessary to adopt measures for preventing the
 further progress of this destructive scourge.     Next to the
 plague, the most formidable disease in the army, from its
general prevalence, was ophthalmia.        In the 10th and 88th
regiments there were upwards of three hundred and fifty
cases, and the total number in the army exceeded six hun
 dred.     Dysentery and hepatitis prevailed very generally
among all the European corps, and the mortality of the
month was very considerable.        In the month of January,
 1802, the cases of plague in the Indian army amounted to
72, in March the number was 46, and in May 26.
    On the last day of April, orders arrived from England to
general Baird, to return with his army to India, and to de
tach the 10th, 6 1 st, and 88th regiments, which were placed
on the British establishment.       On the 3d, the Indian army
began   to  march  to Ghiza,  where  it remained encamped by
the pyramids for some days, until water and other neces
saries for the passage over the desert were reported to be
ready. They crossed the river, encamped at Boulac, set off
                                                           from

                Notices respecting  New Books.             343
from Cairo, and,      passing the ruins of Heliopolis, made
El Hadje their first   stage.   Their marches over the desert
of Suez, as in crossing the great desert, were all performed
during the night, and they always encamped hy sun-rise in.
the morning.     By the end of the month, the whole corps,
except the 7th Bombay regiment, had crossed the desert,
and arrived at Suez.     Part of the army was encamped near
the town of Suez, and part at Moses Wells, nine miles on
the eastern side of the Red Sea.    The march over the desert
of Suez was performed with much greater ease than that
over the desert of Thebes.     The weather was cool and fa^
vourable ; the hot winds were less felt, and they found
abundance of good water provided at the different stations.
On the 2d of June, the embarkation commenced, and by
the 1 5th the whole army was embarked, and had sailed for
the different presidencies, except the 7th regiment, which,
on account of the plague still prevailing in it after the rest
of the army had embarked, was ordered to remain two
months.      Most of the corps of the army embarked in the
most healthy state.
    " To conclude," says the author, " never, perhaps, was
there an army embarked for any service more healthy than
the Indian army was when it re-embarked on its return
from Egypt.
    " Previously to the arrival of the army from Egypt, in
order to provide against the introduction of the plague into
 India, quarantines were established at the presidencies of
Bombay, Bengal, and Madras, as well as at the island of
 Ceylon. The principal of these was at Butcher's Island,
near Bombay, where there were pest and quarantine esta
blishments, of which, on my arrival in June, I took the
charge. At this period, letters from Dr. Short, at Bagdad,
and from Mr. Milne, at Bassorah, described the plague as
raging in Persia, and particularly at Ispahan and Bagdad : in
consequence of this information, every vessel, both from
the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, was ordered to Butcher's
 Island.
    " As  the ships arrived, the troops from the Red Sea were
landed; but. the artillery, 86th regiment, 1st Bombay regi
ment, and the commissariat department, were so uncom
monly healthy, that I detained them but a very few days on
the island.
    " The 7th Bombay regiment landed at Butcher's Island
in August.     As this was the cprps in which the plague had
              prevailed,  though they were not      unhealthy,
frincipally
   judged it prudent  to detain them a month.     On my    last
                                                    inspection

 inspection of them before, they left the island, of a total of
 seven hundred, including        sepoys, their wives, and the
 public and private followers of the corps, I found only four
 sick, and these I believe were all catarrhs.
    " Dr. Henderson, with the pest-establishment, and all
 those whom we had left at Suez, arrived at Butcher's Island
on the 1st September. The convalescents from the plague,
as well as the guard, and the pest-house servants, were, on
their arrival, all of them very healthy : but T thought it safe
to keep them in quarantine on the island till October; when,
 like all the others who had been in quarantine, they were
 provided with new clothing and sent over to Bombay.
    " The company's packets from Bassorah, and the vessels
which arrived from the Persian Gulf, had none of them the
least suspicious appearance, and J. found that their crews
were all very healthy.
    " I had likewise the satisfaction to receive accounts from
the medical gentlemen employed in the expedition, after
their arrival at Calcutta, Madras, and Ceylon: their ac
counts were so late as November.        In none of the corps did
any death occur from the time of embarkation at Suez."
    In part second, the author gives some observations on the
climate of Egypt, as connected with the diseases which pre
vail in that country.
    " The cultivated part of Egypt, particularly the Delta, is
a very rich country; in fertility and luxuriance of soil yield
ing to none under the face of heaven.       The art of husbandry
is there but imperfectly known ; and at their harvests there
is a very great destruction of vegetable matter, from which
hydrogene gas, or hydro-carbonate, is extricated in great
quantities.     Under similar circumstances, in America as
well as in India, I have seen a bad fever of the intermittent
or remit tent- type appear.    But in Egypt after the subsiding
of the Nile, which in many places had covered a great ex
tent of country, there is a great exhalation from the mud,
and from the putrid animal and vegetable matters left be
hind. The effluvia of these substances, acting on the human,
body, will readily account for much disease. If we add to these
the extreme filth of the inhabitants of Egypt, their poor diet,
their narrow, close, and ill-ventilated apartments, generally
much crowded, with the extreme narrowness of their streets,
and the bad police of their towns, we shall not be astonished
if a fever, at first intermittent or remittent, should have
symptoms denominated malignant, superadded to the more
ordinary symptoms of the disease.          If an imported conta
gion   should  make    its appearance   at  the same time, and
                                                           under

                  Notices respecting    New Books.                  345
under the above circumstances, we expect a most terrible
disease.
    " The dry parching wind, which comes over the desert,
and which at certain seasons blows in Egypt and in Arabia, is
well known, and was often severely felt by the army on their
march, both across the desert and the isthmus of Suez.
The whirlwinds of sand roll with great impetuosity, are
very troublesome, and insinuate fine sand and dust every
where.     It is hardly possible to keep the minute particles
out of the eyes.
    " The dews, which fall in Egypt, I always heard were
very heavy, and were a cause of the diseases of the country.
I  had occasion too, more than once, to hear the natives at
tribute much to them as the cause of their diseases ; with
what justice I will not pretend to decide. From some ex
periments which I made in India, on the Red Sea, and lastly
in Egypt, I am inclined to think that they are equally heavy
in the two former as in the latter quarter.      After weighing
the matter carefully, I took a quantity of lint, twelve inches
square, exposed it for a night to the dew, and, by weighing
it in the morning again, ascertained the quantity which it
had gained.      I am aware that this is by no means a nice ex-
             and that in the performance of it several particu-
 ars demand attention ; but it is sufficient to our purpose,
f>criment,
and I learned by     it,that, in the island of Bombay, on the
Red Sea, and in Lower Egypt, the quantity of dew which
falls    nearly equal.

were in Egypt, the season was not the usual one. There
was     greater overflow of the Nile.

    " The fall of rain at Alexandria was greater than on for
mer years; and, at Rosetta, the rains were in setting-in later
than usual. The season of the plague set-in much earlier
than usual*.
    " In general, the Thebaid, or Upper Egypt, healthier  is
than the Lower. Never were troops more healthy than the
army when encamped near Ghenne.
   " Ghiza, the antient Memphis, at the time the army
disembarked there from Upper Egypt, we found to be                    a
very unhealthy quarter.        For considerable time, and im

the station of large armies : alternately of Turks, Mamelukes,
French, and English. From all these armies a number died
at Ghiza, and there was much filth and noxious effluvia.
We saw there enough of putrid animal matter to generate
contagion.       Whether this was or was not the cause of the
fever which prevailed, 1 will not attempt to decide. One
circumstance may be mentioned : we were here joined by a
detachment of the 86th regiment under colonel Lloyd,
which, for     some months before, had been doing duty with
the vizier's army, which never was healthy. That the cir
cumstances which existed at the time of our occupying
Ghiza were the cause of the fever, is manifest from this, that,
subsequently to the army going to the coast, the garrison
left in it found Ghiza a most healthy quarter.         The same
objections are to be made to Rhoda that are applicable to any
marshy situation."
    In the third part of this work, which gives an account of
the diseases of Egypt, Mr. Macgregor has brought forward
some new facts in regard to the plague, and particularly the
treatment, which are well worth the attention of medical
men in general, and of those in particular who may visit
countries where this disease is prevalent.       It is commonly
believed, that the progress of this contagion is stopped by ex
tremes of both heat and cold: but if this be true in regard to
heat, it did not appear to be so in the army of Egypt in re
gard to cold; for the period at which the plague raged most'
was in the coldest months.         In regard to the treatment,
nitric acid was given internally, and where the patients would
drink it it showed good effects. Bark, wine, and opium,
were largely administered, and at a certain stage the cold
bath, for the purpose of obviating that debility which always
appeared to be very great.       At first, calomel was used only
as a purgative, but at last the use of this remedy was carried
farther.     " On the whole," says the author, " in mercury
and the nitric acid we appear to have excellent remedies for
the plague ; but they must be very early and very liberally ex
hibited.     If the first stage is allowed to pass over before
they   are  given, the season of doing it with advantage is in
danger   of  being lost."   In regard to preventive means, the
following'   observation   seems  so well calculated to remove
that despondency which generally prevails when the plague
exercises its ravages, that we cannot help quoting it.
   " There was hardly a corps in the army," says the author,
"  where, at one period or other, the disease did not make its
appearance; but it was always in our power to arrest its pro
gress.    In well regulated corps, where a rigid discipline was*
             8                                          enforced,

               Notices respecting   New Booh.             347
enforced, and proper attention to the interior economy was
paid, it rarely happened, indeed, that much difficulty wag ex
perienced in eradicating the contagion.     As our success in
the prevention," add* he,    " was so great, all that remains
for me is to mention the substance of general Baird's order to
the army on the subject.
   " 1st, To every hospital, an observation-room, or in lieu
of it a tent was attached ; and to it even- case whatever with"
febrile symptoms was sent, as soon as discovered, and was
there most strictly watched by the surgeon.
   " 2dly, On any symptoms of the plague appearing, the
case was instantly sent to the pest-house from the observa
tion-room of the regimental hospital : the patient was ac
 companied by the medical gentlemen of this corps who
attended    him, and who gave the medical gentlemen at
 the pest-house an account of the previous treatment of the
case.
   "   If any doubt remained, the patient in the first instance
was placed in the observation-room of the pest-house ; and,
if the disease did not turn out to be plague, he was sent" to
the quarantine.
   "   3dly, In every corps, and in every department, a minute
inspection by the surgeon was made twice a week ; and every
person with the smallest appearance of     ill  -health was sent
to the hospital.
    " 4thly, Every corps or hospital, where case of plague
                                               a
had appeared, was put into    a  state of quarantine;    and, in
such corps or hospital, an inspection     by   the surgeons was
made at least two or three times day; and every case with
                                    a
 suspicious symptoms was ordered to the observation-room.
    " 3thly, In suspected corps was ordered, that, under
                                    it
the inspection of    a   commissioned officer, every person
 6hould be bathed more frequently, and at stated periods     ;
 and, likewise, that all their clothing and bedding should be
 frequently washed and baked. To all the hospitals, ovens
 and smoking-rooms were attached.
     " flthly, Quarters of corps, hospitals, and ground of en--
 campments, were frequently changed.
     " 7thly, Much to be attributed to the nitrous- fumiga
                    is
 tion. In several instances    it  was attended with the best
 effects.    The lamps, with this, were kept constantly burn
 ing in the observation-rooms, and in the rooms from which
 the cases of the plague had come.       Vessels, with the maw
 terials for the fumigation, were likewise placed under the*
 beds, and in the corners of the rooms.      When our stock of
  nitre was at length exhausted, wc substituted marine sahr

 348              Notices respecting New Books.
  for it ; but this fumigation could not be kept up in rooms
  where the patients were all confined to their beds."
      The next malady which engages the author's attention is
  the ophthalmia, which in Egypt at particular seasons is a
  most generally-prevailing disease.       It is not, however, con
  fined to the human race ; the animals of the country, parti
  cularly the dogs and camels, are subject to its attacks. In
  Egypt it proved most distressing and obstinate. The French,
  it was said, sent from Egypt to France 1000 blind men.
  The number sent home from the English army was very
  considerable likewise.       Of the Indian army 50 were sent
  home invalids from blindness; most of whom were from the
  10th and 88th regiments.
     "  The disease, I think," says the author,     "    might gene
  rally be resolved into, 1st, either of Cullen's two species,
 the ophthalmia tarsi and the ophthalmia membranarum ;
  2dly, to a combination of these two ; or, 3dly, to a species
 of ophthalmia, frequent in India, symptomatic of disease in
 the biliary secretion.
     " The appearance which the disease put on, particularly
 the two first species of         it,
                                    was nearly what we have seen
 in other parts of the world except that the symptoms ad
                                 ;
 vanced with alarming rapidity to the highest inflammatory
 stages.     In most cases the attack was sudden, and very ge
 nerally at night.        Speedily, the patient complained of          a
 burning    heat  of the  eye-ball, or of
                                        a    sensation of needles
being passed through the eye. There was            a    considerable
 swelling   of  the  ball of the eye,  of the  eye-lids,  and some
times ol the neighbouring parts. Almost always, there was
a.  copious flow of tears, which felt hot and scalding, and, as
they flowed, excoriated the face down.            Very frequently,
there was     a racking head-ach and general fever. CEdema
of the eye-lids was frequently met with       in  the early stage of
the disease, and inversion of the cilia in the last stages.
     " The disease very often continued two or three months            :
after had continued some time, the general health became
         it
much impaired.         It  often terminated in diarrhoea or dysen
tery, and sometimes the patient became hectic.
     " In the third species of the disease, which   I     have men
tioned, there was not so much active inflammation as              in
                                                                  the
other two species and
                   ;        it was generally known      by   ayellow
tinge of the adnata, or      by  dyspeptic symptoms being pre
sent; though, sometimes, we have seen those appearances
absent: and no topical application had any effect in re
moving the ophthalmia, till the gums were affected           bycalo-:
sael,or some mercurial preparation,
                                                                  " In,

                  Notices respecting New Books.                 349
    " In   the two first species of the disease, the inflammation,
 in  a great  many instances, induced fever of many days du
ration, and the disease too frequently terminated in opacity
 of the cornea, or in suppuration of the eye-ball.
    "  In the treatment^ it appears, from the reports, that dif
 ferent gentlemen followed very different modes. We said, in
general, that the European practice did not succeed.         Scari
fication and astringent collyria, in the first stage, gave into
lerable pain> and generally aggravated the symptoms.
    "  The practice of the natives was, to apply, in the first
stage, emollient decoctions of their plants, and poultices of
the kali. In the last stage, they rely much on the frequently
bathing of the eye in the cold water of the Nile ; they are like
wise very fond of bleeding ; and I understood that some
times they use the actual cautery, burning behind the ear
where we usually apply blisters.
    " The practice, which appeared to be by far the most suc
cessful, was the following :
    " For the first twenty^-four or thirty-six hours after ad
mission, the eyes of every patient were carefully syringed
with tepid water, which had been filtered carefully.           The
syringing was performed from three to six times in the day;
the light was carefully excluded, the patient kept cool, and
every other part of the antiphlogistic regimen strictly en
forced. After the above period, a weak solution of sugar
of lead, or of caraphir, or vitriolated zinc, was applied.
Where the pain was much complained of, a solution of
opium was added to the collyrium ; opium was applied in a
cataplasm, or two or three drops of laudanum were let fall
into the eye.
    "  If there was much swelling, a saturnine poultice, or the
coagulum aluminosum, was applied to the eyes.                I ob
served, that blistering a large surface, and as near as pos
sible to the seat of the pain, if kept discharging for some
time, always afforded great relief.
    " To remove the fever and to alleviate the distressing pain,
we often gave opium internally in a considerable quantity,
and with great advantage.
    " Setons in the neck and the free use of bark appeared to
be of the greatest service, when the disease was of long
Standing.
    " In opacity of the cornea, and when there were specks,
several gentlemen thought highly of the aqua phagedsenica
of the old pharmacopoeias, after having divided the vessels
which went to the speck. It gave very pungent pain ; but

I have seen great relief from              it,   and also from   a   solution of
lunar caustic.

cessful     the general use of anointment, composed of white

and scarification.
  "   From the days of Prosper Alpinus, the salts contained
in the soil of Egypt have been supposed to be among the
principal causes of the ophthalmia of the country.    Though
the various modifications of light and heat no doubt act as
existing causes yet to the particular soil of Egypt, and to
                        ;
the constitution of the air there, we must look for the re
gular and the principal causes of this disease.
   " In Egypt several causes occurred, which in any country,
separately applied, would be adequate to the production of
violent ophthalmia       the dry, white, dazzling
                               :                    soil, and
the fine sand and dust constantly thrown about in whirl
winds and entering every crevice. If an ophthalmia        epi             is
demical or     endemic in Egypt, the above causes will ren

of the   breadth of sixpence was seen underneath ; which being
removed, the head of the worm was seen.           It was in ge
neral firmly attached, and required force to detach it from
the parts underneath. When detached with the forceps,
we twisted it round a ligature or piece of lint, and thus,
often on the first day, succeeded in extracting a foot, or
even two, of (he worm.         It resembled much what is called
bobbin, and was about the same size. It was transparent
and moist, a white liquid being seen in it. We continued,
daily, extracting as much of it as would come out with gentle
pulling.      It was always dangerous to pull strongly, for fear
of breaking the worm : it then occasioned the most acute
pain, and there followed much swelling, with inflammation of
the neighbouring parts, sometimes of two or three weeks
continuance ; when the worm would show itself at another
part, as at first, with itching and a blister.
    " It seldom appeared to be deeply seated ; generally,
under the cutis, or among the tela cellulosa, when we could
often trace it in its course, and sometimes see it : sometimes
it wa3 under the fascia, anti but seldom among the muscles.
    "  If not ushered in with fever, it was almost always at
 tended with it in its course : when there was considerable
 inflammation, it ran very high. In seven cases mortification
 took place, and very large sloughs were cast off".     In a few
 cases, there was a very considerable and alarming hae
 morrhage.
    " By presenting itself at different places, it would often
 leave two or three large, foul, and fistulous ulcers in dif
 ferent parts of a limb.      When the inflammation has run
 very high, as I have often seen of the whole leg or thigh ;
 and when a profuse suppuration followed j the worm fre
 quently has come out dead, often in pieces, with the sanies ;
 by which, probably, it had been eroded and killed.
     " Frequently, after extracting one worm from a patient,
 a second, a third, or even a fourth, would appear : after get
 ting one out of a leg, a second would appear in the other, a
 third in one hand, and a fourth in the other hand.
     " The guinea-worm, I believe, has been seen in every
  part of the body.     Though the extremities appear to be its
 favourite seats, vet the face, breast, back, penis, &c. are not
 exempted from its visits. 1 heard of a gentleman in Bombay
  who had one in his scrotum and penis, and of a lady who
  had one in the pudenda.

  " As to the  causes of the appearance of the guinea-worm,
and the mode in which it is generated, I must confess that
I have no account that I could venture to offer here.
  "  Indifferent parts of the world, the water drank is ac
cused of occasioning intestinal worms, as the taenia in Swit
zerland, and the taenia and the teretes in the West Indies j
where, likewise,  I have heard the mucilaginous vegetables
eaten assigned as a cause of the frequent appearance           of
worms.     In Russia, there is a worm, the lumbricus mili-
tensis, common near swampy grounds.            In Russia and in
Siberia, in the same  situations, the taenia inferualis prevails.
But,    afterwhat has been here stated, we cannot bring the
water,  drank  on board the Minerva, or at Bombay, to ac
count for the guinea-worm which prevailed : in factj the
water came from different and distant quarters, Bombay,
Ceylon, and Madras. Besides, the officers of the 68th,
and the artillery, drank the same water, and escaped.
   " No case of guinea-worm had been known among either
the Lascars or European sailors in the Minerva, when the
6Cth and 88th embarked in her.
   " I have good reason to think that the spreading of the
guinea-worm may be stopped, whenever it does appear.
The means which we adopted appeared to succeed.           Ex
treme attention to cleanliness is indispensably necessary.
   " In India the native doctors are much more successful
in getting out the worms, than Europeans.         After long
feeling with their fingers, for the body of the worm, they
make an incision as nearly as they can judge over its mid
dle, and, pulling the worm by a duplicature of            it,
                                                     draw out
both ends of the worm at one time.          have often endea

so delicate, and did not guide me so correctly as      did the

portion, and, not unfrequently, the whole worm.
   " Leeches, astringent and sedative lotions, cataplasms,
fomentations, &c. were applied, as required                  by
                                                    the circum
stances of the case.        A good deal of attention was paid
to the disease, in all its stages and several experiments were
                                         ;
made on the worm, which, however,             needless to detail
                                                   it   is
here.

absorbents, I   think that unctuous substances succeeded the
best, particularly mercurial ointment.      Passing an electri
cal shock through the part had no effect."
    We cannot conclude this article without expressing our
thanks to Mr. Macgregor, for the information he has added
to our stock of medical knowledge.        Having enjoyed op
portunities which seldom fall to the lot of medical practi
tioners, he seems to have exerted himself as much as the
shortness of the time would permit, to collect every obser
vation that might be useful either to himself or to others in
the same department.      Many of the facts which he presents
are new, and therefore worthy of more attention        his re      ;
marks on them are judicious, and appear to be the result of
a  sound judgment united to long experience.       In   word,      a
wc do not hesitate to recommend these sketches to the notice
of medical men in general and we have no doubt that they
                                 ;
will be found of great utility to those whose employment
may lead them to the same countries which were visited
by  the author.

   The society desires that the author will examine whether
the revolutions, progress, and decline of poetry, as well as
the variations of its forms, among civilized nations, have
followed the progress of their moral, civil, and religious
knowledge, and of the other sciences, or have been inde

the moral sciences prove that the application of metaphy

teach us, on the contrary, that no progress can be made in
these sciences but by observation, experiments, the conse
quences deduced from them, and the scientific calculations
established on these data ? And what rules does the history
of science prescribe in this respect, to those who wish to

of the organs, and their relation to the apparent symptoms
of different affections.
                      MATHEMATICAL JPART,
            By M. Delambre, perpetual Secretary.
                            GEOMETRY.
    Huygens has given in his treatise De Horologie Oscilla-
 torio the two following theorems, which may be applied to
 all solid bodies : Tlie centre of oscillation and that of suspen
sion are always reciprocal one with the other ; the same body
 is always isochronous to itself when it oscillates around pa
 rallel axes taken at equal distances from the centres of gra
vity. M. Biot has given to these theorems .a remarkable
 extension.
    All these parallel axes form the surface of a right cylin
der, the axis of which passes through the centre of gravity.
But the analytical expression under which M. Biot presents
 the theorem of Huygens showed him that an arbitrary in
clination might be given to this axis, provided that the radius
of the cylirlBer should be also changed in a proper manner.
By these means there will be obtained, according to the
 different values of the inclination, an infinite number of
cylinders the edges of which have the same properties as
 those of the primitive cylinder.         But this is not all : th«
 axis, without changing its inclination, may describe a coni
 cal surface around its primitive position, which still multi
plies the number of the cylinders already found, as many
 times as there may be conceived ridges on the surface of
the cone.
    The   same analytical expression being of the second degree
in   regard to the radius of the cylinder, or, what amounts to
                                Z4                              the

the same thing, in regard to the distance of the centre of
gravity from the point of suspension, this consideration
alone conducts to a theorem analogous to the first of the
two, for which we are indebted to Huygens; — a new proof
of the great fecundity of algebraical expressions, when one
lias the art of giving the most proper form to all their de
velopments.
      Measuring of Heights ly means of the Barometer.
    The celebrated experiment devised by Pascal, and which
proved that a column of mercury decreased in proportion
as the barometer was carried to a greater height, after havr
ing proved the gravity of the air, must have made the mer
cury be considered as a scale capable of measuring the height
to which it is carried.     But this scale being very small in
comparison of the heights which it ought to measure, it
was soon perceived that it would be necessary to improve
the construction of the barometer so far as to render sensi
ble and appreciable the smallest changes in the height of
the mercury.     The necessity of avoiding or of calculating
the continual variations which the barometer experiences,
even without changing its place, presented another obstacle
much more formidable, and which seemed to take away all
hope of approaching the truth, or coming near it. These
difficulties, however, philosophers have been able to surr
mount ; so that barometric measures, properly employed,
may vie in exactness with the trigonometrical measures, to
which they are superior on account of their facility and the
generality of the method.
    Among the different formulae given for the solution of
this problem, that of M. Laplace is distinguished by the
manner in which it has been deduced from theory ; but the
principal co-efficient, drawn from an observation which
appears not to have been free from error, might have need
of some modification.      This M, Ramond has examined in
a memoir, of which we shall give some account.          By his
numerous experiments made on different mountains, he
found what are the circumstances most favourable to such
 observations, as well as the hours which ought to be chosen
or avoided; for there are some causes the effects of which
must be very sensible, and which, however, it is impossible
 always to take into account in calculations.     Such are the
 ascending or descending winds,which, according to M. Ra
 mond, prevail almost constantly at certain hours.      Some,
 by lessening the weight of the column of air with which,
 the mercury is in equilibrium, must also lessen that column,
                                                           and

and make heights to be considered as too great          : descend
ing winds necessarily produce a contrary effect.          The mo
ment when the equilibrium of the atmosphere is not dis
turbed by either of these causes must therefore be chosen,
and that moment is the middle of the day.              But M. Ra-
mond observed also, that the descending winds prevail
oftener than others ; and he concludes that in general the
mean results of observations must give heights too small.
      To make a proper choice of the moment is not all ; no
less care and attention is requisite in the choice of the sta
tions : simultaneous observations, some made in the place
the height of which is required, and others in a fixed place
the height of which above the level of the sea is perfectly
 known, are necessary.          Those also who wish to verify a
formula must have the same knowledge of the height of the
mountain to which the barometer is carried ; and that no
objection may be made to the conclusion, it is necessary that
 the two stations should be sufficiently near, and that nothing
 interrupts the communication, so that the atmospheric va
 riations which arise in the one may also take place in the
 other. M. Ramond found all these advantages united in the
 Peak of Bigorre, and the town of Tarbes, where M. Dangos,
 a celebrated astronomer, was pleased to take upon himself
 the corresponding observations.
      It was bv these means, and with these attentions, that
 M. Ramond found the correction of the co-efficient of La
 place ; after which he applied the formula thus corrected,
 in conjunction with several other known formulae, to cal
 culate the aerostatic ascent of M. Gay-Lussac, who rose to
  the greatest height ever attained by man, since it surpasses
  that of all the mountains on the earth.
      He applies also all these formulae to the observations
 communicated to the class by M. Humboldt, and which
  were made on the highest mountains of Peru, and particu
  larly Chimboraco,        several hundreds of metres above the
  point    at which   Condamine,    the most intrepid of our acade
  micians, was obliged to stop.
       It results from all these formulae, that the formula of La
  place forms a pretty exact mean between alll the other for
  mulae; that it gives errors always very small, sometimes
  more sometimes less ; and that the sum of these errors di
  vided by the number of observations scarcely indicates
   I - ) oodth as the ulterior correction of the co-efficient de
  termined by M. Ramond.

                   Terrestrial Magnetism.
   The observations of the magnetic needle which M. Hum
boldt made with great care in the countries which he vi
sited, have given M. Biot the idea and the means of making
researches in regard to the mathematical theory of terres
trial magnetism*.
                        GEOGRAPHY.
   The results of the attempts hitherto made by the society
in England for making discoveries in the interior parts of
Africa are well known. By the accounts of the different
travels it caused to be undertaken, the difficulties and danger
which   attend such expeditions are seen, and it may therefore
be readily conceived why that part of the world is so little
known. There was reason to think that the antients had a
more extensive and correct knowledge of it ; and in conse
quence of this idea the Class of the Moral and Political Sci
ences proposed, as the subject of a prize in the year 9, a
comparison of the geography of Ptolemy concerning the
interior of Africa with what has been since written on it by
modern authors and those of the middle ages.         As no me
moir was presented, and as the subject of the prize was
withdrawn, M. Buache thought it his duty to communi
cate to the class a detail of the researches which he had be
fore made on the same subject. In 1787, before the forma
tion of the English African Society, he had announced his
opinion in regard to      in memoir read in public sitting
                                it,    a                          a

all the ideas before received, was of such      nature as to ex

Africa, and to furnish some information useful to new tra
vellers, and to the learned who are interested in the progress
of discovery. By allowing to the knowledge of the antients
much more extent than is generally supposed, he is obliged,
by the gross errors which he corrects, and of which he
shows the cause, to deny the exactness ascribed to them by
some authors.     As we cannot here give an idea of this la
bour, we shall confine ourselves to the principal results.
According to the opinion of M. Buache, the knowledge of
the antients along the western coasts of Africa extended as
far as the Cape of Palms, and to the commencement of the
Gulph of Guinea : they had only a vague idea of that gulph,
because they durst not enter  it;but they sailed without dif
ficulty as far as Sierra Leone and the banks of St. Anne,
which represent to us the Hypodromos JEthiopice     ;   and all
the coast to that place was well known to them. On this
first point M. Buache agrees with Danville and major Ren-
ncl.
   In  regard to the interior of that country the antients di
stinguished two large rivers, the Niger and the Gir.      Ac
cording to Danville, whose opinion has been hitherto
adopted, the Niger was that great river which waters Ni-
gritia, directing its course from west to east;  and the Gir,
that which waters the kingdom of Bournon from north to
south, and which then proceeds to the Nile.         According
to M. Buache, the Niger of Ptolemy       is
                                             composed of the
river Senegal and that part of the Joliba discovered by
Mungo Park, and the Gir            river which waters Nigritia
                             is
                             a
along with the Joliba.      M. Buache, therefore, establishes
on the Joliba and the Senegal the people and towns which
Ptolemy has placed near the river Niger and transports to
                                          ;
Nigritia, on the Niger of Danville, the people and towns
which Ptolemy indicates on the Gir.
  It  appears to M. Buache, that the antients carried on
along the coasts and into the interior of Africa the same
trade that they do at present, and in the same manner.
They had establishments on the coast, and on the great      ri
vers which proceed thither, such as the Senegal and the
Gambia  :  they extended their commerce as far as the hanks
of the Gir, but they did not penetrate beyond that river to
wards the south.     Ptolemy speaks of no town beyond the
Gir,  but gives only the names of different tribes.
  A   very curious observation, which     worthy of further
                                         is
research,   isthat of several tribes whose names are twice
mentioned, and which are at considerable distances in Pto-

lemy's map. There are six in that part of the Barbary coast
comprehended between the two Syrtes, and depending on
 the kingdom of Tripoli.       Such are the Astacuri, the Dolo-
 pians,  the  Mimaci,    the  Samamyci, the Nigheni, and the
Esopaei.     It is well   known   that this part of the coast of
Africa is that by which a communication may be most
easily opened with the country of Nigritia, because there
 are fewer deserts to be traversed, and because the kingdoms
of Fezzan, Agadez, and others, where refreshments can be
procured, are found on the route.          It is to be remarked,
that it is to the south of the sources of the Gir that the
names of the above tribes arc found ; and they are at a
small distance from each other, and near the coast of Bar
bary.     M. Buache presumes, till further information be
obtained, that these tribes were colonies of those on the
coast of Barbary, and that the countries which they occupy
 to the south of the sources of the Gir, are the most fertile
and richest of the interior of Africa. This memoir con
tains other observations equally interesting, which may af
ford encouragement to the prosecution of discoveries in this
part of the earth.
                            ASTRONOMY.
    M. Burckhardt, who received the first intelligence of the
new planet discovered by M. Harding, has constantly fol
lowed, more than any of our astronomers, the progress of
this almost imperceptible body ; he has endeavoured also to
determine the elements of its orbit.        On the 16th Vende-
miairehe presented to the class an ellipsis, the great semi-
axis of which, or the mean distance from the sun, was
nearly the same as that of Ceres and Pallas, and its eccen
tricity greater than that even of Mercury. In regard lo the
inclination, it is much less than that of Pallas, but greater
than that of any other planet. M. Burckhardt, before he
arrived at this ellipsis, had tried a parabola, and then a circle.
Twenty days after he read a new memoir, which confirmed
all his former, results ; but he gave to each element a more
approximate value. On the 3d of Nivose he made known
to us a third ellipsis, which differs from the second only
by quantities almost insensible, and which cannot .be im
proved but by means of more numerous observations, and
made at more remote periods.
   M. Gauss, correspondent of the Institute, published also
in Germany the elements of the same planet, founded, in a
great measure, on other observation's, and which differ very
utile from those of M. Burckhardt.

the theory of which still announces greater difficulties to
those who may wish to determine              it,   by
                                             calculating all the
perturbations    may experience,
                it                 seems    sufficiently known
to be found without much trouble, when disengaged so far
from the solar rays as to be again visible.
                        Solstitial Equinoxes.
    We gave an account the preceding year of the observa
tions made with Borda's circle at the observatory Rue de
Paradis, to determine the equinoxes and the solstices. Since
our last public sitting the same astronomer has observed two
new equinoxes and two solstices for the sky was too often
                                        ;
obscured during the latter part of Prairial     yet, as he let slip
                                                    :
no opportunity, we have already collected great number of
                                                        a
observations of the solstice which took place                    in
                                                         the night
between the second and third of Messidor, to be assured
that the observations which we hope still to make may pro
duce great changes in the definitive result.
    The observation of the solstices was employed            the an-  by
tient astronomers to determine the length of the longest
 day in every climate, and the height or the pole for the
 place of observation. At present, we have means much
 more precise for ascertaining the height of the pole            and       ;
 in regard to the length of the longest day, we already know
it   with more than sufficient exactness.        But the solstices
 are still no less interesting to astronomy, which has no other
 method so natural of determining the obliquity of the eclip
 tic that
     ;     is   to say, the angle formed           by
                                              the planes      which    in
 the annual and diurnal revolutions of the earth arc effected                    ;
 the fundamental element which enters into all our calcula
 tions, and the fixing of which          matter of so much deli
                                        is
                                        a
 cacy, that observations cannot be multiplied too much to
  determine properly either the precise extent      had at  it given       a
  period, or the variation which       annually experiences.
                                        it
     It results from the observations of which we here give an
  account, that  by   a mean of twelve solstices, both of winter
  and summer, the mean obliquity must have been 23° 27'
  57" at the commencement of the 19th century, and that
it   would be lcs9         \" or 2"

  not obliged to suppose       amass respecting which there still

 remains some doubt.        The observations of Lacaille, Brad
  ley, and Mayer, compared with those which we have men
 tioned, and those of the most celebrated modern observers,
 furnish quantities the extremes of which are 44" and 56"
 for the present century; theory gives 52"; and this result
 has been adopted in the solar tables now printing.
    The observation of the equinoxes furnishes the most na
 tural and most exact means of knowing the length of the
 year, the apparent motion of the sun, and the point of the
 heavens from which the motion of all the stars is reckoned.
 The five last equinoxes, and more particularly those of the
 year 13, have fully confirmed the correction of from 4"
 to 5", made some years ago, in the right ascensions of the
 stars, which serve as a foundation to all our calculations.
    M. Pictet, correspondent, has communicated to us the
 observation of an occultation of the Pleiades by the moon,
 made at the observatory of Geneva.
    An occultation of w of Scorpio, observed on the 28th of
Messidor, year 12, on the summit of Casuelta, a mountain
in the kingdom of Valencia, has been found among the
 papers of M. Mechain, and will appear in the 6th volume
 of the Memoirs of the Class. This is the last observation
made by an astronomer whose premature loss the Institute
will long regret.
    There was found also among his papers a series of ob
servations of the comet which he discovered at Barcelona
in 1793; it is also printed in the 6th volume of the Me
moirs, and will soon appear.
    M. Humboldt read in one of our sittings a memoir on
the longitude of Mexico, the capital of the kingdom of the
same name.
    Geographers were little agreed in regard to the position
of that important point. The considerable difference which
M. Humboldt found between his first observations and the
last which were made by him, induced him to repeat them
as often as he could, and by different methods.          The di
stance of  the  moon   from   the stars, and the eclipses of se
veral satellites of Jupiter, constantly gave him the same re
sult ; which is incoutestably preferable to all those wt"-v
had appeared before.

A     letter   from Italy, dated August 10, says: "Mr.
Hayter,    who obtained permission from the king of Naples
to unroll the manuscripts found in Herculaneum, begins now
to reap the fruits of his labours and patience. The eleven
young men whom he employs for this purpose have become
very expert, and labour with more dexterity than their pre
decessors.    Mr. Hayter entertains hopes that he has found
a whole Menander, Ennius, and Polybius.        He has found
a Greek writer named Colotos, whose philosophical works
were before totally unknown.      A valuable discovery is an
entire copy of Epicurus, of which we had before only frag
ments.     There are still 600 manuscripts in the Museum of
Fortici."
   Naples, June 25.— According to the reports made to go
vernment of the state of the famous ruins of the antient
city of Paestum ; and particularly the largest of the three
temples, which having been damaged by lightning was in
danger of falling down, orders were given for its restoration.
This design, however, having been prevented by different
obstacles, the counsellor of state charged with the depart
ment of the fine arts, M. Seralli, sent to Paestum, at the
end of the last year, don Felix Nicolassi, superintendant-
general of the search for antiquities throughout the king
dom, in order to remove the rubbish from the largest of
the three temples, to examine        it,
                                      and draw up   a plan for
its restoration.    When the superintendant arrived along
with Antonio Buonucci, he drew up plan for the restora
                                             a
tion of this monument of antiquity which, being approved
                                         j
 by government, was carried into execution in the course of
the present year. During his stay at Paestum, while super
intending the works undertaken for removing the rubbish
which disfigured this antient monument, M. Nicolassi
caused researches    by digging to be made in several places,
which were    attended  with the best success.   He found, in
different  tombs   into which  he entered,  bronze  arms, the
sculpture of which was perfect, and which were highly in
 teresting on account of the very remote period to which they
belonged. He found there also bronze urns of the most
 elegant form  ;  some of baked clay, exceedingly curious,
 both in regard to their form, the subjects represented on

number of military instruments and utensils, used for sacred
as well as domestic purposes.      Exact descriptions of these
articles, as well as of the paintings found in these tombs,
are to be published.
   Government, ho less attentive to the preservation of the
objects of antiquity which exist in the environs of Puzzolij
has charged M. Nicolassi to' clear away the ruins which
encumber the temple of Jupiter Serapis. The labour has
been already begun ; and this antient temple will soon be
entirely discovered, and freed from the stagnant water
formed around    it,and which occasioned the greatest incon
venience in regard to the salubrity of the air in that country.

 opinion, from any further apprehension of new shocks.
     " In the course of yesterday, till seven o'clock in the

terrace, and wished me to come; — hut the scene before me
kept me some minutes longer. — I joined her, and had not
sat down a minute when her English maid called to us that
the eruption was beginning.          In an instant we were on the
terrace, and observed its having overflowed on the same
side as last year, and rushed down with such rapidity as to
run more than a mile in ten minutes, and in a very short
time it reached the valley towards Torre del Greco.             This
stream of lava was immense, and extended with amazing
rapidity over the country ; it divided itself in three branches,
one of which, beyond the Torre del Greco, surrounded the
country-house of the cardinal archbishop of Naples, and be
fore morning reached the sea, and continued running into
it. The stream of lava is much diminished ; but when it
broke out last night, about ten minutes after ten o'clock,

Certificate   of  the Evidence of Mr. Jesty, the Inoculator of
            his Family for the Cow-pock in 1 7 74.
   Mr. Benjamin Jesty, of Downsbay in the isle of Pur-
beck, having, agreeably to an invitation from the Medical
Establishment or the Original Vaccine Institution, Broad-
street, Golden Square, visited London in August 1805, to
communicate certain facts relating to the cow-pock inocu
lation : We think it a matter of justice to himself, and be
neficial to the public, to attest, that, among other facts, he
has afforded decisive evidence of his having vaccinated his
wife and two sons, Robert and Benjamin, in the year 1 774,
who were thereby rendered unsusceptible of the small-pox ;
as appears from the exposure of all the three parties to that
disease frequently during the course of 31 years; and from
the inoculation of the two sons for the small-pox 15 years
ago — That he was led to undertake this novel practice in
 1774, to counteract the small pox, at that time prevalent
 at Yetminster (where he then resided), from knowing the.
 common opinion of the country ever since he was a hoy,
 now above sixty years ago, that persons who had gone
 through the cow-pock naturally, i. e. by taking it from
 cows, were unsusceptible of the ^mall-pox — By himself
 being incapable of taking the small-pox, having gone
 through the cow-pock manv years before — From having
 personally known many individuals, who, after the cow-
                                     Aa 2                        pock,

pock, could not have the small-pox excited — From believ
ing that the cow -pock was an affection free from danger —
And from his opinion that by the cow-poclc inoculation he
should avoid ingrafting various diseases of the human con
stitution, such as " the evil, madness, lues, and many bad
humours," as he called them.
   The remarkably vigorous health of Mr. Jesty, his wife,
and two sons, now 3 1 years subsequent to the cow-pock :
and his own healthy appearance,          at this time 70 yeari of
age, afford a singularly strong proof of the harmlessness of
that affection.     But the public must with particular in
terest hear that, during the late visit to town, Mr. Robert
Jcsty very willingly submitted publicly to inoculation for
the small-pox in the most rigorous manner, and after the
most efficacious mode, without having been infected.
   The circumstances in which Mr. Jesty purposely insti
tuted the vaccine pock inoculation in his own family, viz.
without any precedent, but merely from reasoning upon
the nature of the affection among cows ; and from know
ing its effects in the casual way among men; his exemption
from the prevailing popular prejudices ; and his disregard
of the clamorous reproaches of his neighbours, in our
opinion well entitle him to the respect of the public for his
superior strength of mind : but, further,hu conduct in again
furnishing sucn decisive proofs of the permanentanti-variolous
efficacy of the cow-pock in the present discontented state
of many families, by submitting to inoculation, justly
claims at least the gratitude of the country- — As a testi
mony of our personal regard, and to commemorate so ex
traordinary a fact as that of preventing the small-pox by
inoculating for the cow-pock 3 1 vea-s ago, at our request a
three-quarters length picture of Mr. Jesty is painted by
that excellent artist Mr. Sharp, to be preserved at the
Original Vaccine Pock Institution.
