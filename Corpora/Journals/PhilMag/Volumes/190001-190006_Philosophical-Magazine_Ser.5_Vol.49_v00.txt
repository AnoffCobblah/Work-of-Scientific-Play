I. A Radio-active    Substance emitted from Thorium Compounds.
   By E. RUTHERFORD, M.A., B.Sc., Macdonald Professor of
   Physics, Mc Gill University, Montreal *.
      has been shown by Schmidt-I—           that thorium compounds
IT give out a type        of radiation    similar in its photographic
and electrical actions to uranium and Bontgen radiation.
In addition to this ordinary radiation,             I  have found that
thorium compounds continuously emit radio-active particles
of some kind, which retain their radio-active powers for
several minutes. This “ emanation,” as it will be termed for
 shortness, has the power of ionizing the gas in its neigh
bourhood and of passing through thin layers of metals, and,
with great ease, through considerable thicknesses of paper.
   In order to make clear the evidence of the existence of a.
radio-active emanation, an account will <U+FB01>rst be given of the
anomalous behaviour of thorium compounds compared with
those of uranium.         Thorium oxide has been employed in
most of the experiments, as it exhibits the “emanation”
property to a greater degree than the other compounds; but
what is true for the oxide is also true, but to a less extent, of
the other thorium compounds examined, viz., the nitrate,
sulphate, acetate, and oxalate.
   In a previous paperi the author has shown that the radiation

2            Prof. E. Rutherford on a Radio-active
from thorium is of a more penetrating character than the
radiation from uranium.         Attention was also directed to the
inconstancy   of  thorium    as  a source of radiation.            Owens*
has investigated    in  more   detail   the  radiation      from   thorium
compounds.      He has shown that the radiations from the
di<U+FB02>'erent compounds are of the same kinl, and, with the
exception of thorium oxide in thick layers, approximately
homogeneous in character.
   The intensity of thorium radiation, when examined by
means of the electrical discharge produced, is found to be
very variable; and this inconstaucy is due to slow currents
of air produced in an open room. \Vhen the apparatus is
placed in a closed vessel, to do away with air-currents, the
intensity is found to be practically constant. The Sensi
tiveness of thorium oxide to slight currents of air is very
remarkable.      The movement of the air caused by the opening
or closing of a door at the end of the room opposite to where
the apparatus is placed, is often suf<U+FB01>cient to considerably
diminish the rate of discharge.        In this respect thorium com
pounds di<U+FB02>'er from these of uranium, which are not appre
ciably affected by slight currents of air.               Another anomaly
that thorium compounds exhibit is the ease with which the
radiation apparently passes through paper.                  The following
table is an example ot     the  way the rate of leak between two
parallel plates, one of which is covered with a thick layer of
thorium oxide, varies with the number of layers of ordinary
foolscap-paper placed over the radio-active substance.

   In  the above table the rate of leak with the thorium oxide
uncovered is taken as unity.       It will be observed that the
<U+FB01>rst layer reduced the rate of leak to '74, and the <U+FB01>ve suc
ceeding layers produce very little effect.
   The action, however, is quite different if we use a thin layer          ‘
of thorium oxide. With one layer of paper, the rate of dis—
charge is then reduced to less than 11?; of its value.     At <U+FB01>rst
sight it appears as if the thorium oxide gave out two types of
radiation, one of which is readily absorbed by paper, and the
other to only a slight extent.               If
                                      we examine the radiation

4          ,   Prof. E. Rutherford an a Radio-active
greatly diminished.      The amount of diminution is to a great
extent independent of the electromotive force acting between
the plates. Under similar conditions with uranium, the rate
of leak is not appreciably a<U+FB01>'ected. With a thin layer of
oxide, the diminution of the rate of leak is small; but with a
thick layer of oxide, the rate of leak may be reduced to less
than one-third of its previous value. If two thicknesses of
foolscap-papcr are placed over the thorium oxide, the resulting
rate of leak between the plates may be diminished to less
than 216 of its value by a slight continuous blast of air from
 a gasometer or bellows.
    The phenomena exhibited by thorium compounds receive a
 complete explanation if we suppose that, in addition to the
 ordinary radiation, a large number of radio-active particles
 are given out from the mass of the active substance.         This
               ”
 “emanation       can pass through considerable thicknesses of
 paper. The radio-active particles emitted by the thorium
 compounds gradually ditt'use through the gas in its neighbour
 hood and become centres of ionization throughout the gas.
 The fact that the effect of air-currents is only observed to a
 slight extent with thin layers of thorium oxide is due to the
 preponderance, in that case, of the rate of leak due to the ordi
 nary radiation over that due to the emanation. With a thick
 layer of thorium oxide, the rate of leak due to the ordinary
 radiation is practically that due to a thin surface-layer, as the
 radiation can only penetrate a short distance through the
                                               ”
 salt.   On the other hand, the “emanation       is able to diffuse
 from a distance of several millimetres below the surface of the
 compound, and the rate of leak due to it becomes much greater
 than that due to the radiation alone.
     The eXplanation of the action of slight currents of air is
 clear on the “emanation
                              ”           Since the radio-active

  shown shortly   that the emanation continues to ionize the gas

 quadrants of a Thomson electrometer.        The cylinder, C, was

 terminal of which was connected to earth.

              Substance emitted from Thorium Compomuls.            7
  by the theory of ionization, that the current through the gas
   is proportional to the intensity of the radiation emitted by the
  radio-active particles.     We therefore see that the intensity of
  the radiation given out by the radio-active particles falls of?
  in a geometrical progression with the time. The result shows
  that the intensity of the radiation has fallen to one-half its
  value after an interval of about one minute.      The rate of leak
  due to the emanation was too small for measurement after an
  interval of ten minutes.
      If the ionized gas had been produced from a uranium com
 pound, the duration of the conductivity, for voltages such as
 were used, would only have been a fraction of a second.
     'The rate of decay of intensity is independent of the electro
 motive force acting on the gas. This shows that the radio
 active particles are not destroyed by the electric <U+FB01>eld. The
 current through the gas at any particular instant, after
 stoppage of the <U+FB02>ow of air, was found to be the same whether
 the electromotivo force had been acting the whole time or just
 applied Ifor the time of the test.
      The current through the gas in the cylinder depends on the
 electromotivc force in the same way as the current through a
 gas made conducting by Rontgen rays.          The current at <U+FB01>rst
 increases nearly in proportion to the electromotive force, but
                                               ”
 soon reaches an approximate “ saturation        value.
      The duration of the radio-activity was also tested by another
method.        The paper vessel containing the thorium oxide was
placed inside a long brass cylinder over 200 cms. in length.
A slow current of air (with a velocity of about 2 cms. per
second along the tube) was passed over the thorium oxide along
the tube, and then between two insulated concentric cylinders.
The rate of leak between the two concentric cylinders (po
tential-difference 270 volts) was observed when the air had
been passing suf<U+FB01>ciently long to produce a steady state.        The
rates of leak were observed for varying positions of the
thorium oxide along the tube. Knowing the velocity of
the current of air along the tube, the time taken to carry the
radio-active particles to the testing-apparatus could be deter
mined. Y In this way it was found that the rate of decay was
about the same as determined by the <U+FB01>rst method, i. e., the
intensity fell to half its value in about one minute.
      In this apparatus experiments were also tried to see whether
the radio-active articles moved in an electric <U+FB01>eld. The expe
riments on the egect of a current of air on the rate of discharge
naturally suggest that possibly one of the ions was so large
that it moved extremely slowly even in strong electric <U+FB01>elds.
The results obtained showed that the particles did not move

with    a greater velocity than             cm. per second for a
potential-gradient of one volt per cm. ; and it is probable that
the particles do not move at all in an electric <U+FB01>eld.            By
blowing    the emanation   into  an  inductor,  no evidence  of any
charge in the emanation could be detected.        We may therefore
conclude that the emanation is uncharged, and is not appreciabl y
affected by an electric <U+FB01>eld.
                     Properties of   the Emanution.
    The emanation passes through a plug of cotton-wool without
any loss of its radio-active powers. It is also unaffected by
bubbling through hot or cold water, weak or strong SUlPhlllllC
 acid. In this respect it acts like an ordinary gas.        An ion,
 on the other hand, is not able to pass through a plug of
                or to bubble through water, without losing its
 cpltton-wool,
 0  arge.
    The emanation is similar to uranium in its photographic
 and electrical actions.    It can ionize the gas in its neighbour
 hood, and can affect a photographic plate in the dark after
 several days’ exposure.      Russell * has shown that the active
 agent in producing photographic action in the case of metals,
 paper, &c., is due to hydrogen peroxide.       Hydrogen peroxide
 apparently has the power of passing in some way through
 considerable thicknesses of special substances, and in this
 respect the emanation resembles it. Hydrogen peroxide,
 however, does not ionize the gas in its neighbourhood.         The
 action of hydrogen peroxide on the photographic plate is purely
 a chemical one; but it is the radiation from the emanation,
 and not the emanation itself, that produces ionizing and
 photographic actions.
    The radio-active emanation passes throu b all metals if suf<U+FB01>
 ciently thin.    In order to make certain t at the emanation
 passed through the material to be examined and did not
 ditIiISe round the edges, the radio-active substance was placed
 in a square groove of a thick lead plate. Two layers of paper
 were pasted tightly over the opening to cut off the regular
 radiation.    The material to be tested was then <U+FB01>rmly waxed
 down on the lead plate.
    The following numbers illustrate the effect of different
 metals.    The rate of discharge, due to the emanation between
 two parallel plates 4 ems. apart, was observed.

   The emanation passed readily through several thicknesses
of gold- and silver-leaf.      Aplate ot' mica, thickness '006 cm.,
was completely impervious to the emanation.

   The results are expressed in <U+FB01>g. 2, curve B, where the
ordinate represents current and the abscissa time. It will be
observed that the curve of rise of the current is similar in
form to the rise of an electric current in a circuit of constant
inductance. The current reaches half its value about one minute
after the current of air has stopped,—-a result which agrees
with the equation given, for e_'\‘=1,L when t=60 seconds (see
Table 1V.). At the instant of stopping the current of air
the current has a de<U+FB01>nite value, since most of the ions given
05' by the emanation, before it is blown out of the cylinders,
reach the electrodes.

       The amount of emanation from thorium oxide increases with
    the thickness of the layer.     When    gramme of thorium oxide

    due to the ordinary radiation had practically reached                                   a
    maximum.        The rate of leak due to the emanation for the
    same thickness was small.       With grammes of oxide spread
                                                         9
    over the same area, the rate of leak due to the emanation had
    reached about half its maximum value, which for that case
    corresponded     to four times the rate of leak caused       the                   by
    ordinary radiation.      The emanation thus still preserves its
    radio-active properties after ditl'using through several milli
    metres of thorium compound.

        The emanation         given out whatever the gas by which
                                   is
    the thorium          surrounded.

     whether   air, oxygen, hydrogen,   or carbonic acid   used.              is
        The rate of discharge due to the emanation diminishes
    with lowering of the pressure of the air surrounding it. Only
    a  few observations have been made, but the results seem to
     point to    uniform rate of emission of the emanation at all
                    a
     pressures; but since the intensity of the ionization of the gas
    varies directly as the pressure, the rate of leak decreases with
    lowering of the pressure.
        The amount of the emanation, so far as the experiments
    have gone,      also independent of the quantity of water-vapour
                        is
    present.
       The power of emitting radio-active particles         not pos           is
    sessed  to  any appreciable  extent     other        by
                                                   radio-active sub~
    stances besides thorium.      All the compounds of thorium
    examined possess      to   marked degree, and
                                   it   a                  especially it      is
    large in the oxide.  Two  different specimens  of the oxide have
    been used,  one obtained from   Schuchart  of Germany, and the

            Substance emitted  from Thorium Compounds.               13
other from Eimer & Amend of New York.                 The oxide is pre
pared by the latter by igniting thorium nitrate obtained from
monazite sand.
    The amount of discharge caused by the emulation is in
creased several times by the conversion of the nitrate into
the oxide; but at the same time, the rate ofdischargc due
to the ordinary radiation emitted by the thorium is increased
in about an equal ratio. The conversion of the nitrate
into the oxide took place below a red heat.                On heating
in a mutile for some time at white heat, the amount of
emanation continually diminished, till after four haurs’ ex
posure to the heat, the rate of discharge due to the emination
was only 2430f the value immediately after its conversion into
 oxide.
    Both thorium oxalate and sulphate act in a similar manner
 to the nitrate ; but the emanation is still given otf to a con
 siderable extent after continued heating.
    In considering the question of the origin and nature of the
 emanation, two possible explanations naturally suggest them
 selves, viz. :—
           (1) That the emanation may be due to <U+FB01>ne dust
       particles of the radio-active substance emitted by the
        thorium compounds.
           (2) That the emanation may be a vapour given off
        from thorium compounds.
     The fact that the emanation can pass through metals and
 large thicknesses of paper and through plugs of cotton-wool,
 is strong evidence against the dust hypothesis.            Special ex
 periments,    however,   were   tried to   settle  the question.   The
  experiments    of Aitken and   Wilson   ‘  have  shown  that ordinary
  air can be completely freed from dust particles by repeated
 small expansions of the air Over a water-surface. The dust
  particles act as nuclei for the formation of small drops, and
 are removed from the gas by the action of gravity.
     The experiment was repeated with thorium oxide present
  in the vessel. The oxide was enclosed in a paper cylinder,
  which allowed the emanation to pass through it. After
  repeated expansions no cloud was formed, showing that for
  the expansions used the particles of the emanation were too
  small to become centres of condensation of the water-vapour.
  We may therefore conclude, from this experiment, that the
  emanation does not consist of dust particles of thorium oxide.
     It would be of interest to examine the behaviour of the
  emanation for greater and more sudden expansions, after the

 manner employed by C.            R. W'iison"i in his experiments on
 the action of ions as centres of condensation.
    The emanation may possibly be a vapour of thorium. There
 is reason to believe that all metals and substances give off
 vapour to some degree.        If the radio-active power of thorium
is possessed by the molecules of the substance, it would be
expected that the vapour of the substance would be itself
radio-active for a short time, but the radio-active power
 would diminish in consequence of the rapid radiation of
 energy.    Some information on this point could probably be
 obtained by observation of the rate of diffusion of the ema
nation into gases.      It is hoped that experimental data of this
kind will lead to an approximate determination of the molecular
 Weight of the emanation.
    Experiments ha\e been tried to see if the amount of the
 emanation from thorium oxide is su<U+FB02>icicnt to appreciably
 alter the pressure of the gas in an exhausted tube.        The oxide
was placed in a bulb connecth with a l’liickcr spectroscopic
tube.    The whole was exhausted, and the pressure noted by a
 McLeod gauge. The bulb of thorium oxide was disconnected
from the main tube by means of a stopcock. The Pliicker
tube was re<U+FB01>lled and exhausted again to the same pressure.
On connecting the two tubes together again, no appreciable
difference in the pressure or in the appearance of the discharge
from an induction-coil was observed.             The spectrum of the
gas was unchanged.
    Experiments, which are still in progress, show that the
 emanation possesses a very remarkable property.              I have
found that the positive ion produced        in a gas by the emanation
possesses the power of producing radio-activity in all sub
stances on which it falls.      This power of giving forth a radia
tion lasts for several days. The radiation is of a more pene
trating character than that given out by thorium or uranium.
The emanation from thorium compounds thus has properties
which the thorium itself does not possess. A more com
plete account of the results obtained is reserved for a later
communication.

prism, of height small compared with the area of a horizontal
cross section, were kept for a long time at constant tempe

   In each experiment of one of our sets a rectangular
prism 60 centim. square and not more than (i centim. high
was built up of a slab of the material to be tested, enclosed
between two other slabs of the same material.      Between each
two consecutive slabs of the prism was placed a thin metal
sheet.   This consisted of two rectangular leaves of tinfoil,
about 60 centim. long and a little less than 30 centim. wide,
placed side by side and separated by a narrow ribbon thermal
clement made by butt-jointing. end to end, with the help of
silver solder, a strip of german-silver and a strip of copper of
the same thickness as the tinfoil.       After the edges of the
ribbon had been varnished so as to prevent electrical contact,
the ribbon and the tinfoil could be placed close together so as to
form a continuous sheetof metal 60 centim. square and about

     16                  Prof. B. Osgood Peirce         on the
         It   is evident that when one end of a regular right prism
     of   211  sides made of homogeneous material is kept ata constant
     temperature V0, and the other end at a constant temperature
     V1, while its other faces are kept as nearly as possible at some
     constant temperature between V0 and V,, the temperatures on
     the axis of the prism in its <U+FB01>nal state depend very largely on
     the ratio of the length of the axis of the prism to that of a
     diagonal of a cross section: and that, if this ratio be small
     enough, the temperature conditions to which the sides are
     subjected are of slight importance.               The temperatures at
     points on the axis of a relatively thin disk, one face of which
     is kept at 0° C. and the other at 100° (1., are not measurably
     different, whether the curved surface is kept at 0° C. or
     1000 0., from the temperatures at corresponding points on the
     axis of an in<U+FB01>nite disk of the same thickness, the faces of
     which are kept at 0° C. and 100° C. res ectively.
         It is easy to see, moreover, that in t 1e case of a prism or
     cylinder of poorly conducting material, the bases of which are
     kept at constant temperatures while its side faces are exposed
     to variations of temperature, the introduction of such metal
     sheets as we have sometimes used certainly affects to some
     slight degree the temperatures in the rest of the prism.
         Since it was extremely dif<U+FB01>cult to control the temperatures
     on the side faces of our prisms, it was necessary to make sure
     that the dimensions of the prisms were such that probable
     temperature changes at these faces could not sensibly in
     <U+FB02>uence temperatures at points near the axis. We were able
      to get some useful information, to be checked afterwards by
      experiment, from a discussion of the solutions (obtained on
      the very approximate supposition that the thermal conduc
      tivities of our materials did not change with the temperature)

   We inferred from these results that if the faces of a homo
geneous disk, the radius of which is at least <U+FB01>ve times as
great as its thickness, be kept at temperatures of 100° C. and
00 C. respectively, the temperature in the <U+FB01>nal state, at every
point within a distance from the axis equal to the thickness
of the disk, would be the same within about one hundredth of
a degree,   whether the curved surface were kept at 0° or at
100°.   Since in practice there is a gradual fall of temperature
at the curved surface of such a disk from 100° to 0° in
passing from the hot to the cold side, the approximation is
really much closer than 0°'01; and it is evident that, for the
purposes of the present problem, a disk of such relative dimen
sions, if we consider only the oints near the axis, has prac
tically an in<U+FB01>nite radius and                           tiie
                                     isothermal surfaces in this
portion of the disk are sensibly plane.

                                                   tested.      ese
grooves   were  made  in a Brown   and  Sharpe  Universal  Milling
Machine by extremely thin hard steel saws (N0. 34 B. & S.
Gauge) held between <U+FB02>at disks of somewhat smaller diameters
than the saws to prevent buckling.         The wire that we used
<U+FB01>tted the grooves very closely, and we hoped that the indi
cations of the thermal couples would enable us to determine the
mean temperature of the walls of the groove when the grooved
slab was placed against a <U+FB02>at one.       We found, however, that
the results were often most irregular; and although we spent
some time in attempts to make observations obtained in this
way trustworthy, we met with little success.       Sometimes our
results were good, and sometimes considerably in error.
   The ribbon thermal elements gave consistent results at all
times, provided that the junctions themselves were in contact
with the slabs between which they lay. [f the tinfoil wings were
considerably thicker than thejunction-ribbon, or if the junction
itself were scraped thin, the reading might be in error by an
amount not easy to be accounted for by the mere resistance
of the thin air-<U+FB01>lm on each side of the junction. We shall
wish to discuss this matter at some length in the near future
in the light of some of our observations.
   It is obvious that in the case of such material as glass, the
use of <U+FB01>ne wire thermal elements in the manner just described
is practically impossible, and that the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of
such metal leaves as we use was in every case hundreds of
times less than that of the slabs between which they were
placed.     The question of contact-resistance (Uebergangs
widerstand) will be discussed later on.      In some experiments
we used wire thermopiles inserted in a thin metal disk: we
had also at command a prism-holder so constructed that the
<U+FB01>ne wire elements could be immersed in very thin layers of
mercury.
   The present paper gives an account of a series of measure
ments of the thermal conductivities of different specimens of
“ hard rubber” or “ vulcanite.”        These determinations were
made,   for the most part,  with the help of apparatus previously
used by Dr. Willson and myself.         That the method may be
understood, it will be necessary to describe this apparatus
somewhat at length.

     A represents the hot chamber, weighing about two hundred
 kilograms, which rests in a thick jacket on a heavy table or
 stand made to hold it.      A is connected directly with one (B)
 of two stoutewalled copper boilers, B and B’, each of which
 holds about 40 litres of water. A light cup-shaped weight,
 inverted and laid on a large tube with squared end which
 projects above the top of the boiler, acts as a sensitive safety
 valve and prevents any appreciable rise in temperature within
 the boiler.    B can be re<U+FB01>lled when necessary with boiling
 water from B’ without stopping the constant <U+FB02>ow of steam
                                          f
 through A, by means of the siphon which is provided with
 a valve.    The steam, after passing through the hot chamber,
 is led to the outer air by a jacketed pipe h descending from
 the bottom of A.
    The connexions of the thermal elements are led out of the
 sides of the prism shut in by A and Z, and are held between slabs
 of wood, which act as a sort of guard-ring jacket to the prism
for about 40 centim. before they emerge.          The platinoid or
german-silver    leads of these thermal junctions  within the prism
are soldered together, and       to a copper wire leading to the
 (copper) wire of a potentiometer.       The copper ends of the
couples lead to a mercury-switch by which any one of them, or
any pair pitted against other, may be quickly connected with
the potentiometer.       On its way from the switch to the cold
junctions in C through the potentiometer-wire the current
encounters only copper. By means of a somewhat elaborate
standard potentiometer, not shown in the diagram, the resist
ance, R, in the potentiometer- circuit can be so adjusted that
every millimetre on the potentiometer-wire corresponds to any
desired small potential-difference, such as one microvolt or one
tenth of a microvolt. Rather than make this adjustment many
times a day to conform to the varying temperature of the copper
wire, however, we found it better to determine the slight cor
rections necessary to reduce the readings to absolute measure,
by noting at frequent intervals the indications of a standard
thermal couple, the electromotive force of which is well known.
The potentiometer-wire, which is 0'25 millim. in diameter, can
be changed in a few seconds for a new wire,         the old should

upon the       001' (<U+FB01>g. 4).       Upon the top of this jacket was
fastened    a  hard    rubber    cover   shaped
                                                                Fig. 4.
somewhat like      a  cylindrical   hat.    This
had an opening at the top which could
be closed by an accurately <U+FB01>tting
rubber plug.         In the box, P, thus
made, is placed a thin-walled                 ice
holder, Q, open at top and bottom,
 of the same outside diameter below as
the inside of the brass pot, but some
 what smaller above, so as to leave an
air-space between it and the walls of
 the pot.
     In order that the holder may               be
 easily rotated,   a  pin   soldered  to  a  thin
 diametral web, F, which runs across
 the bottom of the holder, is inserted
 in H, and a vertical brass rod soldered
 to a similar web, E, at the top of the
 holder passes through a hole in the
 cover of the pot which it <U+FB01>ts closely.
 A hard rubber thimble <U+FB01>tting tightly
  on the rod and turning with it permits
  the slow entrance of cold air into the pot without allowing
  any water to leak in. The rod can be clamped at pleasure to
  a brass yoke which is turned by the motor.                      In order to
  prevent   the  introduction     of heat    into   the  pot by conduction
  down the rod,     the   exposed portion        is buried    in cracked ice
  held in a thin metallic cup carried by the yoke and resting
  on it.    When the holder is <U+FB01>lled with ice and is turned by
  the motor, the web at the bottom compels the ice to rub over
  the <U+FB02>oor of the casting, since the holder itself has no bottom;
  and as a result of this, the lower surface of the ice quickly
  acquires and keeps a mirror-like surface.               The drip from the
  pot  comes   out  of  the  edge  of the   casting   Z   through a straight
  hole about   26  centim.    long  and  0'6   centim.   in  diameter drilled
  in the plate and ending ust inside the pot. The whole appa
   ratus is very slightly tilted so as to ensure the steady out<U+FB02>ow
   of the drip.
      A large cylinder, K, 35 centim. high, made of rolled brass
   4 millim. thick, and open at the top and bottom, is mounted
   on brass ball-bearin gs placed on the outside of the hard rubber
  jacket of the pot, P, by means of six vanes, one of which, X,
   is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. K weighs about 20 kilograms when
    empty, and rests upon 144 brass balls each about 12 millim.

                 Thermal Conductivity of Vulcam'te.               25
  in diameter. When set in motion by a slight push, it cou
  tiuues to rotate for about a minute before coming to rest.
  K is so truly hung that the outside can be used as a pulley,
 and the whole can be rotated by the use of the belt shown in
  <U+FB01>g. 1. The vanes reach to about 2 millim. of the <U+FB02>oor of
  the box, and when the whole is <U+FB01>lled with cracked ice and
  then rotated, the ice at the bottom which rubs on Z soon gets
  and holds a very smooth surface.      A hole in the bottom of Z
  carries away the drip and prevents any accumulation of water
  on the <U+FB02>oor of the ice~box.       We were at <U+FB01>rst troubled by
  irregularities arising   from  honeycombing of the ice in the
  ice-box ; and to remedy this a suitably loaded brass tripod is
 used to pack the ice by light blows delivered at intervals of
  21 seconds by the aid of the lever L.     A train of four wheels
  is necessary to reduce the speed of K to one revolution in
  20 seconds,     though only two wheels are shown in the
  drawings.     The tripod slides in guides which revolve with K,
  and a swivel at the top prevents the cord from twisting.
     The rotation of K and of the inside ice-holder, Q, which is
 connected with K by a thin yoke, are matters of much im
 portance. The continual rubbing of the ice over the <U+FB02>at
 surface of the casting seems to be necessary, if the latter is to
 be kept at a uniform constant temperature for hours.           The
  heat produced in rotating Q is solittle as to be quite negligible.
 The ice in K is piled up so as to cover P completely; and we
 have been unable to detect any difference between the tempo
 ratures within and without P by <U+FB01>ne, properly protected
 thermal junctions introduced for the purpose. If, while K
 revolves, Q is kept still, the amount of ice melted in Q becomes
 irregular, though the whole amount of drip in two or three
 hours is not very different from the amount of steady drip in
 an equal time when Q is rotating.         Only selected lumps of
 ice are put into Q. The ice to be used is <U+FB01>rst broken up into
 pieces weighing something like 15 grams each, by means of
an ice-cracking machine, and these pieces are then put into
ice-water so that their sharp edges may become slightly
rounded.       They are then drained and dropped into Q. In
this way a slight amount of water attached to the ice is intro
duced into Q; but the error due to this cause appears to be of
slight importance.       In some experiments the ice to be used
was carefully dried in cold blotting-paper ; but this precaution
does not seem to be necessary, though the use of small bits of
ice with sharp edges is to be avoided.       Q’s capacity is about
2000 cub. centim.       After Q has been freshly <U+FB01>lled in the
course of any experiment while        K  is rotating, no record is
kept for some time, perhaps <U+FB01>fteen minutes, of the amount of

26                Prof. B. Osgood Peirce on the
drip.    Before the ex iration ot' this interval the extra water
introduced into Q wit the ice has drained off, and the indi
cations have become steady.        After this the apparatus is
allowed to run for about two hours until 300 grams of ice, or
less, has been melted, and then Q is re<U+FB01>lled.      The drip-tube
always contains a few drops of water, but this amount remains
sensibly constant during the progress of one experiment.
The drip is collected in a graduated vessel, and the approxi
mate amount is noted from time to time to see whether the
<U+FB02>ow is steady. The whole is then more accurately determined
by weighing, at longer intervals.
    The regularity of drip is a far more sensitive test of the
approximate attainment of the <U+FB01>nal state of the body experi
mented on and its surroundings than is a sensibly constant
 temperature gradient on the axis. In most experiments with
the apparatus just described, a su<U+FB02>iciently steady state has
been attained in about seven hours from the beginning of the
heating.     Sheets of blotting-paper were generally inserted
between the prism to be tested and the hot and cold boxes, to
serve as elastic pads, and to prevent the possible wetting of
the edge of the prism by moisture condensed on the ice-box.
The presence of this paper prolonged the time of waiting for
the <U+FB01>nal state to be attained, but did not in<U+FB02>uence the results
 of the measurement of the conductivity of the prism. When
<U+FB01>lled with ice, Z and K weigh about 300 kilograms, and the
additional pressure due to the bolts is considerable; so that,
 when the prism is made up of brittle material like glass, the
blotting-paper or an equivalent must be used to prevent the
 prism from injury.     Since hard rubber becomes very soft at
temperatures above 100° 0., it did not seem worth while to
 test its thermal conductivity at high temperatures; and it is
not necessary to give any account here of the apparatus
intended for use at temperatures as high as the boiling-point
of sulphur.
    After the absolute conductivity of a particular specimen
 has been carefully determined, between various pairs of tem
 perature-limits, in the apparatus just described, the conduc
 tivity of any other specimens can be easily obtained in the
 same apparatus merely by determining the temperature
 gradient in the <U+FB01>nal state on the axis of a prism built up of
the slab already tested, and the slab to be examined, with
their attendant thermopiles and such other thin slabs as may
be conveniently used.      By varying the order of the slabs on
different occasions,  the temperatures at the faces of the slab to
be examined can be altered, it being always understood that
the thermal elements must be placed between slabs of approxi

                Thermal Conductivity       of Vulcanite.           27
mater the same conductivities.            The relative conductivities
of ditt'erent materials, if these conductivities are not widely
different, can be determined with great- accuracy by this
method; and it is possible to use much smaller slabs than are
necessary if one is to determine absolute conductivities.            I
have two smaller pieces of apparatus very like the large one
already described, except that neither cold box has a device
for determining the amount of heat coming through the prism.
One of these is intended for slabs 35 centim. square; the
other, made wholly from brass, for disks 20 centim. in diameter.
Since it is not easy to get thin plane-faced slabs of some
materials 60 centim. square, it is usually best to compare in
the small apparatus small disks of such materials with a disk
of some standard material cut from a plate previously tested
in the larger apparatus.
 . When one considers the passage of heat through a prism or
wall built up of separate slabs, one is led to ask whether the
cracks between the slabs do not introduce great irregularities.
We know that it is practically impossible so to press together
 <U+FB01>at slabs of any material that there shall not be a relatively
large contact-resistance to the passage of an electrical current
across the common surface.           Should we not expect the thermal
conductivity of a prism made up of two or more slabs of a
 given material to be different from that of a prism of the
 same thickness made of a single slab of this material?             It
 was necessary to appeal to experiments for an answer to this
 question. F ortunately 1 had considerable quantities of a
 special kind of plate-glass and of a special brand of hard
 rubber in which 1 have been unable to detect any change
 of thermal conductivity with the temperature between
 20° C. and 80° C.         All the glass was nearly of the same
 thickness,   but,    by fastening a disk of the rubber to the
 face-plate of ‘a          massive engine-lathe, and using a broad,
                   largeept cool by
 very sharp tool       (                water) with slow speed, and a
 very   <U+FB01>ne  cut,  it  was  possible  to reduce the thickness of the
 disk and to keep the faces almost exactly plane. Of these
 materials 1 have built up at different times a number of prisms
 in di<U+FB02>'erent ways, and have tested these prisms in my apparatus.
 In every case the conductivity seemed to be entirely inde
 pendent of the thickness of the prism and of the number of
 slabs out of which it was built.        It has also appeared that the
 conductivity of a prism made up of a number of disks was
 not changed to any measurable amount by introducing thin
metallic leaves to separate every slab from its next neighbours.
 1n the cases of some heterogeneous prisms built up of slabs of
different substances separated by thermal elements, the results

  28                 Prof. B. Osgood Peirce on    the
   were not regular; and for this reason 1 haVe felt it unwise, as
   I  have already said, to trust the indications of thermal
  elements which lie between substances of widely different
  conductivities.     Of course it is of great importance that the
  faces of the slabs should be practically plane.
      I had at my disposal fourteen di<U+FB02>'erent specimens of hard
  rubber, thick enough to be used conveniently in my apparatus,
  and much of this was in sheets about 120 centim. by 50 centim.
  So much of it as was bought for the purposes of this investi
  gation came from three well-known makers. Besides this
  new rubber, however, there were a number of pieces from
  unknown sources, which had been lying in the laboratory for
  inde<U+FB01>nite periods.       The speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the different
  specimens examined differed slightly from each other, but by
  not nearly so much as 1 per cent. in the extreme cases. The
  speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the rubber used as a standard is about 1'202.
 The speci<U+FB01>c heat of the rubber increases with the temperature,
 as may be inferred from the subjoined Table, in the second
  column of which is given the number of calories required to
  raise one gram of a certain specimen of thin sheet rubber from
  25° C. to the temperatures given in the <U+FB01>rst column.          The

     The average speci<U+FB01>c heat of another specimen of thin
 rubber between 25° C. and 100° C. was 0'370. That of the
thicker standard rubber was 0'339.
     Since hard rubber is an extremely poor conductor of heat,
 a long time was required in the case of any prism for the
<U+FB01>nal state to be reached approximately.        After about seven or
eight hours, if the temperatures of the hot and cold boxes
were kept quite constant, the temperatures at all points on
the axis could generally be assumed to be within 911,- of a

                Thermal Conductivity of Vulcanz'te.              29
degree    of their <U+FB01>nal values; and, in view of the variable
                                  “ hard rubber,” “ ebonite,” or
composition of what is called
“vulcanite,” in the market, and of the extreme dif<U+FB01>culty of
keeping the temperature of the hot box constant within less
than 116 of a degree for any great number of hours, it did not
seem desirable to extend the experiments further.         In what
follows the conductivity is given in every case to three decimal
<U+FB01>gures; but it is evident that the third <U+FB01>gure is not quite
 determined.
    E.vperiment (a).—A compound slab, made up of two plates
 (A and B) of a certain kind of hard rubber which I chose as a
standard, was placed between two other pieces of hard rubber
to form a prism.      Each plate was about 60 centim. long by
 50 centim. bread. The average thickness of A was 1270 centim.
 and that of B 1260 centim.        In the <U+FB01>nal state the thermal
 elements on the warmer side of A, between A and B, and on
 the cooler side of B, indicated 74°‘9, 45°‘2, and 15°'7 re
 spectively.    The rate of melting of the ice in the box was
 102 grams in almost exactly 8760 seconds.          Assuming the
 area of the bottom of the ice-pot to be 126'7 square centim.
 and the latent heat of melting ice to be 7 925, this corresponds
 to the conductivity for each slab of 0'000311.

 into a prism with three plates of glass.    In the <U+FB01>nal state the
 temperatures of the elements on the faces of A were 60°‘1 and
 24°‘9 respectively.     In 11,220 seconds, 154'8 grams of ice
 were melted.       This again corresponds to a conductivity
 between 60° and 25° of 0'000311.
     Two other experiments, in which the <U+FB01>nal gradients on the
 axes of prisms built up of disks about 20 centim. in diameter,
 made of this rubber, were determined, failed to show any
 sensible variation of the conductivity with the temperature
 between    65° and 16°.
    Experiment (c).—A compound slab made of A and a plate
 0 (of the same dimensions as A but purporting to come from
 another maker), with their thermal elements and “ guard
         ”
 plates    of rubber, were used to form a prism for the large
 apparatus. In the <U+FB01>nal state the indications of the elements
  on the warm side of A, between A and C, and on the cool
 side of C were, respectively, 69°‘8, 41°‘l, and 15°"1, so that the
 conductivity of C between 41° and 13° appears to be 0'000319.
     After this a number of disks 2O centim. in diameter, which
 seemed alike in their physical properties, were cut from the
 standard rubber and used with other disks to form prisms for
  the smaller apparatus.

   In view of the suspicious decrease of the thermal conduc
tivity with the thickness of the piece experimented upon, it is
well to say that some manufacturers apparently use rubbers
of different compositions for thick and thin plates.                           Much
cheap, thin rubber is to be had in the market, and the speci<U+FB01>c
electrical resistance of some of this is so low as to make the
material useless for insulating purposes.                        Of the specimens
mentioned in the table, G and H are pieces of expensive
rubber made especially for use in induction-coils of high
grade.     K, which is nearly of the samethickness as H, is an
excellent rubber of high electrical resistance, but is not quite
equal in this respect to H, which has a very different thermal
conductivity.            Extended experimentation seemed to show
that the indications of the thermal elements might be trusted
whether the plates were thick or thin.                      A re-determination of
the conductivities of N and O with the different arrangements
of the prisms gave 0000215 and 0000199 respectively. When
a disk of the standard rubber was turned down thin and its
speci<U+FB01>c conductivity re-determined, it was found to be almost
the same as before ; but when disks F and were made slightly   I
thinner by turning off the polished surface on each side, the
conductivity of the thinner disks was increased by 5 per cent.

and    per cent.
       3          This seems to show that in the cases of some
sheets of hard rubber, the thermal conductivity of the skin
near the polished surfaces is somewhat less than that of the
mass of the material in the sheet.     This difference, however,
is too slight  to account    for the  differences of conductivity
shown by the table.     It is well to emphasize the fact that the
speci<U+FB01>c heat between 25° C. and 100° C. of the standard
rubber is less (0339) than that of such thin sheet rubber as
I have experimented upon.
   Stefan found for the thermal conductivity of a certain
sheet of rubber, 0'787 centim. thick, the value 0'00026: this
rubber had a somewhat greater density (1'22) and a much
lower speci<U+FB01>c heat (0'23) than any of my specimens, so that
the ratio of the conductivity to the speci<U+FB01>c heat per unit
volume was somewhat greater.         Experimenting upon a small
        “
disk of ebonite
                  ” 1'93 centim. in diameter and 0011-1 centim.
thick, Lees found the conductivity to be 000040.

recent British earthquakes, and especially of the Hereford
earthquake of 1896, have added to our knowledge of the

                          General Character      of   the   Sound.
   The earthquake-sound         frequently described simply as
                                       is                                   a
 rumbling sound or, more fully, as hollow or muffled rumbling
                                               a
 sound, a harsh grumbling sound,          mysterious suppressed
                                                   a

such   a  character, as is evident from the comparisons to the
deep notes of an organ, &c.            The references to distant
thunder and the moaning of the wind also testify to a certain
smoothness or monotony in the sound.           To some observers,
however,    the  sound  appears   to  be  intermittent, to be like
three loud explosive moans, or successive discharges of
cannon, or a heavy body falling several times, say, down a
short <U+FB02>ight of stairs.
   At places near the epicentre, the loudness of the sound is
one of the chief features of a moderately strong earthquake.
The sound is compared to the rumbling of six traction-engines,
to that of a train going over a bridge, only intensi<U+FB01>ed a hundred
times, to a tremendous roaring, a sudden loud deafening
noise, or a terri<U+FB01>c explosion, louder than is produced by the
heaviest artillery.    Even in so slight an earthquake as that
felt in the south of Cornwall on April 1, 1898, one observer
described the sound as like the rumbling of thirty or forty
waggons travelling at a rapid pace, while another remarked
“that was the loudest thunder            I
                                         ever heard.”    This may
almost appear to be the language of exaggeration ; but, from
a careful study of the evidence,     Ithink that it expresses the
experience of certain, but not of all, observers.       It will be
seen afterwards how widely persons differ in their powers of
hearing earthquake-sounds.
   Another prominent characteristic of the sound is its ext-ra
ordinary depth. The rolling of heavy railway-trucks, very
low, is the evidence of one observer ; of another, a low
rumbling sound, much lower than the lowest thunder ; while
a third refers to the vibrations of the pedal notes of a great
organ, only of a deeper pitch than can be taken in by the
human ear. The idea of great depth is also given by the
                                   “
very frequent use of the word        heavy” *. It is applied in
every type of comparison, sometimes in an unusual manner,
as, for example, in heavy thunder, a heavy con<U+FB02>agration, or
a heavy explosion.
   The earthquake-sound is frequently compared to the passing
of heavy waggons and other vehicles. The comparison seems
to be generally suggested when the sound is of long duration,
of a certain smoothness, and gradually increases in intensity
to a maximum and then dies away             The reference
                                             'I'.             often

  it In strong earthquakes, the percentage of descriptions in which the
word “heavy” occurs, varies from 28 in the Hereford earthquake of
1896 to 45 in the Pembroke earthquake of 1893. In very slight earth
quakes it may fall as low as 13.
  1' In the Leicester earthquake of 1893, 27 observers stated that the
sound gradually increased in intensity and then died away;  and of these
20 compared the sound to that of passing vehicles.

to a vehicle driven quickly past, to illustrate ap arently the
evenness of the sound or the rapidity with which it attains
and recedes from its maximum intensity.        The common illu
sion that an underground train rushes up to and beneath a
house, and continues its journey in the opposite direction, is
no doubt due to this gradual rise and fall in intensity.
                   Types of Earthquake-Sound.
   A few observers <U+FB01>nd it dif<U+FB01>cult to describe the sound, but
most compare it to some well-known type, and the resemblance
in many cases is so close that the observer at <U+FB01>rst attributed
it to the object of comparison. The descriptions which          I
have examined, several thousands in number, may be classi<U+FB01>ed
under the following heads :—
   (1) W'aggons dc. passing.-—One or several traction-engines,
either alone or heavily laden, sometimes driven furiously past;
a steam-roller travelling    at a quicker pace than usual or
passing   over frozen  ground; heavy waggons coming quickly
down a hill, driven over stone paving, on a hard or frosty
road, in a covered wa Y or narrow street, or over hollow
ground or a bridge; a eavy roller on a garden path, or a
wheelbarrow on a hard and frosty road ; express or heavy
goods trains rushing through a tunnel or a deep cutting,
crossing a wooden bridge or iron viaduct, or a heavy train
running on snow; also, the dragging of heavy furniture or
boxes across an adjoining <U+FB02>oor, the grating of a boat on a
beach or of the bottom of a large vessel when dragged over
rocks.
   (2) Tburden—A loud clap or heavy peal, sometimes dull,
hollow, muffled, or subdued, but most often distant, and thus
conveying the impression of a low deep booming sound.
   (3) W'ind.—A moaning, roaring, howling, rushing, hissing,
or rough, strong wind ; the rising of the wind, the roaring of
a great squall, a heav    wind pressing against the house, or a
high wind sweeping t rough trees ; the howling of wind in a
chimney, a chimney on <U+FB01>re, and the blare of a furnace when
the door is opened.
   (4) Loads of stones rs'c. falling.——-The tipping of a load of
coal, stones, or bricks ; a wall or roof falling, or the crash of
a chimney through the roof.
   (5) Fall of heavy b0dies.—The fall of a heavy weight, of a
tree or heavy timber ; the thud of a large mass of snow from
a house-top, the hanging of a door, only more mu<U+FB02>ied, and
the blow of a wave on the sea-shore.
   (6) Ewplosions.—-The explosion of a boiler, a cartridge of

   .lvuamite, or a rocket; a distant colliery explosion; distant
   heavy rock-blasting, and the boom of a distant cannon.
       (7) llIiscellaneous.—The trampling of many animals, such
   as cows 111shing on the turf below, a quick stampede of a
   large herd of elephants, a number of powerful men struggling
   desperately in the room overhead ; an immense covey of
   partridges or a <U+FB02>ock of starlings on the wing ; the roar of a
   waterfall, the heavy rumbling of sea-waves in a cave, and the
   breaking of waves on a pebbly beach ; the passage of a party
   of skaters, the falling of <U+FB01>ne rain or bail on the leaves of
   trees, a low pedal note on the organ; and the tending or
    settling together of huge masses of rock.
          F
         requency of Comparison to (Ii<U+FB02>‘ere'nt   Types—The type
    of comparison employed varies not only in different earth
    quakes, but in different parts of the disturbed area of one and
    the same earthquake.      This is shown by Table      in which                                           1.,
    the <U+FB01>gures denote the percentage of entries under each type
    with regard to the total number of comparisons.

       The four Cornish earthquakes were all weak and originated
    in foci of comparatively small linear dimensions.        The
    Exmoor earthquake, though not much stronger, resembled
    the remaining shocks in having       long focus.   In these               a
    cases, reference   made more frequently than in the <U+FB01>rst
                             is
    to passing waggons &c. and less frequently to explosions
    and the <U+FB01>ring of heavy guns. Again, in the Comrie earth
     quakes of 1839, the sound which accompanied the more
     violent shocks appeared “to resemble thunder more than

 anything else,-—certainly much deeper toned and more awful,”
  while that which was heard with the weaker and shorter
 shocks was compared to “ the noise caused by the blasting of
a soft rock at a considerable distance, followed by the rever—
 beration of the surrounding mountains.”              The type of com
 parison employed therefore depends on the duration of the
 sound, and this again on the length of the seismic focus.
                  Variation in   the Nature of    the Sound.
      Variation    in 1htensity.—Even      if  there were no definite
'reports on this point, it would be evident, from the frequent
 references to passing vehicles, that the sound is often of
varying intensity.        Sometimes the sound becomes gradually
 louder and ceases almost abruptly, or it may begin suddenly
 and die away gradually; but in these cases the more or
 less rapid termination is probably subjective and due to
 the observer’s inability to hear deep sounds.                In each of
 the three most important British earthquakes of the last
  decade (namely, the Pembroke earthquakes of 1892 and 1893,
 and the Hereford earthquake of 1896), more than 90 per cent.
 of the observers who refer to the point distinguish some
 change in the intensity of the sound ; while the percentages
 of those who heard the sound become gradually louder and
 then die away are respectively 68, 85, and 56.
     The relation which the change in intensity of the sound
 bears to that of the shock is important.             Generally, the two
 increase and decrease together, though, as will be seen after
  wards, there are exceptions to this statement.           01', a hen the
  shock is slight, it is felt when the sound is loudest, as at
  Helston, during the Cornwall earthquake of May 17, 1892,
 when “a distant rumble was heard, gradually increasing in
 intensity until it became a violent thundering sound, at which
 instant everything in the room was perceptibly shaken, the
 sound dying away with the shock with the same sound as
 before
           ” '.
       Variation in Character.—-As a general rule, the sound
  adheres throughout to one of the types enumerated above,
 and varies, if at all, only in intensity.         In the neighbourhood
 of the epicentre, however, there is also a change in character
 perceptible to some, but not all, observers, the change taking

 sensations, a tremulous motion, and a. violent blow or concussion.
 tremulous or trembling motion,” he says,    “ is always perceived. When
 the blow occurs, it is generally in the midst of the tremors, and accom

  place at the time when the shock is strongest.                It then
  assumes a rougher, more grinding or grating character,
  occasionally, but not often, being heard as a loud report or
  crash. As this is a feature which does not seem to have
  attracted much attention, the following examples from
  different British earthquakes are given in illustration.
     At Penryn, the Cornwall earthquake of 1892 consisted of
  two distinct vibrations, each followed by tremulous motion ;
  each was also accompanied         by a sound like the crash of a
  heavy weight on the <U+FB02>oor above and followed by a rumbling
  sound like that of a waggon roaring along the street, con
  tinuing after the shock and              away in the distance. At
                                    dying
  Lamphey, during the Pembro e earthquake of 1892, a sound
  was heard for three seconds resembling that of sea-waves at
 a distance, followed for two seconds by a deep heavy boom
 of thunder, during which the shock was felt, and this by a
 sound like sea-waves dying away in about three seconds.
     Many observations of this kind were made during the
 Hereford earthquake of 1896.            For instance, at Dilwyn in
 Herefordshire, there was a rumbling as of a train going
 overa bridge, with a terri<U+FB01>c crash, such as is heard in a
 thunderstorm, at the instant when the shock was strongest,
 the rumbling         dying away afterwards for some seconds.
 Again, at Horsley in Gloucestershire, the sound was <U+FB01>rst
 like a violent wind among trees; then, while the shock
 lasted, like a very heavy traction-engine close to the house,
 and, at the instant when the sound was loudest and the
 shock strongest, the rumbling was accompanied by a sort of
 grinding noise, which appeared to be under the observer’s
 house, and sounded as if a landslip was in progress.
     When the sound is compared to wind, a change is fre
 quently observed.        Thus, Prof. Papavasiliou records, on the
 authority of M. de Biasi, that a strong shock felt in Zante
 on June 31 (sic), 1896, ‘ fut précédée d’un bruit pareil
 d’abord a celui du vent, puis a celui d’une voiture ” ; and a
 similar change was observed in the same island on Sept. 23,
 1896*.      During the Hereford earthquake of 1896, the change
generally took place at or about the instant when the shock
began or ceased to be felt ; as at Batley, in Yorkshire, where
the shock was preceded by a sound as of a rushing wind,
and was accompanied by a low rumbling noise like distant
thunder.
    Though some exceptions to the conclusion will be noticed
later, it thus appears that, as an earthquake-shock increases

 and decreases in intensity, the sound grows louder and dies
 away, and also deepens and rises in pitch; in other words,
 the vibrations which are observed as shock and sound increase
 and decrease together in amplitude and period.
          Variation in the lVature of the Sound throughout
                          the Disturbed Area.
    In one respect the sound exhibits a marked uniformity all
over the sound-area, namely, in its great depth, if we may
judge from the frequency with which the word “heavy”
 occurs in the descriptions.         In the Hereford earthquake, the
 word is used in 27 per cent. of the comparisons from the
 seven central counties, in 30 per cent. from the counties
surrounding these, and in 27 per cent. from those which lie
 outside.     In the Pembroke earthquake of 1892, the corre
sponding percentages are 38, 45, and 31, and in that of 1893
they are 51, 37, and 39 *.
     Variation in Type.——The connexion between frequency of
type-reference and distance from the epicentre is shown
roughly in the Table (p. 38).
    The principal change common to all three earthquakes is
thus the increasing percentage with the distance of the com
parisons to wind ; and we may infer from this that the sound
tends to become smoother and more nearly monotonous as we
 recede from the epicentre.           As a rule, the comparisons to
passing waggons &c. are less numerous at a distance than
 near the epicentre.      The reasons for this appear to be that
the duration of the sound diminishes as the distance increases,
and that the rise and fall in intensity are also less marked.
 In the Hereford earthquake it is possible to draw curves of
 equal percentage of reference to this type, and these show
that the frequency of reference depends on the duration of
the sound.
     Variation in Change of Intensity—One effect of distance
 would naturally be to quench the weaker sound-vibrations at
 the beginning and end, and we should expect to <U+FB01>nd less
 variation in the intensity of the sound at a distance than near
   '  In  the   Hereford earthquake, the central counties are those of
Hereford,     Gloucester, Worcester,    Shropshire, Radnor, Brecon, and
Monmouth; the inner ring consists of Somerset, \Viltshire, Berkshire,
Oxford,    Warwick, Birmingham, Stafford, Cheshire, Flint, Denbigh,
Montgomery,      and Glamorgan; and the outer ring of the remaining
counties in which the sound was heard.      In the Pembroke earthquakes
the central counties are Pembroke, Carmarthen, and Cardigan ; those in
the inner ring are Cornwall, Devon, Glamorgan,          Brecon, Radnor,
Montgomery, and Merioneth; while the outer ring consists of the
remaining counties of the sound-area.

the epicentre. This certainly is the case, but the change is
not a marked one; for, in the Hereford earthquake, of all
the observers who refer to the point, the percentages of those
who heard the sound increase to a maximum and then die
away are 57'?) for the central counties, 53'7 for the inner
ring, and 53'1 for the outer ring. The corresponding per
centages for those who considered the sound of uniform
intensity throughout are 8'0, 111, and 12'2.
   The test employed, however, is not a very clear one, for at
all stations but those near the boundary of the sound-area
some change in the intensity would be perceptible.       A better
test is furnished by the observed nature of the sound, by the
increasing frequency of reference to the wind-type as we
recede from the epicentre, and b         the comparison of the
sound at great distances to distant t under.
    Variation in Change of Character.—In the Hereford earth
quake, the percentage of the total number of accounts in
which any change was recorded is 194 in the central counties,
 10'7 in the inner ring, and 2'8 in the outer ring, of counties.
In the <U+FB01>rst district the change of type is generally due to the
perception of the crashing or grinding sound which accom
panied the strongest vibrations; in the others, the change,
when observed, is almost invariably from a sound like wind
to a more rumbling sound at the time of the shock, or rice
versci.   In every earthquake I have studied, it is only near
the epicentre that the explosive reports or crashes in the
midst of the rumbling sound are heard.          At a moderate
distance, the sound before and after the shock becomes
smoother, while the sound which accompanies            the shock
retains to acertain extent its rougher and more rumbling
character. As we approach the boundary of the disturbed
area, the irregularities are still further smoothed away, and
the only sound heard is like the low, almost monotonous roll
of distant thunder.
     Variability in the Sound due to its Neighbourhood   to the
                    Lower Limit of Audibz'lity.
   Inaudibilz'ty to some Observers.——Attention has been drawn
in the preceding pages to the extraordinary depth of the
earthquake-sound, so far as it can be inferred from the
efforts that are made to describe it.     But the most decisive
evidence of the close neighbourhood of the sound to the
lower limit of audibility is furnished by the fact that the same
vibrations are heard by some and not by others.               One
observer will describe the sound as like the rumbling pro

duced b       a heavy traction-engine         assing, while another will
be equa ly positive that the shoc' was unaccompanied by
sound. Not only people in the same town, but persons in
the same house, and even in the same room, differ in this
respect.       There is no reason, it should be remarked, for
supposing that they were not equally alert, or that their
conditions varied essentially except in their powers of per
ceiving deep sound.
    This point is so important that         I  venture to give further
evidence in illustration.
    M. Oh. Dcville, who studied the Guadeloupe earthquake
of Feb. 8, 1843, remarks that “ ce bruit . . . n’est pas percu
par tout le monde.         Ni moi, ni les personnes qui m’entour
aient, ne l’avons entendu a la Dominique ; bien plus, peut
ctre par suite de l’émotion, une foule de témoins du désastre
de la Pointe-a-Pitre disent ne l’avoir point entendu.               Qucl
ques uns atferment, au contraire, que ce bruit s’est prolongé
un petit nombre de secondes encore aprcs la commotion;

 been heard, it has only been once during a period of several
years that he can say that he distinctly heard a sound.               This
 was 011 March 11th, 1881, when a sound between hissing and
rumbling was heard "1'.
    During the Hereford earthquake of 1896, if we take the
 evidence only of those observers who were awake before it
 began, we <U+FB01>nd that two out of <U+FB01>ve observers at Clifton did
 not hear the sound, at Learnington two out of six, in Birm
 ingham and the neighbourhood four out of 23, in London
 eight out of 18, and at Bangor two out of seven.                  In the
 whole disturbed area, 148 persons who were awake heard no
 sound, and all but <U+FB01>ve of these were within the boundary of
 the sound-area.
    Partial lnaudibility      to some   Observers—Similar evidence
 is afforded     by the partial inaudibility of the sound, by its
 total cessation, generally during the shock itself, to some
 observers, while others continue to hear it.            In Great Britain

            Dr. G. Davison on Earthquake-Sounds.                       41
records of this kind occur in many earthquakes.              For in
stance, during the Hereford earthquake 81; per cent. of the
observers who were certainly awake, and heard the sound,
state expressly that they were unconscious of any sound
while the shock lasted.        Generally it was heard only before
the shock, ceasing either gradually or somewhat abruptly
about the time when the shock began ; but it was sometimes
heard only when the shock was dying away, and in two
cases before and after, but not during, the shock.          That this
cessation of the sound was inherent in the observers and not
due to their position, is evident from the experiences of
others in the same places.        At Presteign, in Badnorshire, to
one observer the sound ceased before the vibrations com
menced; to another the sound was terrible, as of rending
 rocks beneath his feet, and was loudest at the time when
the shock was strongest.           At Birmingham one observer
 heard the sound before, during, and after the shock, another
entirely before    it,   a  third only after        it,
                                                    while others, as
already remarked, heard no sound at all.
     Variability in the Nature             the Sound.—Even when
                                               of
 observers  in  the   same   place agree in hearing the sound,         it
 may present itself to them under different forms. In the
 Hereford earthquake we <U+FB01>nd that at Hereford                 crash or
                                                               a
 bomb-like explosion was noticed during the rumbling sound
 by four observers, while four others describe the sound in
 terms which imply uniformity of character. At Pridewood
 (four miles from the epicentre) one observer, who felt two
 series of vibrations and heard        loud crash with the maximum
                                           a
 of each, remarks that only        afew heard this peculiar sound,
 although most persons noticed           premonitory rumbling.

 Ledbury the sound, according to one, began like              rushing
                                                               a
 wind, and culminated in           loud explosive report; another
                                   a
 heard a noise like distant thunder, which ended when the
  shock began while third heard no sound at all. The same

  places further away from the epicentre.            At Clifton one
  person heard a   slight rumbling noise, while another compared
  the sound with that of     a  heavy traction-engine passing. In
 the Birmingham district the accounts refer on the one hand
 to the distant approach of       train and the rising of the wind,
                                   a

if  tons of debris had been hurled against the wall of house.      a
     Explanation   of   the above Phenomena.—These observations
 show clearly that there          is lower limit of audibility, and,
                                       a
 further, that this limit    isnot the same for all persons.     Now,
 to create an equally strong impression on the ear, the

  42           Dr. C. Davison on Earthquake-Sounds.
  strength of the vibrations must he very much greater for deep
  sounds than for high ones, and this is especially the case for
  the deepest sounds of all.      If, then, the sound is just audible
  to any person, it will cease to be heard if the period of the
  vibrations be increased without any change occurring in
  their strength, or if the strength be diminished, while the
 period remains unchanged.
     In the immediate neighbourhood of the epicentre, the
 sound-vibrations are of such intensity that they are heard by
 nearly all observers, at             rate in Great Britain.      As we
 recede from the epicentreany   t 1e vibrations diminish in strength,
 and at the same time, as we know from seismographic
 records, the larger vibrations increase in period.             On both
 accounts, then, they      tend    to   become    inaudible.   Thus   the
 percentage of persons who hear the sound should diminish as
 the distance from the epicentre increases, until we reach the
 boundary of the sound-area where no human being is capable
 of hearing so deep :1 sound.
     If the vibrations which reach a particular observer are at
 <U+FB01>rst very rapid, and then gradually increase in period without
 an appropriate concomitant increase in strength, the sound
 will become gradually deeper, and <U+FB01>nally will cease to be
 heard, the ending being more or less abrupt.               Again, if the
 period   were  to be subject to   a   succession   of changes without
 the proper change of strength, it is possible that to some
 observers the vibrations might be inaudible during short
 intervals when the period is great, and they would then hear
 the sound as a succession of reports, a series of footfalls, &c.
     Further, the vibrations which reach the observers in ono
 place at any moment are probably of various amplitude and
period.     One may hear many vibrations, and another only
 some of the series.    Thus to one observer the sound may be
like a rising wind, to another like a heavy traction-engine
passing; one may hear the crashes which accompany the
principal vibrations, while a second will be deaf to them ; to
one the sound may become continually louder and cease
abruptly, to another it may increase to a maximum and then
gradually die away.
    As we recede from the epicentre, however, the vibrations
of every period tend to become inaudible.                  The limiting
vibrations of the whole series will be the <U+FB01>rst to be lost,
especially those of longest period.          Thus near the epicentre
sound-vibrations of many different periods will be heard, and
the sound will be more complex than it is elsewhere.                It is
only in this region that the loud crashes will be heard with
the strongest vibrations.       As the observer recedes from the

                Dr. G. Bavi-sou on Earthquake-Sounds.                  43
epicentre these changes in character must» become gradually
less marked, until at a great distance, near the boundary of
the sound-area, the audible vibrations lie within very narrow
limits with regard to period, and the sound becomes an
almost monotonous deep growl of nearly uniform intensity.
                              Isacoustic Lines.
     An isacoustic line may be de<U+FB01>ned as a line which passes
 throu b all places in which the percentage of persons who
 hear t e sound is the same.
     The construction of isacoustic lines depends on the following
 principles :—(1) at most places within the sound-area the
 sound lies between the extreme values of the lower limit of
 audibility, so that it is heard by some and not by others;
  (2) as the distance from the centre increases the audibility of
 the sound-vibrations diminishes, so that the sound is heard
 by a decreasing proportion of observers; (3) the people in
 any district possess various powers of hearing low sounds,
 but in any one country the. percentage of its inhabitants who
 are capable of hearing a given low sound is probably in all
                                                           '
 parts very nearly the same.
     In <U+FB01>g. 1 (p. 44) the continuous lines represent the isacoustic
 lines of the Hereford earthquake of 1896. ' Their construction
 depends on the percentage of observers within each county
                                                        '
 who recorded their perception of thesound.               .The percentage
.varies from 872 in Herefordshire to 231 in Essex, and for
 any county it is supposed to correspond to that of a small
 district immediately surrounding its centre, and for adjoining
  counties to vary uniformly from one centre to another. The
  counties are of course too large and also too unequal in area
  to allow of great accuracy in the construction of the lines,
  and the number of observations in some of the counties at
  a distance from the epicentre is not so great as is to be
  desired   *.
    * The    inner isoseismal lines of this earthquake are elongated ovals
 with    their longer axes nearly north-west and south-east; and the
  peculiar form of the isacoustic lines is due to the fact that there were
  two distinct foci arranged along a north-west and south-east line, the
 north-west focus (near Hereford) being <U+FB01>rst in action by a few seconds.
 The series of vibrations from the two foci coalesced and formed one
 series at places within a hyperbolic band, the curvilinear axis of which
 coincides very nearly with the dotted line (<U+FB01>g. 1) passing through the
 points of greatest extension of the isacoustic lines. The disturbance was
 much stronger at the north-west than at the south-east focus, while the
 inequality between the sound-vibrations      from the two foci was incon
 siderable.    There was therefore no marked distortion of the isoseismal
 lines in the neighbourhood of the hyperbolic band, while the isacoustic
 lines are completely diverted fromthen' normal course.

  to sound-phenomena by many compilers of earthquake
  catalogues; so that it often remains uncertain whether we
  are to attribute the lack of reference to the inaudibility of
  the vibrations or to the neglect of the compiler or his
  authorities. For instance, in Barbiani’s list of earthquakes in
  Zante (1825—1863) * only 21 out of 1371 shocks are recorded
  as accompanied by sound.                           According to Mr. Roper’s cata
  logue-1',       only      21    per     cent.      of    the British earthquakes felt
  during         the    present century (1801—1889) were attended by
  sound ; but we know from other records that this low <U+FB01>gure
  is chie<U+FB02>y due to incomplete chronicling.
         Great liriluin.—Mr. David Milne, in a valuable memoir
         “
   on       Earthquake-Shocks felt in Great Britain, &c.,” remarks
   that “the shocks are invariably accompanied by sounds "12.
   Though his list contains many entries in which no mention
   of sound-phenomena is made, I believe that this statement
   is practically correct.                 Among the undoubted earthquakes of
   the last ten years 1 know of only one exception.                                 The well
   known Comrie earthquakes are hardly, if ever, free from
   sound; indeed, the observers speak of “hearing the earth
.
   quakes,” rather than of feeling them.

   The proportion of observers who hear the sound is generally
very great in British earthquakes,      as will be seen from
Table           III.
              With one exception the percentage is higher
for slight than for strong shocks.    This of course is partly
due to the sound-area in the latter cases being somewhat less
than the disturbed area, but not to any great extent, for the
number of observers outside the sound-area is always small.
                            I
It is rather due, think, to the sound being by far the most
prominent feature in a weak earthquake.
   Italy—The organization for the study of earthquakes is
more com lete in this country than in any other except
Japan.- T e results are published by the Central O<U+FB01>ice of
Meteorology and Geodynamics at Rome ‘.          Owing to the
uncertainty in some of the time-records, it is not always
possible to group together the observations of the same
earthquake, and a small error may thus enter into the
estimates.   In the two years 1895—1896 the total number of
earthquakes (excluding those of distant origin, and others
registered only by instruments) is 692, and of these 217, or
314 per cent., are recorded as accompanied by sound. In
different earthquakes the percentage of records in which
sound-phenomena are mentioned is very variable, ranging
from 18 for the earthquake of June 10, 1695, to 47 for that
of April 13,1895.      In the Verona earthquake of June 7,
1891, 34 per cent. of the observers heard the sound.    Out of
274 after-shocks of this earthquake, only 25, or 9 per cent;
were attended by sound ; and of one of the strongest of these
shocks, that of Aug. 31, only <U+FB01>ve out of 101 observers were
recorded as auditors of the sound                 1'.

   Aduiirable as are the observations collected    the Central     by
Of<U+FB01>ce,        important,
                it    is  from  the present‘point  of view, to
notice how large     number (more than 60 per cent.) consist
                             a
of records from single places, though there were often several
observers at each place mentioned.      The next Table shows
the relation between the number of records of each earth
quake and the audibility           the accompanying
                                             of         sound
 henomena.
    This'Table shows very clearly how the audibility of the
 sound increases with the number of records of the earthquake.
 It might of course be argued from this that the number of
 records depends on the extent of the disturbed-area, and this
 again on the strength of the shock in-othcr words, that the

the larger    number     of   records, there        the greater chance of

Italy may     be  inferior   in  this   respect to the average observer
in Great Britain,        it  dif<U+FB01>cult, Ithink, to resist the conclusion
                              is
that, with    a  large enough number of records, every Italian
 earthquake    would    be found to be accompanied              sound.                   by
    Japan—For         this  country      we  have  Prof.  Milne’s valuable
catalogue of 8331 earthquakes recorded between 1885 and.
 1892*.     Many of the shocks originated beneath the sea, and
in the following estimates these have been omitted, for, in
some cases,    it   is possible that the sound-area may not have
reached the land.         There remain 5902 earthquakes, of which
 1562, or 26'5 per cent., were accompanied by sound.
    The percentage varies from year to year, being for the
eight years included in the record, 380, 420, 304, 30'0,
 33'7, 20'4, 206, and 292 respectively.                 The low percent
ages    for  the   years   1890      and   1891  are  due  to the prepon
 derance of earthquakes           in   certain districts where the sounds
 are somewhat rarely heard.
    In his great catalogue from which the above results are
 obtained, Prof. Milne gives approximately the disturbed area
 and the position of the epicentre of nearly every earthquake.
 For the latter purpose the whole country                     divided into          is
 rectangles,   the   sides    of   which    are     sixth aof     degree of               a
 latitude   and   longitude      in   length.    Prof.  Milne  has studied
 the distribution of earthquakes accompanied by sound by
 placing  a  mark in the epicentral rectangle of each such earth
 quake.     He   has shown that the number of these earthquakes

varies considerably in different districts, and has endeavoured
to trace the connexion between the frequency of sound
accompanied earthquakes and the geological structure of the
district.    I shall refer to these conclusions in the next
section.
   It is clear, however, that the number of earthquakes ac
companied by sound must be a function of the total number
of earthquakes, and, therefore, that a better method would be
to study the variation in the ratio of the former number to
the latter.        I
                 have tried to do this for the whole of Japan,
but, great as is the number of recorded shocks, it is not
suf<U+FB01>cient for the purpose ; though a map of a smaller district,
in which earthquakes were exceedingly numerous, is given
in <U+FB01>g. 2. Taking only those rectangles which contain not
less than 20 epicentres during the years 1885—1892, the per
centage of the total number of earthquakes that were accom
          by sound may be as high as 77, and as low as zero.

   A point of great importance is the relation between the
audibility of an earthquake and its disturbed area. This is
shown in Table V.

If  we omit the years 1890—1892, on account of the large
numbers of attershocks of the Kumalnoto and Mino-Owari
earthquakes that were unaccompanied by sound, the corre
sponding percentages are
             25'9, 24'4, 41'7, 45'5, 629, 698, and 59'7.
   Thus we see that, with some comparatively unimportant
exceptions, the audibility of an earthquake increases with its
disturbed area, that              is,
                         roughly, with its intensity. But the

most important fact brought out by this analysis is that the
highest percentage is only 70.       The continual approach
towards a percentage of 100, which is characteristic of Italian
earthquakes, is here absent.  That in eight years as many as
65 earthquakes should disturb areas of more than 10,000
square miles and yet be unaccompanied by recorded sound,
while the audibility increases as a rule with the disturbed
area, is indicative,  in all probability, of the defective

   Other Count-ries.——-The evidence for other countries is much
less complete than in the preceding, and I will therefore
merely give a few examples.      Of 521 Greek earthquakes in
1896 recorded by Dr. S. A. Papavasiliou, 160, or 307 per
cent., were accompanied by sound.       Of these, 309 were felt
in the island of Zante, and 101, or 327 per cent., of these
were attended by soundT.       Of 39 earthquakes recorded in
New Zealand in 1891, sound was heard with 18, or 46 per
centi. In the Charleston earthquake of 1886 the audibilitys
percentage. is low in nearly every State, being 195 in the
central State of South Carolina, and, among the neighbouring
States, 21'2 in Virginia, 308 in North Carolina, 17'9 in
Tennessee, 205 in Georgia, 125 in Alabama, and 230 per
cent. in Florida; but it is possible that these low <U+FB01>gures are
due to the incompleteness of the records§.     The most reliable
records for any non-British earthquake are probably those
which are obtained from Prof. F. Suess’s study of the Laibach
earthquake of April 14, 1895.       In this case the audibility-r
percentage is 608 for the whole disturbed area, and 96'7 for

Relation        between     Sound-Audibz'lz'ty     and Geological Structure.
   In earthquakes which are strong enough to be recorded by
seismographs, both the period and amplitude of the vibrations
depend on the nature of the surface-rocks.     It therefore       is
reasonable to suppose that some relation must exist between
the audibility of the shortsperiod vibrations and the nature

of the rocks in which the earthquake originates or of th0se
on which the observers are situated. Mr. C. A. Stevenson
remarks that in the Scottish earthquake of November 28,
1880, most of the observers near the epicentre who heard the
sound were stationed on hard dense rocks with little or no
soil near them *. But the records of this earthquake are too
few to establish a general law.
   Prof. Millie’s discussion of the sound-phenomena of the
Japanese earthquakes is founded on a very large number of
records. In the whole country he indicates <U+FB01>fteen districts
in which earthquakes are specially numerous, and examines
the sound-phenomena with respect to its geological structure.
The conclusion at which he arrives is that “ generally sound
is heard in rocky mountainous districts, while in the alluvial
                                      ”
plains it is but rarely observed                 1’.
   The relative, rather than the absolute, frequency of sound
accom anied earthquakes being, however, the more correct
test,I     ave calculated the percentage of the earthquakes in
each district that were attended by sound and that originated
under land. They are as follows :—21'6. 186, 1'8, 18'7,
30'0, 29'9, 23'1, 34'5, 26‘7, 33'3, 8'0, 509, 42'2, 16'9, and
50'0. Prof. Millie’s general conclusion             in part supported,

                                  this more de<U+FB01>nite evidence. On

    Possibly the districts are too large for the deduction of
general laws. But,            we take only the rectangles, whose

to 928 square miles in the north, we <U+FB01>nd great variety of
audibility-percentage       within the limits of a district.         For
instance, in four consecutive rectangles              bounded by the

 on the nature of the rock beneath which it originated, the
 percentage of audibility should not vary perceptibly at dif
ferent times; and this is very far from being the case.
 Taking the district 7 as a whole, the percentage in November
 1891 (immediately after the Mino-Owari earthquake) was
 17'9, and during the next <U+FB01>ve months it lay between 105
and 121; then it suddenly rose to 388 in May 1892, and
 during the following seven months never fell below 32‘4,
 while it maintained an average of 418.                 In the smaller
 rectangles we <U+FB01>nd the same variety ; in one (that numbered
 1457), for instance, the percentage was 7 '7 during the three
months November 1891—January 1892, and 390 during the
next eleven months; in another (1402) the percentages during
the same intervals were 10'?) and 55'4 respectively.
     Thus whatever the nature of the relation between the
audibility of Japanese earthquakes and the geological structure
may be, it seems to he often masked by other conditions of
greater importance, one of which will now be considered.
        Equal-Audibility Curves in the M'no- Owari DtStTiCt
                                 (Japan).
     The district represented in the accompanying map (<U+FB01>g. 2)
is that part of Japan in which the M ino-Owari earthquake of
1891 and the majority of the very numerous after-shocks
were most prominently felt.           It is bounded by the parallels
34° 40’ and 35° 50’ of north latitude and by the meridians
2° 10' and 3° 30’ west of Tokio.             During the eight years
 1885—1892 the total number of earthquakes felt in the district
was 3014, and of these 604, or 20 per cent., were accom
panied by sound.            The percentage, however, varies very
widely in different parts of the area in question, and the con
tinuous curves in <U+FB01>g. 2 represent this variation.              Dividing
the whole area into 56 rectangles, the sides of which are one
sixth of a degree of latitude and longitude in length, the
percentage of audible earthquakes originating Within each
rectangle is supposed to correspond to the centre of that
rectangle, and the curves are drawn in the same way as
isacoustic lines. The meaning of any curve, say that marked
40, is as follows :—If any point on the curve be regarded as
the centre of a small area, then 40 per cent. of the earth
quakes whose centres are included within this area were

the rectangles where there are no epicentres, or in isolated rectangles
where the number of epicentres is very small.

 meizoseismal area is forked, the main branch proceeding
 towards the south, and that the principal group of curves
 follows this branch.      The more northerly     group of curves
also lies along the main nleizoseismal area, while the third
 group of curves lies roughly in the prolongation of the
 easterly branch of the meizoseismal area.
    It will be seen in a later section that the sound in Japanese
earthquakes is only heard within a few miles from the origin.

<U+FB01>cial earthquakes would have a greater chance of being

 audible than those which originate at a greater depth, and
 that the curves of highest percentages correspond to the
 earth uakes with the shallowest foci.            It is therefore possible
that t e axes of the systems of curves in <U+FB01>g. 2 may mark
 out approximately the lines of growing faults.
      Relation between the Intensities of the Shock and Sound.
    Within and near the epicentre] region of an earthquake,
the intensity of the sound increases and decreases with that
of the shock. Also, when the shock consists of two series of
vibrations or contains two maxima of intensity, the stronger
series or maximum is accompanied by the louder noise ; but
the difference of intensity in the case of the sound is much
less pronounced than in that of the shock.
    In different earthquakes, again, while the intensities of the
sound and shock certainly appear to increase together, the
sound which accompanies the stronger shocks is not much
louder than that which attends the weaker ones at places
near the epicentre.           Similar terms are used in describing
both: in the one case, for instance, the rumbling of a train
going over a bridge only intensi<U+FB01>ed a hundred times; in the
other, the rumbling of thirty or forty waggons travelling at
a rapid pace.       Humboldt also notices that “the intensity of
the hollow     noise  which generally accompanies an earthquake
does not increase in the same degree as the force of the oscil.
lations”*.      1n the Comrie earthquakes, according to one
observer,     “a   loud noise accompanies every shock, propor
tionate in loudness to its strength, . . . but in the lesser ones
no vibration is perceptible, merely the peculiar report is
heard.”       Again, in October 1846 three great shocks occurred
in New Zealand, and were succeeded by numerous slight
tremors.       “In the two last of the three grand shocks,”
writes Sir W. Fitzherbert, “the roaring was certainly con‘
siderable, but it was inconsiderable when compared with the
concussion, whilst in the minor shocks the vibration was
tri<U+FB02>ing    as compared      with the report ”'l'.
   Relations   between    the  Sound-Area and      the  Disturbed Area.
    Relative Magnitude of Sound-Area and Disturbed Area.—
 The ratio which the extent of the sound-area bears to that of
the disturbed area ranges continuously between the widest
possible limits.       At the one limit, the shock is felt but is
unaccompanied by sound; at the other, the sound is heard
without any attendant shock.

   (1) The case in which no sound is board has already been
considered in discussing the inaudibility of some earthquakes ;
and it is probable, as there suggested, that the absence of
recorded sound is due to the defective auditory powers of the
observers.
             In
           the great majority of    strong and violent earth
quakes, the sound-area occupies     a region surrounding     the
epicentre, while the disturbed area extends beyond it in every
direction.   In Great Britain, the sound-area in our strongest
earthquakes is often considerable. In the Pembroke earth
quake of 1893, the disturbed area contains about 63,600 square
miles and the sound-area about 37,700 square miles, being
231 miles long and 210 miles broad.       The Hereford earth
quake of 1896 disturbed an area of not less than 98,000
square miles, while the sound was heard over a district 320
and 284 miles in length and breadth and about 70,000 square
miles in area.   The Essex earthquake of 1884 was felt over
about 50,000 square miles, and, excluding an isolated obser
vation, the sound was heard as far as 114 miles from the
centre *.
   Similar materials for the earthquakes of other countries
are rare.   In the Verny (Turkestan) earthquake of 1887, the
disturbed area is about 950 miles long, 560 miles broad, and
about 400,000 square miles in area; the corresponding di
mensions for the sound-area are 650 and 290 miles, and
about 132,000 square miles       The Neapolitan earthquake of

   While the sound-area may thus attain such great dimen
sions in European and American earthquakes, the case is very
different in those felt in Japan. When Prof. Milne remarks
that “ earthquake sounds only travel a few miles from their
origin” *, or “the very fact that the sound . . . was heard
indicates . . . that those who heard the noise were not many
miles removed from the origin”                he

which originated beneath land, during the years 1885—1892,

                                                              as we have
seen,  26'5.    For  the  submarine    shocks     for  the  same   period
the percentage         only 084, and none of the earthquakes
                       is
studied originated at       agreater distance than 40 or 50 miles
from the shore, while the epicentres of 93 per cent. of the
total number were not more than 10 miles distant.
   The comparatively poor powers of the Japanese people for
hearing deep sounds are of course responsible for the small
dimensions of the sound~areas.           The limited sound-area of
the Neapolitan earthquake        isperhaps due to want of observa
tions, Mallet’s inquiries having been con<U+FB01>ned principally to
the epicentral region.         In the Charleston earthquake, we
have     large
        a.      sound-area   with  an apparently low percentage of
audibility   ;but the smallness of the latter quantity           probably   is
owing to the imperfection of the records, for the percentage
in the central State of South Carolina           less than in six more
                                                     is
distant States.      For the more recent British earthquakes
observations are numerous, and here we have                    high per   a
centage of         audibility occurring       with comparatively                 large
sound-areas.
   (3) In    few earthquakes the disturbed area and sound
             a
area practically coincide, the boundaries of both being deter
mined by the same places of observation. The shocks are
generally of moderate strength, the disturbed areas ranging
from about 400 to 2000 square miles, and in one case, that
of the Inverness earthquake of 1890, to 4340 square miles.

      (4) In many slight British earthquakes the sound-area
  overlaps the disturbed area, as a rule only on one side, but
  sometimes in every direction.            The Cornwall earthquake of
  April 1, 1898, had a disturbed area of about 175 square miles,
  beyond which the sound-area extended for a mile or two
  towards the south-west, north, and north-east (see <U+FB01>g. 3, p. 60).
  In the Comrie earthquake of July 12, 1895, the disturbed
  area contained only 18% square miles ; the sound-area over
  lapped its boundary by two or three miles towards the north
  and west, if not in all directions.         The Oomrie earthquake of
  Aug. 26, 1898, was still weaker; the sound-area contained
'butla few square miles, while the shock was only felt at one
  or two places within it.
       (5) The limiting case, in which earth-sounds are heard
  without any accompanying shock, is of considerable interest.
  .As a general rule, they appear to form part of the series of
  after-shocks of a great earthquake, or occur as intercalated
  members of a series of weak shocks.              But it is possible that,
  under the names of barisal guns, mist-poetfers, marinas, &c.,
  they may also be heard quite detached from an earthquake
  series; though the identification of these mysterious noises
  with earth-sounds must be regarded as uncertain for the
  present.
      Most, if not all, great earthquakes appear to include nume
  rous earth-sounds among their attendant crowds of after
  shoeks, especially in and near the epicentral regions.                   Even
  in Japan, where the audibility-percentage is so low, they are
  far from uncommon.            For instance, the 3305 after-shocks of
  the Mino-Owari earthquake recorded at Gifu between Oct. 28,
  1891, and the end of 1893, included 10 violent shocks, 97
  strong, 1808 weak, 1041 feeble shocks, and 409 math
  sounds *. On the other hand, in Great Britain, where the
  audibility-percentage is high, earth-sounds are occasionally
  numerous, especially at Comrie.            After the strong shock of
  Oct. 23, 1839, one observer at Oomrie noted between this
  date and the end of 1841, 19 earthquake-shocks (10 of which
  are described as vertical, and 7 lateral), 25 tremors, and 234
  earth-sounds T.
      It seems unnecessary to accumulate many further examples,
  but reference should be made to three cases in which earth
  sounds were especially numerous.              In the island of Meleda,
 in     the   Adriatic   Sea,   earth-sounds    were heard during the

    years 1822—1826.    Partsch, in his valuable memoir describing
    them, inserts a chronicle of the shocks and sounds observed
    by a resident in the island, from Nov. 17, 1824, to Feb. 18,
    1826; from which it appears that there were during this
    time 30 shocks and 71 detonations.        Of the shocks, all but
    three were accompanied by sound ; and 18 of the remaining
                              “
    shocks are described as      succussory,” i. e. they consisted of
    a more or less vertical movement *.
       The district surrounding East Haddam, in Connecticut,
    U.S.A., is another in which earth-sounds were at one time
    frequent.    Before the English settlements, they were well
    known to the Indian inhabitants, who called the place
    ZlIore/zemoodus, or place of noises, and
                                               “ drove a

    trade at worshipping      the devil” there.       The sounds are
    described in the following terms by a writer in 1729 :—
    “
       Whether it be <U+FB01>re or air distressed in the subterraneous
    caverns of the earth, cannot be known ; for there is no erup
    tion, no explosion perceptible, but by sounds and tremors,
    which sometimes are very fearful and dreadful.                   I
                                                                  have
    myself heard eight   or ten   sounds successively,  and  imitating
    small arms, in the space of <U+FB01>ve minutes.                     I
                                                    I have, suppose,
    heard several hundreds of them within twenty years; some
    more, some less terrible.      Sometimes we have heard them
    almost every day,   and  great numbers of them in the space of
    a year.    Oftentimes          I
                                have observed them to be coming
    down from the north imitating slow thunder, until the sound
    came near, or right under, and then there seemed to be a
'
    breaking, like the noise of a cannon shot, or severe thunder,
    which shakes the houses and all that is in them.”         Another
     observer, writing about the beginning of the present, or end
     of the last century, says :—“ The awful noises described in
    the preceding extract . . . . continue to the present time.
    The effects they produce are various as the intermediate
    degrees between the roar of a cannon and the noise of a
    pistol. The concussions of the earth, made at the same time,
    are as much diversi<U+FB01>ed as the sounds in the air.        The shock
    they give to a dwelling-house is the same as the falling of
    logs on the <U+FB02>oor. The smaller shocks . . . . are spoken of as
    usual occurrences, and are called Moodus noises.         But when
    they are so violent as to be heard in the adjacent houses, they
    are called earthquakes

     Lastly, a ver       remarkable        series of earth-sounds is that
described by flumboldt                  as the subterranean thunder of
Guanaxuato, a city on the Mexican plateau far removed from
any active volcano. “The noise,” he says, “began about
midnight on the 9th of January, 1784, and continued for a
month . . . . From the 13th to the 16th of January, it seemed
to the inhabitants as     heavy clouds lay beneath their feet, from
                            it'
which issued alternate slow rolling sounds and short quick
claps of thunder.      The noise abated as gradually as          had  it
begun. It was limited to         small space and was not heard in
                                      a
a  basaltic district at    distance of
                            a               few miles.”
                                                   a     “Neither
on the surface of the earth, nor in mines 1600 feet in depth
was the slightest shock to be perceived.          No similar noise
had ever before been heard on the elevated table-land of Mexico,
nor has this terri<U+FB01>c phenomenon since occurred there

    From the above examples, and from others that might be
quoted, we may infer: (1) that earth-sounds especially cha
racterize those districts where slight shocks are frequent;
 (2) that in the midst of      series of earth-sounds one or more
                                  a
slight shocks, accompanied by precisely similar sounds, are
occasionally intercalated         1';
                                  (3) that when moderate shocks
are felt, the earth-sounds are heard at places where the motion
is  frequently vertical, and, when strong shocks are felt, at

Prof. Omori also remarks (Journ. Coll. Sci. Imp. Univ. Japan, vol. vii.
t.   2,1894, pp. 197—198) that “many of the after-shocks of the Mino
gwari earthquake were attended with sounds, which were essentially of
two types, being either rushing feeble noises like those caused by winds,
or loud rumbling sounds like those caused by the fall of heavy wei‘rht on

which were sometimes like detonations of thunder, were most frequent
and distinct in the     eo Valley [the epicentral district], where, as
                        N                                                  I

ground accompanying these sounds Were invariably very feeble, and often
not to be felt at all.”

    Relative Position of Sound-Area and Disturbed Area.—
The excentricity of the sound-area with respect to the iso
seismal lines is one of the most signi<U+FB01>cant phenomena of earth
quake-sounds.       In weak earthquakes the sound is a more
prominent     feature  than the shock, and it is in these that the
excentricity is most easily detected; but            I believe that, with
a suf<U+FB01>ciently careful stud , it would be found to exist in
nearly all earthquakes. Thus, in the Leicester earthquake of
1893, which disturbed an area 58 miles long from W. 38° N.
to E. 38° 8., and 46 miles broad, the sound-area and dis
turbed area apparently coincided.           Near the north-west end
of the longer axis, however, the shock was felt, but no sound
was heard, by observers at <U+FB01>ve places; while at seven places
towards the opposite end, the sound was heard without any
shock being sensible.        It is thus clear that the isacoustic
lines,  if they  could  have  been drawn, would, relatively to the
isoseismals, be displaced towards the south-east.
    The sound-area of the Pembroke earthquake of 1893 was
bounded by a line similar in form and size to the isoseismal 4,
 such that, if the latter curve were shifted about ten or twelve
 miles in the direction of its longer axis, it would roughly
 coincide with the fermer line.         in the Neapolitan earthquake
 of 1857, the records collected by Mallet in his great work
 show that the boundary of the sound-area is similarly displaced
in the direction of the longer axis of the innermost isoseismal.
 The peculiar form of the isacoustic lines of the Hereford
 earthquake of 1896 and their aberration from the isoseismal
 lines have been alluded to above.            The observations of the
 Edinburgh and Lancashire earthquakes of 1889 are somewhat
 scanty, but they appear to indicate that the sound-areas
 were shifted towards the lines of the earthquake-faults *.
     In the slight earthquakes of this country the excentricity
 of the sound-area is manifested by its overlapping the dis
 turbed area in one direction. In the accompanying map (p. 60)
 the continuous lines represent the isoseismals of intensities 3
 and 4 of the Cornwall earthquake of April 1, 1898.             The outer
 dotted line indicates roughly the boundary of the sound-area,
 and the inner dotted line, which is concentric with the former,
 separates the places where the sound was very loud from
 those where it was distinctly fainter.          The relative positions
 of the isoseismals show that the earthquake-fault must hade
  towards the south-east, and therefore that the sound-area,

      strong shocks have been omitted, on account of their numerical
     inferiority. The three curves, continuous, broken, and dotted,
      represent respectively the percentages (with regard to the
      total number of earthquakes each month) of the weak shocks,
      feeble shocks, and sounds, beginning in Nov. 1891.               During
      the <U+FB01>rst three months, the weak shocks rapidly decline in
      relative frequency, while there is a corresponding increase in
      that of both feeble shocks and sounds.              But, at the end of
      <U+FB01>ve months, the two latter        curves    begin to diverge, the feeble
      shocks being subject to a <U+FB02>uctuating increase, and the sounds
      to a <U+FB02>uctuating decrease, in relative frequency.
         Very similar, though less exact, is the evidence furnished
      by Drummond’s Comrie record from Oct. 1839 to Dec. 1841,
      the principal shock being that which occurred on Oct. 23,
      1839 *.     In this series the earth-sounds greatly predominated,

there being 276 earth-sounds and only 5-1 shocks and tremors.
If  we divide the whole time into nine intervals of three
months each, the percentages of earth-sounds in the several
intervals are 87, 89, 88, 100, 95, 80, 50, 76, and 50 ; showing
that towards the close of the period considered, the perceptible
shocks increased in relative frequency.
                   Time-Relations                       qftlre Sound and Shock.
      In earthquake-catalogues,the time—relations of the sound
and  shock are not often recorded  ; and it is therefore probable
that such entries, when they do occur, refer to the more
prominent relations. In Mallet’s great catalogue, for instance,
the time-relations are given for only 423 earthquakes; and
in these the sound is said to have preceded the shock in 100
cases, accompanied it in 307, followed it in 9, preceded and
accompanied it in 2, accompanied and followed it in 2, and
preceded, accompanied, and followed it in 3 cases.        Thus,
either the sound occurred more frequently before the shock
than after, or the sound which preceded the shock was louder
and more readily observed than that which followed.
   In studying the more recent British earthquakes,        have                                                   I
endeavoured to attain greater precision in de<U+FB01>ning the time

namely, the beginning, epoch of maximum intensity, and the
end.    In the Table which follows, the letters p, c, and indi

            Dr. G. Davison on Earthquake-Sounds.                 63
   Thus, as a general rule, the beginning of the sound precedes
that of the shock, but occasionally coincides with    it,  especially
when the earthquake      is   weak. For weak shocks the epochs
of maximum intensity of both always coincide; while, for
stronger shocks, the epoch of maximum intensity of the sound
generally coincides with, but sometimes precedes, that of the
shock. The end of the sound hardly ever precedes, but often
coincides with, that of the shock in weak earthquakes, and in
 both strong and weak earthquakes more frequently follows         it
 than otherwise.
    Time-Relatz'ons with regard to Distance from the Epicentre.—
The great majority of the records are from places not far from
the epicentre.     The effect of distance on the time-relations   is
 shown more clearly in the next Table (p. 64), in which the
 number of observations       is given for each epoch and district;
 but for convenience of comparison the <U+FB01>gures in the other
 columns are percentages of the numbers of observations. This
 Table of necessity refers only to the stronger earthquakes.
    It appears, then, that the beginning of the sound generally
 precedes that of the shock in all parts of the sound-areas, even
 close to the epicentre.
    The epochs of maximum intensity of the sound and shock
 coincide, as  a   rule, especially in the central counties and
 outer ring but in the inner ring of counties observations of
           ;
 precedence increase in frequency. In the case of the Hereford
 earthquake, an analysis of the observations according to di
 rection, though   it rests on small number of records, indicates
                               a
 that the percentage of observations of coincidence undergoes
 a marked decrease in the inner ring in the counties traversed
 by the longer axis of the isoseismal lines, while in those which
 lie along the shorter axis        it   nearly constant. The much
                                        is
 weaker Leicester earthquake of 1893 leads to          a   somewhat
 similar  conclusion.     The   epoch  of  maximum   intensity of the
 sound preceded that of the shock at 19 places, which are, as      a
 rule, near the ends of the longer axis of the disturbed area      ;
 and coincided with     it  at 18 places, which are not far distant
 from   the epicentre   or shorter   axis, and in two cases close to
 the ends of that axis.
    In the Pembroke earthquake of 1892, the end of the sound
 generally followed that of the shock all over the disturbed
 area; in that of 1893, observations of coincidence increase
 with the distance from the origin.          On the whole, the per
 centages   for this epoch   in the Hereford  earthquake do not var
 much with the distance.        In the Leicester earthquake of 1893
 the end of the sound preceded that of the shock at 16 places
 generally near the longer axis             the disturbed area, and

  especially close to the ends of it; and it followed it at 16
  places chie<U+FB02>y near the epicentre or the shorter axis.
     Apparent Outracing of the Shock by the Shani—The partial
  coincidence of the sound with the shock at places near the
  epicentre, and its precedence at others more distant, have led
  some seismologists to believe that the sound-vibrations travel
 with a greater velocity than those which constitute the per
  ceptible shock *. From the evidence of British earthquakes
 we may conclude that the difference in velocity, if it exist, is
 very slight; for, otherwise, the sound could not be heard after
 the shock at places so far distant as 180 miles from the
 epicentre        1'.
     In the earthquakes of some other countries        would seemit
 that the sound generally ceases before the shock, and often
 before the shock begins. In such cases there       clearly at least
                                                            is
 an apparent outracing of the shock by the sound; but                           it   is
 not improbable that this due merely to the defective powers
                                         is
 of the observers for hearing the weak sound which follows the
 shock.
    Relative Duration     the Sound and Shock—When the time-.
                                    of
 relations of both beginning and end of the sound and shock
 are noted by observers,         generally possible to determine
                                         it   is
 their relative duration.     The <U+FB01>gures in the following table
 give the number of records in which the duration of the
 sound      greater than, equal to, or less than that of the
             is
 shock, as well as the number in which the relative duration                         is
 doubtful.
    The most important <U+FB01>gures in Table VIII. (p. 66) are those
which give the duration of the sound as greater or less than that
 of the shock. Those which make the duration ofboth equal are
not entitled to the same consideration; for the statement that
the sound and shock were coincident at both ends                less       is
precise than the others.       We may therefore conclude that
the duration of the sound         generally greater than that of
                                               is
the shock.

                             Origin of Earthquake-Sounds.
       In    any earthquake there are generally three well-defined
  stages of motion—the                      preliminary tremor, the principal
  portion, and the end portion.                      In the <U+FB01>rst, the characteristic
  movements are small in amplitude and short in period; the
  second and most active part of the disturbance consists chie<U+FB02>y
  of vibrations of larger amplitude and longer period ; and these
  'are followed by the feeble movements which constitute the
   end portion.               Slow undulations, with a period of about
   one-half to two seconds, may, however, be present in all three
   stages; while the ripples, with a period of one-tenth of a
   second or more, may be superposed on the slow undulations
  in the second and third stages as well as in the <U+FB01>rst. The
   average period of the ripples, it is important to notice, is
   slightly greater during the principal portion than during the
   other two stages *.
        During the earlier part of the movement there is a distinct
   increase in the period of the vibrations; and this has led some
   seismologists'l' (all at the time living in Japan) to suggest
        "

that the <U+FB01>rst recorded tremors may be the successors of those
which produce the preliminary earthquake-sound.          The ob
servations of British earthquakes show, however, that the
sound-vibrations are not con<U+FB01>ned to the earlier stage, but
that, like the ripples, they are also superposed on the slow
undulations which form the main feature of the principal and
end portions of an earthquake.
    Some of the phenomena of earthquake-sounds, as we have
seen, are due to the neighbourhood of the sound to the varying
lower limit of audibility.    There are others, such as the time
and space-relations of the sound and shock, for which a different
explanation is required, and whose origin is of a geological
rather than a physical character.
    The theory which follows is based on the supposition that
 the majority of non-volcanic      earthquakes are due to the
 gradual,  but  intermittent,  growth of faults; the immediate
 cause of the disturbance being the friction produced by the
 slipping and rubbing of one of the adjoining rock-masses over
 and against the other *.
    A fault-slip does not of necessity take place concurrently
 all over the focus or instantaneously at any one point of it.
 But, as a. general rule, it certainly occupies a very short
 interval of time, and at places near the epicentre the duration
 of the sensible part of an earthquake must be mainly due to
 the size of the focus and the <U+FB01>nite velocity of the earth-.
waves.
    The seismic focus is practically a. surface inclined to the
horizon, and is often of great length in a horizontal direction.
 In its simplest form there will be a central region of the fault
 surface where the relative displacement of the two rock-masses
is a maximum, and this will be surrounded by a region in
 which the relative displacement is small, and gradually dies
 away towards the edges.      As the vibrations of great ampli
 tude are  also of long  period,  we may consider that from all
 parts of the focus   there  start together vibrations of various
 amplitude and period, the large and slow undulations coming
 mostly from the central region, and the small and rapid vibra
 tions from those which bound it. It          believe, from these
                                                  is,

marginal regions, and especially from the upper and lateral
margins, that the more sensible sound-vibrations chie<U+FB02>y come.
I   will now endeavour to show how the phenomena of earth
quake-sounds can be explained on this theory.
    If  there is no discontinuity in period between the large
vibrations which come from the centre of the area and the
sound-vibrations from the focal margins, it is evident that
among the vibrations must be included those which produce
the deepest sound that can be heard by the human ear.           The
rumbling character of the sound may be due partly to its
 neighbourhood to the lower limit of audibility, partly, no
 doubt, to irregularities in the fault-surface producing local
 variations in the initial disturbance.        To the latter cause
 may also be owing the intermittent         sounds   heard by some
observers.
     But whether there be any slight <U+FB02>uctuations in amplitude
 and period, or not, it is evident that the average intensity of the
 sound must gradually increase until the shock is felt; and as
 soon as it is over, or nearly over, must gradually die away.     At
 the same time the greater amplitude of the vibrations from
 near the central part of the focus will render audible vibrations
 of longer period than those which come from the margins;
 and thus the depth of the sound will increase and decrease
 with the intensities of the sound and shock.        Especially will
 this be the case with the vibrations from       the neighbourhood
 of that part of the focus where the initial amplitude is greatest;
 and the strongest vibrations and loud explosive crashes
 audible to some persons should therefore be observed con
 currently.
     Similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that the intensity
 of the sound should increase with that of the shock in dif
 ferent earthquakes, and that the sound should be deeper with
 strong shocks than with weak ones.         But while the marginal
 vibrations are limited in period and amplitude, those from the
 central parts of the focus have a much wider range. With
 very weak shocks the sound should be the most prominent
 feature; with very strong ones the sound, though actually
 louder, should be relatively insigni<U+FB01>cant; and when, as in the
  Hereford earthquake, the earthquake consists of two distinct
 parts, the two shocks may differ widely in intensity, while the
  accompanying sounds may be almost equally loud.
     With observers of given average auditory powers, the mag~
  nitude of the sound-area depends on the limited strength of
  the marginal vibrations, and on the dimensions of the seismic
  focus, and therefore of its marginal regions.      The magnitude
  of the disturbed area depends partly on the size of the focus,

               Dr. G. Davison on Earthquake-Sounds.                      69
     chie<U+FB02>y perhaps on the initial intensity of the vibrations from
    its central portion.    While the dimensions of the sound-area
    should generally increase with those of the disturbed area, it
    is evident that they should not increase in the same ratio.
    With very strong shocks, the sound-area should be' a compa
.
    ratively small district surrounding the epicentre. With very
    slight ones, the marginal regions would be so great compared
    with the central portion of the focus, that the sound-area
    might overlap the disturbed area.       In the limit, the central
    portion of the focus would vanish, and an earth-sound would
    be the only result sensible to human beings *.
       Several of the phenomena of earthquake-sounds depend on
    the superficial form and inclined position of the focus, and on
    the fact that the most sensible sound-vibrations come from the
   upper and lateral margins.         The isacoustic lines and the
   boundary of the sound-area should not be concentric with the
    isoseismal lines.    Relatively to the latter the sound-area will
    be shifted towards the fault-line, and also in a direction
   parallel toit,
                if    one lateral margin should predominate over
   the other.
       The time-relations of the sound and shock remain to be
   considered. The sound-vibrations from the margin nearest
   to the observer should be heard before the shock begins, those
   from the upper margin, and possibly from parts of the central
   portion, during the progress of the shock, and those from the
   furthest margin after the shock ends.       Moreover, the sound
   vibrations from the nearer lateral margin will he of greater
  intensity than those from the further one; and thus the fore
  sound should be more generally heard than the after-sound,
  and with Japanese and some other observers should be the
  only one perceptible.       The percentage of observations of the
  after-sound should also diminish with the increasing distance
  from the origin; and the duration of the sound, especially
  near the epicentre, should be greater than that of the shock.
      At places near the epicentre, and also at places whose
  distances are great compared with the dimensions of the
  focus, the sound-vibrations which appear loudest will be those
  which originate near the central portions of the focus; and
  thus the epochs of maximum intensity of the sound and shock
  should coincide.        If,
                            however, the horizontal length of the
 nearer focal margin be considerable, the sound which seems
 loudest to observers at       moderate distance may come from or
                                a
   it It has been suggested that the comparative smallness of the sound
area may be due to the more rapid extinction of the sound-vibrations;
but the explanation  is clearly incomplete, for

near that margin ; for there is but little change in the initial
intensity of the sound-vibrations from the neighbourhood of
the central portion.       To observers who are situated near
the continuation of the line of fault, the maximum epoch of
the sound will therefore precede that of the shock ; while to
those who are near the minor axis of the isoseismals, the two
epochs will approximately coincide.

 §
       THEa    more satisfactory manner than has hitherto been
attempted, the part that the medium plays in the P.D.
that is observed between two dissimilar metals when they are
metallically connected.      N0 experiment on this important
point, whether made in vacuo or in any gas whatsoever, can
be considered decisive unless the <U+FB01>lms of air condensed on the
two plates of metal be <U+FB01>rst removed. If the Volta effect is
due to the air at all, it is most certainly due to that part of
the atmosphere immediately surrounding the metals, namely,
to the condensed surface-layers of air or oxygen; and hence
it is in the highest degree essential to be certain of the entire
removal of this surface-layer before any experiments can be
considered decisive.       The molecular attraction between a
metal and the gaseous <U+FB01>lm in close contact with it is probably
of very considerable magnitude; hence it is useless simply to
surround the metals with another gas, and then assume that
your measurements are being made in that second gas,
ignoring the original condensed sheet of air.
    Most experimenters on the subject have either ignored
 altogether or else failed to realize in full the presence and
 possible action of these air-sheets condensed on the metals.

 A critical and, may add, wholly delightful account of the
 work done prior to the year 1884 is to be found in the
exhaustive report presented by Prof. Oliver Lodge to the
 British Association in that year. Nobody will venture to claim
<U+FB01>nality for any experiment bearing on the subject that is
described in that report. Neither can it be said that any work
published since that date effectually and decisivel clears up
the many doubts and dif<U+FB01>culties with which t is matter
bristles.   There are, however, two important researches con
cerning   which  a few remarks here would not be out of place.

  merely measured the Volta contact-di<U+FB02>'erence               between two
  disks of zinc and copper in high vacua of air and hydrogen,
 the pressure being less than 553 mm. of mercury, and showed
 that on readmitting air to atmospheric pressure no variation
 of the RD. as great as 1 per cent. ensued.                   Seeing that
  Dr. Bottomley did not so much as warm his vacuum-tube,
 there is not much reason to suppose that the result would
 have been otherwise than what it actually was.             Dr. Erskine
 Murray, who quite realized the possible importance of the
 condensed air-<U+FB01>lms in the production of the Volta phenomena,
 attacked the problem rather more indirectly; but his method
  of removing the <U+FB01>lms by <U+FB01>ling the surfaces of the metals
  under melted para<U+FB02>in-wax cannot,              I think, he considered as
 entirely satisfactory.     In   the <U+FB01>rst  place it ignores the probable
  electrolytic action of the wax, or of the moisture in the wax,
  for apparently no precautions were taken to dry it; and oven
                                        I
 if these effects be disregarded, believe it improbable in the
 highest degree that merely <U+FB01>ling off the surface-layer of metal
 is suf<U+FB01>cient to remove these condensed air-sheets.              Why, the
 <U+FB01>le itself is covered with a <U+FB01>lm of air I
     § 2. It seemed, therefore, that in spite of the enormous
 quantity of experimental work that this controversy concerning
 the contact effect had brought forth, there was still room for a
 crucial and decisive experiment which should go to the very
 root of the matter, and <U+FB01>nally satisfy all con<U+FB02>icting parties.
 It was with this ideal, possibly unattainable like all true ideals,
 in view, that      I  began experiments in this <U+FB01>eld some two
 years ago.
     §3. I will    now proceed to describe in detail the various
 forms of apparatus that were devised for these investigations,
 and give a short account of the experiments that were made
 with each.      As a rule, only the outlines and results of each
 experiment will be given ; consequently but a small proportion
 of all the observations taken will be recorded here.
     § 4. Some preliminary            experiments were made with
'the apparatus sketched           in <U+FB01>g. 1, which was made for
 Profs. Ayrton and Perry about twenty years ago. In this

 exhaustive series of contact                  measurements they made

     The results obtained were not very satis

 about in dusty cupboards for many years
 with the opening unclosed, so that the
 insulating-power of the glass supports was
 anything but high.       In consequence of
 the small capacity of the system, quite a
 small amount of leakage caused a large
 change in the potential of the insulated
 inductor; and it is quite possible that the
paraf<U+FB01>n-wax in which the terminals G, H
 were sealed was not a suf<U+FB01>ciently good
 insulator for this purpose.     It was not
 possible to measure the absolute value of
 the Volta P.D. between A and B, as the
 two metals were in permanent metallic

results.
   § 5. In designing anew apparatus,       Fig. 2.
the following points were specially
kept in view :——(1) The desirability
of being able to measure the actual
value of the Volta effect.     (2) The
absolute necessity of being able to
heat strongly the contact couple in
the highest attainable vacuum.       (3)
The necessity of having high insu
lation, in consequence of the small
capacities dealt with. It will be found
subsequently that the exigencies of
 (2) reduced the capacity still further
than would otherwise have been the
case.
   To ful<U+FB01>l condition (2) it was neces
sary to make the apparatus of hard
combustion-tubing;      but as such glass
is extremely    dif<U+FB01>cult    to work, and
as it would have been exceedingly
troublesome, if not impossible, to seal
glass tubes or platinum wires into
                                         it,
it was decided to make the apparatus
in two parts. This had the further
advantage that the plates could be
taken out and examined whenever
desirable, which would not haVe been
the case had the tube been entirely
sealed up.

 screw on to G. The nuts are insulated from the bolts and
 shaft and from one another with strips of mica.    The spindle G
 is mounted at L on a needle-point that rests in a small hole
 in the glass support N, which is shaped as shown in the
 <U+FB01>gure.    M is the end view of a. small bar-magnet which is
 screwed on the spindle.     By means of an outside horseshoe—
magnet revolving      on a turntable  one is able to turn M, and
 therefore the contact couple, through an arc of 180°, just as
in the apparatus described in §4.
    Two very <U+FB01>ne platinum wires are connected to the dis
similar metals E and F and pass out of the top of the glass
tube through the seals at P and Q ".      K1, K, are the platinum
inductors (each % in. by 5% in.). These are bent into arcs of
circles as shown in the plan of <U+FB01>g. 2, and scaled into the
highly insulating glass tubes Rand S. Platinum wires running
through these tubes pass from the inductors K1, K; to the
 outside of the apparatus, into which they are sealed. The
 wire which was always kept earthed is sealed at T, as shown
in <U+FB01>g. 2.    In the case of the insulated one S, it was necessary
to prolong the glass tube as shown in <U+FB01>g. 3 (S, S), so that a
couple of inches of its surface could always be kept highl
insulating by the common device of slipping on it a smail
<U+FB02>ask containing a little strong sulphuric acid (T, <U+FB01>g. 3). The
cork (U) is just slipped upwards when readings are being
taken. This <U+FB02>ask is not shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, as it would there
appear in front of the apparatus instead of at the side, as in
<U+FB01>g. 3. The outlet W (<U+FB01>g. 2) served to connect the tube to
the air-pump.     U is a ground-glass joint sealed in mercury.

meter exactly counterbalanced the Volta E.M.F. between the
plates E and F. A voltmeter gave the reading directly.
   § 7. The method of heating the lower part of the tube was
to slip over it a tube of copper lined with asbestos.    It was
then found quite possible to bring the tube safely to a bright
red heat with a blowpipe <U+FB02>ame.     The large distance between
the source of heat and the upper part of the tube, only about
6 or 8 inches of the lower part being heated directly, pre
vented the joints aud seals from becoming unduly heated,
and conveyance of heat by convective air-currents was pre
vented by suitably placed sheets ot' asbestos cloth. It was at
<U+FB01>rst feared that a large ground-glass joint such as O, O (<U+FB01>g. 2)
would not be suf<U+FB01>ciently air-tight for the very high vacua
that it was desired to work with, but the joint proved to have
been so very carefully ground* that when scrupulously clean
it would readily hold         a vacuum as   high   as MIT“,   mm., which
was almost the limiting reading reliably given by the McLeod
gauge.    1always  found that        I
                                  could get a far better <U+FB01>t,
although, on the other hand, it was  then far more dif<U+FB01>cult to
open after exhaustion, when the joint was quite clean and
dry than when it was smeared with even a slight trace of
glycerine.
   In other respects the apparatus did not prove so satisfactory,
In the<U+FB01>rst place it was necessary that the <U+FB01>ne platinum
wires attached to the movable plates E and F should be so
<U+FB02>exible as not to exercise any appreciable control on the free
motion of the system.       On the other hand, if they were too
loose there was fear of one or other of them coming into con
tact with the platinum inductors at some position through
which it passed.       It proved an exceedingly troublesome
operation   to make  the  exact adjustment of length necessary,
and even at their best the wires always exercised a certain
amount of control, so that it was never possible to revolve
the moving system completely through 180° of are.        This, of
course, materially diminished the sensibility of the arrange
ment. There was another cause which operated still more
in reducing the sensibility, and that was the comparatively
large distance between the movable plates and the inductors.
This was in consequence of the necessarily great length of
the spindle G,      Or,
                     so that when the plates were closer than
about 73‘; in., quite small amount of side play caused by pull
                          a
ing round the system was suf<U+FB01>cient to bring the plates into
contact.
 *I   might mention that the glass-blowing required in all these pieces
of apparatus was most satisfactorily performed by Mr. C. E. Miller.

 76           Mr. F. S. Spiers on Contact Electricity.
     When the apparatus was working at its best, and the various
 adjustments were made with the utmost possible care, a P.D.
 between the movable plates E and F of one volt caused a de
 tlexion on the electrometer of about 20 scaledivisions, the
 sensibility of the electrometer being such that a P.D. of 0.
 volt applied directly between its terminals gave a de<U+FB01>exion
 of 470 scale-divisions.
     It was impossible to increase the size of the plate and thus
 augment the sensibility of the apparatus, because its dimen
 sions were strictly limited by the diameter of the combustion
 tubing (A, A, <U+FB01>g. 2).         I  was fortunate enough to get hold
 ol a length of 1% in. diameter. As far as I am aware there was
 not another piece 01" combustion-tubing in London of greater,
 or even as great, diameter.
     § 8. In the <U+FB01>rst experiments that were made with this
 apparatus the dissimilar metals were platinum and zinc.            The
 P.D. between the two, after cleaning the latter with emery
 paper and wiping with clean dry silk, was about 0'95 volt.
 To make measurements in high vacua I. <U+FB01>rst exhausted the
 tube to a vacuum of about iU‘UU mm. (this took about four
 hours to obtain), without applying any heat at all. This
 caused no appreciable reduction of the contact force.               (In
 these experiments the degree of accuracy is not greater than
 0‘05 ot' a volt.)     The tube was then gently heated with a
 single   bunsen-<U+FB01>ame,     and the pressure soon rose, by reason of
 the heat driving off occluded or adherent gases from the glass
 and metal surfaces, to about 316 mm.             Long-continued heat
ing    with this  single  bunsen-burner       did not noticeably reduce
 the RD.    between    the  metals,    so an  additional source of heat
 was applied in the shape of another burner; but alter a couple
 of hours’ heating and pumping, although air still continued
to come off, no change in the P.D. was observed after the
metals were allowed to cool.
    The tube was next heated in a blowpipe <U+FB02>ame, the outer
_eopper shield being kept at a red heat for about 10 minutes.
Copious air-bubbles now passed through the fall tubes of the
sprengel-pump, and the pressure fell from T0160- millim. to
“1,-6 millim.      The apparatus was then allowed to cool, the
pump     being   worked    continuously.       When it was quite cold
the pressure      was   @617,“  nlillim.,  and  the RD. had fallen to
about 0'1 of a volt.       It will be seen from § 10 that this was
simply the result of oxidation of the zinc, but at the time            I
thought it might have possibly been a true diminution of the
Volta e<U+FB01>'ect due to my having driven o<U+FB01>' the greater part of
the condensed air from the surface of the metal plates.                I
therefore again heated the tube in the blowpipe <U+FB02>ame, this
time more strongly than before.                Unfortunately   the heat

              Mr. F. S. Spiers on Contact Electricity.              77
proved too <U+FB01>erce for the zinc plate, for it volatilized, covering
nearly the whole of the inside of the apparatus with a
<U+FB01>ne layer of zinc dust. The tube therefore had to be dis
mantled and opened, thoroughly cleaned, and a fresh plate
of zinc put in place of the old one.         I thought it best this
time not to use the blowpipe at all, but merely to heat the
apparatus withaconple of bunsen-burners, continuing heatin
and pumping until no more air should come away throng
the pump.     But here again, after about <U+FB01>ve hours’ heating,
the zinc again melted and the experiment proved useless.
I  then decided to dispense with the zinc plate altogether and
to replace it by a plate of aluminium, whose melting-point
is 600° 0., while that of zinc is 412° (1.
    In the course of the next series of experiments I unluckily
broke both the upper and lower parts of the tube just at the
 middle joint (1,0 in exercising a little too much vigour in
separating the two parts from one another after the usual
persuasive means of loosening obdurate ground-glass joints
had proved unsuccessful. As the apparatus had to be entirely
remade   I introduced some radical changes in its construction
in order to remedy the inherent defects of the original design.
    §9. Fig. 3 represents the new apparatus as <U+FB01>nally con
structed.      Ihere adopted the original Volta method of
procedure, with the application, of course, of Lord Kelvin’s
compensation device. In this particular form of apparatus,
where great capacity can only be attained by diminishing the
distance between the condenser-plates, it is susceptible of
greater sensibility than the Ayrton and Perry modi<U+FB01>cation,
and it  is,moreover, somewhat simpler.
    In the <U+FB01>g. A,  A    the insulated platinum plate supported
                        is
and insulated by the glass tube B.          To insure rigidity, the
plate was fairly stout, too thick to be fused into the glass
support, so that    it had welded to the top         a  stout piece of
platinum   wire  which  <U+FB01>tted  tight  into the  glass  tube   B.  C,

as the    older   one which it replaced.
    There is no need to discuss here the well-known method of
making an observation. In the actual apparatus ( <U+FB01>g. 3), 0,
when not of iron, had a plate of that metal attached to its
back, so that by closing the circuit of the small electromagnet
W by means of a spring key it was drawn away from the
platinum plate A.            This reduced the taking of a reading
to   the    exceedingly simple operations of making and then
breaking a single platinum contact to the potentiometer, and
then pressing a spring key.
    In its new form the apparatus proved entirely satisfactory
in every way. The adjustments were not at all troublesome
to make, in fact, it was eventually found possible to dispense
altogether with the stops L, H, and K (<U+FB01>g. 3), for the plates
could be prevented from touching and yet allowed to come
within T15 in. of one another by just giving the proper tilt to
 the apparatus as a whole.             The sensibility was all that was
 desired.       When that of the quadrant electrometer for directly
 applied E.M.Fs. was 553 scale-divisions per volt, a P.D. be
  tween the condenser-plates of 1 volt gave on the average a
 de<U+FB02>exion of about 70 on pulling away the movable plate.
 It was quite possible, by taking great care in making the
 adjustments, to attain a sensibility of 90 divisions per volt.
 The readings in general are accurate to 0'02 of a volt, and
 they are pretty reliable to 001 volt.
     § 10. The experiments were continued with this improved
  apparatus, using plates of aluminium and platinum as the
  dissimilar metals.       The P.D. between these metals measured
 as quickly as possible after cleaning the surface of the alu
 minium with <U+FB01>ne emery-paper was
                                   1'45 volts.
  This value slowly fell       as time went    011* ,- thus after about    1%
 hours,    it  was
                                   1'20 volts;
  and it <U+FB01>nally assumed, very slowly,            a steady  value of about
                                    1'02 volts.
  After this steady value had been arrived at, the experiment
  was proceeded with much as described in § 8.                 The tube was
  exhausted      to   about       millim.  pressure,    and  then heat was
  applied from two bunsen <U+FB02>ames.               The variations of pressure

that followed were similar to those observed in the old
apparatus (§ 8). Even after heating in this way for <U+FB01>ve hours
the pressure was about the same as at the beginning of the
operation     varied from
                      (it    millim. to     millim.), showing

that after prolonged heating condensed air was still given off
from the inside surfaces of the apparatus. This did not, of
course, necessarily imply that there was still    large quantity        a
of air left sticking to the metal plates, for as the heat slowly
travelled up the tube                     by
                            conduction air would be gradually
driven 01? its upper surfaces, and this would continue until
the whole of the apparatus (and even the pump) became
strongly heated.     The source of heat was very gradually
removed, the pump being vigorously worked the whole time,
until when the tube was quite cold the pressure was gs‘w
millim.    The PD. between the plates was then
                                               0'28 volt.

                                         convection from the sur
rounding gaseous molecules.)
   After leaving the apparatus for 15 hours the pressure had
risen to      millim., and then the RD. was

                                               0'31 volt.
Air was then admitted into the tube.    The reading remained
unaltered even after several hours, but after leaving the tube
open to the atmosphere for three days, the Pi). had fallen to
                                               0'02 volt.
The aluminium plate was then taken out and very gently
rubbed once or twice with <U+FB01>ne emery-paper.   The P.D.
rose to
                                               0'56 volt.
It   was again rubbed with emery, after which the                           P.D.   was
                                               0'72 volt.
It    thus clear that at least the greater part of the above

       § 11. The experiments described in § 10 satis<U+FB01>ed me that it
   was useless to attempt to drive off the last remnants of air from
   the metal plates by merely heating them in a vacuum, so             I
  decided <U+FB01>rst to thoroughly wash out the apparatus three or
  four times with fairly pure dry hydrogen, and then strongly
  heat it in a high vacuum of that gas.         I expected that such
  a molecularly active gas as hydrogen would displace even the
  last traces of air from the pores of the metal plates.
       The hydrogen was prepared from fairly pure zinc (such as
  is used in Marsh’s test for arsenic) and pure hydrochloric
  acid. It was washed by passing throu h distilled water and
  carefully dried by means of tubes of pumice and strong
 sulphuric acid and of phosphorus peutoxide.          Such hydrogen
 should contain but the barest traces of foreign gases, and           I
 considered it sufficiently pure for my purpose.           (1 had tried
 other methods of preparing the hydrogen, but found the
 above the most satisfactory on the whole.          The chief thing
 was to avoid having such impurities in the gas as oxygen,
 ozone, water-vapour, or other oxygen-containing electrolytes.)
 There was probably a far greater quantity of strange gases in
 the vacuum-tube even after exhaustion than was in the
hydrogen.
      The hydrogen generating apparatus and drying-tubes were
joined directly to the apparatus throngh a mercury-sealed tap.
The                    apparatus, when not producing gas, was
         generating
always kept ful of hydrogen at a pressure greater than that
of the atmosphere, so that if any leakage took place through
the various joints it would be hydrogen leaking out into the
atmosphere and not air leaking in.
      § 12. At the beginning of this new experiment the RD.
between      the plates was
                                0'98 volt.

RD.      was
                                         0'95 volt,
and again let in an atmosphere of hydrogen.                                    The same
operation was repeated a third time, and <U+FB01>nally the                            apparatus
was left to itself full of hydrogen for two days, so                           as to give
the gas a good chance of soaking into the metals                                and dis
placing from them the original' surface-layers of                              air. The
voltage was then
                            0'87 volt,
and remained constant at that value. (This diminution is in
accordance with Lord Kelvin’s observation that soaking a
platinum plate in hydrogen makes it temporarily about
0'1 volt positive to another platinum plate that has not been
so treated*.)
     I
    then again exhausted to 5010-6 mm. and heated the tube
with a couple of bunsen-burners just as on former occasions.
When cold the RD. was
                         0'83 volt,
at a pressure of <U+FB01>lm, mm.
   From the practical constancy of this value, it seemed to
me that        I
           had now really removed the last traces of air, and
that there was not suf<U+FB01>cient oxygen present to oxidize the
aluminium plate as had happened before in an ordinary
vacuum, and that there was a true contact P.D. between
aluminium and platinum of about 0'8 of a volt.      To subject
it to the severest possible test, next heated the I
                                                  apparatus to
a far higher temperature with a blowpipe-<U+FB02>ame.   The outer
copper protecting sheath was kept red hot for about half an
hour, the pump working throughout the time.            then                       I
allowed the tube to slowly  cool.  When   it was quite cold
and the pressure was

                                           0-09 volt.
     I let in a little      hydrogen; it had no immediate e<U+FB01>'ect on
the      RD.        1   then let in dried             air; the reading very slowly
fell     to zero, and the next morning                   it was
                                          —0'15 volt
 (i.e. aluminium   ne ative to platinum), at which value                                it
 remained permanent y.     In appearance the aluminium was
 unaltered, except for a very slight purple coloration just at

  well with emery~paper sent back the value to
                                 1‘20 volts.
     Thus we have arrived at the exceedingly interesting fact
  that even in a. high vacuum of pure dry hydrogen at the minute
 pressure   of mle mm. of mercury, and after four washings in
  that gas, there is still su<U+FB01>icient oxygen present to completely
  oxidize the surface of an aluminium plate, if it only be brought
 to a suf<U+FB01>ciently high temperature (about a dull red heat);
 and if there is sufficient oxygen present to oxidize it there is
  surely su<U+FB02>icient present to charge it as required by the
 electrolytic theory of the Volta effect.
     In face of this striking experimental result, it is utterly
 futile to draw any positive conclusions whatsoever concerning
 the seat of the E.M.F. in Volta’s phenomenon based on
  experiments made in what usually passes for a vacuum,
 whether it be a vacuum of air or one of any other gas;
 because, to repeat what          I  have already stated, unless far
  more drastic measures are taken—and no mere mechanical
  pumping will su<U+FB02>ice—it is a matter of practical impossibility
 to remove the insoaked condensed air-<U+FB01>lms from the surfaces
 of such highly oxidizable metals as zinc and aluminium.
 And yet the most illustrious upholder of the contact theory
 asks concerning Dr. Bottomley’s high-vacuum experiments
 (referred to above, § 1), made in a vacuum of                  mm. and
 without any application of heat, what would be the ef<U+FB01>cacy
 of the su posed oxy en bath in such a case I *
     § 13.   n face of t ese results, a perfectly decisive experi
 ment seemed almost hopeless to expect. However, I <U+FB01>nally
 decided upon a method of removing the whole of the oxygen
 which really did offer some hopes of success, and that was to
 chemically burn away the oxygen.               Such a process naturally
 could not be carried out with aluminium as the positive metal,
 simply because aluminium has a greater af<U+FB01>nity for oxygen
 than has hydrogen, and it is impossible under any known
 circumstances to reduce aluminium                 oxide by means of
hydrogen.        Iron, however, was a metal that answered all
the' necessary requirements.               The P.D. between it and
platinum    was   suf<U+FB01>ciently high (it varies from about 0'3 to 0'5
of 9. volt, according to surface conditions) for the purpose;
the metal could be very strongly heated without fear of
fusion or volatilization, and any oxide of iron present or
formed in the process of heating could be easily reduced by

hydrogen at a not unduly high temperature.               There is another
property possessed by          iron  which   is of  peculiar interest in
connexion with these experiments, namely, its transparency
to hydrogen at a red heat *.           Owing to this remarkable and
interesting property (which is likewise shared by platinum), it
seemed probable in the highest degree that after the continued
heating of such a platinum-iron couple in an atmosphere of
hydrogen, the gas would freely permeate both metals and
 eventually combine with every trace of oxygen present,
 either directly or by reducing any iron oxide that has been
 formed, and the roduct of the combustion (water) would be
driven off by tie heat and absorbed in drying-tubes of
 phosphorus pentoxide. Of course              I did not expect that all
the oxygen       would     be remm'ed   in  one   operation; but that if
 the metals were brought to a red heat and then allowed to
cool (both iron and platinum absorb hydrogen on cooling)
 and the operation repeated say half-a-dozen times, that little by
 little the whole or at least the greater part of the oxygen <U+FB01>lms
 condensed on the surface-layers of the metals would be driven
off and replaced by h drogen. Thus it would be possible to
 measure the contact           .D. between iron and platinum in an
 atmosphere       of hydrogen and of hydrogen only.                As has
 already been pointed out, it is useless to displace the outer
 atmosphere of hydrogen and to leave the inner layers of gas
 whose particles are within the range of molecular action of
 the metals unchanged (see                 From what follows           14),
 I  venture to think that as far as my experiments go they seem
 to con<U+FB01>rm on the whole and within certain limits the series
 of phenomena that were suggested above as being likely to
take place.

 (Dr. Erskine-Murray        does not mention that the         high
potential produced by burnishing is merely a temporary
effect), and remained practically constant at that value.         I
 then exhausted and washed out the apparatus with hydrogen
and repeated the process three times just as described in §12.
The tube was then heated with a blowpipe-<U+FB02>ame and kept at
a bright red heat for about 20 minutes.           It was then, of
course, full of hydrogen, at about an atmosphere          pressure
 (when hot).    Knowing the pressure of the gas in the tube
both when it was hot and cold I was able, by making certain
assumptions as to the distribution of heat, to roughly estimate
the maximum temperature of the gas in the tube.              After
keeping the outside copper tube at a bright red heat for
about 40 minutes the maximum inside temperature was not
less than 800° C.
    The next morning the P.D. was
              —O'40 volt (platinum positive to iron).
I then heated again, as before, for 33 minutes; when cold,
after about three hours, the P.D. was
                            —0'O6 volt.
I   again heated   for half an hour.     The next morning       the
reading was
                            —0‘28 volt.
 I  heated again for  half an hour.   After three hours the P.D.
was
                            —O'05 volt.
I repeated   the operation.    The next day the  P.D.  was
                            —0'l3 volt.
On again heating for half an hour the          P.D., as measured
after two hours’ cooling, was
                            + 0'05 volt.

 P.D.    was

I   heated again for    half an hour.     The next morning      the
voltage stood at
                            —O'l6 volt.
     I had hoped that after so many successive beatings and cool
ings the P.D. would have settled down to a steady value after
all the oxygen had been got rid of, and that this value Would
be the true contact P.D. in an atmosphere of hydrogen.        But,

86              Mr. F. S. Spiers on Contact Electricity.
as is evident from the above readings, such was not the case ;
there seemed to be no tendency for the voltage to settle down
to a <U+FB01>nal steady value.         However, a careful examination of
the above results and of others not given here, convinced me
that there is a law underlying these results in spite of their
apparently contradictory nature. It seems that, on the whole,
readings that were taken as soon as possible after the heating
 (the tube, however, being cold or almost cold) were more
positive (or less negative) than those taken some hours or on
the next day after the heating.          In order to test this suppo
sition, when       I  next repeated the operation of heating,        I
took time-readings of the voltage, starting as soon as possible
after the heating.       There is really a double time effect taking
place, the one superimposed upon the other : <U+FB01>rstly, an
ordinary temperature effect ; this ceases when the tube is
quite cold or soon after; secondly, the time e<U+FB02>'ect particu
larly referred to here, which goes on, as will be seen, for
several days, long after direct temperature effects have dis
appeared.       In consequence of this the time-readings taken,
say    within  the  <U+FB01>rst two or three hours after heating, teach
us nothing de<U+FB01>nite.             .
    The tube was kept red hot for half an hour from 2.20 to
2.50 P.M., and then the asbestos-lined copper shield was
immediately removed so as to allow it to cool as quickly as
possible.     At 3.30, when the apparatus felt almost cold, the
P.D. was
                              0'18 volt.
At 3.50 it    was             0'04 volt.
At 4.25 it    was           —-0'12 volt.
At    5                     —0'l5 volt.
At    8                     —0'2O volt.
The next day at 10.30 A.M., —0'29 volt.
After two more days, at 10.30, —0'60 volt.
    The temperature—EMF. curve becomes asymptotic at
about —O'60 volt.
     On repeating the operation by again heating and taking
 time-readings,     I  obtained very similar results. In this case
 the P.D. after twenty-three hours was
                               —0'28 volt,
 and    I  then started exhausting the apparatus of hydrogen
  (although the equilibrium value, —0'60 volt, was not yet
 arrived at) with the intention of again letting air into the

  little hydrogen, this time 3 mm. ; the RD. became
                                —0'48 volt.
  I  then let in dry air, until the pressure was 1 atmosphere.
  The P.D. then moved slowly in the positive direction.            The
  air was admitted at 6.35 P.M.
     At  6.47 the    P.D.  was —O‘43 volt.
     At  7.0  it was            —0‘40 volt.
     At 7.20                    -0'37   volt.
 The next morning at 10.30 it was
                               —O'17 volt.
     This very slow return to the positive value, or, rather, in
 the positive direction, is just what one would have expected
 on the assumption that the Volta effect is a function of the
 medium surrounding the gases.            Consider for a moment the
 state of the surfaces of the metals just at this juncture.       The
 whole object of the experiment was to rem0ve, to the utmost
 extent possible, the original condensed surface-layers of air
 from the plates, and to replace them by layers of hydrogen.
 From the method that was adopted, and from the results that
 followed, it is almost certain that this state was actually
arrived at. Then the true contact P.D. between iron and
platinum in an atmosphere of hydrogen and hydrogen only
 (neglecting for the moment the probably inactive nitrogen) is
about —O'60 volt (platinum being positive to iron).               The
fact that this value was only reached long after the metals
had cooled from a red heat in an atmosphere of hydrogen
is easily explicable.       The whole or greater part of the Volta
effect  is due   to the layers of gas in immediate and close contact
with the metal surfaces. Naturally, when the metals were hot,

88           Mr. F. S. Spiers on Contact Electricity.
the amount of gas (in this case hydrogen) in such close contact
was extremely small.       As the metals cooled—and, indeed, long
after they were cold—they were gradually soaking in and ab
sorbing hydrogen ; and all the time this was going on the P.D.
was gradually becoming more and more negative (see p. 86),
until at last the <U+FB01>nal value, about —O'UO volt, was reached,
and this represents the true rulue of the Volta e<U+FB02>'ect between
iron and platinum in an atmosphere of hydrogen.                     When,
then,  I  pumped   out  the  hydrogen    and  let ill  air, the  P.D.did
not immediately return to its original positive value,although
it slowly went back in the positive direction (110 more than
measuring the contact P.l). of air-covered plates of iron and
platinum in hydrogen gives a P.D. ot' —O'60 volt) simply
because the greater part of the gas in the closest contact with
the metals was still hydrogen and not air.            The metals would
probably    have to be  left for months,   and  perhaps     years, before
the air would entirely replace the surface-layers of hydrogen.
 In fact, it would possibly be as dif<U+FB01>cult to replace the
hydrogen <U+FB01>lm by an air <U+FB01>lm as it was to displace the
original air <U+FB01>lm and replace it b hydrogen.                 Nevertheless,
the all-important fact remains t at a complete change of
atmosphere, unaccompanied, as far as the chemical conditions
 enable us to judge, by any corrosion or oxidation of the
 metallic surfaces, induces a complete and fundamental change
 in the value of the Volta effect, differing not only in mag
 nitude but also in sign from the first value. It would be
 well, if this experiment be repeated, to actually leave the
 metallic couple untouched for some considerable time (some
 weeks or even months if necessary) to see whether the
 maximum positive value of the RD. would return of its own
 accord without external aid.                       I
                                     In this case thought might   I
 hasten somewhat the process of replacing the new hydrogen
 film again by an air-<U+FB01>lm by heating the tube.                 I kept the
 outside copper sheath red hot for about 15 minutes.                When
 the tube was perfectly cold the RD. was
                              + 0'22 volt.
 After two hours it remained entirely unaltered at 0'22 volt.
 It  might be objected    that heating in this way oxidized the
 iron; but it must      be remembered that the plates were still
 partially surrounded with hydrogen, and before oxidation
 could take place the hydrogen would have to be driven off.
 (In any case, at a rod beat any oxygen present would unite
 with the hydrogen rather than with the iron.)               This view is
 supported by    the   result   of a   second   heating,     in  this case
 extending over 20 minutes. Then, after the tube was cold,

                Mr. F. S. Spiers on Contact Electricity.                 89
the P.D. was exactly zero, and on taking out the iron plate
and examining it         I  found it completely covered with a thin
black scale of iron oxide. There is no doubt, then, as to the
effect of surface oxidation ; and it is in agreement with other
experimenters, who <U+FB01>nd that oxidation always causes the
 contact activity of metals to disappear.
     § 15. The net result of the experiments described above in
 § 14 is strongly in favour of that theory of the Volta effect
  which supposes it to be due to some electrolytic action of the
 medium or media surrounding the dissimilar metals ‘. We
 have seen how, by as far as possible removing the oxygen
 from the surfaces of an iron-platinum couple and replacing it
 by hydrogen, there resulted an enormous total change in
 the contact E.M.F., namely from + 0'37 volt to —O'60 volt;
 how on again admitting air, so that a mixture of air and
 hydrogen surrounded the plates, the RD. slowly moved in
 the positive direction, reaching after 16 hours a value of
  --O'17 volt ; and how, after heating the plates so as to
 arti<U+FB01>cially hasten the removal of hydrogen from the surfaces
 of the metals and its replacement by air, the value of the RD.
 became still more positive, namely +0'22 volt.                  There is a
 strong presumption         of truth in  the assertion  that  these curious
 variations in the contact force under varying conditions of
 atmosphere, which become so intelligible when looked at in
 the light of the electrolytic theory, appear impossible and
 incomprehensible when considered from a standpoint like that
 taken up by the pure contact theorists.

 IN such      as comparisons between the air and platinum
resistance scales of temperature, a correction is required for
the expansion of the thermometric envelope.              Over a range
at low temperatures the expansion might be readily deter
mined, e. g., by <U+FB01>lling the bulb with a liquid, conveniently
mercury, whose absolute expansion is known, and using it as
a weight-thermometer to measure the relative expansion of
the liquid.      At high temperatures, however, such a method
cannot well be used, and the correction must be calculated
either from the results of low temperature measurements, or
from the linear expansion as determined directly at these
higher temperatures, provided the material be homogeneous.
As porcelain is the substance generally used, this latter
method is available; and it was therefore suggested to me by
Mr. E. H. Grif<U+FB01>ths, F.R.S., that it might be useful to try

                  Porcelain with Rise of Temperature.            91
to determine how the expansion of porcelain varies with the
temperature.
     Direct determinations’of the linear expansion of porcelain
have been made by Deville and Troost (Comptes Rendus, lix.
p. 162, 1864), and by Holborn and Wien (Ann. Phys. Chem.
 xlvii. p. 107, 1892). In the experiments of Deville and
 Troost on Bayeux porcelain the temperatures were measured
 by means of an air-thermometer heated in the same enclosure
 with the experimental rod, and having its bulb of the same
 kind of porcelain. Readings were taken at 0° (1.. and again
 at temperatures between 1000° and 1500°.            The conclusion
 reached was that the coe<U+FB01>icient of cubical ex ansion is con
 stant, and between '000016 and '000017. Int e experiments
 of Holborn and Wien the expansion of a length of 9 cm. of
 Berlin porcelain was measured, the temperature being deter
 mined by a thermo-electric junction in contact with the
 porcelain.       Measurements were taken at the temperature of
 the room, and again at about 1000° in some experiments, at
 about 500° in others.        As the values found for the mean
 coef<U+FB01>cient for one of these intervals agreed as well with those
 found for the other interval as they did amongst themselves,
 these experimenters also concluded that the coef<U+FB01>cient is
  constant.      The mean value of the coe<U+FB02>icient of linear expan
  sion  for the   kind of porcelain used for their air-thermometers
 is taken as "0000044.
     The method adopted in the experiments          described in the
  present paper was essentially the same as        that employed in
  the case of glass by Callendar (Phil. Trans.     1887 A, p. 167),
  and by Callendar and Gri<U+FB02>iths (Phil.              Trans. 1891 A,
 p. 123).
     A   tube of glazed Bayeux porcelain about 1 metre long and
  1'7 cm. external diameter was used.           Two <U+FB01>ne transverse
  scratches ran round the tube at a distance of about 91 cm.
  from each other ; and the distance between these marks was
  directly compared at a series of temperatures from 0° C. to
  830° (J. with a standard length, by means of a pair of reading
  microscopes.
      The mean temperature of the portion of the tube between
  the marks was deduced from the resistance of a platinum
  wire (doubled for the sake of obtaining a convenient value
  for Rim—Bo) which passed straight down the tube from one
  mark to the other and back again. The wire was fastened
  down at intervals to a strip of mica which <U+FB01>tted the tube
  fairly tightly.     At the upper mark the wires were attached
   to others of thicker platinum, which were themselves joined
  at the pyrometer-head which closed this end of the tube to

 92           Mr. T. G. Bedtord       on the Expansion    of
 copper leads.     The head also carried a second pair of terminals
 to which was attached a thick platinum wire running to the
                                         “
 upper mark and back to act as a            compensator.”
    Connexion was made between the pyrometer-head and the
 resistance-box by means of a carefully equalized and insulated
 fourfold cable.      The lower end of the porcelain tube was
 closed by a porcelain plug.
    The resistance measurements           were made by the usual
 Wheatstone-bridge method, the arms of the bridge being
 equal.     The resistance-box used contains a set of 7 coils of
 nominal values 10 to 640 mean box-units, and in series with
 the coils a bridge-wire 40 cm. long, the effective resistance of
 1 cm. of which is equal approximately to l box-unit.                By
 means of a vernier '01 cm. can be read.           The mean box-unit
 is roughly '01 ohm *. A careful standardization of both coils
 and bridge-wire was made in January 1898, by Mr. E. H.
 Grif<U+FB01>ths and Mr. O. F. Green; and again in May 1899,
 since the completion of these experiments, the coils have been
 restandardized by Mr. C. F. Green, and show no perceptible
 change since the previous standardization.           The resistance of
 the pyrometer-wire was about 260 box-units at 0° C.                The
 current from a dry cell through 20 ohms was employed, and
 was found to produce no serious heating-effect.               Thermo
 electric etfects were eliminated by the use of Grit<U+FB01>ths’
 Thermo-electric key (Phil. Trans. 1893 A, p. 398). A dead
 beat mirror galvanometer was used.
    The reading-microscopes, for the use of which the writer
 is indebted to Prof. Ewing, were made by the Cambridge
 Scienti<U+FB01>c Instrument Company.              They were supported on
 solid  stone  blocks standing on        a   <U+FB01>rm stone bench.       The
 microscope-carriage moves along its slides by means of a screw
 of '5 mm. pitch, the head bein divided into 100 parts and
 thus reading to '005 mm. Tent<U+FB01>s of these divisions could be
 estimated, but the diamond marks on the porcelain were not
 suf<U+FB01>ciently good to enable settings of the cross-wire to be
 made to such accuracy.         The gas furnace in which the tube
 was heated was supported on a stand provided with levelling
 screws, by adjusting which the marks were kept in focus as
the tube was heated or cooled.             Both the microscopes and
bench were screened by bright tinned plate from the radia
tion from the furnace. As a standard length the distance
between two diamond marks on a glass tube kept in a trough
of melting ice was used.       This distance was equal to 91'394 cm.
                                                                        '
During each experiment the readings for the glass tube were
taken at intervals.

                     Porcelain with Rise            of Temperature.                         93
     For the determination of the <U+FB01>xed points R0 and R100, the
apparatus was more cumbersome than that used for smaller
pyrometers.               In determining R100, steam from a boiler was
led into a metal tube about 6 cm. in diameter surrounding
the porcelain tube.                 The metal tube was surrounded by a
similar wider tube 10 cm. in diameter and co-axial with it.
The steam, passing along the inner metal tube, returned
through the space between the two tubes, forming a jacket,
 and thence passed out to a condenser.                                     A siphon-gauge
showed any excess of steam-pressure                                 within the apparatus
above the atmospheric pressure.                           The jacketed steam vessel
 and the tubes leading from the boiler were carefully packed
 round with cotton-wool and hair felt. The steam-vessel was
 slightly inclined to the horizontal, so that the condensed water
 might drain away.                 It was found that with this arrangement
 the readings very soon became steady when steam was passed
 into the apparatus; and the values of B100 deduced from
 experiments on different days and under different barometric
 pressures agreed satisfactorily with one another.
      The ice-point R0 was determined by immersing the porce
 lain tube in a mixture of pounded ice and water contained in
 a vessel formed from the larger of the metal tubes used for
 the steam-point determinations.
      The sample of platinum wire, from which the piece used in
 these experiments was cut, is known to have a value of 8, in
  Callendar’s formula, from 1'50 to 1'51.                             The value     8:  1605
,was assumed, and thus a direct determination of the resistance
vat the tem erature of boiling sulphur was avoided. An error
 of '01 in             causes an error of less than 1° in the calculated
 value       of   t at  1000“.
      After a careful determination of the ice and steam points,
  the tube was heated as follows :—

    After the experiment of March 30, the ice and steam
 points were re-determined, and were found to have changed
 considerably. Accordingly, from this date,a re-determination
 of the <U+FB01>xed points was made after each exposure to a high
 temperature, and the values then obtained were used in the
 reduction of the observations of the preceding experiment.
 On account of the change, the observations of March 21—29
 inclusive were not reduced.
    In making an experiment the tube was heated to as high a
temperature as possible, and observations of length and
resistance were made.     By diminishing the gas-su ply the
tube was then allowed to cool gradually, and when the
temperature had become steady, length and resistance mea
surements were again made; this process was repeated till
the tube reached the temperature of the air.     The observa
tions were recorded thus :—

    Columns 2 and 4 give the sum of the microscope readings
 for the standard length and the porcelain tube respectively.
 The porcelain tube projected from the furnace so that a
 length of about 6 cm. at either end was not directly heated
thereby.    The temperature of the tube in the neighbourhood
of the marks was taken roughly by means of mercury
thermometers, and is recorded in column 5.
    The resultsof experiments 1, 2, 7—10, are collected in
Table       III.
            (p. 96) ; the results of the last four experiments are
represented in the diagram.
    It appears from the diagram that, from 0° to 600°, the
results are represented fairly well by a curve given by the
formula

                       l0 dt
       Since the coe<U+FB01>icient varies with the temperature, an uncer
      tainty is introduced due to the gradient of temperature
      from the portion of the tube heated in the furnace to the
      marks ; but this uncertainty must be very small. According
      to a rough estimate made by the aid of the auxiliary tem
      perature readings in column 5, Table 11., the correction for
      the ends came out to be '6 per cent. at mean temperature
      800°, falling to ‘4 per cent. at 600°.
         The error introduced into the temperature measurements,
      if the part of the tube occupied by the wire did not precisely
      coincide with the part between the diamond marks, must
     also have been very small.     Thus, for a temperature gradient
     so steep as 100° per centim. in the neighbourhood of the
     diamond marks, an error of 1° in the temperature would
     necessitate a displacement of the wire by nearly 1 centim.
     The chief dif<U+FB01>culty in experiments of this kind seems to be
     in insuring that the temperature shall be uniform all along
     the tube.    With an ordinary gas-furnace it is impossible to
     be certain that this condition is satis<U+FB01>ed.    An accident to
     the tube after experiment 10 prevented any    further measure
     ments, and so no experiments were made while the tem
     perature was rising.
         As may be seen from Table 111., there seem to have been
    permanent changes in the length of the tube during the
    course of the experiments, but these changes are very small
    and apparently irregular.      At the end of experiment 7 it
    was observed    that  the tube had  become very slightly bent;
    the irregularities in the length at 0° may be due to this.
,   The total increase in length at 0° from March 13 to April 8
    was '02 per cent.

                       .33] Lord RAYLEIGH, RILS.‘
            law of equal partition, enunciated <U+FB01>rst by 1Vaterston
THE      for the case of point molecules of varying mass, and the
associated Boltzmann-Maxwell doctrine respecting steady dis
tributions have been the subject of much difference of opinion.
Indeed. it would hardly be too much to say that no two writers
are fully agreed.             The discussion has turned mainly upon
Maxwell’s paper of 18791'. to which objectionsi have been
taken by Lord Kelvin and Prof. Bryan, and in a minor degree
by Prof. Boltzmann and myself.                     Lord Kelvin’s objections
are the most fundamental.                   He writes§ : “But, conceding
 Maxwell’s fundamental assumption, 1 do not see in the mathe
matical workings of his paper any proof of his conclusion
‘that the average kinetic energy corresponding to any one of
the variables is the same for every one of the variables of the
system.’ Indeed, as a general proposition its meaning is not
explained, and it seems to me inexplicable.                   The reduction of
the kinetic energy toa sum of squares leaves the several parts
of the whole with no correspondence to any de<U+FB01>ned or de<U+FB01>nable
set of independent variables.”
    In a short note [I written soon afterwards                      I  pointed
out some considerations which appeared to me to justify
Maxwell’s argument, and                  I  suggested      the substitution of
Hamilton’s principal function for the one employed by
Maxwell<U+FB02>. The views that I then expressed still commend
themselves to me; and              I  think that it may be worth while to
develop      them     a   little   further,    and to illustrate Maxwell’s
argument by applying                 it to   a   particular case where the
simplicity of the circumstances and the familiarity of the
notation may help to fix our ideas.
    But in the mean time it may be well to consider Lord
              “ Decisive Test-case

its two sides must equalize, and keep equal, the average

collisions, to t 1e average kinetic energy of 0. Hence, when
the times of A being in the space between H and K are
included in the average, the average of the sum ofthe potential
and kinetic energies of A is equal to the average kinetic
energy of 0. But the potential energy of A at every point
in the space HK is positive, because, according to our suppo
sition, the velocity of A is diminished during every time of
its motion from H towards K, and increased to the same value
again during motion from K to H. Hence, the average

    The apparent disproof of the law of partition of energy in
this simple problem seems to have shaken the faith even of
such experts as Dr. W'atson and Mr. Burbury *. M. Poincare,
however, considering a special case of Lord Kelvin’s pro
 blem     arrives at
         1',              aconclusion in harmony with Maxwell’s
law. Prof. Bryani considers that the test-case “shows the im
possibility of drawing general conclusions as to the distribution
of energy in single system from the possible law ot'pernlanent
                  a

large number of systems; but, as             shall show more fully

barrier K; and let us compare two cases, the whole energy
 being the same in both.
    In case           F   so powerful that with whatever velocity
                           is
 (within    the  possible   limits) A can approach,                reflected

at H, which then behaves like             <U+FB01>xed barrier.
                                          a                  In case (ii.)              F
is  still powerful enough to produce this result, except when A
approaches        with
                 it        kinetic energy nearly equal to the whole
                            a
energy of the system.          A then penetrates beyond H, moving
slowly    from   H    to  K   and   back again from K to H, thus
remaining for relatively long time beyond H. Lord Kelvin’s
                     a
statement requires that the average total energy of                  should
                                                                          A
be the same in the two cases; but this                  cannot be. For
                                                          it
during the occasional penetrations beyond H in case (ii.) A
has nearly the whole energy of the system; and its enjoyment
of this    isprolonged by the penetration.          Hence in case (ii.) A
has    a  higher average total energy than in case (i.); and a
margin      is  provided which may allow the average kinetic
energies to be equal.         Ibelieve that the consideration here
advanced goes to the root of the matter, and shows why                             it   is
that the possession of potential energy may involve no
deduction from the full share of kinetic energy.
    Lord Kelvin’s “ decisive test-case ”              entirely covered by
                                                        is
Maxwell’s reasoning—a reasoning in my view substantially
correct.        would be possible, therefore, to take this case as
                It                                                                      a
typical example in illustration of the general argument; but
I  prefer for this purpose, as somewhat simpler, another test
case, also proposed by Lord Kelvin.              This     simply that of
                                                              is                        a

where    E  is given by (17), and    f is an arbitrary function.
    It is especially to be noticed that the limitation to the
form (18) holds only for phases lying upon the same path.
If   two phases have different energies, they do not lie upon
the same path, but in this case the independence of the
distributions in the two phases is already guaranteed by the
form of (18).       The question is whether all phases of given
mergy lie upon the same path. It is easy to invent cases
for which the answer will be in the negative.                 Suppose, for
example, that there are two centres of force 0, O’ on the line
of motion which attract with a force at <U+FB01>rst proportional to
distance but vanishing when the distance exceeds a. certain
value less than the interval 00’.        A particle may then vibrate          _
with the same (small) energy either round 0 or round 0’;
but the phases of the two motions do not lie upon the same
path. Consequently       f  is not limited by the condition of
steadiness to be the same in the two groups of phases.                     In
all cases steadiness is ensured by the form (18) ; and if all
phases of equal energy lie upon the same path, this form is
necessary as well as suf<U+FB01>cient.
    All the essential di<U+FB02>iculties of the theory appear to be
raised by the particular case just discussed, and the reader to
whom the subject is new is recommended to give it his
 careful attention.
    In the more general problem of motion in two dimensions
 the discussion follows a parallel course.          In order to <U+FB01>nd the
 distribution at time t' corresponding to (9) at time t, we have
 to transform the               differential, regarding w, 3/, u, e as
                     multiple
 known functions of m , y’, u’, 0’.        Here again we take the
 initial and   <U+FB01>nal coordinates    x, y, a", 3/ as an intermediate

 108                       Lord Rayleigh on the Law qf
    We have thus investigated for a particle in two dimensions
 the  law of steady distribution, and the equal partition of
 energy which is its necessary consequence.          And we see
 that “ the only assumption necessary to the directproof is that
 the system, if left to itself in its actual state of motion, will,
   sooner or later, pass through every phase which is consistent
                                   ”
   with the equation of energy        (Maxwell). It will be observed
  that so far nothing whatever has been said as to time
  averages for a single particle.       The law of equal partition, as
  hitherto stated, relates to a large number of particles and to a
  single moment of time.
     The extension to time-averages, the aspect under which
  Lord Kelvin has always considered the problem, is important,
  the more as some authors appear to doubt the possibility of
  such extension.        Thus Prof. Bryan (Report, § 11, 1894),
  speaking of Maxwell’s assumption, writes :—“ To discover, if
  possible, a general class of dynamical systems satisfying the
  assumption would form an interestin              subject for future
  investigation.     It         is,
                            however, doubtfu how far Maxwell’s
  law would be applicable to the time-averages of the energies
  in any such system.       We shall see, in what follows, that the
 law of permanent        distribution    of    very large number of
                                                 a

                 is                                                 more

 inference with regard to the average distribution (taken with
 respect to the time) for one system.”
     The extension to time-averages appears to me to require
nothing more than Maxwell’s assumption, without which the law
of distribution itself only an arti<U+FB01>cial arrangement, sui<U+FB01>cient
                                is
 indeed but not necessary for steadiness.         We shall still speak
 of the particle moving in two dimensions, though the argument
is   general.    It has been shown that at any moment the u
 energy and    the   o-energy of the group of particles       the same;

   precisely parallel lines, and the additional dif<U+FB01>culties are
   merely those entailed by the use of generalized coordinates.
   Thus (1) follows from (7) by substantially the same process
    (given in my former note) that                         follows from

       As hinted before, some of the dif<U+FB01>culties that have been
   felt upon this subject may be met by a fuller recognition
   of the invariantic character of the expressions.                 This point
  has been ably developed by Prof. Bryan, who has given
    (loc. cit. § 14) a formal veri<U+FB01>cation that (33) is unaltered by
  a change of coordinates. If we follow attentively the process
  by which (1) is established, we see that in                      there is no
  assumption that the system of coordinates is the same at times
  t’ and t, and that accordingly we are not tied to one system
  in (33). Indeed, so far as 1 can see, there would be no
   meaning in the assertion that the system of generalized coor
  dinates employed for two different con<U+FB01>gurations was the
  same     '.
       We come now to the deduction from (33) of Maxwell’s law
  of partition of energy.         On this Prof. Bryan (loc. cit. § 20,
  remarks :—-“ Objections have been raised to this step in
  Maxwell’s work by myself (‘ Report on Thermodynamics,’
  Part I. § 44) on the ground that the kinetic energy cannot in
  general be expressed as the sum of squares of generalized
  momenta corresponding to generalized coordinates of the
  system, and by Lord Kelvin (Nature, Aug. 13, 1891) on the
  ground that the conclusion to which it leads has no intelligible
  meaning.        Boltzmann (Phil. Mag. March 1893) has put the
  investigation into a slightly modi<U+FB01>ed form which meets the
  <U+FB01>rst objection, and which imposes a certain restriction upon
  the generality of the result.           Under this limitation the result
  is              intelligible,  and the second objection is therefore
       perfectly
  also met.’                        I
                   At this point <U+FB01>nd myself in disagreement with
  all the above quoted authorities, and in the position of
  maintaining the correctness of Maxwell’s original deduction.
       Prof. Boltzmann considers that “Maxwell committed an
      * It would be like         that two points lie upon the same curve,
  when the character ofsaying
                           t e curve is not de<U+FB01>ned.

110                            Lord Rayleigh       0n the   Law of
error in assuming that by choosing suitable coordinates the
expression for the vis viva could always be made to contain
only the squares of the momenta.”             This is precisely the
objection which I supposed myself to have already answered
in 1892.            I
               wrote, “It seems to be overlooked that Maxwell
is limiting his attention to systems in a given con<U+FB01>guration,
and that no dynamics is founded upon the reduced expression
for T. The reduction can be effected in an iminite number
of ways. \Ve may imagine the configuration in question
rendered one of stable equilibrium by the introduction of
suitable forces proportional to displacements. The principal
modes of isochronous vibration .thus resulting will serve the
required purpose.”
   It is possible, therefore, so to choose the coordinates that for
a given con<U+FB01>guration (and for con<U+FB01>gurations differing infi
nitely little therefrom) the kinetic energy T, which is always
a quadratic function of the velocities, shall reduce to a sum of
squares with, if we please, given coefficients.       Thus in the

are an in<U+FB01>nite number) which allows                 T   to be expressed     in the
 form (35).
    In the case where the “ system ” consists of a single
particle, (35) is justi<U+FB01>ed by any system of rectangular coor
dinates; and although we are not bound to use the same
system for di<U+FB02>'erent positions of the particle, it would conduce
to simplicity to do so.         If the system be a rigid body, we may
 measure the velocities of the centre of inertia parallel to three
 <U+FB01>xed rectangular axes, while the remaining momenta refer to
 rotations about the principal axes of the body.                   If  Maxwell’s
 assumption hold good, a permanent distribution is such that
 in one, or in any number of positions, the mean energy of
 each rotation and of each translation is the same.                   And under
 the same restriction a similar assertion may be made respecting
 the time-averages for a single rigid body.
    There is much dif<U+FB01>culty in judging of the applicability of
 Maxwell’s assumption.            As Maxwell himself showed, it is easy
 to <U+FB01>nd cases of exception ; but in most of these the conditions
 strike one as rather special.            It must be observed, however,
that if we take it quite literally, the assumption is of a severely
 restrictive character; for it asserts that the system, starting
from any phase, will traverse every other phase (consistent
with the energyr condition) before returning to the initial phase.
 As soon as the initial phase is recovered, a cycle is estab
 lished, and no new phases can be reached, however long
the motion may continue.
     We return now to the question of the distribution of
 momenta among the systems which occupy a given con<U+FB01>gu
ration, still supposing the coordinates so chosen as to reduce
 T to a sum of squares (35). It will be convenient to <U+FB01>x our
 attention upon systems for which E lies within narrow limits,
 E and E +dE. Since E is given, there is a relation between

114              Lord Rayleigh on    the   Law of
                             i
 If the integration between on be carried out completely, we
recover the value unity.
    The interest of the case where n is very great lies of course
in the application to a gas supposed to consist of an immense
number of similar molecules *, or of several sets of similar
molecules ; and the question arises whether (45) can be
applied to deduce the Maxwellian law of distribution of
velocities among the molecules of a single system at a given
instant of time.      A caution may usefully be interposed here
 as to the sense in which the Maxwellian distribution is to be
understood.     It would be absurd to attempt to prove that the
 distribution in a single system is necessarily such and such, for
 we have already assumed that every phase, including every
distribution of velocities, is attainable, and indeed attained if
suf<U+FB01>cient time be allowed.      The most that can be proved is
 that the distribution will approximate to a particular law for
 the greater part of the time, and that if sensible deviations
occur they will be transitory.
    In applying (45) to a gas it will be convenient to suppose
in the <U+FB01>rst instance that all the molecules are similar.     Each
molecule has several degrees of freedom, but we may <U+FB01>x our
attention upon one of them, say the .z'-velocity of the centre
of inertia, usually denoted by u. In (45) the whole system is
supposed to occupy a given con<U+FB01>guration ; and the expression
gives us the distribution of velocity at a given time for a
single molecule among all the systems.        The distribution of
velocity is the same for every other molecule, and thus the
expression applies to the statistics of all the molecules of all
the systems.     Does it also apply to the statistics of all the
molecules of a single system?     In order to make this inference
we must assume that the statistics are the same (at the same
time) for all the systems, or, what comes to the same thing
(if Maxwell’s assumption be allowed), that they are the same
for the same system at the various times when it passes through
a given con<U+FB01>guration.
   Thus far the argument relates only to a single con<U+FB01>guration.
If the con<U+FB01>guration be changed, there will be in general a
change of potential energy and a corresponding change in the
kinetic energy to be distributed amongst the degrees of free
dom.     But in the case of a gas, of which the statistics are
assumed to be regular, the potential energy remains approxi
mately constant when exclusion is made of exceptional
conditions.    The same law of distribution of velocity then
applies   to every con<U+FB01>guration, that      is,   may be asserted
                                                 it

 without reference to the question of con<U+FB01>guration.      We thus
arrive at the Maxwellian law of velocities in a single gas, as
well as the relation between the velocities in a mixture of
molecules of different kinds <U+FB01>rst laid down by Waterston.
   The assumptions which we have made as to the practical
regularity of statistics are those upon which the usual theory
of ideal gases is founded ; but the results are far more
general. Nothing whatever has been said as to the character
of the forces with which the molecules act upon one another,
or are acted upon by external agencies.    Although for distinct
ness a gas has been spoken of, the results apply equally to a
medium constituted as a liquid or a solid is supposed to be.
A kinetic theory of matter, as usually understood, appears to
require that in equilibrium the whole kinetic energy shall be
equally shared among all the degrees of freedom, and within
each degree of freedom be distributed according to the same
law. It is included in this statement that temperature is a
matter of kinetic energy only, e. 9. that when a vertical column
of gas is in equilibrium, the mean velocity of a molecule is the
same at the top as at the bottom of the column.
   Reverting to (37), (41), in order to consider the distribution
of the systems as dependent upon the coordinates independ
ently of the velocities, we have, omitting unnecessary factors,

effect the integration with respect to all the coordinates of

 say in the various systems contemplated the particular mole
 cule is uniformly distributed with respect to .z'.  The same
is true of 3/ and z, and thus the whole spacial distribution is
uniform.         If
                 the single system constituting     the gas has
uniform statistics, it will follow that the distribution in it of
molecules similar to the particular molecule is uniform.
   The uniformity of the distribution is disturbed if an external
force acts.   In illustration of this we may consider the case
of gravity.    From (52) the distribution with respect to the
coordinates of the particular molecule will be
                                     e'gz/Z’K    dx dy ds,
and the same formula   gives the density of molecules similar
to the particular molecule in a single system.
  The main purpose of this paper is now accomplished ; but
I will take the opportunity to make a few remarks upon some
general aspects of a kinetic theory of matter. Many writers
appear to commit themselves to absolute statements, but
Kelvin* and Boltzmann and Maxwell fully reco nize that
conclusions can never be more than probable.            T e second
law of thermodynamics itself is in this predicament.        Indeed
it might seem at <U+FB01>rst si ht as if the case were even worse than
this. Mr. Culverwell                  has
                              emphasized    difficulty, which must

 rather to a small value, only because the conditions, or phases
 as we have called them, corresponding to small values are
  more probable, i. e. more numerous.          If
                                                there is considerable
  available energy at any moment, it is because the condition
  is then exceptional and peculiar.       After a short interval of
  time the condition may become more peculiar still, and the
  available energy may increase, but this is improbable.            The
  probability is that the available energy will, if not at once, at
  any rate after a short interval, decrease owing to the substitu
  tion of a more nearly normal state of things.
     There     is,
                 however, another side to this question, which
 perhaps    has  been too much neglected.       Small values of the
 available energy are indeed more probable than large ones,
 but there     isa degree of smallness below which   it   isimprobable
 that the value will lie. If at any time the value lies extremely
 low,it   is an increase and not   a   decrease which     is  probable.
 Maxwell showed long ago how           a   being capable    of  dealing
 with individual molecules would be in position to circumvent
                                               a
 the second law.     It    important to notice that for this end
                          is                                        it
is   not necessary to deal with individual molecules. It would
 suf<U+FB01>ce to take advantage of local reversals 0f the second law,
 which will involve, not very rarely,      a considerable number of
 neighbouring molecules. Similar considerations apply to other
 departures from anormal state of things, such, for example, as
unequal mixing of two kinds of molecules, or such         a  departure
 from the Watersth relation (of equal mean kinetic energies) as
has been investigated by Maxwell and by Tait and Burbury.
     The difficulties connected with the application of the law
of equal partition of energy to actual gases have long been felt.
In the case of argon and helium and mercury vapour the ratio
of speci<U+FB01>c heats (1'67) limits the degrees of freedom of each
molecule to the three required for translatory motion.             The
value (1'4) applicable to the principal diatomic gases gives
room for the three kinds of translation and for two kinds of
rotation.     Nothing is   left for rotation round the line joining
the atoms, nor for relative motion of the atoms in this line.
Even  if    we regard the atoms as mere points, whose rotation
means nothing, there must still exist energy of the last
mentioued kind, and its amount (according to the law) should
not be inferior.
    We are here brought face to face with           a    fundamental
dif<U+FB01>culty, relating not to the theory of gases merely, but
rather to general dynamics.        In most questions of dynamics
a    condition whose violation involves a large amount of
potential energy may be treated as constraint. It

principle that solids are regarded as rigid, strings as inex
tensible, and so on.      And it is upon the recognition of such
constraints   that  Lagrange’s method is founded.          But the law
of equal partition disregards potential energy.               However
 great may be the energy required to alter the distance of the
two atoms in a diatomic molecule, practical rigidity is never
 secured, and the kinetic energy of the relative motion in the
 line of junction is the same as if the tie were of the feeblest.
 The two atoms, however related, remain two atoms,          '
                                                                and the
 degrees   of freedom   remain   six in   number.
     What would appear to he wanted is some escape from the
 destructive simplicity of the general conclusion relating to
 partition of kinetic energy, whereby the energy of motions
 involving larger amounts of potential energy should be
 allowed to be diminished in consequence.            If the argument,
 as above set forth after Maxwell, be valid, such escape must
 involve a repudiation of Maxwell’s fundamental postulate as
 practically applicable to systems with an immense number of
 degrees of freedom.

mere writing’s    sake.
     But whatever may have been the real reason for his sub
sequent silence, there is not the least doubt that Swan invented,
described, constructed, and used, thirty years before the
scienti<U+FB01>c world was read ' for       the prism-photometer which

meters constructed by Swan himself           is  now among the
apparatus of the Physical Laboratory of Edinburgh Uni
versity, having been purchased by Professor Tait some years
ago along with the best part of Professor Swan’s private
collection. This photometer   is in regular use in the Laboratory.
   In the same collection were also two other small prisms
intended for the same purpose, but not made up. The lid of
the small box containing them still, bears the inscription in
Professor Swan’s own handwriting:—-“ Pair of <U+FB01>ne plate
glass prisms made for me by Uooke (1870) for my prism                '
photometer.”     This inscription, written fully ten years after
the <U+FB01>rst published description, shows that Swan was in the
habit of using his photometer.
   The fact that Swan had forestalled Lummer and Brodhun
in the invention and construction of an ingenious form of
photometer has of course been familiar to all of<U+FB01>cially con
nected with the Edinburgh University Physical Laboratory
for some years past. Recently, having occasion to enquire
somewhat closely into the history of photometric methods,
I  determined to make     a  systematic search through Swan’s
published papers,     which  for the most part treat of optical
subjects.     had not far to search; for on the plate illustrating

surprise  I found as complete      a description of the essential
instrument as anyone could desire to <U+FB01>nd.         It   will remain
always    amatter  of no small  astonishment   that   such  an im

notice of the myriad workers in photometry.         In Swan’s day

                  experiments made by HopkinsonT on alloys of iron
   Vl‘HEand         nickel led to such striking results that the author
   thought that experiments of the same nature on other alloys
   of iron mi ht contribute some interesting facts to our know
   ledge of           agnetism. Accordingly a series of experiments
   were undertaken on some alloys of iron and aluminium.                  An
   account of the earlier experiments on these alloys, performed
   at the Cavendish Laboratory during the years 1897 and 1898,
   is given in this paper ; the later experiments being reserved
   for a subsequent communication.
        The alloys were made to the author’s order by the British
   Aluminium Company.                    Considerable dif<U+FB01>culty    was ex
   perienced at <U+FB01>rst in obtaining satisfactory specimens, the
   ones <U+FB01>rst made being very brittle and liable to split when
  smartly struck.            This was no doubt due mainly to rapid
  cooling.          After taking suitable precautions against this,
  however, suf<U+FB01>ciently durable specimens were obtained—unless
  the amount of aluminium approached 30 per cent., in which
  case the alloys gradually disintegrated to <U+FB01>ne powder with
  the evolution of acetylene gas.
       The specimens actually investigated contained 3'64, 5'44,
'
  9'89, and 18'47 per cent. of aluminium respectively.                   The
  <U+FB01>rst was comparatively soft and could easily be turned in a
  lathe; but the other three (in which the carbon was in the
  combined form) were extremely hard, and it was found im
  possible to cut them with ordinary tools.             The rings used in
  the experiments were obtained by casting the metal into a
  disk and boring out the central part of this by means of a
  rotating copper tube fed with emery-powder and oil.

    The experiments made extend over temperatures ranging
 from —83° C. to +9000 0.
    To obtain the low temperatures, the specimen, wound with
 primary and secondary coils, was immersed in an ether bath
 surrounded by a cooling medium of either ice and salt or
 carbon-dioxide snow. The ether bath was connected with a
 water-pump, by means of which rapid evaporation could be
 set up, and the ether thus cooled below the temperature of
the surrounding medium.
    The carbon-dioxide snow was obtained from Guinness’s
 brewery, Dublin, and was sent over in a barrel packed with
cowhair.      Although the journey took three days, the loss due
to evaporation was comparatively small, being not more than
one quarter of the whole amount.          While workin with the
 carbon-dioxide snow the experiments were continu           through
 out the night, and on one occasion the author conducted an
experiment for 36 consecutive hours.
    The high temperatures were obtained by means of Fletcher’s
improved muf<U+FB02>e-furnace, furnished with a governor to re
gulate the supply of gas to the furnace.       In later experiments,
however,     the alloys  have   been  heated   electrically by an ar
rangement similar to that used by Morris* in his experiments
 on the magnetic properties of iron.          This method has been
 found to be in every respect superior to the furnace method.
    The temperatures were deduced from the resistance of the
secondary coil, which was of platinum wire, and was wound
next to the ring.
    The chief results obtained from the experiments recorded
in this paper may be summed up generally as follows :—
    (1) The alloys behave magnetically as though they con
sisted of two distinct media superposed.
    (2) The general roundness of the curves and their lack of
abruptness near the critical point seem to indicate that the
alloys are heterogeneous       in structure.     A similar lack of
abruptness     near  the critical  point will be  seen in the curves
obtained by Hopkinson for nickel-iron alloys.
    (3) The permeability decreases with rise of temperature
near the critical point until aminimum value is reached, when
further rise of temperature produces very slight diminution,
if any, in the permeability.
    Morris‘l' has shown that in the case of iron we have a
remanent permeability after passing the critical point (which
result has since been corroborated by Hopkinson I).
    (4) The experiments suggest that the maximum value of

the permeability for an alloy containing 10 per cent. of
aluminium is reached at about —90° C.
   (5) An alloy containing 1847 per cent. of aluminium has
a critical point of about 25° (1., and gives no indication of
temperature hysteresis.   This alloy probably has a maximum
permeability at a temperature much below —90° C.

   The secondary S, is connected in series with the secondary

   One terminal of a galvanometer is connected with the point

pieces a, a, were connected to     the two terminals  of the battery
B, side <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2, and the      two terminals b, b, to the points
7, 8, in the primary circuit      (<U+FB01>g. 1).  It will be seen that at
each half revolution of the       secohmmeter the current in the
primary circuit was reversed.
   The contact pieces 0, 0 were connected to the two terminals
of the galvanometer G (<U+FB01>gs. 1 and 3), and d, d to the points
a, ,8 in the secondary circuit.   The secohmmeter was driven
by a small motor, and the contacts were arranged so that the
galvanometer connexions were reversed immediately before
the reversal of the battery.  The direction of rotation is shown
by the arrow (<U+FB01>g. 2).
   Pieces of ebonite were <U+FB01>tted into the spaces 9 g to allow
the central contacts to pass smoothly over them.     In time the
insulation becomes impaired owing to the continuous deposi
tion of brass on the ebonite.       To prevent this, V-shaped
grooves    11,were cut in the ebonite, and thus the continuity
                 h
of  the deposit was broken.     These grooves were scraped out
from time to time during the experiments.

      The brushes a a of the secohmmeter D were joined to the
   mercury cup 1 of the rocker K1 and to the point e respectively.
   This rocket serves the double purpose of throwing the current
   in and out of the primaries and of obtaining a zero. This
   second purpose is considered under a separate heading.        The
   three arms of the rocker on either side are soldered together.
   In the initial position the points 2 and 3 are connected up,
  and the current <U+FB02>ows through the branch circuit Z. ()n
  reversal, the points 1 and 2 are joined, and the current then
  <U+FB02>ows through the primaries of X and Y.
      The Galvanometer.—-The resistance of the galvanometer
  <U+FB01>nally used in the experiments was about 7 ohms.            It was
  made as sensitive as possible.      A weighted needle was used
  in the <U+FB01>rst experiments, but was afterwards discarded as it
  was found that the gain in steadiness was more than out
  balanced by the loss of sensitiveness.      The needle was never
  absolutely at rest, owing to the difference of the time constants
  in the two secondaries, and the variability of that of X.
  This effect was not suf<U+FB01>cient to prevent the detection of
  a de<U+FB02>exion of g millim. on the scale.       The scale was read by
  means of a telescope placed at some distance from the galva
  nometer-     The mutual inductance Y was placed with its axis
 vertical, and at such a distance from the galvanometer as not
 to disturb the needle.
      To obtain a Zero—The mercury cups 4 and 6 in the key K1
 are connected.      On reversing the rocker, the galvanometer is
 <U+FB01>rst cutout and then reconnected.        The lengths of the legs of
 the rocker are such that the current is reversed before the
 galvanometer is reconnected.       If  the rocker be turned over
 slowly, the spot of light moves off continuously from the
 zero.
     The Mutual Inductance.—The coil Y was wound with one
 primary and three secondaries. The values of the mutual
 inductances for the separate secondaries were 9'04 x 106,
 7 '014x 105, and 4'536 x 105 respectively.       It was hence pos
 sible to vary considerably the value of the mutual inductance
used in the experiments.       The values given above were de
termined by comparison with a standard coil whose mutual
inductance had been carefully calculated.
     Comparison with the Ballistic Melhod.—It was thought
desirable to compare the results obtained by this method with

   Eddy Currents—As the rings used in the experiments
were not laminated, the question of the in<U+FB02>uence of the eddy
currents set up in them 011 reversing the primary became an
important one.
   In J. J.  Thomson’s Recent Researches, the case of a cylinder
placed   in a  uniform magnetic <U+FB01>eld which is suddenly destroyed

 128            Dr. S. W. Richardson on      the Magnetic
 is considered, and it is shown how the total induction in the
 cylinder at any time t after the magnetic force is destroyed
                                                          2

 and   0' are the permeability        and speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the
 material of the cylinder and a is its radius.         We can make
 use of this result to form an approximate idea of the speed at
 which the secohmmeter might be driven without materially
 a<U+FB02>'ecting the magnetic measurements.
    The greatest permeability f'or alloy No. 1, which is the
 most permeable of the three specimens considered in this
paper, was 680.        If   we take a as 06 cm. and a- as 20,000

parison with the table on p. 357 (‘ Recent Researches ’) will
show that in this case the total induction will have diminished
to 1 per cent. of its original amount in 0'1 of a second.
    Hence we see that the number of alternations per second
in the experiments on this alloy should be less than 10
per second, in order that the results may be relied upon to
l  per cent.
    In general the secohmmeter made about 3 alternations per
second.      It could easily be seen whether, in any given case,
the eddy currents were affecting the measurements, by obtain
ing a balance and then allowing the speed of the secohmmeter
to increase.
    The effect of eddy currents would be shown by the balance
being disturbed.
    Care was taken, during the experiments, that the speed of
the secohmmeter should in all cases be less than that at which
this occurred.
       § III.   THE DETERMINATION OF THE TEMPERATURE.
    The resistance of the secondary of the ring (which was of
platinum wire and was wound next to the ring) was taken as
a measure of the temperature.            Thick platinum leads were
connected to the secondary close to the ring, and after passing
out of the box containing it dipped into mercury cups sus
  ended in an oil-bath.        From these cups copper wires passed
to the key     K 4 (<U+FB01>g. 3), by means of which the secondary could
be connected at will to either the magnetic bridge or the wire
bridge.      Side by side with the platinum leads were placed
compensating leads.         These were cut from the same specimen
of wire   as  that  used't'or  the leads to the secondary, and also
dipped into mercury cups suspended in the oil-bath.           Copper

           Properties of the Alloys        of Iron and Aluminium.         129
wires of the same resistance as those connected to K4 joined
these cups with the key K3.
   The object of the oil-bath was to maintain the junctions of
platinum and copper at the same temperature, and thus get
rid of thermoelectric currents.
   The leads were protected from direct heating by the furnace
by means of a thick sheet of asbestos.
   The resistance-bridge H               LMJ
                                    was so arranged that the
resistance of the secondary could be obtained directly from
one observation.
   This end was gained by the following device :—
   The resistance of the arm              HJ
                                    was made equal to 1001
ohms.
   The resistance of         MJ
                            consisted of three parts, r2, rs, and p2.
   'r, was a resistance of 1000 ohms ; r3 consisted of coils of
tenths of an ohm ; and p2 was part of the bridge-wire 170.
   The resistance of the whole wire 176 was slightly greater
than 1 ohm. Hence, by taking the proper plugs out of 73,
the resistance of p2 and 1*, could be made together equal to one
ohm to within one-twentieth of an ohm; i. 0., the resistance of
the arm      MJis equal to 1001 ohms to within a twentieth of an
ohm.   To obtain a reading, the secondary and galvanometer
are switched on to the wire-bridge by means of the keys K1
and K2, and 1'4 and p1 are adjusted until there is a balance
[with      MJ';HJ].
   When this is the case the resistance                  of the secondary is
given by
                                   1',   = r4+p1.
   The compensating leads are connected to the arm LM by
the key K3.
   The resistance of different lengths of the bridge-wire havin
been previously tabulated, the resistance of the secondary coul
be read off directly from the scale.

130            Dr. S. W. Richardson on   the  Magnetic
     As the secondary is outside the ring whose temperature is
required, care is necessary to insure that the temperature of
the ring does not materially lag behind that of the thermo
meter.
     To avoid the error due to this cause as far as possible,
 readings were only taken when the temperature was prac
 tically stationary.
      The close agreement of the results obtained under different
 conditions shows that the temperature of the ring could not
 have been greatly different from that of the secondary.         As
 it was impossible       to  read  the magnetic   bridge   and  the
  resistance bridge simultaneously, the time of each observation
  was recorded.      A time and temperature curve was plotted,
  and from this the temperature at the time of taking a
  magnetic observation was inferred.
    §  IV.  METHODS    USED FOR VARYING THE TEMPERATURE AND
                      FOR msunxrmc THE GorLs.
               (1) Ewperz'nwnts at High Temperatures.
       Asbestos paper was used as an insulator in these experi
   ments.     The specimen of paper used was obtained from
   Bell & Sons and was of a very superior quality.             After
   heating to a white     heat  and subsequently cooling, the dis
   coloration was very slight—the paper then having a faint
   yellow tinge.    The paper also held well together after heating,
   and showed no signs of crumbling.          The amount of car
   bonaceous matter present must have been very much less
   than that contained in the paper usually found in the
   market.
       The paper was cut into strips of about 1 cm. width.
        A double layer of this paper was wound next to the rin .
   Outside this the platinum secondary was wound, a doubTe
   layer of paper being twisted round the wire during winding ;
   this thickness of paper being again doubled for the <U+FB01>rst and
   last wind.    The primary was of copper wire insulated in the
   same way as the secondary, a double layer of paper being
    wound between the primary and secondary.
        The ring when wound was placed in a copper box, to which
    a copper tube of about 8 inches in length was attached.
        The box was placed in the mu<U+FB02>ie of a Fletcher’s “ Improved
            ”
    Mutiie     Furnace, being separated from direct contact with it
    by means of a thick pad of asbestos board. The mouth of the
    muf<U+FB02>e was closed with another iece of asbestos board, through
    a hole in which the tube attac ed to the box passed.
        This copper tube, through which the leads passed, served

    was tested from time to time during the experiments.    It was

    one inch in length was fastened to one side of the box, and to
    this was attached       piece of glass tubing of about one foot in
                            a

<U+FB01>g. 6. The box containing the ring was placed
water which was heated from below by a             bunsen-burner.
The water was automatically kept in movement by means of a
stirrer driven by a current of air passing through an asbestos
cylinder and impinging upon a wind-wheel V.
   To obtain temperatures between that of the atmosphere and
that of ice, the source of heat was removed and small pieces
of ice were added to the water from time to time until the
desired temperature was obtained.

          (3) Experiments at Temperatures below Zero.
    The same box and attached tube was used as in the last
 series of experiments.     It was found that, at the low tempe
 ratures used, ice formed to the thickness of a centimetre
 or more along the metal leads, owing to the condensation
 of the moisture in the air, and thus the insulation was
 endangered.
     To overcome this di<U+FB01>iculty the following arrangement was
 adopted (<U+FB01>g. 7). The secondary and compensating leads were
 surrounded by an indiarubber tube T, the free end of which
 was carefully closed.     Some portion of this tube passed down
 into the glass tube G. This was then <U+FB01>lled with melted paraf<U+FB01>n.     .

 tube also prevented the circulation of air between the
 surrounding atmosphere and the interior of the box, and the
 consequent heating of the ring. The box containing the ring
 was placed in the centre of a t in-walled metal vessel V, which
 was closed with a tightly-<U+FB01>tting bung through which the glass
 tube G passed.    The vessel V was of about a pint and a half
 capacity, and   was  <U+FB01>lled with ether, which was introduced
 through the tube K. The vessel was connected with a water
 pump and manometer by means of another tube L.             It was
 thus possible, by the rapid evaporation of the ether, to cool the

by regulating the evaporation to vary the temperature at will.
The bung was covered with melted paraf<U+FB01>n before commencing
an experiment, to insure air-tightness.        The vessel V was
  laced in the cooling medium M contained in the large stone
Jar  J, which rested on a thick pad of <U+FB02>annel. The whole
arrangement was surrounded with a quantity of cotton
waste C.     The cooling medium used in these experiments
was either a mixture    of ice and salt, or carbon-dioxide snow.

                                 Alloy N0. 1.
   The <U+FB01>rst alloy investigated contained 3'64 per cent. of
aluminium.
   This alloy, in which the carbon was mostly in the form of
graphite, was comparatively soft, and could easily be turned
in a lathe. The other alloys, in which the carbon was mostly
in the form of combined carbon, were harder than the hardest
steel.
   A   complete analysis of this alloy,             as  supplied by Mr. Dawe,

remains almost constant.          This flat part is followed by a
steep part extending     to  about  600°, when the curve begins to
bend round again, <U+FB01>nally becoming parallel to the axis of
temperature at about 750 C.
   This temperature was taken as the critical temperature for
the ring of alloy.

       Properties   of the Alloys of Iron and Aluminium.     139
   At about 660° C. the curve develops a sharp point indicating
an abrupt increase in the permeability followed by an equally
abrupt decrease.      This point will be discussed more fully in
Part  II.
   It will be noticed that there are no sharp points in the
curves at the temperatures of maximum and minimum permea
bility as might be expected to be the case if we were dealing
with a substance of uniform consistency. This general round
ness suggests that the alloy is heterogeneous in structure, the
roundness being due to the different constituents reaching
their maximum and minimum values at slightly different
temperatures.
   A complete curve, showing all the changes of induction
with increasing temperature, is shown on <U+FB01>g. 11.
   The relatively great steepness of the curve between the tem
peratures of 385° and 420° (about) is well shown in this <U+FB01>gure.
   This general form of curve was found to be common to all
the alloys experimented on.
   In all cases there is a very sudden change in the induction
after passing the temperature of maximum induction, followed
by a <U+FB02>atness extending in the case of the alloy containing
10 per cent. of aluminium          over a considerable range of
temperature, after which the curves again become steep.
   It was thought that it would be interesting to ascertain
whether the magnitude of this sudden change was in any
wa connected with the strength of the <U+FB01>eld.
   To do this it is easy to select the temperature at which the
induction is a maximum, as this is fairly well marked, and is
about 380° C. The temperature at which the sudden change
ceases does not, however, appear to be the same for all <U+FB01>elds.
The temperature 450° was arbitrarily chosen as that from
which to measure the termination of the sudden change.
The di<U+FB02>'erence of B between these two temperatures is for
shortness referred to as B.

      Properties of the Alloys of Iron and Aluminium.              141'
   These results are plotted on <U+FB01>g. 12.    The curve obtained
is very similar in general shape to a B and H curve, and does
not differ materially in shape from the analagous curves for
the next alloy considered.      The changes of the induction
with temperature are, in fact, of the same nature as those we
 should obtain if we were dealing with two rings of different
compositions superposed one upon the other.         -
    The B and H curves shown on <U+FB01>g. 9 were obtained
 from the readings given in the Table on p. 140.

   This alloy contained about 10 per cent. of aluminium.          It
was too hard to be cut by ordinary tools.        The molten metal
was cast into a ring of 6'57 ems. external diameter, and 2'92
cms. thick.    The ring was subsequently cut into two by
means of a diamond wheel, and an analysis was made of the
upper half.

       The curves connecting B and T (H=const.) for this alloy
    are shown on <U+FB01>gs. 15 and 16.
       A study of these curves in conjunction with the correspond
    ing ones for the Alloy No         I    leads to the conclusion that the
    maximum value of the induction is probably reached at a
    temperature of about —90° C.                       The great chan e in the
   induction between this temperature and +100°                                        is ve
   striking, the value at 100° being about one-quarter of that at
    —90° 0., and about one-half of that at 20° C.
      The curves show for weak <U+FB01>elds a second maximum between
   300° and 400°, after which the induct-ion falls off to a
   minimum value at about 460“ when the permeability ;—_- 1'7.
   All the methods for varying the temperature (vide §
   were called into requisition in the experiments on this alloy.
                                                                                          IV.)

   The third alloy investigated contained 1847 per cent. of
aluminium.     It was exceedingly hard. The molten metal
was cast into a disk, and a hole was bored through the central
part of this by means of the emery cylinder.         The critical
temperature was found to be about 25° C.
   The experiments give no evidence of temperature hys
teresis—the B and T curves obtained with rising temperatures
being identical with those obtained with falling temperatures.

part of those for Alloy No. 11.       g. the part above 200° C.)

passing the critical point.
   As, however, the cooling took place in the air, the test                                        is
not sensitive, and this result cannot be regarded as of much
value.

the superposition of two media of different constitution, as
for instance crystals in a solidi<U+FB01>ed mother-liquid.                       That

   Suppose, for instance, A’, B’ are the curves obtained by
plotting the parts of the induction contributed by each medium
independently against the temperature for any given value
of H; then the curve C’ obtained by adding the ordinates
will represent the observed B and T curve for the alloy in
question.

   The value of B for this curve, which approximates to the
maximum Value of the ordinate of the curve A’, would then
be connected with H by a curve similar to a B and H curve.
   This result is in agreement with the curves actually obtained
from the experiments.
   It is intended very shortly to publish an account of some
further experiments on the changes of hysteresis as the tem
perature rises, and on the behaviour of the alloys during
cooling.

in making the very complete analyses of the alloys, and to

Esq., F.G.S.
     This paper opens with a general reference to the Ordovician and
Silurian complex of Central Wales, and a notice of the geological
work hitherto done in the region.                       The stratigraphieal relations of
the Silurian formations which occur in the country surrounding the
town of Rhayader(Radnorshire)are then described in detail. Typical
and con<U+FB01>rmatory sections are given, demonstrating the complete
local sequence of the rocks of the Rhayader district.                                These are
illustrated by lists of characteristic graptolites.                        These fossils are
compared with those of Southern Scotland, Sweden,and North Wales,
 showing that the graptolite-succession is everywhere similar, and
<U+FB01>xing the age of the Rhayader Series as representing the Lower

 country, shows the complete succession.        In any area some One
 group is always better developed than others; and some portion of
 at least one group is certain to be missing. The lowest, or Gwastaden
 Group, has a maximum thickness of over 1800 feet.       It is underlain,
 apparently conformably, by highly-cleaved       dark  blue   shales, and
 overlain unconformably by both the Caban and Rhayader Groups.
 The base of the Gwastaden Group is formed of a thick mass of
 grauwackcs, which thin to the east and thicken to the west. They
 contain Climacograptus, and pass up into mixed <U+FB02>ags and grits with
 O'limacograptus and Diployraptus.       These are succeeded by shales
 and mudstones in which the <U+FB01>rst Monograptidae appear.             These
 become dominant in the upper part.
    The succeeding      Cuban Group has a maximum thickness of
 1500 feet.     Its lower division consists of two massive con
 glomerates, separated by shalcs; its higher division is made up
 of <U+FB01>ne~grained grits, shales, and <U+FB02>ags. Each member of the
 group is overlapped to the east by the next sub-group above it,
until eventually the whole group disappears beneath the Rhayader
 Pale Shales, which in the eastern areas rest directly on the
Gwastaden rocks.
   The Rhayader Group consists of pale green, blue, and grey shales
 and mudstones, which overstcp on to the Gwastaden beds; and may
possibly pass completely over them, and rest on the dark shales
farther east.
    After the Gwastaden rocks were laid down, the sea-<U+FB02>oor appears
to have been elevated and denuded, a hollow being scoured out to
the eastward.       Rapid sinking followed; and the sea <U+FB01>lled the
hollow with the Caban sediments, practically levelling it up by the
time that the deposition of the Pale Slates began.
    Tables of fossils enable the author to establish a complete com
parison of the whole of the local zones of the Rhayader district with
those of Southern Scotland, Wales, and Sweden.        In the Rhayader
area we <U+FB01>nd, for the <U+FB01>rst time in Britain, the entire Valentian suc—
cession developed in one general sequence of rocks, with a more or
less common lithological character and with a fauna composed
throughout of similar palaeontological types.

   Dr. BLANFORD said that he had been asked by Prof. Juan, who was
unable to attend, to say a few words about certain photographs sent
by Mr. E. H. L. Schwarz, and representing the Dwyka boulder-bed
 and the rounded and grooved underlying surface,in the neighbourhood
of the Orange River near Hopetown and Prieska.         The importance
of these photographs lay in the evidence which they a<U+FB02>'orded on a
disputed point.       Dr. Sutherland and Mr. Griesbach had called
attention to the evidence of ice-action presented by the Dwyka
Conglomerate in Natal, and additional evidence had been brought
forward by several observers, especially by Mr.Dunn from the Orange

                 \On Drift-growls at West Wickham.                   157
Free State and Cape Colony, and recently by Dr. Molengraa<U+FB01>' from
the Transvaal.    Other observers however, and especially the late
Prof. Green, had disputed the glacial origin of. the Dwyka beds.
The photographs now exhibited would, the speaker thought, convince
most geologists that the phenomena presented were due to ice-action.
The resemblance to similar photographs shown to the Society in
1896 by Prof. T. W. Edgeworth David, and representing the beds
corresponding to the Dwyka Conglomerate in South Australia, was
noteworthy.    Evidence of glacial action in Upper Palmozoic times

land.’   By Dr. J. W. Gregory, F.G.S.
   British Somaliland consists of a high plateau, of which the
northern scarp is separated from the Gulf of Aden by a belt of low
hills and plains known as the Guban.         The southern plateau
consists   of Archaeau gneisses,       quartzites, amphibolite-schists,
chloritic schists, and pegmatites. It is capped by purple grits,
red sandstones, and conglomerates, which are covered by limestones
of Neocomian, Turonian      (‘I Cenomanian), and Eocene ages.       The
Neocomian limestone, which may be correlated with that of Singeli
described by Rochebrune, occurs at Dobar in the Guban; while
a   Jurassic limestone, probably of Bathonian date, occurs at
Bihendula in the Guban.        Fossils collected from these limestones
and from raised reefs of Pleistocene age, by Mr. and Mrs. Lort
Phillips, Miss Gillet, Mr. G. P. V. Aylmer, Capt. E. T. Marshall,
and Mr. F. B. Parkinson, have been examined by the author, who
tabulates   alist of corals and echinids. One new genus and fourteen
new species of corals are described, belonging to the genera
Sty/lophora, Stylina, Columnastrtea, Prionastrrea, Favia, illetethmos,
 chlolites, and I/ithrmea, and one new species of Pseudodiarlema.
The evidence of the collectionsis sul<U+FB01>cientto show that   a  Neocomian
limestone occurs both on the summit of the Somali plateau and on
 the <U+FB02>oor of the Guban, and that some marine limestones of Lower
 Tertiary age (probably Eocene) also occur on the plateau. It          is
therefore evident that the foundering of the Aden Gulf          is  post
Eocene in age.

the author between 1880 and 1885, and they establish the existence
of Drift-gravels about a mile south of Hayes Common. Some of
the implements have lost their pointed ends and bear other indica
tions of use, many are smoothed and rounded by Drift-wear, but a
few are entirely unworn, while some, particularly the larger ex
amples, are bruised and crushed by such in<U+FB02>uences as the plough
share and waggon-wheels. Most of the implements have a super<U+FB01>cial
colouring, varying from a pale straw-tint to a rich ochreous-brown.
‘
  The association of much-worn implements, unworn implements,
and <U+FB02>akes, cores, and waste-chips, in the same bed of Drift-gravel
points to the fact that we have here a collection of material which
was brought from a great variety of places, and has undergone a
great variety of conditions and changes.’

  ON KERR’S       PHENOMENON.          BY MM. ABRAHAM        AND LEMOINE.
               dielectrics, sulphide of carbon for example, become bire
LIQUID   fringent when     placed between the armatures of a condenser.
The liquid is equivalent to a crystal whose axis is normal to the
faces of the condenser.         It is shown by passing between the plates
a luminous beam polarized at 45° to the axis.               A nicol analyser
cannot extinguish it.
    When the electric <U+FB01>eld is done away with the birefringence dies
 out during an inappreciable space of time.          M. Blondlot has shown,
 by a method founded on the use of a revolving mirror, that the
optical phenomenon does not exist more than (“71,00 second after the
removal of the electric <U+FB01>eld.        The authors have been able to shorten
this interval.
    The condenser K is charged by connecting it with the poles P
 of a high-voltage transformer.           It is discharged suddenly in the
 spark E, which is divided by an air-blast.               If the amount of
 birefringence during this discharge is measured, it should show
 that this birefringence disappears during a very short time.

    The measurement of the birefringence is made by employing the

 condenser K      is analysed by the so-called photometric method ; it

nicol N2, these two images can be brought to the same intensity;
this rotation of the nicol measures the difference of mean phase
 due to Kerr’s phenomenon during the passage of the luminous <U+FB02>ow
in the condenser.
   A continuous source of light (sun, electric arc, &e.) cannot be
employed; the spark presents the advantage of being produced
only at the moment of the discharge and of having                     duration
                                                                       a
comparable    to   that   of  the   disappearance     of   the  birefringence.
The experiment furnishes therefore, together with the result
sought for, the evaluation of the order of the length of duration
of the spark.
   The light of the spark        brought into the condenser, at different
                                    is
periods,   bythe  following     arrangement    :—The converging lens             Ll

                                                                  it
the interval between the plates of the condenser (mirror M1
removed).     On the other hand, putting the mirror M1 in place,
the system of two converging lenses, L2, L3, and four plane mirrors
M2, M3, M4, Ml will bring the light of the spark to the condenser.
   By displacing the two mirrors M2, M3 the length of path
EMzMaM‘Ml which the light of the spark traverses before arriving
at the condenser K can be varied.
   The <U+FB01>rst measurement, made with the mirror Ml removed, gives
the value of the phenomenon at the instant when the spark                         E
appears, or, at the latest, at the end of the time which light
takes to traverse the path EK, which           isabout 20 centimetres.
   1n the following measurements, Ml being in place, the time
which elapses between the production of the spark and the instant
when the light passes K can be increased at will                   ;   it  only
                                                                            is
necessary to draw back              by
                                  degrees the mirrors M2, M3.           In this
manner one can, after a fashion, construct the curve of the
phenomenon as         a function of the time,        a delay of one metre
corresponding    to  one  three-hundred-millionth       of   asecond.

      MM. Abraham and Lemoine also exhibited to the Society an
   arrangement which enables the birefringence of conductors to be
   shown.     The water which <U+FB01>lls the tank of Kerr’s condenser is
  operated on. The condenser is placed between two crossed nicols
  suitably situated.        The spark E is always the source of light
                                   '
   employed.
      The manner of charging the condenser is different.                 The poles
   of the transformer charge two condensers by cascade; the exterior
  armatures of these condensers are connected by a resistance of which
  the condenser K forms part.               During the charge the water plays
  the part of a conductor.           At the moment when the spark passes,
   the charges suddenly set free on the auxiliary condensers proceed
  to charge the condenser K, and during this sudden action the water
‘
  acts as an insulator.           The Kerr's condenser keeps its charge
  for a very short time. and a brilliant reappearance of light is
  observed.—-Séances        de la Societé Franchise de Physique, Nov. 17,

                     compounds under certain conditions possess
  THORIUMthe property      of producing temporary radioactivity in
  all solid substances in their neighbourhood.              The substance
 made radio-active behaves, with regard to its photographic
 and electrical actions, as if it were covered with a layer
 of radio-active substance like uranium or thorium.                 Unlike
 the radiations from thorium and uranium, which are given
 out uniformly for long periods of time, the intensity of the
 excited radiation is not constant, but gradually diminishes.
 The intensity falls to half its value about eleven hours after
 the removal of the substance from the neighbourhood of
 the thorium.       The radiation given out is more penetrating
in character than the similar radiations emitted by uranium
and thorium and the radio-active derivatives from pitchblende,
radium‘l', and polonium
     Attention was <U+FB01>rst drawn to this phenomenon of what may
               “ excited                  ”
be termed                 radioactivity     by the apparent failure of
good     insulators,   like  ebonite    and   paraf<U+FB01>n, to continue to
insulate in the presence of thorium compounds.

 ciable movement of the electrometer-needle.              If, however,
 the plate  C,     covered with thorium oxide, were left in the

 removal      of
              C      and   the  substitution  of   a non-active metal
 plate, the movement of the electrometer-needle showed that
B    was receiving a   +    charge. On reversing the battery, the
 current was reversed in direction but equal in amount. The
 current between the plates gradually decreased with the time,
 and became inappreeiable after            few days.
                                             a           By replacing’
 the thorium oxide, the experiment could be repeated.
     It was at <U+FB01>rst thought that possibly dust particles from the
 thorium oxide might have escaped from under the paper and
 in some way adhered to the upper plate. An examination of
  the plate B,    however, revealed no trace of thorium oxide on
 its surface. The plate made the air                 conductor in its
                                                      a
  neighbourhood, as    if  it  were covered with a thick layer of
  radio-active substance.       If the surface of the plate was care

          produced by    the Action of Thorium Compounds.         163
  fully scrubbed with sand- or emery-paper, the radio-active
  power was to   a  great extent destroyed. It was found possible
  to make    the ‘plate B active, even if the thorium oxide were
  covered with 30 layers of foolscap paper tightly waxed down
  so as to prevent the escape of dust particles.                    .
     If the plate C was charged — and B+, the plate B no
  longer became radio-active, but the top layer of paper over
  the thorium was found to be active op its upper side to about
  the same extent as the plate B in the previous case ; i. e., the
  negatively charged surface was made active in both cases.
     All the compounds of thorium examined have the power of
  causing radioactivity in substances.          The oxide, however,
  gives far the largest effects, and has consequently been used in
  most of the experiments.
     The thorium compounds used were supplied by Messrs.
  Eimer & Amend, New York. The oxide was obtained by
  igniting the nitrate which had been manufactured from
  monazite sand.      If  the oxide is heated for some hours to a
  white heat in a platinum crucible, it loses its power of
 exciting radioactivity in substances to a very large extent.
               Comparison     of Intensities of Radiation.
     The intensity of the radiation, excited in substances in the
  manner described, was in all cases compared by the electrical
  method.     In general, for the purposes of measurement, the
  radioactivity was excited in <U+FB02>at plates or circular cylinders.
     For <U+FB02>at plates the testing apparatus was similar to <U+FB01>g. 1.
 The brass plates corresponding to B and C were 5 cms. apart,
  with a potential-difference of 50 volts between them.          The
 current between the plates, measured by the rate of movement
 of the electrometer-needle, was taken as proportional to the
intensity of the radiation at the surface.         With radio-active
 cylinders, the active cylinder was placed in a larger cylinder
and concentric with it. The current for 50 volts between the
 cylinders was taken as a measure of the intensity of the
 radiation at the surface.
    For experiments, extending in some cases over several days
or weeks, it was necessary that for each observation the electro
meter should be of the same degree of sensitiveness.        This was
roughly ensured by the Thomson Replenisher and Gauge,
attached to the electrometer.         For small variations from the
standard sensitiveness, the values of the current were corrected
by observing the number of divisions on the electrometer-scale
corresponding to the E M.F. of a Clark cell.                        .

the intensity of the radiation from radio-active plates and
cylinders, a brief theoretical discussion will be given of the
relation that exists between the intensity of the radiation, the
      of the active surface, and the maximum current through
 talil'ea
       0 gas.
       Two cases will be considered—
          (I.) When the radiation is given out uniformly from a
               plane surface and the current through the gas is
               measured between two parallel planes.
          (IL) When the radiation is given out from a cylinder and
               the current measured between concentric cylinders.
       Case I.—We will <U+FB01>rst consider the case of a uniformly
radio-active plate 0, of area S, which is placed between two
large parallel plates A and B (<U+FB01>g. 2 a).
                 Fig.   2 a.
   \Ve will suppose the plate C to be of large dimensions
compared with the distance d of the plate C from A, and to
give out radiation equally from all points of its surface. The
gas is ionized by the passage of the radiation through          it,
and the ions produced travel to the plates         A

in<U+FB02>uence of the electric <U+FB01>eld.
   In consequence of the energy required to ionize the gas, the
intensity of the radiation diminishes in its passage through it.

the value of   the   intensity may be considered approximately
equal at equal distances from the surface 0. In consequence of
the absorption of the radiation by the gas, the intensity  I   at

          Conditions  for  the    Production of Radioactivity in
                                  Substances.
     In order to  con<U+FB01>ne the induced radioactivity produced by
  thorium compounds to any particular conductor, it is necessary
 that it should be charged — and all other bodies in the <U+FB01>eld + .
  In order to produce radioactivity in all bodies in the neigh
  bourhood, n0 electric <U+FB01>eld is required.                If  thorium oxide is
 placed in a closed vessel connected to earth, the sides of the
 vessel and any solid bodies near, whether conductors or
 insulators, become radio-active. If, in addition, the surface of
 the thorium oxide is covered with paper or thin aluminium
 foil, the side of the paper away from the oxide becomes
 radio-active.    When no electromotive forces are acting, the
 amount of radioactivity in a given time per unit area is
 greater the nearer the body to the thorium oxide.
    With electromotive forces acting, the substance to which
 the radioactivity is due appears to travel along the lines
 of force from the + to the —- charged body. It is thus
 possible to concentrate the radioactivity on small plates or
<U+FB01>ne wires by placing them in a closed metal vessel connected
 to earth and charging them —.
    If  the bodies are all uncharged, the particles producing
 radioactivity, by the process of diffusion through the gas,
 are carried to the sides of the bodies and adhere to them.                A
<U+FB01>ne wire <U+FB01>xed in the centre of a vessel on the bottom of which
 the active salt is placed becomes only slightly radio-active, since
only a few of the active particles reach its surface. The closer'
a body is to the thorium, other conditions remaining unaltered,
 the more active it becomes.

    Fig.  3 shows the general arrangement for concentrating the
activity on a small area of a conductor. A metal vessel V

168          Prof. E. Rutherford on Radioactivity
was connected to the + pole of a battery of small lead accu
mulators of 300 volts, the other pole of which was to earth.
   A thick layer of thorium oxide was placed in the bottom
of the vessel and covered with several thicknesses of paper.
A brass tube D.was <U+FB01>xed in the side of the vessel and
metallically connected with it. A <U+FB01>ne platinum wire AB
was <U+FB01>xed on the end of a stouter brass rod BC.           The brass
rod was <U+FB01>xed centrally in the cylinder D and insulated from
it. The end of the brass rod B was placed well inside the
cylinder D. The conductor AC was connected to earth.
    The <U+FB01>ne wire is thus the only body exposed in the <U+FB01>eld
with a charge, and, under the in<U+FB02>uence of electric forces, the
active particles are carried to the wire AB and adhere to its
surface.
    The same general results are obtained whether the surface
 of the thorium oxide is bare or covered with paper or thin
layers of metal-foil.
    Two or three layers of paper almost completely cut off the
                      " from thorium; so the effect cannot be
ordinary radiation
due to the direct radiation from its surface.

 I    have spoken of using     a   platinum wire, but any other
 metal wire will serve equally well.         Using large electro
 motive forces and large surface of thorium oxide,

 be quite possible to increase the radioactivity of unit area of
 the conductor to more than 20 times the value cited in the
 above case.     So far as the results obtained indicate, there      is
 no limit to the amount of increase, since we can suppose the
 area of the — charged conductor diminished and the amount of
 thorium increased. In practice, however,         alimit would soon
 be reached, asit  would be dif<U+FB01>cult to cause all the radio-active
 particles to move to the small conductor without very large
electric forces.

plates,    on  one of  which     is spread thorium oxide, is greatly
diminished by directing a slow continuous blast of air between
the plates.       As the particles have no charge, they may be
readily removed from between the plates by a current of air
even in a strong electric <U+FB01>eld.
                                                                     ”
    There is a very close connexion between this “emanation
and excited radioactivity—in fact, the emanation is in some
way the direct cause of the latter. The following facts will
serve to show the close connexion that exists :—
    (1) All thorium compounds examined are able to make
substances radio-active, but to different degrees.         The greater
the amount of emanation, the greater the amount of induced
radioactivity.       As an example, thorium oxide is the most
active of all thorium compounds in producing radioactivity
and giving out the emanation. A thin layer of thorium oxide
 gives out very little emanation, and is only slightly effective
 in producing radioactivity.
     ('2) Substances are made radio-active when the active com
 pound is covered with several layers of paper or thin metal
 foil. The emanation also readily passes through paper and
 thin metal foil. Two or three layers of ordinary foolscap
 paper completely out ott' the ordinary radiation given out by
 thorium compounds, but do not much diminish the amount of
 induced radioactivity.
     (3) A slow current of air, which quickly removes the
 emanation as it appears, also diminishes the power of pro
 ducing radioactivity.          The amount of induced radiation is
 greater    in  closedfhan     in  open vessels, on account of the dis
 turbance of air-currents in the latter case.
     (4) Thorium oxide which had been heated to a suf<U+FB01>ciently
 high temperature gave out very little emanation and produced
 little radioactivity.
     Speaking generally, it may be said that the presence of the
  emanation is necessary for the production of radioactivity in
                       * Phil.  Mag. January 1900.

 170             Prof. E. Rutherford on Radioactivity
 substances, and that the amount of radioactivity depends
 upon the amount of the “emanation.”                   A radio-active sub
stance like uranium, which gives out no emanation, produces
no trace of excited radioactivity.
    An experiment now to be described throws a further light
on the question.       The general arrangement of the experiment
is shown in fig. 4.

    A  slow current of air from a gas-bag, after bubbling through
 sulphuric acid, passed down through a rectangular wooden
 vessel, 60 cms. in length.        In order to remove spray and dust
 and to equalize the current of air over the cross-section, the
 air was assed through cotton-wool at W. A metal plate
 covered t e bottom of the vessel and was charged +.                         Four
 insulated  metal   plates, A,   B,   C, D, placed      at   equal distances,

 Thorium oxide covered with paper was placed under the
electrode   A.
    The current of air was passed through the vessel at the
 steady rate of about '2 cm. per second for a period of 7 hours,
 with 300 volts between the lower and upper plates.                           The

activity is produced on the plates some distance away from

   It will be observed that the radiations from zinc and thorium
oxide are quite ditt'erent in character, the radiation from the
former being far more penetrating as regards aluminium.
Both types of radiation are approximately homogeneous. The
current, which is proportional to the intensity of the radiation,
diminishes approximately in a geometrical progression as the
thickness of the metal increases in arithmetical progression.

   This method can also be used to compare the radiations
from the various metals when made radio-active.     In this way
it was found that all the substances tried, viz., Cu, Pb, Pt,
Al, Zn, brass, cardboard, paper, which had been made radio
active, gave out radiations of the same penetrating power.
It was also found that the same type of radiation was given
out from polished and dull surfaces, and that it was unaffected
by the concentration of the radioactivity.
   Since the same radiation is given out by all the metals and
non-metallic substances like cardboard or paper, under varying
conditions, We may conclude that either the substance itself
which has been made radio-active plays no direct part in
determining the kind of radiation, or that all exert exactly
the same action.

   The “excited      radiation is also of a more penetrating
character than that given out by uranium, thorium, and the
pitchblende derivatives radium and polouium.
               Absorption of the Radiation in Air.
   The absorption of the induced radiation in air was also
determined. The method employed was similar to one pre
viously used and described by the author* for determining
the absorption of uranium radiation by different gases. A
similar apparatus has been employed by Owens 1‘ for thorium
radiation.
   Two insulated parallel plates, kept a <U+FB01>xed distance apart,
could be moved by means of a screw to different distances
from the parallel radio-active surface.        The radiation from
the active   surface  passed through    a circular opening in the
lower plate, covered with thin aluminium-foil, and was stopped
by the upper plate.        The current between the two <U+FB01>xed
plates  for a large voltage was determined for different dis
tances from the radio-active        late.   If the radius of the
active surface is large compare with the distance of the lower
of the pair of plates from     it,the current between the plates

in a geometrical progression as the distance increases in

radiation in air at different pressures have been obtained by

   The distances through which the three types of radiation
from uranium, thorium, and active lead pass through air at
ordinary pressures and temperatures before the intensity is
reduced to one-half its value, are about 4, 10, and 16'5 mms.
respectively.

radiation is the same as for aluminium and paper.
    The “ excited” radiation is of a more penetrating kind
than the easily absorbed type (the a radiation) * given out
by uranium, but much less than the B type. The radiations
from radium and polonium are also more readily absorbed in
 air than the excited radiation is.

made    active. In order to test the rate of decay of the
intensity, the active rod was placed inside a cylinder and
concentric with it. The current between the two cylinders
for a potential-di<U+FB01>'erence of 50 volts was measured in the
usual manner, and at intervals of several hours.

  The value of the maximum current, which is taken as
unity, was 1'6 x 10“11 amperes.
    Fig. 7 shows graphically the results obtained. The results
 show that the current through the gas (which is proportional
 to the intensity of the radiation) diminishes in geometrical
 progression with the time. The time taken for the intensity
 of the radiation to fall to half its value is about eleven hours.
If   10 be   the intensity at the beginning, the intensity       I
 after a. time t is given by
                             1:10 6—“,
where L is a constant.
    The above law appears to hold accurately for all substances
made radio-active.      No difference in the rate of decay has
been observed, whether the radiation is on a plate of large
area or concentrated on a <U+FB01>ne wire.         The rate of decay is
also independent of the substance made radioactive. A piece
of paper, mica, or metal, all give the same rate of loss of
intensity.    As far as experiments have gone, the rate of
decay is unaffected by the pressure of the gas surrounding      it,
or whether the air   is  dry or full of moisture. The same rate
of decay has always been obtained under all the conditions
tried, provided the surface      not acted on mechanically or by
                                 is
chemicals.
   The mean value of   L   deduced from the above results  is
                           L='0000189.

 proportionally with the time, and then more slowly, <U+FB01>nally

   We will now consider the conditions which in<U+FB02>uence the
increase of the intensity of radiation from        given surfacea

suppose that the surface to be made radio-active      negatively         is
charged.
   Two opposing actions are evidently at work. Fresh radio
active    articles are being continually carried to the plate,
while t    eintensity of the radiation given out by the active
surface continually diminishes, owing to the radiation of
energy. A steady state will be reached when the rate of
increase of intensity due to the supply of fresh radio-active
particles   isequal to the rate of decrease of the intensity due
to the radiation of energy from the active surface.

    We have so far assumed that the
                                              radio-active particles
were conveyed     to the surface under the
                                                    in<U+FB02>uence of an.
electric <U+FB01>eld. The equations
                                    which have been given will,
however, apply equally well to the case of
electromotive forces
                                                   diffusion.   If no
                        are acting, the radio-active particles

         produced by the Action of Yhorium Compounds.         181
di<U+FB02>'use through the gas and adhere to the surface on which
they impinge.     A steady state will be reached when the rate
of supply of fresh radio-active particles due to diffusion is
balanced by the decay of the radiation from the surface.
The maximum intensity of the radiation on any surface in
the nei hbourhood of a thorium compound is thus pro
portiona to the number of radio-active particles that reach it
by the processes of diffusion.
        Eject of         on the Amount  of Radioactivity.
   The amount of induced radioactivity in  a given time increases
with the voltage for small voltages, but soon reaches a point
beyond which large increases in the E.M.F. have a very
small effect on it. In order to investigate the relation in
detail, the following arrangement was employed :—
   Two insulated concentric brass cylinders A and B (<U+FB01>g. 9)
were used, of diameters 5'5 and '7 centim. respectively.      The
                              Fig. 9.
                                                  0““.
ends were closed with paraf<U+FB01>n stoppers C and D. The cylinder
A was connected with the + pole of a battery, the other pole
of which was to earth. The cylinder B was connected to the
electrometer in the usual manner. A layer of thorium oxide
in a paper envelope was placed along the bottom of the cylinder
A. The whole was exposed to the action of thorium oxide
for three days.   The intensity of the radiation given out by
B had, after that interval, nearly reached its maximum value.

182                    Prof. E. Rutherford   on   Radioactivity
The following measurements were made for each exPeriment
at different voltages :—
   (1) The current between A and B was measured with the
         thorium oxide in the cylinder.
   (2) After the thorium oxide had been removed and the air
         blown out, the current between A and B was again
         determined.
   (3)  The  cylinder B was then removed and a non-active one
         of the same dimensions substituted and the current
         avain observed.
   The ellectrometer was brought to the same sensitiveness
every day by means of a Thomson Replenisher.         For rapid
rates of discharge, a condenser of '001 microfarad capacity
was placed in the electrometer circuit.
   The current (3) includes the small leak (if any) over the
insulators plus the current due to the radioactivity produced
in the end paraf<U+FB01>n stoppers.    The current (2) was due to the
radio-active cylinder B, together with the current (3). The
                                         ”
current (1) was due to the “ emanation     from thorium oxide
plus (2) and
   From these three observations it was therefore possible to
determine :—
    (a) The rate of discharge due to the thorium alone ;
   (b)        rate of discharge due to radio-active cylinder             B

voltages between cylinders.

curve C shows that as the voltage diminishes, the amount of
 radioactivity on the sides and ends increases, reaching a
maximum when the voltage is zero. The currents due to the
 radioactivity of B, given in the third column of the table, are
 for 50 volts between the cylinders.         The value given for 310
 volts is probably too large, as it was measured for 310 volts
 between plates, instead of 50 as in the other experiments.
     In the <U+FB01>fth column is given the total current due to the
 radioactivity ,on ends and sides plus the action of cylinder B.
 It will be observed that the resulting values are not very
 different, except the value for 310 volts, which, for reasons
 above explained, is probably too large.
     It looks as if a certain number of radio-active particles were
 given out from the thorium and that these were carried to
 various parts of the vessel, the effect due to the whole number
 being about the same as if they were all concentrated on the
 negative electrode.

                   Case   of Di<U+FB01>'usion of Radio-active Particles.
   The case where no voltage is acting is one of special
interest, for there the diffusion of the radio-active particles
is alone operative. A loose la er of paper was placed over
the paper envelope containing                       a the

  The current due to the total radioactivity   thus about the                  is
same as the current when 20 volts acts between cylinders.
The experiments on the effect of voltage extended for more
than month, and some of the results showed that the thorium
         a
oxide was not a constant source of radiation during the whole
of that time. The variations were not, however, suf<U+FB01>ciently
large to obscure the general nature of the results.

    The third column gives the current in divisions per second
 due to radio-active rod in the testing vessel.    In the fourth
 column are given the divisions per second corresponding to
 an exposure of the rod for the same time (three days) in each
 case, at the particular pressure.   The results are interpolated
 from the <U+FB01>rst two columns with the help of the curve given
 in <U+FB01>g.   8.The results must only be considered approximate, and
 merely serve to give comparative estimate of the radioactivity
                                    a
 at each pressure.    The general results are clear. The radio
 activity   isabout the same at 16 millim. as at 760 millim.
 Between the pressures of 16 and 4'5 millim. the amount
 begins to diminish, until at '45 millim.         only 216 of the it   is

186        ,      Prof. E. Rutherford on Radioactivity
value at atmospheric pressure.             Still further diminution-of
pressure     does  not  have   much   effect.
   A special experiment on the distribution of the radio
activity at low pressures throws some light on the phenomena.
If  we expose a rod charged — at a low pressure to the action
of thorium, it will be found that the rod is only slightly
radio-active, while the top of the paper over the thorium
oxide and the sides of the vessel are strongly radio-active. At
atmospheric pressure, other conditions remaining the saine,'it
will be found that most of the radioactivity is con<U+FB01>ned to
the rod, and only a slight amount is produced on the paper
and sides of the vessel.            It appears as if the radio-active
particles are unable to        be all carried to the negative electrode
 at low pressures.        This may be due to the increased rate of
diffusion of the active particles at low pressures, or more
                                                                “
probably to the small number of ions produced by the emana
tion
      ”  at low pressures.
    It is found that the current through the gas due to the
 “emanation ” falls off nearly proportionally to the pressure,
 so that the number of ions present between cylinders at low
 pressures is a very small fraction of those at atmospheric
 pressure.

 a straight line.         If   the conveyance of the radio-active
 particles to the electrode is due to the movements of the ions
 between cylinders, at low pressures the number of ions may
 be too small to be effective in that respect.

      Chemical and Mechanical Actions on                   the Radio-active
                             Smface.
    We have previously considered the conditions which govern
 the production and decay of the induced radioactivity.                      We
 will now describe some experiments that have been made to

188            Prof. E. Rutherford on Radioactivity
try and throw some light on the question             as to what the
induced radioactivity is really due      to.
   If  the radioactivity is caused b         some radio—active dust
deposited on the substance, we. shou d expect to <U+FB01>nd evidence
of it by examining the surface with a microscope, or by noting
whether there is any increase in weight. A <U+FB01>ne piece of platinum
 wire, which had been carefully weighed, was made strongly
radio-active by <U+FB01>ve da s’ exposure to thorium oxide covered
over with paper.     Wit in the limits of accuracy of the balance
no certain variation of the weight could be detected.            The
increase of weio'ht, if any, was certainly less than Q16 of a
milligramme.      an examination by a microscope no collection
of dust particles on the surface could be observed.          We may
conclude from this experiment, that if the radioactivity is due
to the deposition of radio-active particles on the surface, these
particles must be extraordinarily radio—active compared with
their weight.    A rough estimate shows that the radioactivity
of the surface-layer must be at least a million times greater
than that of uranium or thorium.
   The amount of radiation from an active surface is always
lessened by mechanical actions, such as rubbing the surface
with a cloth or <U+FB01>ne sand-paper.            In order to completely
remove the radioactivity, it is necessary to remove the
surface-layer by long scouring with sand- or emery-paper.
   A blast of air directed against a radio-active plate has no
appreciable effect on the amount of radiation given out.
   A radio~active platinum wire or plate can be heated White
hot without much altering the amount of radiation given out
from it. A strongly active <U+FB01>ne wire is more affected than a
plate; but that is probably chie<U+FB02>y due to action of the <U+FB02>ame
gases upon it.
                           Chemical Actions.
   The radioactivity of a platinum plate is not much affected
by dipping it in water, caustic soda, or nitric acid, whether
hot or cold. Sulphuric or hydrochloric acid has the power of
rapidly destroying the intensity of the radiation in a few
minutes. A copper-sulphate solution, if only slightly acid,
does not act on the wire rapidly.         The following example of
a test shows the   effect   of  several of the solutions on a radio
active platinum plate.         After each immersion the plate was
washed in water and dried over a Bunsen-<U+FB02>ame.                  After
exposure   of 4 minutes   to  gradually heated  water  and 2 minutes
to boiling water, the rate of discharge fell from 100 divisions

        produced   by the Action of Thorium Compounds.           189
in 15'5 secs. to 100 divisions in 20 secs. After  5 minutes’ boiling
in caustic soda, the rate of discharge fell to 100 in 27 secs. After
10 minutes’ exposure to strong hot nitric acid, the rate of dis
charge was cut down to one-half its previous value. Dilute
sulphuric acid reduced the rate of discharge to one-half in
 10 secs. and one-quarter in 60 secs.       Both hydrochloric and
 sulphuric acids are more powerful in destroying the radio
active power than the other solutions examined. ln the case
 of water and caustic soda, the small diminution of intensity
 appears to be due as much to the mechanical action of the
 bubbling as to the chemical action on the surface.
    The question now arises, whether the loss of radioactivity
 of the active plate by immersion in solutions is due to the
 destruction of the radio-active power of the particles or their
 removal from the plate to the solution. A <U+FB01>ne platinum wire,
 very strongly active, was placed in a few drops of dilute
 sulphuric acid for several minutes.         The wire lost a large
 proportion of its radioactivity.      The dilute acid was then
 evaporated down to dryness in a sand-bath, and on exami
 nation it was found that the residue on the glass surface was
 strongly active.     We may conclude from this experiment
 that the radioactivity of the particles is not destroyed, but
 that they pass into solution, and that on evaporating the
 solvent the substance still remains.
    Some experiments were tried to see whether a plate preserved
its radio-active power when a layer of copper was electrolyti
 cally deposited upon it. A radio-active platinum wire was
 made a cathode in a copper-sulphate solution, and a current
 of about half an ampere passed through for 1 minute.           The
 radioactivity was diminished to about '7 of its value when tested
 in the usual way. After washing the wire in water, it was
 allowed to stand some time in air, and the rate of diminution
 of the radioactivity observed.        The intensity diminished
 more rapidly at first than for an unacted-on wire; but after
 10 hours the rate of diminution became normal.            The more
 rapid decrease at <U+FB01>rst is probably due to the dilute sulphuric
acid which remained in the pores of the copper deposit.
 When the platinum wire was made the anode in a copper
 sulphate solution, the radioactivity rapidly diminished.       The
 action in this case was probably due to the production of
 sulphuric acid at the surface of the anode by the passage of
 the current which dissolved the radio-active material on the
platinum plate.

 190             Prof. E. Rutherford on Radioactivity
                         Discussion of    the  Results.
     Before entering on the question of the cause and nature of
 induced radioactivity, a brief review may be given of the
 results obtained :—
     (1) All thorium compounds examined produce radioactivity
 in substances in their neighbourhood, if the bodies are all un
 charged.       With charged conductors the radioactivity is
 produced     on  the — charged body.           In strong electric <U+FB01>elds,
 the radioactivity can be concentrated on the surface of thin
 wires. Thorium oxide is the most active of the thorium
 compounds in causing radioactivity, but loses its power if it
 is heated for several hours at a high temperature.
     (2) The power of producing “radioactivity ”is closely con
 nected with the presence of the              emanation     from thorium
 compounds,      and   is  in  some   way dependent upon it.
     (3) The radiation excited in bodies is homogeneous, and of'
 a more penetrating character than the radiations from thorium
 or uranium.        The radiation is con<U+FB01>ned to the surface of the
 substance,    and   is independent of whether the substance is a
 conductor or non-conductor and of the nature of its surface.
      (4) The intensity of the radial-ion emitted falls off in a
 geometrical progression with the time, decreasing to half its
 value in about 11 hours. The decay of intensity is inde
 pendent of the state of concentration of the radioactivity or
 the nature of the substance.
     (5) The amount of induced radioactivity increases at <U+FB01>rst
 nearly preportional to the time of exposure, but soon tends
 to a value when the intensity of the radiation varies very
 little with increase of the time of' exposure.
     (6) The amount of induced radioactivity produced in a
 given time on a conductor depends on the potential-difference
 between the electrodes, and tends to a constant value for large
-E.M.F.’s.
     (7) The amount of radioactivity is inde endent of the
 pressure of the gas, except at low pressures w en the amount
 on the —- charged conductor decreases with the pressure.             The
 amount    is not  much      affected  whether  the  gas is hydrogen, air,
 or carbonic acid.
     (8) No increase of weight has been observed by making a
 body radio-active.          The radiation from a platinum wire is
 not    much   altered    by placing the wire in a <U+FB02>ame, hot or cold
 water, or nitric acid.             Hydrochloric and sulphuric acids
 rapidly remove the radioactivity from its surface.                   The
 solution,   when   evaporated,      leaves the  active  portion behind.
     Three possible explanations of the phenomena of induced

           produced by the Action        of Thorium      Compounds.     191
  radioactivity naturally present themselves :—(a) That the
  radioactivity is due to a kind of phosphorescence               excited in
  the substance by the radiation from thorium;                     or to the
                                                                 (b)
  deposition    of  the  + gaseous      ions  produced     in   the gas by
  the “emanation”;        (c)  or to the deposition of particles of         a
  radio-active material emitted by thorium compounds.                      ~
     The hypothesis that the radiation              is kind of phospho
                                                         a
  rescence will not explain the results observed, since sub
  stances are made radio-active outside the incidence of the
  radiation, and the radioactivity can be concentrated on the
  -— electrode.      The question as to whether the induced radio
  activity  is  due to the deposition of       a  foreign substance on
  bodies, or to the action of the + ions produced in the gas, or
-a combination of both,             dif<U+FB01>cult to decide with certainty
                                    is
from the experimental         evidence.     The theory that the + ions
 produced by the emanation are responsible for the radio
 activity, at <U+FB01>rst sight seems to explain many of the results.
 Since the radio-active particles of the emanation are very
  small, the intensity of the radiation must be very great near
  them and in consequence of this, ions may not only be pro
       ;
duced, but the charges on the ions set in violent vibration:
 these  +    ions would be carried to the negative electrode, and
  gradually dissipate the energy of their vibration by radiation
 into space.      On this theory, however,      it    dif<U+FB01>cult to explain
                                                      is
 the variation of radioactivity with pressure.          At low pressures,
 the experiments show that the total radioactivity produced                 is
 much the same as at atmospheric pressure, but the — electrode
receives only    a   small proportion of the radio-active particles.
 On   the   theory  that  the radio-active particles are + ions, we
 should expect them in          astrong <U+FB01>eld to be all carried to the
  — electrode.      Another experiment on the variation of the
 amount of radioactivity with distance also does not fall in
 readily with this view.           The amount of radioactivity was
 found to be practically the same whether the distance from
 the radio-active surface was          mms. or
                                         3          ems.
                                                    3         In the latter
 case,   the  number    of  +   ions  produced by      the   emanation      is
 much greater than in the former; 'but the amount of radio
 activity   is unaffected.
    The theory that the radioactivity          isdue to      deposition of
                                                             a
radio-active particles      from   the thorium compounds affords            a
general explanation of all the results but the dif<U+FB01>culty
                                               ;                       is to
advance    a  satisfactory reason for the particles obtaining the +
 charge which they must possess in order to be moved to the
 e- electrode in an electric <U+FB01>eld. If we suppose the radio-active
particles from‘thoriumi compounds emitted at a uniform rate,
 independent of the nature and pressure of the gas, we should

192          Radioactivity produced by Thorium Compounds.
expect to obtain the same total amount of radioactivity spread
over a vessel due to diffusion of the particles, as can be
obtained by concentration of all the radio-active particles on
the — electrode; and the amount should be independent of
the pressure and nature of the gas, provided it does not act
on the thorium.            Some experiments seem to point to the
conclusion that the radio-active particles are not charged till
they dil’fuse out into the gas, but that they gain a + charge
in the course of time. A possible explanation is that the +
charge is obtained by the diffusion of the ions to the surface
of the particles. Since there is reason to believe that the
— ions in most cases move faster than the + ions in an electric
<U+FB01>eld, there is always an excess of + ions in the gas, and the
particles in the gas thus tend to become positively charged.
On this supposition, the diminution of the amount of radio
activity on the — electrode at low pressures is due to the
fact that there is not a suf<U+FB01>cient number of ions in the gas
to charge the particles, which thus di<U+FB02>'use to the sides of the
vessel.                                   ~
    As far as experiments hav                     one, the power of exciting
 radioactivity appears         to   be    con     ned to thorium compounds.
Neither uranium nor radium nor polonium has so far shown any
trace of action; but the specimens
                                                    '   of radium and polonium
used were       not  very    radio-active         and     contained considerable
amounts of impurity.             A   plate      made      radio-active is not able
to excite any appreciable radioactivity
near it.       I have tested the + and                   -       in another plate
                                                             electrodes after the
passage for several         hours      of   a  strong     current    between them
 due to Bontgen rays, <U+FB02>ames,                and    discharge      from    points, but
no trace of radioactivity on them has been observed.

          R. L.     It. WILBERFORCE                         1',    following         a   suggestion
           ‘due     to       Profs. Ayrton and Perry                      i,       has described   a
 method of using        spiral spring in the determination of the

 Young’s modulus and the simple rigidity for the material of
 the wire forming the spring.         The great improvement intro
 duced by Mr. Wilberforce             consisted    in determining the
 periodic  times   of the  longitudinal   and   angular vibrations of a
 mass hung at the end of the spring, instead of measuring the
 longitudinal and the angular displacements of the end of the
spring due respectively to          measured force and

 the method led me to endeavour to simplify the conditions of
 the experiment, while retaining the principles laid down by
 Mr. Wilberforce. The apparatus and the method described in                                                 _
 this paper are the outcome of that endeavour.
    It should be noted at the outset that the assumption                                           is
 made, in accordance with general practice, that the wires
under test maybe regarded as formed of isotropic metal. But

The results given below show that in some cases isotropy
must be very largely departed from and in fact the method   ;

indication of the extent of aeolotropy than in giving values of
so-called “elastic constants.”

 those pierced by the holes for the clamping-screws, the system
 can be suspended by two parallel strings (about 1 metre in
 length), the plane A B D C being horizontal.                 The fact that
 the ends of the hooks, which engage in the strings, are about
 4 cm. above the centres of gravity of the bars, ensures that
                    position of the plane        ABDC          is thoroughly

    If new the two ends B, D are made to approach each other,
the displacements of the two bars being equal, and if the bars
are then set free, the system will vibrate, each bar executing
harmonic vibrations in a horizontal plane.               To the <U+FB01>rst order
of small quantities G and G' have no motion along the line
joining them; and when there is the additional limitation that
the mass of the wire is small compared with that of the bars,
the motion of G and G! at right angles to G G' may be
neglected. Thus to this order of accuracy the centres of
 gravity of the bars are at rest, and consequently the action of'
the wire on either bar is a pure couple.                The stress across
 any   section of the  wire   is a couple  of  equal value, and thus the
 wire is bent into a circular are.

   Two points remain to be noticed in connexion with the
determination of E. The wire will not generally be absolutely
straight.   But it is easily shown that small initial curvature
 (not necessarily uniform) in the horizontal plane is without
in<U+FB02>uence upon the time of vibration.      Curvature in a vertical
plane calls the rigidity of the material into play; but the effect
upon the time of vibration will be small when the wire is
nearly straight.
   The second point refers to the correction due to the <U+FB01>nite
mass of the wire.     The processes of the theory of the trans
verse vibrations of rods enable the period to be calculated to
any desired accuracy; but a close approximation can be
obtained by a very simple method.       The process turns upon
calculating the kinetic energy of the system on the assumption
that for a given angle between the bars the form of the wire,
when in motion, is the same as its form when at rest                                        1'.

   Some practical details may be added.         In the <U+FB01>rst expe_
riment (for <U+FB01>nding E), in order to set the bars into vibration
without     iving them any motion of translation,           conve                               B,                      is
nient slig<U+FB01>itly to draw together the two ends            by    loop
                                                                                                D it                             a
of cotton-thread.       The system, thus constrained,         then                                                          is
brought to rest, and the desired vibration     started by burning                     is
the thread.
   The motion of the bars must be small in order that the most
highly strained portions of the wire may not be strained
beyond the elastic limit.       have found that when the are of
                                            I                    ”

               is            rapid damping even with “silver

than for small arcs.       But when the vibration has become

198       Mr. G. F. O. Searle on      the   Elasticity of Wires.
su<U+FB02>iciently small the damping becomes very small, indicating
that the elastic limit is not overstepped. With a steel wire
314 cms. in length and '0698 cm. in radius, 1 <U+FB01>nd it easy to
count 100 vibrations of one of the bars with an initial de<U+FB02>exion
of not more than 1°, the elasticity being practically perfect.
This result might be expected, for in this case the greatest
 stress experienced by any part of the wire is only about 1,1,], of
the breaking stress.
    The suspending strings must be long and <U+FB01>ne, so that the
 torsional couples due to them may be negligible.
     Since any departure from the circular form of section of
 the wire has an important in<U+FB02>uence upon the time of vibration
 in the determination of E, it is advisable to mark one of the
 clamping-screws, and to take two sets of observations for the
 period with the mark (1) vertical, (2) horizontal.             The mean
 of the two values is to be used in the formulae (3) or (11).
 The two corresponding diameters should be measured by a
 screw-gauge and the mean taken, or the mean diameter should
 be found by the hydrostatic balance.
     The form of clamping-screw shown in fig. 2 is convenient;
 for if a number of wires of various metals are provided with
 clamping-screws, the same inertia-bars serve for all the wires.
 If  short wires are used, the clamping-screws should be recessed
 into the bars so that the end of the screw may be in the centre
 of the bar, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2 '. The wires are soldered into
 holes drilled into the screws.
    The only remarks necessary with regard to the determination
  of the rigidity are that small arcs of vibration should be used,
 and that the suspending-hooks should be so light that their
 moments of inertia about the axis of the wire are negligible.
     The masses of the bars should be determined, and, for
  convenience, marked upon the bars hejbre the holes are drilled
 in them.
     The dimensions of my apparatus are as follows:—
     Length of each bar =32‘1 ems.
     Width of each bar (square in section) =1'25 cm.
     Mass of each bar=441 grammes.
     Moment of inertia of each bar=3-793 X 10‘ grm. cm?
     Length of wires under test: 314 cms.
     Diameter of wires tested='1 to '15 cm.
     The following are some of the results obtained, the unit for
 each modulus being one dyne per square centimetre.                      In
 each case the value of E has been corrected for the mass of
    * This is not the case in my apparatus;   the end of the screw is about
 '6 cm. from the centre of the bar.

Messerschmitt *, and Chwolson’r also show great deviations.
The results of Wieneri and in one particular case of Seeliger
conform in the main to it. Lommel §-Seeliger’s law

shows deviations from the results of direct observation which
are at least as considerable as are those from Lambert’s law.
 In this connexion, the observations on the radiation of heat are
worthy of notice, as they are based on Very sensitive objective
methods.        Provostaye and Desainslt, Maquenne<U+FB01>l, Godard *',
and HutchinsTT con<U+FB01>rm for small angleso of incidence the
 law of the cosine without any exception. Angstrom                     II alone
found empirically Lommel's law, but this conclusion was due
 to a fundamental error in the disposition of his experiments, as
he himself admits in a later publication.                A closer examination
 of the above-mentioned results does not warrant the con
clusions to the extent drawn by the investigators.                        They
only show that no absolutely inatt surfaces are found in
nature, and that therefore the law of the cosine is not valid
 for natural bodies, more particularly in the case of the stars.
 Seeliger’s experiments were made specially for astronomo~
photometric purposes, and it is hence impossible to draw strict
 deductions from them which shall apply to really inatt
surfaces.      Messerschmitt, on the other hand, committed errors
 in principle, which will subsequently be referred to ; whilst
 Kononowitsch used a substance so unsuitable that his results
cannot be taken into consideration.                  It was hence necessary
to obtain new results, which should be based strictly on the
grounds which the theory demands.

    Preparing     the  Plates.-—-Powders loosely sifted and having
a level surface      would     undoubtedly answer the postulate of
the theory best. This would, however, necessitat-ea horizontal
position of the surfaces, which renders the investigations very
laborious.       It is therefore advisable to have the substances
in the shape of plane plates, so that the surface to be experi-_
mented upon can be brought into a vertical position. Cements
such as gum &c. have been shown to change the optical
properties of the powders in a high degree.               Casting (plaster
of Paris) also causes more or less normal re<U+FB02>exion, which
must by all means be avoided. The best method, as                    I  have
found, is to compress the powders by means of an hydraulic
 press and a steel stamping-iron.              \Vith suitable support at
the base and a pressure of from 4 to 20 tons, the necessary
 solidity for delicate treatment is obtained.                  No normal
 re<U+FB01>exion can be detected on the plates, as the following
 results will show; even the size of the powdery particles is
 not changed. Thus the chief source of such errors as all
 investigators have hitherto fallen into is fully avoided.
      The Polarization of the Scattered Light had to be dealt with
 <U+FB01>rst in order to decide whether a polarization-photometer
 could be used.            In contrast to media with very small
 suspended       particles    such as solutions of colloids &c., the
 scattered light       re<U+FB02>ected       by powders is not polarized, as
                                  "
 Provostaye and Desains have shown. The linear dimensions
 compared with the length of the re<U+FB02>ected waves are in the <U+FB01>rst
 case of the same order or even smaller than the waves, whilst
 the powder particles have an average diameter of 0002 nnn.
  The size is evidently of the same importance here as it is in
  respect to the colour (Rayleigh’s theory) of the light of 'the'
  sk .     The above-mentioned plates have been studied \vith‘a
  “                               ” and no polarization was found ; even
     fiaidinger’sche Lupe
  polarized incident light was re<U+FB02>ected depolarized (with
  exception of the limit angles 6 = 80° and i = 60° or 80°).
  This shows the perfection of the plates and permits the
  employment of a polarization-photometer, to the use of which
  Messerschmitt was not entitled as his substances polarized
  the light.
       Zhe Disposition of the Ewperiments must be such that
  parallel light can fall under any angle of incidence                 on the
  surface of the substance, and that the re<U+FB02>ected scattered
  light can be observed under any angle of emission (e) by the

202        Dr. H. R. Wright         on the   Photometry of    the
 photometer. The plate (a) (see <U+FB01>gure) is <U+FB01>xed with the surface
 in a vertical plane on the table (b) , which turns round a vertical
 axis and carries a graduated circle (0).         The source of light
 has a <U+FB01>xed position and is not to be moved; the angle of
 incidence is varied by turning the table              The graduated
 circle (d) concentric to     (0)determines the angle of emission.
 Contrary to other investigations in this line only one source
 of light has been used instead of two. The advantage of this
method     is  self-evident inasmuch as all variations of the
intensity are eliminated.
    The Standard       ofComparison     is drawn from the source of
 light which   illuminates   the  plate  in  the following way :—A

    The Source    of Light  is   an arc-lamp of about 500 candle
power, which burned with great constancy after having been
carefully regulated.       This was chosen as the best means of
procuring   a   parallel beam of light of great intensity, such as
the theory demands.
    As Photometer Glan’s * spectrophotometer was used.                  In
front of the slit placed Crova’s little plate with convergent
                 I                     t
edges.    The width of the slit was only 0'4 mm.                   To be
prepared for all eventualities the Wollaston prism was turned
so that light with      a vertical plane of polarization entering
the lower half of the slit vanishes; because the traces of
re<U+FB02>ected polarized light vibrate in avertical plane when at all
visible.

for the re<U+FB02>ected ones that they should be parallel        ;  not conical
as was markedly the case with other observers.                  As each
particle   scatters  light  in all directions,   we  have   to   separate
one of these rays from the others and to prevent the latter
from reaching the photometer. For this purpose                 it   isbest
to make use of a cylinder-lens (g) placed at its focal distance

 204       Dr. H. B. Wright on         the   Photometry   of the
   both from the slit and from the diffuse re<U+FB02>ecting plate.        All
   rays parallel to the optical axis of the collimator unite in one
   straight line, which coincides with the slit, whilst all other
   rays fall either to the right or to the left of it on to the
   carefully blackened metal parts of the photometer, and
   cannot possibly reach the eye.        The selection of the focal
  distance and the size of the lens are very important for the
  results.
      The Arliustment of the Apparatus—The arc-lamp (compare
  <U+FB01>gure) rests on a stand, which can be raised and lowered by
  means of a cog-wheel.       It is also movable in two directions
  in a horizontal plane.      A Zeiss condensing-lens spherically
  corrected procures the parallel beam of light.           A circular
  hole (h) is cut in the box carrying the condensing-lens so
  that the centre of it lies in its optical axis. It is used as a
  stop and also for centering the arc of the lamp.         The closed
  end of the cardboard tube    (1')contains three apertures, which
  are of such dimensions that only the plates were illuminated.
  To make the border of the dark parts of the instrument more
  exact still, the movable screen (k) was used.          The di<U+FB02>'use
  re<U+FB02>ecting plate        was gently pressed by two brackets,
 <U+FB01>xed with springs, against the brass piece (I), which could
 be levelled by means of three adjusting-screws.               It
                                                             stood on
 a “Meyerstein”        spectrometer, from which the collimator
 and telescope were removed.        The graduated circle (0) with
 two verniers  is  read by  means of the two microscopes.         The
 photometer rests on    a sliding board, which      iscarried       by
                                                                  the
 part (n).     A weight of 10 kg. balances the whole, which
 turns round the same           as the plate          The angles are
 read by the large graduated circle (11) (diameter 51 cm.) and
 the dials (d]) and (d2).      The directions of the condensing
 lens-, cylinder-lens-, and collimator-axes must of course meet
 in the axis of rotation, which must also pass through the centre
 of the little plate (a'), the mirror (f), and must lie. in
the surface of the plate (a).      A specially contrived body (0),
made of tin, prevents any extraneous light from coming into
the photometer, and carries the above mentioned cylinder
lens (9) and plate (a’).        The slit (1") sends light on to          a
small mirror whose surface lies in the axis ofrotation and which
is    <U+FB01>xed on the brass piece (I).         Thus one       enabled to

the zero of the graduated circle        actually 90°.

     The Photometric Measurements—Two            different methods
are at our disposal :
    1st Illethod.—The length of the plate with regard to the
dimensions of the photometer      is constant.  Or the projection
                                                     :

 on a plane perpendicular to the observed ray decreases with
increasing angle 6 as the cosine of this very angle       -                 1!.
    2nd Method—The length of the part of the plate which                                 is
 observed    not constant, but increases with increasing angle
             is                                                                           e

 cular to the observed direction     constant. is           _
    In case of homogeneous illumination the results of the
 second method multiplied by cos        are the same as by the
                                                    e
 <U+FB01>rst method. The reasons for using the second more com
 plicated method will easily be seen from the following:——
 For the sake of simplicity let us suppose Lambert’s law                                 is
 true. Then the <U+FB01>rst method will yield for i==O° and e=0°,
 the intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected light L=]OOO; for e=80°,
 L=]73. Such enormous dilferences cannot be measured
 with exactitude by any existing photometer.         The second
 method, on the other hand, will yield for the same angles
 e=0°, L=1000, and e=8()°, also L=1000. By multiplying
 with cos we get, of course, L=1000 and
             6                                     173, as before. L:
Now,   if Lambert’s law         not strictly correct, we still are
                                      is
forced to admit the superiority of the second method.               A

was made          by
              him. The values of the intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected
light are nearly constant between e=20° and 60°, and they
begin then suddenly to decrease very rapidly.                By using

   The    Compensation   of the Ilfeasure)nent8.——The measured
quantities are not the real objective-intensities of illumination ;
they are only functions of them, being the excitation produced
on the eye.    According to Fechner’s psycho-physical law the
intensity  of the sensation is proportional to the logarithm of
the excitation.   Consequently these logarithms must be used
for the compensation.        Gauss’s law of the least squares
leads to the following formula for the most probable value x
when by the different measurements for the same intensity
the values hl,     .    ll,

believes to be the only existing matt substance, was observed
at two different places in the spectrum which, according to
                                 ’
Helmholtz, ‘Physiologische Optik (p. 317), are complementary
colours.   The same applies to plaster of Paris.  The mixed
waves were measured in the same way as with ultramarine by
removing the prism of the photometer. The accuracy was
only 6 per cent. ; but to these last-mentioned measurements
no especial importance was attached ; they were only made
for reasons which will be subsequently shown.
   Even the best mirrors scatter light, which has been ob
served by the photometer.      From the results it is evident
that this scattered light obeys perfectly dg'lferent laws from
those of matt substances.

Hence the colour seems to be of greater in<U+FB02>uence for the
angle of incidence than for the angles of emission. Mes
serschmitt found the <U+FB01>rst result also, and tried to explain                                                  it

212             Dr. R. H. \Vright 0n            the    Photometry ofthe
colours.    The regular re<U+FB02>exion begins sooner for red than for
yellow, green, &c.    This fact alone, I believe, can scarcely be
a suf<U+FB01>cient explanation, because Fresnel * and Hankel 1- used
angles of 79° as a minimum, whilst here the phenomenon
can be noticed already at 20°.
    The law for the angle of emission having been found to
be independent of the colour,                   I
                                     believe to have proved the
truth ofvon Lommel’s hypothesis, that the so-called coef<U+FB01>cient
 of diffusion is independent of the wave-length for particles of
 the said dimensions.    Contrary to this the dependence upon
 colour has been shown by Christiansen I in the case of very
 small suspended particles. This cannot, however, be used as
 an ar ument against my assertion, because the size of the
 partic es is so very different, and the situation altogether
 another one; especially as the ratio of the refractive indiees
 is very nearly unity by Christiansen’s experiments.
   If    we compare the mean of the complementary colours
  (tables 7 a and 10 a) with the values found without the use
 of a prism, we <U+FB01>nd deviations which exceed the accuracy of
 the measurements very much.        In the <U+FB01>rst case we combine
 the angles (a) of the nicol in the following way :
                                  tanzared + tani’agreen
                                          2
 In the second case we read an angle        of whose relation to
                                                           a',
the angles for and, age“, &c., we are in total ignorance,
as physiological questions arise here.      Hence we see theo
retically that  the values of both tables are probably different,
and the experiments con<U+FB01>rm this also.        Thus one   not able      is
to establish a law for white light, after having made observa—
tions of the plate at different parts of the spectrum only.
And        italso not permissible to draw an inference from
                is
Messerschmitt’s results (p. 884).       They only show that a
 deviation exists          ;    but its value   is    absolutely unknown.
                                         PART        II.
      If
       the variations between the results and the theory are
 given, as in the case ofother observers, only the law as whole             a
 can be considered.      It     however,is,  great advantage toa
 compare   the  single  elements  of  the  law  with the reality.

     (lonsidering that the probable error in the investigations
is 2 per cent. we see from these tables that the law of the cosi is
not valid.      The values of the angles of incidence for constants
are in the mean smaller than Lambert’s, a result which
 Seeliger and Wiener have also found.          The law of the cos c                                           is,
 on the other hand, perfectly correct, whilst Lambert’s law in
 totality naturally shows great deviations caused by the cos                                                  1'.

 <U+FB01>nds that the observations come the nearer to the law of the

      c
  the less normal re<U+FB02>exion they showed.          Well,     seems to me           it
 at the <U+FB01>rst start hardly reasonable to expect that plates which
  re<U+FB02>ect the light normally can follow           law which does not a
  take this into account at all            clear that the plates must

   results show that by this method of pressure one              able to                     is
   get   them  in the required  condition.    It     worthy   of  regardis
   that   it has not been possible yet to prove Lambert’s law
  theoretically as Ziillner and Seeli or have shown. But that
 is    in my view no reason why          ould not exist. As shown
                                                 it      s
  in the beginning, the very sensitive objective observations in
   the analogous case of radiant heat likewise con<U+FB01>rm the law

   not correct.
       Hence von Lomlnel’s law      not valid.  is There are number                           a

   of possibilities which can explain the deviations, and which
   may be mentioned here :—
      1. The law takes only rays into consideration which come
   from the inside of the plate.           Undoubtedly the diffuse re
   <U+FB02>exion of the surface is so great that it cannot be ignored.
      2. The refraction of the incident and reflected rays has
  been disregarded.         There can be no doubt that in reality the
  rays must be refracted as they pass from one medium into
  another and different one.
      3. von Lommel assumed that the same quantity of light
  l.dw.dp is diffused in all directions.        As regards the front half
  of the particles (looking on to the plate) the truth of this is
  fully established by my experiments for azimuths 0° and
  180°.    But for the hinder half there can be no doubt that
  the quantity of light diffused by it must be less than for the
 front half.
      Messerschmitt <U+FB01>nds fault with v. Lommel’s theory because
  the in<U+FB02>uence of polarization           is left out of account.       To
 support this assertion he mentions besides his own observa
 tions those of Violle‘ respecting polarization through emis
 sion. As the circumstances are so widely ditferent (molten
 silver being operated upon) this cannot be used as an argu
 ment.     At the outset       I showed that the polarizing of the
 light is not a quality of diffuse re<U+FB02>ecting substances ; when
 it occurs it is invariably the consequence of normal re<U+FB02>exion,
 which is a phenomenon quite apart from diffusion.                 Hence
 von Lommel was quite right in leaving polarization out of
the question.
                           Rnsumé or RESULTS.
  7  The investigations upon compressed powders of such thick
 ness that no perceptible light penetrated right through them
 lead to the following results :—
     1. Common light is not polarized by diffuse re<U+FB02>exion.
 (Lommel’s hypothesis.)
     2. The intensity of the light diffusely re<U+FB02>ected under the
angles +€ and -—e is the same, or it is independent of the
azimuth.      There is no normal re<U+FB02>exion. (Lommel’s hypo
                      '
thesis.)
     3. The law of emission by constant incidence is inde
pendent of colour, or the coef<U+FB01>cient of diffusion is independent
of the wave-length in the case of particles of the given size.
(Lommel’s hypothesis).
     4. A law for the intensity of re<U+FB02>ected               scattered light
cannot be symmetric in reference to z' and e.

angle    6 constant    and with varying angles of incidence i is
not proportional to the cos i, as Lambert assumes.
     6. The intensity of the di<U+FB01>'use re<U+FB02>ected          light with the
angle 2' constant and the angle a varying is proportional to
cos c, or Lambert’a law of emanation is strictly correct for
absolutely matt surfaces without any exception.
     7. The so-called law of the cosine (g=l‘2.ds.cosi cos c) is
not true in consequence of the deviations of the law of the
cos i.       The deviations range between 4'6 per cent. and
10 per cent.
     In conclusion      I  wish to return my best thanks to Prof.
Dr. von Lommel, who drew my attention to this interesting
branch of optics.         I  am also greatly indebted to Prof. Dr.
Seeliger and Prof. Dr. Graetz for the interest shown by
these gentlemen.

  XIV.      On the Theory    of  the Function of the Condenser  in an
    Induction-Coil.       By 1\'. R. JOHNSON, Filosojie Licentiat *.
     N   a  memoir “On the Function of the Condenser in an
        lnduction~Coil,” T. Mizuno has published in May 18981'
 a research on the relation between the capacity of the con
 denser, the intensity of the primary current, and the secondary
 spark-length.       His results can be theoretically explained as
 follows:—
     If the   condenser is inserted across the interruptor in the
 primary circuit, the extra current darts into the condenser ;
 and if the maximum of the potential-difference in the con
 denser is very great, a spark takes place in the interrupter,
 and thus the oscillations in the circuit are diminished by the
 spark. If the capacity of the condenser is very large, the
 maximum of potential-difference in the condenser and the
 interrupter is small and unable to make a spark.                Thus,
 the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the induction-coil is greatly increased by a
 little increasing capacity as far as the discharge by spark at
 the interrupter diminishes ; when this spark is entirely sup
 pressed, the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the induction-coil is greatest and
  the secondary spark-length a maximum.             The capacity of the
  primary condenser being further increased, the ef<U+FB01>ciency of
  the induction-coil       is diminished by the reason that the
  maximum potential-difference in the condenser is diminished

     By means of the equation (2), the maximum of spark

     The lengths of the secondary sparks, observed by M izuno,

XV.      011  the Passage of Argon through thin I'ilms         of India
                 rubber.     By Lord RAYLEIGH, I".R.S.*
             after the discovery of Argon it was thought desira_
SOON    ble  to compare the percolation of the gas through india
rubber with that of nitrogen, and Sir W. Roberts-Austen
kindly gave me some advice upon the subject. The proposal
was simply to allow atmospheric air to percolate through the
rubber film into a vacuum, after the manner of Graham, and
then to determine the proportion of argon.                 It will be re
membered that Graham found that the percentage of oxygen
was raised in this manner from the 21 of the atmosphere to
about 40.         At the time the experiment fell through, but
during the      last year   I  have carried it out with the assistance
of Mr. Gordon.
   The rubber balloon was <U+FB01>rst charged with dry boxwood
sawdust.        This rather troublesome operation was facilitated
by so mounting the balloon that with the aid of an air-pump
the external pressure could be reduced.                When suf<U+FB01>ciently
              '
distended the balloon was connected With a large Toepler
pump, into the vacuous head of which the diffused gases
could collect. At intervals they were drawn off in the usual
                     '
wa    .
   The di<U+FB02>’usion was not conducted under ideal conditions.
In order to make the most of the time, the apparatus was left
at w0rk during the night, so that by the morning the internal
pressure had risen to perhaps three inches of mercury.               The
proportion      of oxygen    in the gas collected  was  determined  from
time to time. It varied from 34 per cent. when the vacuum
was bad to about 39 per cent. when the vacuum was good.

  On Conductivities       of certain hfedia for a Steady Flam.    221
On an average it was estimated that the proportion of oxygen
would be about 37 per cent. of the whole. The total quantity
of di<U+FB01>'used gas reckoned at atmospheric pressure was about
300 c.c. per twenty-four hours.
    On removal from the pump the gas was introduced into an
inverted <U+FB02>ask standing over alkali, and with addition of
oxygen as required was treated with the electrical discharge
from a transformer in connexion with the public supply of
alternating current.    In this way the nitrogen was gradually
oxidized and absorbed.     Towards the close of operations the
 gas was transferred to a smaller vessel, where it was further
 sparked until 110 further contraction occurred, and the lines
 of nitrogen had disappeared from the spectrum. The excess
 of oxygen was then removed by phosphorus.
    It remains only to record the <U+FB01>nal <U+FB01>gures. The residue,
 free of oxygen and nitrogen, from 3205 c.c. of diffused gas
 was 39 c.c. The most instructive way of stating the result
 is perhaps to reckon the argon as a percentage, not of the
 whole, but of the nitrogen and argon only.     Of the 3205 c.c.
 total, 2020 c.c. would be nitrogen and argon, and of this the
 39 c.c. argon would be 1'93 per cent.       Since, according to
  Kellas (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. lix. p. 67, 1895), 100 c.c. of
 mixed atmospheric nitrogen and argon contains 1'19 per
 cent. of argon, we see that in the diffused gas the proportion
 of argon is about half as great again as in the atmosphere.
 Argon then passes the indiarubber <U+FB01>lm more readily than
 nitrogen, but not in such a degree as to render the diffusion
 process a useful one for the concentration of argon from the
atmosphere.

222     Dr. C. H. Lees on             the Cozuluctivities          of Heterogeneous
the plane equipotential surfaces in the media ; in the second
the parts of the two media consist of right prisms of rectan
gular cross'section, one dimension of the cross-section being
in<U+FB01>nitely great compared to the other, and the length of the
prism being again in<U+FB01>nitely great compared to this greatest
cross-sectional dimension, placed with their edges either
parallel or perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces.  The
difference of order of magnitude of the three dimensions of
the elementary parts of the two media in this last case is
necessary in order that the disturbance of the <U+FB02>ow near the
edges of the prism may be neglected in the calculation.
   These three cases, although of considerable interest, have
only a limited application on account of the restrictions in
troduced to enable the calculations to be carried out ; and I
propose here to consider the case of a medium formed of an
equal number of in<U+FB01>nitely long prisms of square cross-section,
of two media having conductivities k, and [1:2, arranged as
shown in <U+FB01>g. 1, and bounded by two parallel equipotential

226                Mr. S. H. Burhury on the Law of
six times as well as the other. The curves have been drawn
by an approximate method which depends on the fact that
near each angular point A, U, the equation which tranf'orms
the kite-shaped <U+FB01>gure of <U+FB01>g. 3 into the square of <U+FB01>g. 2 takes
the form z'=Az". The accuracy of the diagrams will therefore
be least near the centre of each square ABCD, where the
position of an equipotential line may be in error by 10 per cent.
of its distance from the next one.
   Professor Lamb has pointed out to me that by superposing
a second <U+FB02>ux, the direction of which is at right angles to the
<U+FB01>rst, on the <U+FB01>rst, a flux with stream and equipotential lines
through the centres of the squares parallel to their sides is
obtained. The conductivity of the medium for this <U+FB02>ux will
be readily seen to be given again by the formula

the conductivity has the above value, the conductivity of the

 kinetic energy.     For it is easy to construct a system in which
  that is not true.    For instance, suppose two parallel <U+FB01>xed
 elastic planes, P and Q, and PQ a common normal.            Let m
 and M be two elastic Spheres of unequal masses, each having
 its centre in the line PQ. Initially let m be touching the
 plane P and be projected in direction PQ.          Simultaneously
 let M be touching the plane Q and be projected in direc
 tion QP. The two spheres will collide, having their line of
  centres in PQ, with the point of contact, say, at R.          the      If
momenta are equal and opposite, the two spheres will, after
 collision, retrace their respective courses, will rebound nor
mally from the two planes, and will again collide at the same
place, and so on for ever.       Since the momenta are equal and
the masses unequal,     the  kinetic  energies are unequal.    Yet
the motion is stationary.      The condition of stationary motion
is then not a su<U+FB02>icient foundation for the theorem of equal
partition of energy.     What further condition is necessary or
suf<U+FB01>cient ?
    It is generally understood that the theorem is proved in the
Kinetic Theory of Gases, the simplest form of' which may be
stated thus :—
    A very great number of elastic spheres are moving in a
bounded space, and freely by their encounters or collisions
exchanging energy with one another.              Let no forces act
except during collisions      between   two spheres, or between a
sphere and the bounding surface, supposed perfectly elastic.
Let f(u, v, w) do do dw or   f.   du do dw be at any instant the
number of spheres m whose component velocities lie within
the limits

Similarly, let F(U, V, W) itU dV dW or F . dU dV JW be the

  If m   andM, having these velocities, are properly situated
with respect to one another, they will within the time dt after
the given instant collide with each other, and assume new
velocities denoted by the accented letters &c. U’ &c. where

ungeordnet.” But the working assumption which he actually
makes use of in the special case, as a deduction from his
general assumption, is the same as that used by Dr. Watson
and other writers, namely that, regarding                 f
                                                      and F as the
chances that a molecule shall have velocities between the
limits (1) or (2), these chances are independent of the relative
position of the molecules—at least that this is the case for
molecules approaching collision.       Hence          f
                                                and F bein inde

it is proved that

                      F = Ce-m<m+v=+wn;
and therefore mu53=MUe &c., which is the law.
   But the question arises whether the state of things
assumed by Boltzmann to exist, from which the theorem of
equal partition of energy follows as a mathematical deduction,
can exist, and continue to exist, in fact in a <U+FB01>nite system of
molecules left to their own mutual actions for in<U+FB01>nite time
undisturbed from without.
   Ithink Lord Rayleigh’s       argument, p. 109              et seq.,   requires
some assumptions :—
  (1) Systems on the same path move           independently of one
         another.
   (2) Systems cannot exchange paths; or if they can we
         must assume a law of interchange.              .
   I think there may be other constants besides E, e. y. if two
elastic spheres with velocities a1, n2, &c. collide, ulu.) + vva + wlw2
is constant as well as E.
   Does not the method prove too much? namely that not
merely the law of equal partition (p. 115), but in effect the
distribution 6*” must hold for all states of matter.

                  Electromagnetic Theory of Light.                 ‘229
 magnetic wave-surface.        The present writer (Phil. Mag. xlii.
  Sept. 1896, p. 224) pointed out that it is an orthogonal pro
 jection—in two different ways—of the Fresnel surface.                I
 do not know of other writers who have contributed to this
 particular department ; but       I suspect that this is due to my
  ignorance, and not to the absence of literature.
     The following statements are either explicitly made in,
  or are obviously deducible from, the text of Basset’s ‘ Physical
  Optics.’    In that particular form of Maxwell’s Electro
 Magnetic Theory of Light in which the media are supposed
  to be non-magnetic, we have exactly the same analytical con
 ditions, so far as lane waves in a non-absorbent medium are
 concerned, as in t ree other theories of light, viz.: (1) Fresnel’s
  (2) MacCullagh’s, (3) Lord Kelvin’s (contractile aether).         To
 be more precise :—(1) The electromagnetic displacement, D,
 is the exact mathematical equivalent of Fresnel’s displacement;
 (2) the electromagnetic M.M.F., H (or, what is the same in
 the present case, the magnetic induction B), is the exact
 mathematical equivalent of MacGullagh’s displacement; (3)
 the electromagnetic E.M.F., E, is the exact mathematical
  equivalent of Lord Kelvin’s displacement.
     In the second and third cases the mathematical equivalence
 extends, not only to the properties of plane waves within a medium,
 but also to the boundary conditions between two media.        4 his is
 true in the <U+FB01>rst case also, in so far that the laws ofre/lea'ion and
 refraction at the boundary of isotropic transparent media,
 which result from the two theories, are the same.
     If only for this extraordinary property of being mathe
 matically equivalent to so many distinct and celebrated
 theories, the electromagnetic theory is worthy of study.
    It is to be remarked that it is only a particular form
 (certainly a very general particular form) of the electro
 magnetic theory which has these wide and exact mathe
 matical analogies with other theories. Mr. Heaviside has
taught us to look, in Electromagnetism, for a symmetrical
 dual interpretation of results, the electric and magnetic
 quantities providing the duality.       It may be anticipated that
in the general electromagnetic theory of light, insight will be
obtained by adhering to the symmetrical dual interpretation.
    This <U+FB01>rst part of the present paper is mainly concerned with
geometrical properties of the wave-surface exhibiting this
symmetry.       Incidentally a-new presentation of the funda
mental analysis will be given.
    Four geometrical theorems are enunciated, and immediately
after the enunciation of each, some of its obvious geometrical
consequences are detailed.       The proofs of the propositions are
then given.

   Terminology and Malian—Intensity is understood to mean
energy per unit volume. D, E, B,H each+(intensity)il will be
denoted by 8, e, B, 'y respectively.          If it is thought desirable
to give names to these vectors, they may be called the quasi
unit displacement, the quasi-unit E.M.F., &c. The terms
D-oid, E-oid, &c. used in Prop. 1. below may be regarded as
convenient abbreviations of displacement-ellipsoid, E.M.F.
ellipsoid, &c. The vector of ray-velocity and the index-vector
will be denoted by p, a- respectively; that is to say. the mag
nitude of p        the velocity of propagation of a ray parallel to p,
and the magnitude of o' is the reciprocal of the corresponding
u'are-<U+FB01>'ont velocity, 0 itself being perpendicular to the wave
front and in the direction of its motion. The locus of the
extremities of p and a, supposed drawn from a given origin 0,
are, as usual, called the wave- and index-surfaces respectively.
To <U+FB01>x the ideas, we may suppo=e the unit of length to be
 1 cm., and the unit ot'time to be 1/(3 X 101°) of a second. Thus
in vacuo both wave- and index-surfaces will be spheres each
of about 1 cm. radius.
    Prop. 1. The loci of the extremities of 3, s, B, y, supposed
all drawn from O, are elli soicls with common centre 0. These
ellipsoids will be called t e D-oid, E-oid, B-oid, and H-oid
respectively.
    Prop.   11.   The D-oid and E-ozd are reciprocal polars; and
3   and   e   are corresponding      vectors of them.        [836: — 1,

 of the index-surface, and that H and B are perpendicular to
 all the other vectors.
    By Prop. II. it will be noticed that not more than three of
 the six surfaces, wave-, D-oid, &c., are independent.                As a
 matter of fact      two,  and    but   two,  are. These may be taken
 as the E-oid and E-oid (or as the D-oid and B-oid); for when
 these are given, the D-oid and B-oid are given by Prop. 11.,
and the wave-surface and index-surface by Prop. IV.
    Prop. 1V. e and 'y are, in direction, conjugate to       one another,
with regard to both the E-oid and H-oid.
    8 and B are, in direction, conjugate to one another,     'u-ith regard
 to both the D-oid and B-m'lt.
    This proposition (when the E-oid and H-oid are given)
 su<U+FB02>ices    to determine all of the four 6, ry, 8, ,8 when the
 direction of any one is given.             For the ellipsoids serve by
 Prop. I. to give the magnitude of each when its direction is
 known, so that it is only necessary to determine the direction
 of each.        Suppose the direction of e given: since 7 is
 conjugate     to s with regard to the E-oid, 'y is con<U+FB01>ned to one
 plane; since it is also conjugate with regard to the H-oid,
 it is con<U+FB01>ned to another plane. Its direction therefore is
 determinate.        [Its sense may have either of the two values

p=V€'y, the senses will correspond to propagations of disturb

                                        When 6 and y are known, 8 and
,8 are known by Prop. II.
    Also, when 6 and 'y are known, p is known; since p=Very,
and also 0', since 0=V818.             Thus when the direction of any
one   of the four  e, y, 8, ,8  is  known, all six vectors are known.
    But Prop. IV. also suf<U+FB01>ces to determine all six when the
direction of p or of a- is known, and gives us geometrical
constructions for the wave- and index-surfaces.
    Thus if the direction of p is given, the plane of e and 7

    By taking all possible directions for p, this gives a geo
 metrical construction for the wave-surface.                 From the con
 struction it is clear that the surface forms a double sheet with
 centre at O. Fresnel’s construction is clearly what the pre
 sent construction degenerates into when one of the ellipsoids
 is a sphere.
    Of course similar remarks apply to the index-surface as
 depending on the D-oid and B-oid.

 II.    Reflexion and Refraction at the Surface of Crystals, treated
             by a Theorem of Sir Wm. Rowan Hamilton.
      In  his ‘ Elements of Quaternions’ (4.23 (12) in 1st edition,
 probably this important theorem will not escape the editor of
 the 2nd edition) Hamilton has             roved a theorem of such
  singular beauty and ease of application in particular cases,
 that    I think it well worth calling attention to. This seems
 the    more   necessary as it appears to have been overlooked by
  subsequent writers.
      His treatment is—probably necessarily, based as it is on
  MacCullagh’s theory —somewhat complex, whereas the treat
  ment on the electromagnetic theory is little more than an
  interpretation of the fundamental equations. He treats only
  of the case where a ray in an isotropic medium is incident
  on the face of a crystal, and where the polarization of the
  incident light is such that there is but one refracted ray.       On
  the electromagnetic theory it is just as easy to suppose both
  media to be crystalline, and to allow the incident polarization
  to be arbitrary.
      There will in this case be one incident ray, two refracted
  rays, and two re<U+FB02>ected rays, <U+FB01>ve in all as against Hamilton’s
   (and MacCullagh’s,         since in this particular      Hamilton is
   following MacCullagh) three.

                             P,  P1,; P2'1 Pl”, P2”,
 and similarly for the other vectors involved.
      The theorem is true only for the usual form of electro
 magnetic theory, i. e. for the case when both media are
 assumed non-magnetic.            It is to be remembered that this form
 is apparently as satisfactory as the more veneral form in
 explaining all known optical phenomena. The following is
 the theorem :—
     If we   suppose mechanical forces
                                   I        I

they    will reduce   to a couple whose plane is parallel to the face.
         <U+FB01>gures    6 and 7 below.]
 [See
     Before giving the proof some remarks are desirable.                If
the incident wave-front and the two wave-surfaces (centre at
point of incidence) be given, by Huyghens’s construction
we know the <U+FB01>ve wave-fronts.               These fronts, supposed drawn
touching       the   wave-surfaces      at  the appropriate points, all
contain the line of intersection of the incident front with the
face, or as we shall call it the trace of that front on the face.
Since the fronts are known the directions of the M.M.F.’s
are known, and it only remains to <U+FB01>nd their magnitudes.
These M.M.F.’s, drawn as described in the enunciation,
are in the corresponding fronts, and therefore all intersect
one line, the trace.
    Thus when the circumstances of incidence are given the
four magnitudes of the M.M.F.’s of the refracted and re<U+FB02>ected
waves are required.         The theorem gives <U+FB01>ve conditions, but
one of     them   is  always satis<U+FB01>ed by reason of the <U+FB01>ve vectors
all intersecting one line. The theorem is in every case not
only necessary, but suf<U+FB01>cient to determine the unknown
quantities.

chloride       brought in contact with the paper, whilst ordinary
               is
barium chloride under the same conditions produces no effect.
   The radiferous compounds necessary for the production of ozone
are all very active and all luminous.     The phenomenon seems more
nearly related to the radioactivity than to the luminosity.      Thus
very luminous carbonate of radium produces less ozone than                                                             a a

 manifests itself is not blackened in the reducing <U+FB02>ame, whence we
conclude that it does not contain any lead.
     The change produced in barium platinocyanide by the radium
 rays is probably also a chemical e<U+FB02>'ect.           When submitted to the
action of the radium rays, barium platinocyanide begins to grow
 yellow, then it becomes brown, and this brown variety is less sen—
 sitive to the excitation of <U+FB02>uorescence.           To restore the platinu
cyanide to its original condition it is su<U+FB02>icient to expose it to sun
light. This phenomenon is the same as that which has been
described for the Rontgen rays by M. Villard *.
     When a layer of barium platinocyanide is placed in the dark
above a, layer of a radioactive salt, the platinocyanide               becomes
strongly luminous under the in<U+FB02>uence of the Becquerel rays; but
 little by little the platinocyanide is converted into the brown
variety and the luminosity gradually diminishes.             On exposing the
system to light, the platinooyanide is partially restored, and if
then the system is brought back into the dark the light emitted is
again very brilliant.
     Thus is realized the synthesis of a phosphorescent body with
long duration of phosphorescence by means of a <U+FB02>uorescent body
and a radioactive body.
    M. Giesel has prepared a raditerous platinocyanide of barium,
very luminous at the moment of its preparation, which under the
action of its own Becquerel rays is converted into the less luminous
brown variety          1'.

a   solution which has been saturated when hot, the crystals are
colourless at the moment of deposit.           Little by little these crystals
acquire    a rose colour which becomes gradually more pronounced.
This coloration appears the more rapidly and                the more intense
                                                                  is

   ON THE CHEMICAL        ACTION OF THE X-RAYS.          BY P. VILLABD.
    The interesting results which M. and Mme. Curie * have lately
 made known will perhaps render the following observation, which
 I have not ventured to publish before, of some interest.
    When a Crookes tube has been in action for some time, the
glass of the bulb acquires, as is well known, a very marked violet
tint over the part above the plane of the anticathode, that is to say,
on the side where the latter receives the cathode-rays.        This region
of the bulb is struck at the same time by the x-rays and by the
diffused cathode-rays ; the following experiment enables us to
determine to which of the two radiations the action observed should
be attributed.
    In a focus-tube,    I surrounded the anticathode by a wide tube,
either of ordinary glass or of <U+FB02>int glass, the inner wall of which
could be protected against the cathode—rays by very thin aluminium
leaf, very transparent to the m-rays. A silhouette cut out of opaque        _
metal, platinum for example, could be interposed at will in the path
of these latter.    After action had gone on for about half an hour I
obtained the following results:
    When there is no aluminium leaf the tube becomes strongly
blackened if it is of <U+FB02>int glass, and acquires the bluish tint with
metallic re<U+FB02>exion of <U+FB02>int glass that has been reduced.         When it is
of ordinary glass, which always contains a little lead, it only becomes
brown.     This is the ordinary cathodic reduction, similar to that
produced in a reducing <U+FB02>ame.         The interposition of the aluminium
leaf, stopping the cathode-rays, does away altogether with this re
duction; and then a violet coloration is obtained, both with <U+FB02>int
glass and with ordinary glass. This modi<U+FB01>cation is evidently due
to the x-rays; it is only produced above the plane of the anti
cathode, and if a little plate of platinum be interposed in the path
of these rays, the region protected by it remains uncoloured.            It
                                   I
was to this phenomenon that alluded in a discussion at the Easter
meeting of the Société de Physique, when I said that it was strictly
speaking possible to obtain a radiograph by taking for the sensitive
compound a simple glass plate.
    This transformation of glass or <U+FB02>int glass is certainly due to oxids
ation, as it is equally well obtained on warming the <U+FB02>int glass in a
strongly oxidizing <U+FB02>ame.        Very probably the violet coloration is
produced    by  manganese;     this  metal, in its fully oxidized combi—
nations, is known to colour glass violet.
    These results moreover establish an analogy between the .r-rays
and the radiations emitted by radioactive substances.            For this
reason [ propose to repeat the foregoing experiments, but substi
tuting for ordinary glass 8. silicate containing, in considerable
quantity, some substance whose oxidation will be easy to recognize.

                           By  J.  H. JEANS *.
                                 PART   I.
  §  1.           present paper is principally concerned with the
        THE    appearance of light which accompanies the dis
  charge ot' electricity through a rare<U+FB01>ed gas.
                                    “
                                                       I have attempted
 to show that Prof. Thomson’s          Theory of the Conduction of
 Electricity              Gases by Charged Ions ”T is capable of
               through
 supplying an exp anation of the striations, and of most of the
 other phenomena observed in connexion with the discharge
 through a vacuum-tube.
     Considering the case of a one-dimensional discharge be
 tween two parallel and in<U+FB01>nite plates, Thomson has arrived
 at a differential equation connecting y, the semi-square of the
 electric intensity at a point, with .z', a coordinate measured
 along the line of                   It is impossible to solve this
 equation in <U+FB01>nite discharge.
                        terms,   nt Thomson has drawn a gra h,
 giving an approximate value of y for every value of w, t is
 graph satisfying the differential equation at every point, and
also the two terminal conditions at the electrodes.
    In the same paper Thomson has also given a second graph,
in which are plotted out the result of some measurements by
Graham on the potential gradient in a vacuum-tube.                 The
comparison of the graph thus deduced from experiment with
          *  Communicated by Prof. J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.

the graph calculated from theory is therefore of interest, and
it. is at once obvious that there are considerable differences
 between the two curves.
    In particular the theoretical graph is convex to the axis of
m at every point, while the experimental graph shows con
cavity ovcr two regions of the axis.
    Now when a graph for y is drawn from measurements
actually taken from a tube through which a discharge is
 passing, a comparison of the                   so obtained with the
glowing     tube  shows   that   the    graph
                                       disc arge is accompanied by
 luminosity at those parts of the tube at which the graph is
concave to the axis, and at no others.              There are also, as
 Thomson points out           c. ante, p. 267), theoretical reasons
                                   (I.
which lead us to suppose that luminosity               accompanied by
                                                             is
concavity of the graph.
    Thus the graph at which Thomson arrives, being convex at
every point, precludes the possibility of luminosity in any
part of the tube;         shows the distribution of electric force
                             it
in non-luminous discharge.

 light and dark bands occurring alternately and at regular
 intervals, except in the nei hblourhood of the electrodes.
 'Ihomson has obtained         discharge through
                                    a                     tube <U+FB01>fty feet
                                                                  a
in length, and observed     that  the  whole  tube, with   the exception
of    a few inches near the cathode, was <U+FB01>lled with these
striations.
    It appears therefore as            the true system of electrical
                                           if
 equations, account being taken of the volume equations only,
 without reference to the boundary conditions, ought to lead
to an in<U+FB01>nite system of striations           in fact, the

    It must be borne in mind that Thomson’s raph only one              is
 out of an in<U+FB01>nite series of curves, all of whi<U+FB01>i are represented
 by the same differential equations, and this leads us to con
 sider <U+FB01>rstly, whether any other member of this family of
 curves bears any resemblance to Graham’s experimental
 curve    ;and, secondly, whether any member can consist of                  a
 series of regular waves, and so correspond to                    periodic
                                                                       a
solution.
    Now      will appear in the course of the present paper that
              it
 there     considerable probability that both of these questions
          is
 must be answered in the negative. If this                  so,    follows
                                                                  is    it
 that the complete explanation cannot be implicity contained
  in Thomson’s differential equation; in order to arrive at                  it,

 new physical considerations will have to be introduced, which
 were not allowed for in forming this equation.
    § 2. Our analysis seems to indicate that there is only one
 explanation possible which is consistent with the main facts
 of the theory of conduction by ions, and this, stated brie<U+FB02>y,
 is somewhat as follows :—
    Thomson’s equation gives a solution for the case of steady
 motion which not only is mathematically possible, but is the
 only solution which satis<U+FB01>es the assumed conditions through
out. This steady motion, however,             under certain circum
                                                   is,
stances, unstable, just as the steady motion to which the
hydrodynamical equations lead for the case of liquid <U+FB02>owing
through an ori<U+FB01>ce          isunstable. And, just as the liquid              is
known in nature to break up into           succession of small drops,
                                           a
so the discharge in        avacuum-tube breaks up, under suitable
conditions, into      a  succession   of small discharges, each dis
charge forming        asingle striation.
     A   mathematical explanation of this may be given in the
following way :—
    It' we suppose that Thomson’s equations are absolutely true
over all ranges of the variables, then there          only oneform
                                                              is
of discharge possible, and this              non-luminous.
                                              is              When,
however, the volume-density of the ions becomes inde<U+FB01>nitely
great,      it obvious that these equations can no longer hold
                 is
without modi<U+FB01>cation.            It    impossible to get an in<U+FB01>nite
                                     is
volume-density of electricity in nature, and this fact            not  is
contained in the equations. We are therefore compelled to
admit the existence of new forces which were not allowed for
in the original equations these forces are negligible until the
                                ;
volume-density         the ions reaches a certain large limit, but
                      of
they    then come   into   action, and are sa<U+FB01>cient to prevent the
volume-density from ever actually becoming in<U+FB01>nite.            These
forces may be of the nature of           repulsion between
                                          a                        of
ions which have approached inde<U+FB01>nitely near to eac pairs       other,
or,   we imagine the ions to be bodies of <U+FB01>nite size, they will
     if
consist of the forces of elasticity which prevent collection of    a
such bodies from being compressed into an inde<U+FB01>nitely small
s    ace.
 pBut, without making any assumptions about the nature of
these forces beyond those laid down in the sentence in italics,
it   can be shown that the existence of such forces makes
    ossible a second type of solution, which essentially different
                                                         is
liom that considered by Thomson, and that this solution, inter
preted physically, predicts the existence of       system of       a
striations in the middle of   tube, which may be expected

     § 3. The present section consists        of an explanation of the
notation to be used, and a summary of those parts of Thomson’s
paper which are essential to the theory.              We are considering
a discharge in perfectly pure gas, between two parallel and
in<U+FB01>nite plates.
     Let  .z- be a coordinate measured      along the line of
 the    positive axis of .z' being drawn from the anode               dischargp,
                                                                            to t e
cathode.        The electricalintensity at any point will be denoted
 by X. The positive and negative ions are supposed to move
 in opposite directions with velocities proportional to X
 (Thomson, 1. c. ante, p. 253). These velocities will be denoted
 by    le    and IQX respectively, the former being parallel to the
 positive axis of a". The number of positive ions per unit
 volume is n], and of negative ions 112. Of these a certain
 number recombine, and this number is supposed to be anlnz,
 since, other things being equal, it will be proportional to the
 product 11111,. In the same unit volume, a certain number of
 molecules become dissociated, and these produce q ions of
 each sort per unit time.
      No assumption is as yet made as to the way in which q and
 a depend on other quantities ; but from their de<U+FB01>nition they
 must be positive quantities at every point of the line of
 discharge,

disposition of the curves in that part of the plane of p, y With
which we are concerned.
    Any curve starting from A and meeting OG (<U+FB01>g. 1) must
clearly be an arched curve terminating in B. For the con
ditions already laid down prevent it from meeting either the hue
OB or are GEB of the parabola, or again from bending back
and recrossing 0G.      The limiting curves of this system are on
the one hand the axis of p, and on the other hand the curve
which actually passes through G. At no point on any
curve of this system can y reach a value greater than 0G;

   There is a second system, consisting of curves which pass
through A but do not meet 0G. These must therefore meet
AG, be bent away from the axis of y after crossing AG, and
<U+FB01>nally meet AA'.
   It can be shown that these curves cannot attain to an
in<U+FB01>nite value of y before meeting the line AA'. For we can
<U+FB01>nd the shape of the curves which <U+FB01>ll up that part of the
p, y lane which lies between the lines AA' and BB', and for
which y is in<U+FB01>nite.  The differential equation of these curves
is seen by equation (9) to be
                                1        klk,        dp_

and this represents   system of parabolas which are convex to
                            a
the axis of p.  Since these parabolas cannot be members of
that system of curves which we are now discussing, we
conclude that there must be some point A’, in the line AA',
beyond which this system never reaches.    As the curves of                            a
system cannot cross one another,      must be the curve that
                                                      it
actually passes through             G
                           which reaches this limiting point A'.

               is       maximum limit to the value of

                                     y, = AA’.
   There    an exactly               similar
               B is                                      of curves passing

through    and meetin                    BG.        For this
                                                          system also there
is
 a   maximum limit to           t   e    value of y, given by
                                    y. = BB’.
     The   s   stem    of curves which pass through     and do not            B,
meet   B       ,   must consist of the curves which meet 0G.  This

                  Striated Electrical Discharge.              253
system is therefore identical with the <U+FB01>rst system which we
              namely, the series of arches which join the points
Zonigidered,
  ,     .
    The remainder of the part of the p, y plane with which we
are dealing is <U+FB01>lled up by a system of curves which meet 0G
above G, each curve having its lowest point on 0G.            For
curves of this type there is an inferior limit to the value of y,
and this is the value yo already found in equation (11).
    The curves in the p, y plane are thus seen to fall into four
classes.    These are represented in their essential features by
                               Fig. 2.

referred to by the numbers in this diagram.
    The limiting curves are the two curves AGB’ , A’ GB, which
are drawn in thick lines in the diagram. These curves intersect
in G and divide the plane into four regions, in each of which
lie all the curves in one of the four classes.
    § 6. Let us now examine to what extent the arrangement
of curves found in the last section will be altered if we replace
the assumption that q and a are constant by the more general
assumption that they are positive quantities which vary
with .
    Friim the equations of   § 4, it follows at once  that:
    (i.) The curve (a) is no longer a parabola, but is still a
curve which passes through the points A and B, and is sym
metrical about the same axis as before.

    (ii.) At all points adjacent to the line y=0, the sign to be
given to                in drawing          the system        of curves    remains the

in<U+FB01>nite.
                                 d],
    (iii.) Hence, since                must change sign in crossing either
                                 (E
the curve (a) or the axis of y,     follows that the curve (a)
                                                   it
must cross the positive axis of an odd number of times.

   (iv.) The curve (0:) cannot meet the lines AA', BB' in any
points except A and B.
   From this we deduce that the new curve (0:) consists
primarily of an arch through     and                         B,
                                          and secondly, of any

number of closed curves either inside or outside the arch.

directions of the shading adjacent to the arch through AB, as
also the direction of the shading at in<U+FB01>nity, must remain
unaltered.
   The four types of curves of which the existence has already
been discovered will therefore continue to exist in the new
graph in the IM/ plane. The general appearance of the new
graph will, however, depend on whether the curve (a) cuts the
axis of    once or more than once.
             y
   For the effect of introducing into this locus new closed
curves which do not meet the axis of y,          simply    twisting

of the lines already in the graph, and this introduces no
essentially different type of curve.    But the effect of admitting
into this locus new closed curves which do out the axis of y,
or of allowing the original arch to meet this axis more than
once, will be the introduction of an entirely new type of
curve into the p,     graph, and this will consist of a series of
                          y
closed curves.     Fig. will, hope, make the truth of these

   It might, however, be urged that near the electrodes the
volume-equations of § 3 give place to other and different
volume-equations ; and if this were so, there is nothing to
prevent all the conditions of the problem from being satis<U+FB01>ed.
   Under these circumstances, the examination of whether
closed curves can or can not occur in the p, y graph becomes
a matter of importance.       The necessary and su<U+FB01>icient con
dition that closed curves shall be an impossibility is that the
curve (a) shall only meet the axis of y in one point, and this
condition will in future be spoken of as condition A.

 256               Mr.    J.   H. Jeans      on the
    We have seen that if condition A is ful<U+FB01>lled all the curves
 which constitute the p, g graph come under one or other of
 the four classes represented in <U+FB01>g. 2.
    We shall in the following sections con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to the
 consideration of these four types of curves, and it will appear
 that if these four types alone exist, there is only one type of
 solution possible in addition to that already arrived at by
Thomson.
    Even if condition A is not satis<U+FB01>ed this alternative type
 of solution will still be possible, but, as has already been
 pointed out, we are no longer justi<U+FB01>ed in asserting that it is
the only alternative.    A second alternative becomes possible
on assuming that the gas near the electrodes is in an
abnormal state.
    § 8. From our knowledge of the graph in the p, g plane it
is easy to deduce the corresponding graph in the plane of .z', y.
An intersection of a p, g curve with the axis of p will give
rise to a maximum or minimum value for g on the corre
sponding .r, g curve, and an intersection with the curve (a)
will give rise to a point of inflexion.      The new graph, in
strictness, consists  of a doubly  in<U+FB01>nite system of curves, but
it will be suf<U+FB01>cient to consider the system as singly in<U+FB01>nite,
a single curve corresponding to each curve in the 1),     plane.
A second in<U+FB01>nity is then obtained by moving each curve
parallel to itself along the axis of .z'.
    The curves in the plane of .z', y fall into four classes
corresponding to the four classes of curves in the p, g plane.
   The curves of the <U+FB01>rst class will each give rise to a single
arch in the plane of w, y ; this arch stands on the axis of w,
and is on the positive side of this axis. Since we are now
considering the case in which q and :z are no longer constants,
this arch may or may not have points of in<U+FB02>exion.         Every
curve of this system leaves the axis of a' at an angle
           and   meets    it again at       an angle
tan-(£72),

 same curve, that curve must be of the fourth class.
     § The question which now suggests itself the following:—
         9.                                                                          is
If we plot out the actual graph for along any discharge,                    3
does the curve so obtained necessarily coincide with         single                               a
curve of the in<U+FB01>nite series typi<U+FB01>ed in <U+FB01>g. 4?
   If this question must be answered in the af<U+FB01>rmative, the
graph must, as we have seen in the last section, be a curve of
the fourth class, terminated by the points a and            This                             B.       is
in fact the only solution which satis<U+FB01>es equation (8) at
every point, satis<U+FB01>es the assumed boundary conditions at
the electrodes, and makes n1, n2, and      positive at every point.     y
It   is  solution of this type that
          a                             arrived at in Thomson’s    is
 a      er.
             alternative to this solution would lie in making
     lllhe onl
up   agrap discontinuously out of       number of the curves or         a
parts of curves shown in <U+FB01>g. 4. We are therefore led to
inquire whether        ever possible to pass from one curve to
                               it   is
another without violating physical conditions of continuity.
   Since the velocity of the ions must be continuous, .z', and

                   Striated Electrical Discharge.                               259
therefore y, must be continuous.               If
                                     we suppose that 10 also
is to be continuous we  are reduced to keeping on the same
curve, for two curves can never touch each other, since by
equation (8) the curvature depends only on y and p.
                                                                                 9
                                                                                (11/
  The     effect   of making   p    discontinuous            is   to     make

become in<U+FB01>nite.        If, then, equation (8)           is not to be violated,
y must be zero at that point.                _
  An alternative solution can therefore be obtained by build-'
ing up the graph of y out of pieces from the curves in <U+FB01>g. 4,
care being taken to only pass from one curve to another on
the axis.  The solution so obtained is such that the electric
force and velocities of the ions are continuous, and it satis<U+FB01>es
all the mathematical equations.
   It   is,
         moreover, obvious that there          only one type of
                                                        is
solution of this kind possible.     This consists of any number
of arched curves of the <U+FB01>rst class placed end to end and
terminated by    curve of the second class at the anode, and
                   a
curve of the third class at the cathode; the points                       a’      ,8' a

  § 10. When we attempt to interpret this second solution, we
are immediately confronted with the fact that
                                                                  a is

260                   Mr. J.  H. Jeans    on the
as  B, O, or D in <U+FB01>g. 5, we should not only have an in<U+FB01>nite
volume-density of ions, but also all the ions would be at rest.
    It has, however, been already pointed out (§ 2) that as y
becomes inde<U+FB01>nitely small, the equation from which our
solution has been derived ceases to hold. New forces come
into play, with the result that the graph representing the
actual values of y ceases any longer to satisfy the differential
equation which holds elsewhere.            And if these forces are
forces which prevent the volume-density of ions from becoming
in<U+FB01>nite (as must be the case if the ions are of <U+FB01>nite size),
the change in the di<U+FB02>'erential equation will be of such a nature
as to prevent the graph from ever meeting the axis.
    Let us imagine that 07 is some small value of y, such that
these forces do not produce any effect till y falls below a
certain value 1], but that for values of y less than 1) the
equations of § 3 cease to hold.

theory, but     h0pe in the second part of this paper to show

parts, unless the light traverses a path coinciding with an
optic axis of the crystal, or unless the path coincides with the
major or minor axis of the elliptic section of the wave~surface.
1n the former case, both the velocities and the directions of the
rays coincide; in the latter, although the velocities are
different, the paths are the same. That these are but two
special cases of an in<U+FB01>nite number in which the paths of the
ordinary and extraordinary rays coincide was <U+FB01>rst shown                                                     by

 refractin    medium, or else it is so small that it nearly coin
 cides wit an axis of the elliptic wave-front.
    The geometrical construction for obtaining the coincidence
 of the two rays is simple, and follows at once from Huyghens’
 principle.    Let, in <U+FB01>g. 1, the ellipse and circle represent a
 principal  section  of Fresnel’s wave-surface, and let AOB be
                                  Fig.   1.
the surface of a crystal.    If Om is an ordinary ray, we <U+FB01>nd
the corresponding extraordinary ray Om’ by drawing a tan
gent to the circle at m and, from where it cuts the surface at
S, a tangent to the ellipse at m’.    But if it is assumed that
the two rays are to coincide, say in the line Om’, then tan
gents drawn from the intersections of this line with the circle
at m” and with the ellipse at 111' will meet in some point S’.
Evidently, if S' be connected with O as a new surface of the
crystal, all the conditions of Huyghens’ principle are satis<U+FB01>ed.
To obtain the ray in the bounding medium a. circle of proper
radius On is drawn ; a tangent from S' to n gives the direction
of this incident ray On.
   If,  then, OS' is the surface of a crystal, an incident my 10
 will traverse the crystal undivided in direction along the line
 Or, and the angle of refraction will obey the simple sine law.
 The locus of the points S’ gives all possible solutions of the
                                '
 problem.
    Figs. 2—6 show this locus for the three principal sections of
 a biaxal crystal and for both a negative and a positive uniaxal
 cr stal.  The curves are symmetrical about both axes and
 are of the eighth degree.    There are two sets : the full lines
 being found by drawing                 on the same side of the
centre, and the dotted curvestangents
                                  y tangents from opposite sides.
For the uniaxal crystal a branch of the curve becomes a
pair of straight lines perpendicular to the optic axis. The
dotted curves are only approximately correct and are drawn,
for convenience, much closer        the centre of the <U+FB01>gure than

      These points, since a> b>c, are essentially real, and there
are in each case four intersections with the axes; two, at
 least, must be singular points, and if the curve of the locus
does not cross an axis all four have this property.          They and
the asymptotes        have been located approximately on the
 diagrams.
      An examination of the <U+FB01>gures shows that a line through
 the origin of coordinates may cut the locus in four pairs of
 points.      Since this line forms the trace of the surface of the
  crystal with a coordinate plane, 'there are, at most, three
  directions in which the ordinary and extraordinary rays
  coincide for this single section.         There are, of course, an
  in<U+FB01>nite number of these sections.        It should be noted that the
  two intersections with the horizontal branch on the right.
  must be taken with the intersection with the vertical branch
  on the left, and vice versa. If the surface of the crystal is cut
  tangent to the horizontal branch of the locus, two directions
   of coincidence are possible; for greater angles, only one.
   With a uniaxal crystal one of these solutions is due to a ray
   along the optic axis. As biaxal crystals, generally, have two
   of their in lices of refraction nearly equal in value, one branch
   of the locus approximates closely to a straight line; so one
   pair of coincident rays is 'found near the axis of the ellipse    ‘
   which is more nearly equal to the radius of the circle.
       Hitherto we have discussel only the conditions for the
   coincidence of the two rays inside the crystal.         To complete
   the investigation the direction of the corresponding incident
   ray in the bounding medium must be determined. Huyghens"
   principle gives at once the solution.           A circle is drawn,
   shown dotted in <U+FB01>g. 1 (p. 203), whose radius is proportional
   to the velocity of light in the medium, and a tangent is drawn
   to it from the point S’.      The ray is then perpendicular to the
   tangent.      Let d be the radius of this circle, 9 the angle of
   incidence of a ray in the bounding medium, and a the angle
   between the normal to the surface and the axis X.              Then
    (0 +a) is the angle made by the ray and X, and if a", z are the
    coordinates of a point on the envelope,

 Or, in other words, if the refractive index of the medium is
 less than 1'3484, there can only be one my which will enter
 the crystal, however it is out, without divergence, and that is
 along the optic axis.            If   1'3484< 1/¢l< 1'5539, there are two
 directions of non-divergence, and if 1/1l> 1'5539, three ; one
 always being in the direction of the optic axis.
    Having established the necessary conditions for the bound
ing medium, it is possible to determine a section of Iceland
 spar which will give three coincident pairs of ordinary and
 extraordinary rays. The equation of the envelope (b) is put

    As the difference in lengths of axes of the crystals has
 been much exaggerated in the diagrams, only the relative
positions of these points and lines are shown.
    A word should be said regarding the physical interpretation
of the parts of the locus hitherto omitted. A supposititious
case of refraction, which cannot be realized, may be given
to explain the existence of the dotted branches of the curve.
If  a source of light were situated at the-origin of coordinates,
emitting an ordinary and extraordinary ray in opposite
directions, then the locus which would give coincidence of
direction to these rays is the dotted curves indicated.
   I   have not been able to interpret the presence of the
singular points on the axes.              When the intersections on
the axes are singular points they always lie inside both the
ellipse and the circle.         The two tangents to the ellipse and
circle,   which  are   the   wave-fronts     of the rays of light, are
consequently imaginary.           It seems, then, as if the rays also
must    be imaginary.
   XXII.     Viscosity of Solutions.        By R. HOSKING, Kernot
        Research Scholar in the University of Melbourne*.
   T is evident that, in the immediate future, the study of the
       viscosity of liquids is destined to prove as helpful in the
investigation of the molecular kinetics of liquids as the
corresponding study of gaseous viscosity has been found to
be in the kinetic theory of gases.
   Already a large amount of work on the viscosity of liquids
has been published, but much of the pioneer work has been
    4* Communicated   by Mr.   W.  Sutherland  on behalf of Prof.

                      Viscosity   of Solutions.              275
superseded   by the recent careful measurements of Thorpe and
Rodger (Phil. Trans. 1894).
   The object of the present experimental investigation is to
brin    the data for some typical solutions up to at least the
stan ard of completeness attained by Thorpe and Rodger for
the commoner liquids; for it is probable that in the next
important advance in the theory of solutions, viscosity will
have a considerable share.        The solutions chosen for study
were those of NaCl 1 per cent., 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and
 20 per cent., representing typical electrolytic solutions; and
of cane-sugar 1 per cent., 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 20 per
 cent., and 40 per cent., representing typical non-electrolytic
 solutions. Absolute values of the viscosit        were obtained
 over a range of temperature from 0° to 90°
    To ascertain whether the viscosities of these solutions had
 been determined to the desired degree of accuracy, a pre
 liminary study of the viscosity of water over the same range
 of temperature was undertaken ; and as it was found that the
 results were in accord with the best determinations hitherto
 made, such as those of Poiseuille, Sprung, Slotte, and Thorpe
 and Rodger, it was concluded that the viscosities of solutions
 obtained with the same apparatus could be taken to possess
 the desired degree of accuracy.
    In the tables containing the data obtained in these experi
 ments, those for water will be given along with the values for
 solutions.                     _
    The method employed was that used by Thorpe and Rodger,
 the general principles of which are here stated.
    A de<U+FB01>nite volume of the liquid under observation, under
 the in<U+FB02>uence of a de<U+FB01>nite pressure, <U+FB02>ows through a horizontal
 capillary tube of known dimensions in a certain time, the
 temperature of the liquid being observed and kept constant
 during the interval.
    The liquid, for the purposes of experiment, was contained
 in a glass glischrometer, similar to that employed by Thorpe
 and Rodger, with the difference, however, that the short
 capillary tube, instead of being sealed to the two limbs, was
 united to them by means of two indiarubber corks, one at
 each end of the capillary tube.
    The glischrometer was almost completely immersed in a
 water-bath, which was heated to the desired temperature by
 gas-<U+FB02>ames,   and could be maintained at that temperature
 by manipulation of a very small jet applied beneath it.
    On each vertical limb of the glischrometer two horizontal
 marks were etched, in the restricted portions above and below
 the long cylindrical bulbs ; the two limbs had been made

 276                          Mr. R. Hosking     0n the
perfectly similar in size and shape, and so the two marks on
either limb were placed symmetrically with regard to the
bulb between them, and, when the capillary tube was hori
zontal, and limbs vertical, the two 11 per marks were in the
same horizontal plane, and likewise t e two lower ones.
   The volume of liquid employed in the experiments is that
which the glischrometer holds when the one meniscus is level
with the upper mark in the one limb, and the other meniscus
coincides with the lower mark in the other limb.           The
volume which <U+FB02>ows through       the capillary, however, is that
contained between the two marks on the same limb, diminished
by the small quantity which adheres to the sides of the bulb.
   The pressure is that due to a reservoir of compressed air,
which can be connected to either limb at pleasure, and is
measured by an open water-manometer.
   The time of <U+FB02>ow is measured by a stop-watch, and the
temperature of the liquid is that of the bath surrounding                     it,
and    indicated
       is                by
                     thermometers graduated to tenths.
        ZlIcasuv'ement    of   the   Conslants   of   the   Glt'schrometer.
    These constants are the semi-axes of the capillary, the
 working length of the capillary; and the working volume of
 the bulbs, where the working length of the capillary means
 the measured length together with the Couette correction for
 the open ends, and the working volume means the quantity
 of liquid which <U+FB02>ows through the capillary in an experiment.
These constants are determined before the portions of the
glischrometer are united together.
    The capillary tube was selected and cut from              much      a
longer piece    which   had  been    previously   calibrated   with
extreme care,    and  of  which  the   mean   diameter    had  been
obtained by weighing the mercury which had occupied known
lengths in the tube.      The mean diameter of the selected
portion   was  deduced.   The   bore was slightly elliptical, and
the ratio   of the axes  was  observed   directly under      micro    a
scope.    From these two series of measurements, the values of
the semi-axes were obtained.        The length of the capillary
was measured directly, the ends having been previously ground
perpendicular to the length of the bore.
    To obtain the working volume of the bulbs,             suitable a
capillary tube was attached to the lower extremity of the limb,
and the limb <U+FB01>lled with water. The pressure was then applied
above, and the liquid was driven through at about the same
rate as     would be in the ordinary experiments. The dis
            it

weighed <U+FB02>ask and immediately weighed.
   The only disadvantage of the use of corks instead of making
the whole glisehrometer of glass and sealing the capillary and.
limbs together, is that a ring of rubber 8 millim. in mean
diameter and 0'5 millim. in width is in contact with the
liquid at each end of the capillary tube; but in the case of
aqueous solutions there is nothing to fear in the way of
dissolved rubber. By the use of corks, on the other hand, in
addition to the fact that the constants of the glischrometer can
be evaluated before uniting the limbs and capillary, we have
the further advantages that cleaning operations are much
facilitated, risk of breakage is diminished, and capillary tubes
of different dimensions can readily be substituted if necessary.
   The following values were obtained for the constants :—

    278                Mr. R. Hosking       on. the
    and
             log at: 74282145    ;    10g   3:2-5880686.
      All  the necessary corrections were made to the readings of
    the stop-watch, the thermometers, and the pressure-gauge.
    The <U+FB02>ow through the capillary tube was in every case linear,
    and the kinetic-energy correction comparatively small.
       Care was taken that the liquid should remain free from dust
    throughout the whole series of observations. The amount of
    liquid in the glischrometer was so regulated that at each
    temperature the volume should be unaltered.           The obser
‘
    vations were begun at low temperatures in every case; and
    when the liquid in the glischrometer had reached the next
    higher temperature, the increase in volume was extracted.
       The air-reservoir was a large copper cylinder connected
    with a pump on the one side, and on the other side with the
    manometer and two glass three-way taps, by means of rubber
    tubing and T-pieces.      The two taps were united by rubber
    tubing to the limbs of the glischrometer, one to each, and the
    liquid in the glischrometer could be driven in either direction
    by proper adjustment of the taps.
       The bath was provided with the necessary taps and syphons
    for <U+FB01>lling and emptying     it,and,      addition, for running
                                            in                       a
    continuous   stream  of cold water  through the bath for tempe
    ratures below the normal.
       The glischrometer, thermometer, and syphon-tubes were
    kept in position by the cover of the bath, through which
    suitable holes had been bored.       Another hole in the cover
    admitted the shaft of small propeller for stirring the water
                          a
    of the bath, with power taken from           asmall water-motor.
    When the propeller was rotated quickly by this means,            a
    splendid circulation was set up in the bath.
       In explanation of the accompanying tables, the following
    short description of the order of observations may be necessary.
       Imagine that the observations are complete at one tempe
    rature, and the bath  is being heated to the next temperature
    at which we desire to make   a  measurement.
        When this temperature has been reached, the stirrer     is set
    in motion and the regulating <U+FB02>ame increased to prevent
    cooling: when the temperature remains practically constant,
    the liquid is driven into the right limb      by
                                                 turning the left tap
    to pressure and the right to air    :when the meniscus in the
    left limb has reached the lower mark, the left tap        is also
    turned to air, and the iiidiarubber from the top of the

                                Viscosity   of Solutions.                   279
right limb having been just previously removed, the extra
quantity of liquid due to expansion is withdrawn bya suitable
 instrument, the meniscus being made to coincide with the
 upper mark on the right limb when the meniscus in the left
 limb coincides with the lower mark on that side.         Connexion
 is again restored between the right limb and the right tap.
    The left tap is now for a few seconds turned to pressure,
 and then the right tap is turned also.
    The <U+FB01>rst reading of the pressure is now taken, and the left
 tap turned to air.      The upper mark in R (=right side) is
 observed through a telescope, and, when the meniscus crosses
it,  the watch     started.     Immediately the <U+FB01>rst reading of the
                   is is
 temperature       made, through another telescope.        The <U+FB01>rst
 telescope     moved down on its graduated vertical scale to
              is
 view the lower mark in R.
    The stop-watch        stopped at the instant of coincidence, the
                           is
 second reading of the temperature           taken, and the left tap
                                                     is
 turned to pressure.      The second reading of the pressure                 is
 now taken. A second set of observations             taken with the
                                                            is
liquid <U+FB02>owing in the opposite direction.           When this set             is
 complete, the stirrer       stopped, unless the whole set
                                is                              to be is
repeated, and the experiment at this particular temperature
is  at an end.
    The value for the viscosity         determined for each set of
                                                is
readings; and        the temperature has remained unaltered, the
                     if
mean of the two values            taken as the <U+FB01>rst absolute value
                                     is
at that temperature.         A second absnlute value             is
                                                            obtained
from the third and fourth sets of observations, that              the  is
second complete set: here            complete set represents two
                                            a
ordinary sets—one from right to left, and the other from left
to   ri ht.
     Tli temperature, however, usually alters slightly during an
experiment at       particular temperature; and we may obtain
                     a
four different readings of the mean temperature and four
different values of the viscosity. We have then to reduce these
four values to what they would be at the mean of the four
temperatures, for which purpose the value of dn/dt               is
                                                            obtained
from     curve
          a     drawn    through   the points representing the <U+FB01>rst
values of viscosity and temperature in each set, and by means
of   itthe four values are reduced to values at the mean tem
perature. Then, as before, the mean of the <U+FB01>rst and second
values gives the <U+FB01>rst mean value, and the mean of the third
and fourth the second mean value. The mean of these values
is taken as the <U+FB01>nal mean value.

   The mean pressure only has been given, but the difference
between‘the <U+FB01>rst and second readings is always slight.
   The value of the kinetic-energy correction is also shown in

where k1 and k, are the conductivities of the constituents, and
p, and p, either the masses or the volumes of each present.
Paalhorn, Winkelmann, and Schott, in their paper on the
conductivities of glasses *, used the <U+FB01>rst form with the 10’s the
masses of the constituents present; but Winkelmann has
recently. recalculated the results T, using the second form,
with the p’s the volumes of the constituents present, and
found a better agreement than formerly.
   Fockei uses the <U+FB01>rst formula, with the p’s the masses, to
represent his own results on the conductivities of various kinds
of glass.  Both theory and experiment§, however, point to the
fact that it is the proportion by volume which ought to be
used in such calculations ; and I shall con<U+FB01>ne myself in what
follows to the consideration of the proportions by volume,
calculated on the assumption that the mixture is simply a
physical mixture, and is formed without contraction.      Under
these conditions the formula
                                      k    = P1151 +P2ks

corresponds to the constituents being distributed in the space
between the two parallel isothermal surfaces, through which
the heat enters and leaves the medium, in the form of right.

   As it is not easy to say that one of these three distributions
is more likely than another to represent the actual facts,                                                 I
propose to apply each of the three formulae to the calculation of
the conductivities of the mixtures of solids and liquids experi
mented on by G. Wiedemann          Henneberg 1',   and myself             I,                              §,
and compare the results of the calculations with the values
 found experimentally.
    It will he noticed that the conductivities determined for
 successive equal increments of one constituent, correspond
 for the <U+FB01>rst formula to the successive terms of an arithmetic,
 for the second to the terms of           harmonic, and for the
                                                        a
 third to those of     geometric
                             a      series, the <U+FB01>rst and the last
 terms of the three series being   the  same.   The third formula
 will therefore give a value for the conductivity of         given                             a
mixture between the values given by the <U+FB01>rst and second
formulae.    In the tables which follow the values calculated by
the three formulae (1), (2), and (3) are referred to as
                                                           “ mean
conductivity,”

 also   in a plane perpedicular to that of the drawing, i. e. con
  sisting of cubes of the two media, will be greater than that of
 the prisms of <U+FB01>g. 3, and will therefore deviate more from the
  value of the conductivity found experimentally than does that
 given by the logarithmic formula.          Hence it seems unne
  cessary to attempt an accurate calculation of the conductivity
  of the mixture of cubes. Also, since the deviations from the
 calculated values found in the cases considered in the above
 tables, appear to differ in character from one mixture to
 another, they indicate that the thermal conductivity of a
 mixture is not completely determined by the conductivities
 of its constituents, and by the volume of each constituent
 present.
     The attempts which have hitherto been made to represent
the thermal conductivity of glass as a function of its compo
 sition and of the unknown conductivities of its constituents,
 must therefore be considered as not justi<U+FB01>ed by our know
 ledge of the behaviour of mixtures of substances the con
 ductivities of which are known.
     The formula expressing the conductivity of a mixture in
 terms of its composition and the conductivities of its con
 stituents, must then contain at least one quantity dependent
 on the characters of the two constituents, and the calculated
 values of the conductivity may be made to coincide with the
 observed values at three points.       There are many empirical
formula: which under these conditions give values that agree
fairly well with the intermediate observations; and although
I   have found the formula

as the best representation of the thermal conductivity of a
mixture.
    The result of this examination may then be summed up as
follows :—
    Of the three values for the conductivity of a mixture
calculated from the mean conductivity, mean resistivity, or
mean logarithmic formula, that from the mean conductivity
is most unsatisfactory, and that from the mean logarithmic
formula least unsatisfactory.      The logarithmic formula gives

      Discharge      of Electricity through  Argon and Helium.      293
in general too high,and the resistivity formula too low         a value
for the conductivity.
    The conductivity of a mixture appears not to be dependent
solely on the volume and conductivity of each constituent
present.
    The empirical formula (4) gives a fair representation of
the observations in the preceding tables.
XXIV.          0n the Discharge of Electricity through      Argon and
    Helium.         By Hon. R.       J.  STRUTT, B.A.,     Scholar    of
     Trinitg College, Cambridge".
          this paper     I propose to describe some observations,
IN partly         quantitative and partly qualitative, on electrical
conduction through these gases.              The observations include
measurements of the fall of potential over the negative glow
in a vacuum-tube, observations on the luminous e<U+FB02>'ects pro
duced by the discharge, and comparisons of the rate at which
 ions are produced in them and in air, under the in<U+FB02>uence of
 Rbntgen rays.
    The argon was produced from atmospheric air, the nitrogen
 being removed by sparking with oxygen in presence of caustic
 alkali.       The surplus oxygen was removed with phosphorus.
 The helium was extracted from Brazilian monazite-sand by
 boiling it with sulphuric acid. It was puri<U+FB01>ed in the same
 wa as the argon.
        he gases were introduced into the discharge-tubes by the
 method described by Prof. W. Ramsay (Trans. Chem. Soc.
 v. 1895, p. 686).
            illeasurements   of the Cathode-F all of Potential.
     The investigations of Hittorf and Warburg have shown
  that when a steady current passes through a gas the differ
  ence of potential between the cathode and the outside of the
  negative glow is a constant, independent of the current
  passing through the gas, and of the pressure, provided that—
             (a) There is no chemical action between the cathode
         and the gas;
              (6) That the negative glow does not cover the whole
         of the cathode, and is not interfered with by the walls of
         the tube.
     This constant potential-di<U+FB02>'erence is known as the cathode
  fall.    It is usually of the order of 300 volts, and has a different
  value for each gas.                     I

yet been found connecting it with other properties of the gas.
Indeed the data hitherto available are scarcely suf<U+FB01>cient for
generalization.
   The arrangement    I have used for determining the cathode
fall is represented  in  <U+FB01>g. 1. A is a battery of 400 Planté
cells. D is the tube 3 cm. in diameter containing the rare<U+FB01>ed

 gas.   The details of this tube are as followsz—q is a long
 platinum wire used as cathode, r is a platinum wire which
 extends to a point 4 or 5 mm. from the end of q : r is covered
 with blue enamel-glass except just at the tip.      When the
 current was passing, r was outside the negative glow, in the
 Faraday dark space.       The: cathode-fall was therefore the
 difference of potential between 9 and r. The exact position

                Electricity through Argon and Helium.             295
of r is not important,    as the potential-gradient in the Faraday
space is small.     s is an aluminiuzn wire, used as anode; u isa
short length of capillary tubing; andt is a glass bulb into
which is sealed another platinum electrode.              By using the
electrode in t as anode instead of s, a discharge could be sent
through the capillary tube u. This was convenient for exa
mining t-he spectrum of the gas, so as to judge of its purity.
An induction-coil was usually used instead of the battery for
this purpose, since the discharge obtained with it was much
brighter.    At 1; the vacuum-tube was connected with the
               previously described for exhausting and admitting
a<U+FB01>rangement
t e gas.
   B is a telephone, included in the battery-circuit.            It is
used for ascertaining whether or not the current is continuous.
Any intermittence in the current is at once made evident by
a singing noise in the telephone.
   For measuring the difference of potential between q and r
one of Lord Kelvin’s multicellular voltmeters is used.            It is
represented diagrammatically at G.           The range of this instru
ment is from 250 to 1000 volts.
   In order to test the apparatus and gain experience in using
it, preliminary measurements were made on the cathode-fall
in     drogen.

the vacuum-tube in the way described for helium and argon.
At <U+FB01>rst the measurements obtained were anomalous, being
generally very much too high.           It was thought at <U+FB01>rst that
the testing electrode was too far from the cathode.                The
distance was 9—10 mm.            The tube was dismounted, and the
distance diminished to its present value 4—5 mm.                   The
readings    were   still erratic,   however.    Finally   the anomaly
was traced to the in<U+FB02>uence of occluded gases in the platinum
wire which formed the cathode. These were got rid of by
heating the cathode to      a   bright-yellow heat for some minutes
by    a strong discharge      from   an induction-coil.     The pump
 was then worked, and      a   fresh supply of hydrogen admitted.
 Readings were now obtained in good agreement with those
of previous observers.       The mean of these readings was about
298 volts, as against 300 found by Warburg.             The agreement
is,
  I   think, as good as can be expected.
                        Cathode-F all in fleliam.
      The tube was exhausted and helium admitted. At <U+FB01>rst
the     spectrum of the gas showed traces of nitrogen; an
                                     X2

296           Hon. R.   J.  Strutt 0n  the  Discharge of
exceedingly minute quantity would be suf<U+FB01>cient to account
for this. The nitrogen spectrum was visible only in the
positive column, not in the negative glow. The spectrum of
the latter showed helium only.
    While the gas was in this condition the cathode-fall was at
<U+FB01>rst about 350 volts. The battery-wires were removed and
 the discharge from an induction-coil sent through the tube,        .
using the aluminium wire 8 as cathode.               This wire was
 strongly heated by     the   discharge.    The  aluminium became
 soft, and fused up into a knob under the in<U+FB02>uence of surface
tension. At the same time the aluminium spluttered on the
 walls of the tube.     The nitrogen was gradually absorbed by
the heated aluminium, and the nitrogen bands faded out from
 the spectrum.      At the same time the cathode-fall, which was
 observed at intervals, diminished till it reached avalue of
 about 226 volts. The nitrogen was now no longer visible,
 and the cathode-fall remained stationary.
    Since this cathode-fall was below the lowest graduation
 of the voltmeter, an E.M.F. had to be added to the volt
 meter circuit.      For this purpose twenty storage-cells were
 used.    'Iheir           was independently determined by means
 of a Cardew voltmeter.         This E.M.F. was subtracted from
 the reading     of the multicellular.     The <U+FB01>rst set of readings
 obtained was as follows:—
         265,    268,   271,    265 volts.    Mean 267 volts.
    Each of these readings was obtained with a different resist
 ance in the main circuit :—
    More helium was now admitted. The cathode-fall at once
 went up to something like 350 volts. But on allowing the
 discharge from the coil to run for some time, the aluminium
 absorbed the nitrogen, and the cathode-fall returned to its
 original value.
    Second set of readings :—
              265,    268,   271,    272.       Mean 267.
    The same process was repeated.
    Third set of readings :—
              270,    265,    270,   265.       Mean 267.
    The             of the battery (20 cells) added in the volt
 meter circuit was determined before and after the experiment.
 The values were the same, 40'7 volts.
    Next morning readings were taken with the same sample
 of gas, to see if the value had altered.

                Electricity through Argon and Helium.            297
    The readings were       :—
                   262,    270,   265.     Mean 266.
    E.M.F.     added 400 volts.
    The value of the cathode-fall from the mean of all these
 experiments is
                                226 volts.
    Care was taken in all cases to free the cathode from occluded
 gases by heating.
    N0 dif<U+FB01>culty was found in keeping the telephone silent in
 these experiments.
    The cathode-fall for helium is not very different from the
 value 230 volts found for nitrogen by Warburg and others.
 This may suggest that my helium was contaminated with
 nitrogen.      But  I  do not think that there is in reality any
 ground for suspicion.        W hen traces of nitrogen were present,
 the cathode-fall in the mixture was very much higher than
 230 volts; as soon as the spectroscopic test (which is in this
 case very delicate) showed the absence of nitrogen, the cathode
 fall fell to 226 volts.
                          Cathode-Fall in Argon.
    The determination of the cathode-fall in argon presents
                                                       I
 peculiar dif<U+FB01>culties—dif<U+FB01>culties which, so far as know, have
 not been encountered in the case of any other gas.
    When a wire cathode of the usual form is used, the positive
 column of the discharge insists on curling round the testing
electrode, and going on to the back of the cathode (see <U+FB01>g. 2).
                                Fig. 2.
The positive column is represented by the light shading, the
negatlve      low by the dark.        The result is that the whole
potential i<U+FB01>'erence, corresponding to the length AB of the
positive column, is added on to the cathode-fall measured
between the cathode d and the testing electrode 6.              The
distance to which the extremity B of the positive light

298            Hon. R.   J. Strutt on    the Discharge of
extends depends on the current through the tube. The greater
the current, the further it reaches towards the cathode.            By
increasing the external resistance it can be made to recede
as far as the point A.        But when this is done the current is
so   small  that it does not suf<U+FB01>ce to produce a continuous dis
charge through the gas.           The telephone emits a humming
noise, and of course no true measurement of the cathode-fall
is possible.     When the external resistance is diminished so
that a continuous current is obtained, the potential-difference
 between 0 and d increases with the current, although the
 negative glow does not COVGI‘ the whole cathode.           This is due
 to the added poteiitial-di<U+FB02>'erence 0f the variable length AB
 of the positive column.
     Many different tubes of various diameters and with the as
 at very different pressures were tried, but the same trou le
 occurred in all.       In one tube the testing electrode A was
 covered with a glass hemisphere open on the side facing the
 cathode, thus (<U+FB01>g. 3)—
                                  Fig. 3.
               testing wire
                                                        Cal/2m?
     It  was hoped that this glass protection might keep off the
 positive column, and enable good measurements to be made;
  but the readings obtained were just as anomalous as before.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty Was <U+FB01>nally overcome in the following manner :—
  Instead of a wire cathode, a platinum disk was employed, of
  such a diameter as to <U+FB01>ll up as nearly as possible the whole
 cross-section of the tube without, however, touching the
  sides.   It is clear that in this case the positive column cannot
  get  back  behind the testing-point.       The no ative. glow formed
  a patch on the disk-electrode.      The area of t is patch depended
  on the current.      And as long as the glow did not cover the
  whole disk, the cathode—fall was independent of the current.
  The only objection to the disk is that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to pass a
  suf<U+FB01>ciently strong current through the tube to heat so large
 an area satisfactorily.       Thus it is dif<U+FB01>cult to get rid of the
  occluded gases.
     This cause of error vitiated the earlier measurements.
     The cathode-fall in argon turned out to be so low that an

                  Electricity through Argon and Helium.                   299
            had to be added to the voltmeter circuit to bring the
readings within the range of its graduations. Lar er E.M.F.’s
were added in this case than in the case of he ium.                      They
were suf<U+FB01>ciently large to be determined by the multicellular
itself.    A key was employed which enabled either the added
           or the added E.M.F. +the cathode-fall to be measured.
By subtraction the cathode-fall was found.
   The <U+FB01>rst set of satisfactory readings was as follows :—
         570,            570,        570,       572,      573,      572,
         571,            568,        570,       572.

   A second set of readings on the same sample of gas, made
next day, were as follows :—
                  533,           533,       535,      52s,      528,

    A   stron        discharge from an induction-coil was now sent
through      t    is    sample of gas for a considerable time, with a
view to removing any traces of nitrogen that might remain
by absorption by the spluttered aluminium from the electrode,
as in the case of helium.
    The readings after this were :—
                         580,       581,        580,     584.

    Another sample of argon was next tested. It is not necessary
 to give the observations in detail, since they resemble closely
 those given above.
    The mean results at <U+FB01>rst were :—
                                       171 volts.
 After prolongel               sparking the cathode-fall remained almost
 unaltered.          The observed value was :———
                                       170 volts.

800            Hon. R.        J.    Strutt    on the      Discharge of
A   third sample of the gas gave the value
                                      165 volts.
   It was not possible to submit this sam le of gas to prolonged
sparking owing to an accident, by whic air gained admission
to the tube.
  Taking the mean of all these measurements,                       we have as the
cathode-fall in argon :—
                                      167 volts.
   It was mentioned above, p. 293, that one condition for a
normal cathode-fall is that there should be no chemical
action between the cathode and the gas.     This statement                           is,
however, of      somewhat hypothetical nature.
                   a                             It was found
by Warburg that the cathode-fall in hydrogen was nearly the
same (300 volts) over electrodes of copper, zinc, iron, and
platinum. But for aluminium and magnesium cathodes          was                it
much less (about 180 and 160 volts respectively).     It seems
most natural to attribute the exceptional behaviour of these
latter metals to chemical action of the gas, or of traces of
impurities in          it,
                    upon them.     However this may be                               it
appeared to be of interest to determine whether argon would
show any similar effect.       few experiments were made to
                                          A
test this point.
   A disk cathode of aluminium was employed.         spluttered      It
freely in the argon-<U+FB01>lled tube.   The values obtained for the
cathode-fall were
                                    97,      90,     85.
By continual sparking               the value rose somewhat          higher.        The
readings were
                             100,     105,         105,    115.
The mean value for the cathode-fall in argon over aluminium
electrodes    is
                                      100 volts.
Thus, so far as these experiments go, the cathode-fall in
argon appears to be diminished in the same ratio as that in
hydrogen, when aluminium electrodes are substituted for
platinum.

    It will be seen from this description that the electrodeless
 discharge brings out in a very striking way the change from
the red to the blue glow in argon <U+FB01>rst noticed by Sir W.
Crookes.     The red glow is obtained when the pressure of the
gas is high, or when the discharge is feeble.    The blue glow
is obtained when the pressure is low, or the discharge very
intense, as it is in the outer zone of the ring.   The bulb re
mained faintly luminous with a phosphorescent glow after
the discharge had been turned off.      This low was observed
after a purely red discharge (<U+FB01>g. 4b) as we 1 as after a purely
blue one (<U+FB01>g. 4e).

          Conductivity of Helium under Ra'ntyen Rays.
   It is now well-known that gases exposed to Rontgen rays
are enabled to conduct electricity.             The explanation of this
effect    is,
            beyond doubt,     that   the  ra    manufacture out of the

gas carriers charged with electriclty.             The motion of these
charged carriers or ions under an electromotive force con
stitutes the current.         This kind of gaseous conduction               is
essentially   distinct    from    the conduction which constitutes
disru tive discharge. The former takes place under small
E.M. .’s, the latter, under given circumstances, requires                   a
de<U+FB01>nite large E.M.F. to produce it. It has been found (see
J.   J.Thomson, The Discharge of Electricity through Gases,’
                          ‘
p. 35) that with           given shape of electrodes, and

when ions are used 11 in conveying the current as fast as

   The following is an account of some experiments to deter
mine the ratio of saturation currents in helium and in air :—
    The gas was contained in an                 Fig, 5,
aluminium cylinder,        2 centim.  in
diameter (a, <U+FB01>g. 5). closed at one
end by a sheet of aluminium h                           c
cemented on.        The rays passed in
through           The other end was
                   11.
closed by              htly-<U+FB01>tting ce
                         a   ti
mented plug of ehonite          through0,
                                                                 d
which passed smaller aluminium
                           a
tube      d. This last reached nearly
to the bottom of the outer cylin
der.          served as an inlet for
              1t
the     as, and also as one of the
elect§odes.       The outer cylinder
                                                  We
at was used as the other electrode.
A   glass tube was cemented into
                           e
d,   so as to enable         connexion
                                   a
to be made with the mercury-                                     a
pump, by means of which the air
was removed before admitting
the helium.
  It    was found that          the rays
                                    if
 fell directly   on the   ebonite plug        0
the results were very irregular.
 To guard against this metal disk  a
 was carried on         so as nearly to
                               d                            L            4

 and 1118 to screen the ebonite from
     t
 the rays.       This screen was of brass, but was faced with
 aluminium.        This was to guard against the abnormal ioniza
 tion which, as Perrin has shown, occurs at thesurface of most
 metals, but not appreciably at an aluminium surface.
     A second precisely similar vessel was provided, which was
 left full of air, for comparison.
     A lead-covered box was used to contain the induction
 coil and focus-tube which generated the rays. The two
 aluminium vessels were arranged side by side so that the
 rays emerging from holes in the lead box could fall on their
ends      b.
   The wires leading to the electrometer from the gas cells
      screened by being led through metal tubes connected to
werp1
cart      .
   The method of determining the conductivity was to <U+FB01>nd
the rate at which an electric charge could leak through the

304            Hon. R.    J.  Strutt 0n     the  Discharge of
gas   to the insulated quadrants of a quadrant electrometer.
 This rate was <U+FB01>rst determined when both of the cells were
filled with air. The bulb was adjusted to such a position that
 the rate of leak in each of the cells was very nearly the same.
 One of the cells was then <U+FB01>lled with helium, and the rates of
 leak again compared. The ratio of these rates was corrected
 for the slight inequality of the gas cells as determined when
both were <U+FB01>lled with air.
    In this way the relative conductivities were determined.
    The electrical connexions are shown in fig. 6.

terminal is put to earth and to a pair of electrometer
 quadrants. The other terminal to the outside of the cell 6,
containing Blintgenized gas.            The central and highly insu
lated electrode of this cell is connected to the other pair of
electrometer quadrants.
    Suitable commutating arrangements, consisting of mercury
 cups in para<U+FB02>in blocks, are provided for throwing either the
 air cell or the helium cell into the circuit.
    Supposing all to be in working order, the measurements
were made as follows :—The two pairs of quadrants were

             Electricity through Argon and Helium.                    305
connected together. The zero was read.           The quadrants were
disconnected. The rays were turned on for a convenient time,
usually twenty seconds.        The number of divisions through
which the spot of light had mOVed was observed.
    The other gas cell was then substituted and the same
process gone through, and so on alternately.
    It was <U+FB01>rst necessary to make sure that the                     used
was suf<U+FB01>cient to saturate the gas.       For this purpose the rate
of leak through the air cell was determined with various
E.M.F.’s.
    The rays remainel on 20 seconds in each case.

    Thus it was found that 100 cells scarcely produced a larger
 current than 50.     Saturation had been reached.           In all the
 subsequent experiments      100 cells were   used.
     The two cells, both <U+FB01>lled with air, were now compared.
    The numbers given are the number of divisions passed over
 in 10 seconds.

     Another set of measurements      gave the following      results  :—
                 Cell No. 1.             Cell No.  2.
                      50'                     58
                      60-                     65
                      69,                     60
     The discrepancies between successive readings may be
  almost entirely attributed to irregularities in the action of the
  contact-breaker of the coil, and of the high vacuum tube.
  The measurements following immediately upon one another
  should be most strictly comparable.
     The best method of reducing these results is therefore to

306      Discharge of Electricity through Argon and Helium.
take the average of the ratios of successive readings (coupled
by lines in the tables).
    The mean ratio of conductivities thus found from the <U+FB01>rst
set of experiments was
                                 1 :  1'07.
    From the second set
                                 1 :  1‘00.
    The mean of all these experiments gave as the ratio of the
conductivity in cell No. 1 to that in cell N0. 2
                                  1 : 1'04.
    Cell No.    2  was     then attached    to  a mercury-pump       and
exhausted.      Helium was admitted to atmospheric pressure.
The cell was then carefully readjusted to exactly its original
position.
    The de<U+FB02>exion produced by 10 seconds’ exposure to the rays
for each of the cells alternately was noted.
            Air (cell N o.  1).             Helium (cell No. 2).

                      32                       14
     The ratio of conductivities from this last set of experiments
 is 1 : '46. Other experiments gave results very nearly the
 same.     But in no other case was the radiation quite so steady.
 I  prefer therefore to rely on the above.
     Correcting for the inequality of the cells, the ratio is 1 :‘44.
     It follows that the rate at which ions are produced in
 helium is about half that at which they are produced in air.
                              General Remarks.
     The peculiar interest of the gases argon and helium is in
 their monatomic characters.
     The view is now generally taken that the electric discharge
 is conveyed in all cases by ions, these ions being produced by
 a dissociation process of some kind.             If this be admitted
 there can be no escape from the conclusion that the ions of
 monatomic gases are split up into something smaller.
     The above experiments make it suf<U+FB01>ciently clear,            I think,
  that these gases convey the discharge in a normal manner.             If
  the potential-fall at the cathode is a measure of the energy
  expended in the ionization of the gas when effected by an

            On Electrolytic Convection in Geissler-tubes.              307
                                                                             '
electric <U+FB01>eld, the experiments show that the ionization of
argon and helium is somewhat more easily effected than that
of other gases.                                       7
   There are other reasons for thinking that the atomicity of
an elementary gas is not an important factor in its facility
of ionization.
   Thus mercury vapour was found by Thomson and Ruther
ford to conduct much more freely than air under the in<U+FB02>uence
of the rays. Helium, on the other hand, conducts only about
half as well as air.
   There is one peculiarity which seems to belong to mona
tomic gases only.
   It is only in such gases that aluminium cathodes “ splutter.”
This effect is observed in mercury, argon, and helium.
   This, however, is a subsidiary point.     There is no means
of interpreting it in the present state of our knowledge of the
subject.
XXV.       On an Experiment bearing on          theHypothesis of Electro
  lytic Convection       in   Geissler-tubes.     By H. MORRIS-AIREY,
  B.Sc.*
    ROF.        J. J.   THOMSON, in his book ‘Discharge of
      Electricity through Gases,’ describes an experiment to
show the convection of chlorine through hydrogen under the
in<U+FB02>uence of an electric discharge.
   A small quantity of chlorine is introduced into a capillary
tube <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen at a low pressure, and the discharge
from an induction-coil allowed to take place through the tube.
On examining the tube with a spectroscope the chlorine is
seen only at the anode, and on reversing the current the
chlorine appears at the new anode, and so on as often as the
current is reversed.
   The conclusion Prof. Thomson draws from this       that the   is,
chlorine   isactually transported through  the hydrogen   from
one end of the tube to the other after each reversal of the
current.
   This conclusion, however, does not seem to be justi<U+FB01>ed,
since the difference of temperature known to exist at the two
electrodes may be suf<U+FB01>cient to account for the effect, the
chlorine being seen only at the hottest part of the tube. It
seemed interesting therefore to see      the motion of the
                                                  if
chlorine could be detected in some other way.
   An experiment was made with a tube of the shape shown
                *   Communicated    by   Prof. Schuster, F.R.S

in the diagram, pieces of platinum wire fused into it at the
points A, A', B, B' being used as electrodes.       Hydrogen and
a little chlorine were allowed to enter the tube, and the elec
trodes A and B connected to the terminals of an induction-coil
giving a spark about 6 centim. long.
                 x:
                 A                          8
   With a mixture of the gases containing 7 per cent. of
chlorine at a pressure of 2 millim. mercury, the spectrum of
chlorine was obtained from a small portion of the tube sur
rounding the anode, while in the rest of the tube no chlorine
could be detected.      The current was repeatedly reversed,
and the effect described by Prof. Thomson observed.
   The electrode B was then made the anode, and no chlorine
being detected on careful examination of the part AA’ the
two parts AA' and BB' were fused of? at the points 0 and D
whilst the current was still passing.
   Making use of the remaining electrodes at A’ and 3’, each of
the tubes thus obtained was connected to the induction-coil
and examined with a s ectroscope.
   If Prof. Thomson’s t eory were correct no chlorine should

              On   some   Novel Thermo-Electrz'c Phenomena.          309
 have been discoverable in the part AA’.        However, the
 chlorine spectrum was easily obtained from AA’ ; and on
 'comparison with BB’ the intensity of the chlorine lines was
 found to be the same in both cases. The tubes were fused on
 again and the experiment repeated, making A the anode,
 when the same result was obtained.
    This proves that if any convection of the chlorine does take
 place, it is to an extremely small extent, and is certainly not
 suf<U+FB01>cient to account for the effect observed.
    To Prof. H. Kayser I wish to acknowledge indebtedness.

     W. F. BARRETT, F.1f.S., Professor of Ercperz'mental Physics
     in the Royal College of Science for [reland*.
         the course of a determination of some of the physical
 IN     properties possessed by various new alloys of iron, which
  had been prepared by Mr. R. A. Had<U+FB01>eld, of Shef<U+FB01>eld, I found
  the thermo-electric behaviour of a particular nickel steel, to
  which <U+FB01>ve per cent. of manganese had been added, to be so
  remarkable that it seemed worthy of a separate note.
     The analysis of this alloy (kindly supplied to me by Mr.
  Had<U+FB01>eld) was as follows :—
                  Iron .......... .. 68'8 per cent.
                  Nickel .......... .. 25'0        ,,

                  Carbon ....... ..      1'2       ,,
    The speci<U+FB01>c electrical resistance of this alloy was found by
 'Mr. Brown and myself to be higher than that of any other alloy
  we had hitherto examined          1t amounted to no less than 97'52
                                  1'.
  microhms per cub. centim. (at 15° (1.).        At the same time its
  variation of resistance with change of temperature was com
 paratively small, the temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient being 0'08 per
cent. per degree C. (between 0° and 250° C.).
    The thermo-electric behaviour of the various alloys of iron
 which Mr. Had<U+FB01>eld had kindly placed in my possession was
 in course of investigation, and the enormous electrical resist
 ance of this specimen, and of another similar alloy with some
 what less nickel, led me to try earlier than  I       should otherwise
 have done some of its other physical properties.
    A preliminary experiment was made by coupling wire of   a
this new alloy successively with different metals and testing

the thermo-electric power of the various junctions up to a red
heat.   When an iron wire was used as the second metal the
thermo-electric t'orce quickly rose till a certain temperature
much below redness was reached, and then remained almost
stationary,notwithstandingthat   the temperature of the junction
rose from a black up to a bright white heat ; the cool junctions
being throughout kept in water at the temperature of the
room, or in ice.     Here, then, we have the change in the
thermo-electric     force arrested when a certain temperature is
reached, and the force remaining nearly the same in spite of
the increasing difference of temperature between the cool and
hot junctions.      We know that so long as the diference of
temperature     between   the cool and hot junctions in most
thermo-couples remains constant, and the circuit is unchanged,
the potential-difference also remains constant;         but if the
difference of temperature between the cool and hot junctions
alters, then the potential-di<U+FB02>'erence, as a rule, also changes;
and for small changes of temperature the electromotive force
thus set up        in most cases, proportional to the change of
                        is,
temperature. This, of course,        the principle upon which the

                                               a
 with certain alloys this proportionality holds good through             a
 wide range of temperature.

 twisted with     wire of an alloy of platinum containing 10 per
                        a
 cent. of rhodium, was employed.            The va our of boiling
 water (100°C.) and of boiling sulphur (445°          are the most
 convenient and reliable <U+FB01>xed points for plotting the lower part

microvolts was accurately determined by means of a standard
cell and potentiometer, one scale-division being found to be
equal to 265 microvolts.             With a similar couple Professor
Callendar found that the E.M.F. in microvolts at three points
ought to be as follows :—
                  100° C.        .     .        650 microvolts
                  445°           .     .      3630

the     other junctions being in ice.            My own determinations
at 100° C. and 445° C. gave almost identically the same values
in microvolts; this may be accidental, but the variations of
thermo-electric power in different specimens of platinum is
probably very slight.          1 therefore took Professor      Callendar’s
value     in  microvolts for 1000° C. in preference to the rather
different number 1 obtained *. The results are plotted in the
curve shown in the <U+FB01>gure, marked “ pyrometer couple.”
     We will now return to the thermo-electric behaviour of this
 nickel-manganese-iron alloy.            An iron wire, drawn from the
purest commercial iron, was coupled with a wire of the alloy.
 The wires were twisted together at the junction and then
 brazed.        After insulation with asbestos they were lashed
 alongside of the platinum-rhodium pyrometer couple, and the
 pair of couples was then inserted in the centre of a thick iron
 tube held horizontally in, and heated by, a gas furnace, the
 temperature of which could be raised to a white heat.                  The
 cooler junctions of both couples were kept in ice, and pairs of
 readings were taken as the temperature was raised, and again
 as it was lowered ; the rise and fall being slow and steady in
 both cases. As the readings of each couple were taken alter
 nately, to obtain a true comparison three readings were
 necessary in each case : <U+FB01>rst, of one couple A ; then, of the
 other B; then, of A again; the mean of the <U+FB01>rst and last
 readings of A being comparable with B. The galvanometer
 being extremely dead—beat, all three readings could be taken
 closely together. This comparison was repeated two or three
 times every minute during heating and cooling, thus several
 series of readings for about every 10° 0. rise or fall of tem
 perature were obtained ; the readings which corresponded to
 similar temperatures in heating and cooling being remarkably
 concordant, allowance being made for a very small constant
 difference to be mentioned in the sequel.

 is directly proportional to the scale-readings of the galvanometer, it is
 easy, when the E.M.F. in microvolts at 100° and 445°C. is found, to
 determine the higher points in the curve by means of the ratio given

   The results are plotted in the second curve shown on the
<U+FB01>gure.    It will be seen that, up to a temperature of 320° 0.,
the E.M.F. of the nickel-steel alloy and iron couple rose
rapidly; it then remained absolutely constant until the
temperature rose to 500°, and after this, only a small change
occurred up to the highest temperature attainable in the gas
furnace employed.       The mean E.M.F. between 300° and
1000° 0. was     in  round numbers 4000 microvolts, and the
extreme variations from the mean                      throughout this
range of 700° L—that        is, from     low black heat to a white
                                          a
heat—were less than 170 microvolts, or about + and — per            4
cent. of the E.M.F. at 300° 0., the cooler junction being kept
at 0° 0.    It   will be noticed that there           is   slight and
                                                           a
curious oscillation of the E.M.F. about the mean line between
300° and 1100° 0., the curve cutting the mean E.M.F. at
four points, viz., at 310°, 540°, 810°, and 1030° 0.
   The couple was next exposed to             avery low temperature
obtained from solid 00,, but though               a  temperature of
 — 80° 0. was reached
                          (the other junction being still kept in
melting ice), no other anomalous action occurred, the reverse
         increasing rapidly as the temperature fell.         On again
raising   the  temperature     to     awhite  heat,   the  phenomena
previously observed were exactly reproduced, and continued
to be so on repeated heating and cooling.
   In place of nearly pure iron, other substances were tried
as the second metal in conjunction with this alloy.          Ordinary
commercial iron wire gave         a very similar result, the oscil
lations from the mean E.M.F. being slightly greater.             With
an ordinary mild steel wire as the second metal, the nickel
manganese alloy now gave          adifferent result; this       shown
                                                               is

remains constant only between 400 and 600° 0., then begins
to fall and continues falling slowly to the highest temperature
reached, over 1000° 0.
   Platinum, copper, and other metals were also tried in
conjunction with this alloy, but in no case was there observed
the singular constancy of E.M.F. through a wide range of
tem erature which occurred when iron was the second metal.
Wit platinum the E.M.F. has an opposite sign (to that
occurring when the alloy          is coupled vwith iron) up to            a
temperature of 210°      0.;  inversion takes place at this tem
perature, after which the              rapidly rises with increasing
temperature   in  an  approximately parabolic curve.
   A small thermo-electrie battery was formed of strips of
this alloy with strips of iron, the strips being insulated by
asbestos, and brazed at their junctions; 25 of these couples

314               Prof. W. F. Barrett on    some
give an E.M.F. of 116 of a volt when heated over any <U+FB02>ame,
the cooler junctions being kept in ice-cold water.         A con—
venient standard of             mi ht thus be made if the means
of the readings between 300 and 1000° 0. were taken.
Whether repeated heating and cooling of the alloy will affect
its                                 I
               I cannot say, but have not yet observed any
injury resulting from this cause.
    We know so little of the whole subject of thermo-electrieity,
that the explanation of the remarkable behaviour of this
alloy can only be a matter for conjecture.         Some light may
be thrown on it by the results obtained from the other alloys
of iron, when their thermo-electric behaviour is examined.
 So far   I  have found that reducing the nickel in the alloy
from 25 to 19 per cent., the other constituents remaining the
 same, does not destroy the sudden arrest of E.M.F. at about
 300° 0. ; but the range of temperature where the E.M.F. is
 nearly constant is less, extending from about 400° to 750° 0.
    It has been suggested that the peculiar thermo-electric
 property of this alloy may be connected with the effect
 observed    by Lord Kelvin, the so-called Thomson effect,
whereby a kind of electric convection of heat occurs.          It is
 very possible that it may have some connexion with this, and
 hence with the neu tral point, which occurs in the thermo-electric
 behaviour of certain pairs of metals, such as copper and iron.
 It is well-kn0wn that at a certain critical difference of tempe
 rature between the hot and cold junctions of, say, a copper-iron
 couple, the potential-difference due to heat disappears ; as the
 temperature rises, inversion of the current occurs ; and a
 second inversion may occur at a still higher temperature.       In
 the phenomenon described in this paper, the E.M.F., it is
 true, does not fall to zero. If, however, the cooler junction
 were kept at a temperature of 310° 0., this would be the
 case; and we should then have a series of three successive
 small inversions of E.M.F., occurring at 540°, 810°, and
 1030° 0.     In a copper-iron couple the neutral point is 275° 0.
    I have noticed that the temperature of the neutral point in
 a copper-iron, or copper-steel couple, is not the same during
 the heating as during the cooling of the couple.        Moreover,
 in a couple formed of copper and mild carbon steel, the
 neutral point becomes lower in successive heatings. Thus,
 at the <U+FB01>rst heating the temperature of inversion was approxi
 mately 640° 0., and in cooling, 500° 0. ; in the second
 heating, 550° 0., and in cooling, 465° 0. ; in the third heat
 ing, 520° 0., and in cooling, 465° 0.: the difference between
 the temperature of inversion in heating and cooling becoming
 less in each successive heating and cooling.        The cool junc

      tion was here at 16° 0. throughout ; the neutral points at the
      1st, 2nd, and 3rd heatings and corresponding coolings of the
      couple, would therefore be approximately as follows :—
                  Neutral Points of Copper-steel Couple.
                                  First,         Second,      Third Heating.
        When heating              328°           283°            268° C.
        When cooling              258°           241°             241° C.
          It is obvious therefore that the curve representing the
       thermo-electric force of a copper-steel couple at different
       temperatures is not the same for a rising as for a falling
       temperature. This      Ihave found to be the-case with couples
       formed of several other metals, provided one element of the
       couple is iron or steel or other alloy of iron.       When the
       other metal is platinum, the difference in the two curves is well
      seen, though with a platinum-iron couple the difference of
      E.M.F. in heating and cooling is less marked than with a
      platinum-steel couple. In the latter case, a considerable area
      is enclosed by the curves (representing the relation between
      thermo-electric force and temperature) during heating and
      during cooling. Hence, at a given temperature, say 500 0.,
      of the hot junction, the E.M.F. of a platinum-steel couple is'
      considerably higher during heating than during cooling.
          The reverse is the case with a couple formed of' Had<U+FB01>eld’s
      nickel-manganese-steel and copper, or a couple formed of the
      same alloy with platinum ; in both these cases at any given
      temperature, the E.M.F. is lower during heating than during
      cooling.    With a couple formed of the same alloy and iron,
      as described in the earlier part of this paper, there is also a
      slightly lower E.M.F. at corresponding temperatures during
      heating than during cooling; but the difference only exists at
      certain parts of the scale, and is so small that it could not be
      shown on the curve as reduced in the text. WVith the nickel
      manganese-steel    alloy (containing 19 instead of 25 per cent.
      of nickel) coupled with iron, the              is slightly higher
     at corresponding temperatures      in  heating than in cooling up
     to the level part of the curve,       e. about 400° (1, where the
                                           2'.
     E.M.F. becomes almost the same in heating as in cooling—
     very sli htly lower, however,—and remains so until the curve
     rises, w en the E.M.F. again becomes higher at corresponding
     temperatures in heating than in cooling up to the highest
     temperature reached      : in this case, therefore, the curves
     showing    the           during heating and cooling cross each
     other twice, <U+FB01>rst at about 400° and next at about 800° C.
     I     hope, in
                  a   subsequent paper, to give the results of further
     investigation   which    am pursuing on this interesting pheno

properties,  which  make   them   invaluable   to  the ophthalmic

them systematically, in 1862, in his work Astigmatismus

Theorie der Cylinderlinsen.        Javal has written much on
the subject from the ophthalmological point of view, as has
Mr. S. M. Burnett. Mr. C. F. Prentice has also written of

Stokesi has proposed a cylindrical lens of variable power by
combining at a variable angle two equal cylindrical lenses of
opposite sign.   The problem of the optical properties of
crossed cylindrical  lenses was touched upon by Reusch and
by Donders.      Kriiss has written upon the aberration of
“               ”
  bicylindrical   lenses, meaning by that term such lenses as
have both surfaces cylindrical and of equal curvature, but
with their axes mutually at right-angles.     Lastly, Prentice
has given very elaborate rules for calculating the equivalent
sphere-cylindrical lens for any combination of two lenses
crossed at any angle.    The importance of the solution of this
problem arises from a point in modern ophthalmic practice:—

power of the eye is di<U+FB02>'erent in di<U+FB02>'erent meridians around
the optic axis.      One process of examination of this defect
consists in ascertaining the position of the meridian of greatest
 refractive power, and in then measuring that power; and,
this having been done, measuring the power in a meridian at
right angles to the former, that is to say in the meridian of
 minimum refractive power.         The difference between these
two powers gives in reality the amount of cylindricity to be
corrected.     Or the excess of each over the normal spherical
refractive power of the eye might be separately corrected by
the choice of two appropriate cylindrical lenses which are
then superposed        at right an les.    Sometimes, however,
ophthalmic surgeons, whether t irough insuf<U+FB01>cient apprecia
tion of the geometrical and optical principles involved, or
through some incidental cause, prescribe a lens with two
cylindrical curvatures on the respective faces of the lens, not
crossed at right-angles but at some oblique angle.      As such
lenses are difficult of manufacture, and as their optical effect
can be precisely reproduced by a suitably calculated and more
 readily ground sphere-cylindrical lens, the optician desires
to have simple rules for
calculating the equivalent
sphere-cylinder.      Hence the
present attempt to arrive at
easier rules for obliquely
crossed cylindrical lenses.
To establish these rules it is
possible    to proceed by a
 simpler method than that of
Reusch', whose investigation
is exclusively based upon the
properties of parabolic lenses.

    5. The  circumstance that the cylindrical part of the
resultant of two crossed cylindrical lenses varies from maxi
mum to minimum when the angle between the axes of the
two lenses is varied from 0° to 90°, suggests a solution to the
practical problem how to make a cylindrical lens of variable
cylindricity.    If two equal positive cylindrical lenses are used,
the value of the cylindrical part of their resultant varies
from their sum, when the angle 6=0°, to zero when the
angle 0=90°. But while the cylindrical part thus diminishes,
in proportion to the square of the cosine of the angle between
 them, the spherical part of the resultant increases in the
 proportion of the square of the sine of the same angle. One
 never obtains a simple cylindrical lens, except in the case of
the coincidence of the axes.       Similarly if two equal negative
 cylindrical lenses are used, the resultant consists of a negative
 cylindrical part and a negative spherical part, the one
decreasing, the other increasing when the angle 0 is increased
 from 0° to 90°.
    Ophthalmists are acquainted with a combination (known
 as Stokes’s lens) consisting of two cylindrical lenses of equal
 but opposite powers (one a convex, the other an equal con
 cave), arranged to be rotated to various angles of obliquity
 across one another.       When their axes are in coincidence,
 or 0=0°, they neutralize one another completely.            When
 crossed   at right-angles their resultant cylindricity is a

324      On       the   Law of Reciprocity in Difuse Re<U+FB02>exion.
maximum but is mixed in sign.           Suppose their respective
powers   were  +2 dioptries   and  —2  dioptries ; they will when
crossed not act as either a +4 dioptrie cylinder, or as a
 —4 dioptrie cylinder, but can be made to act as such by
adding at choice either a + 2 dioptrie spherical lens or a —2
dioptrie spherical lens, to neutralize the refractive e<U+FB02>'ects in
one or other of the meridians.      When crossed at intermediate
angles the spherical lens required to neutralize, and so produce
the effect of a simple cylinder, would be of some intermediate
power. This is a slight inconvenience ; but a more serious
 one exists in the circumstance that in rotating one about the
other the axis of the resultant cylindrical effect takes a varying
obliquity.    This objection is not removed by rotating the two
lenses in opposite directions simultaneously.
   A more convenient combination to give varying degrees of
cylindricity is the followingz—Let two lenses be ground,
each being a mixed equi-cylinder consisting of a concave and
convex ground at right-angles to one another on the opposite
faces of the glass.   Two such mixed cylinders, if rotated with
equal motion in opposite directions, will give a varying
cylindricity of <U+FB01>xed direction in space. With the axes of
 +cylindricity coincident they give the maximum ; but when
each is rotated to 45°, one to the right, the other to the left,
their resultant is zero.    In intermediate positions the value
of the resultant  varies  accordin   to the square of the cosine
of double the angle through w ich either has been moved

axes), but    remains <U+FB01>xed in direction. When each
             it                                             rotated         is

foundation, appears approximately to represent the facts. The
question may indeed be raised whether it is possible so to
de<U+FB01>ne an ideally matt surface that Lambert’s law may become
strictly applicable.
   The conclusion drawn by Dr. \Vright from his experiments
with compressed powders upon which                I desire to comment
is that numbered (4) in his 'résumé of results, viz. “A law
for the intensity of re<U+FB02>ected scattered               light cannot he
symmetric in reference to i and s.”             It appears to me that
this statement is in contradiction to a fundamental principle
of reciprocity, of such generality that escape from it is
dif<U+FB01>cult.     This principle is discussed at length in my book on
the ‘Theory of Sound,’ § 109.           Its application to the present
question may be thus stated :—-Suppose that in any direc
tion (1') and at any distance r from a small surface (S)
re<U+FB02>ecting in any manner there be situated a radiant point (A)
of given intensity, and consider the intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected
vibrations at any point B situated in direction 6 and at distance
r' from S. The theorem is to the effect that the intensity is
the same as it would be at A if the radiant point Were trans
ferred to B‘. The conclusion follows that whatever may be
its character in other respects, the function~of i and e which
represents the intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected scattered light must
be symmetrical with respect to these quantities.
   The actual departures from the reciprocal relation found
by Dr. Wright were not very large, and they may possibly
be of the nature of experimental errors.                 In any case it
seems desirable that the theoretical dif<U+FB01>culty in accepting
Dr. Wright’s conclusion should be pointed out.

   ‘326                     Geological Society:—
   'Man, has studied the coast-section    in the Carboniferous Volcanic
    series between Castleton Bay and Poolvash, with the result
    that he has discovered evidence that the strata haVe undergone
    much deformation in pre-Triassic times.     In the western part of
    the outcrop the volcanic material consists almost wholly of tu<U+FB02>’,
    in places bedded and fossiliferous;    in the eastern part exists a
    chaotic mass of coarse and <U+FB01>ne fragmental volcanic material, tra—
    versed by ridgcs of basaltic rock and containing entangled patches
    of dark limestone.     The author now considers that the larger
   lenticles and most of the smaller blocks of limestone have been
   torn up from the underlying limestone-<U+FB02>oor during a sliding forward
   or overthrusting of the volcanic series upon it. Such blocks do not
   contain ashy material, though patches of truly interbedded, ashy
   limestone are probably also present. The sections at Scarlet Point,
   l’oolvash, and between Cromwell’s \Valk and Close-ny-Chollagh
  Point are described and <U+FB01>gured. Strips of limestone are found to
  shoot steeply upward and become wedged in between the blocks
  in the agglomerate; they give indications of sliding and disturbance,
  and their outer surfaces are indurated and chcrt-like.        The ash,
  which usually rests on black argillaceous limestone-<U+FB02>ags, in places
  appears to come into juxtaposition with a somewhat lower horizon,
  crushed, platy material intervening between the two.      Steep domes
  of the limestone break into sharp crests, which shoot up into the
  ash and are bent over towards the north; and between the crests
 small ragged strips of limestone are entangled among the tuti'.
 Bands of vesicular basalt are bent and shattered. A dyke-like mass
 has'had a segment sliced off and thrust forward among the aggloe
 merate, so that its <U+FB02>ow-lines of vesicles are sharply truncated along
 the fractured edge, which is often notched and <U+FB01>lled in with ash as
 though lumps had been torn out of it.         The composition of the
 included masses is in<U+FB02>uenced by the neighbourhood of the rocks
 in situ, being calcareous near limestone, and basaltic near the basalt
 masses.
     The phenomena may be explained as the e<U+FB01>'ects of earth-movement
on a group of rocks consisting of limestone passing up into tuif,
interbedded with lava-<U+FB02>ows, and possibly traversed by sills or
dykes of basaltic rock. The results of the disturbance appear to
be limited vertically and horizontally, and to have been determined
by the differential resistance of the component rocks.       Analogous
features occur in the Borrowdale Volcanic Series and in the Silurian
volcanic rocks of Portraine.

    The Wenlock Shale of this area was deposited on the sinking
shore-line of the old Llandeilo ridge, resulting in the overlap of

higher beds on lower.
    The Long Mountain is a syncline with a north-east and south-west
 axis. Here also there must have been deposition on a sinking ridge
 accompanied by overlap.           The lowest beds, exposed near Chirbury,
 belong to the zone of “Managraptus riccartonensis; but on the
 north-west side, near Middletown, the lowest beds seen above the
Tarannon Shales belong to the zone of Cyrtograptus Linnarssoni.
The relationship of these beds to the Tarannon Shales is regarded
 as an unconformity.            The sections in this district con<U+FB01>rm those
established for the Builth area.
    In the Llangollen Basin the general structure is a synclinal fold
 complicated by many minor folds and faults.                         The ‘Pale Slates’
are covered by darker shales belonging to the zone of Oyrtograptus
 Murchisoni; and in this district the relationships of the lowest zones
 are clearer than at Builth or the Long Mountain.
    The pulaeontological part of the paper describes several species,
some of which are recorded               for the <U+FB01>rst time in the country :
 Uyrtogruptus      Curruthersi,     C.  rigidm,     and a new species of C’yrto

    The relationship of the abundant diabase to the Permo-Carboni
t'erous strata     of the island has been long a matter of dispute.
                    J
Among others, ukes described sections which appeared to con<U+FB01>rm
the view that Permo-Carboniferous sediments were deposited round
vast masses of igneous rock previously cooled and denuded.                                  The
author has identi<U+FB01>ed and visited the sections, and <U+FB01>nds in one that,
although there is a step-like junction between the sediments and the
igneous rocks, it is the result of the intrusion of diabase, and not
of the deposition of sediment. The sediment, which is fossilit'erous,
is converted into an intensely hard whitish marble, and the associated
shale-bands into chert. The diabase, which is ordinarily an ophitic
rock, acquires at the junction a <U+FB01>nely crystalline-granular texture.
.inkes’s second section also gives undoubted evidence of intrusion.

         our former paper‘f we have described some effects of
 IN      magnetization on the dimensions of nickel and iron, as
  well as those of hydrostatic pressure and longitudinal pull on
  the magnetization.    We have shown that there is reciprocal
  relation between the two, and that the Villari effect in iron
 is a natural consequence of the observed changes of dimen
  sions.   Unfortunately the range of the magnetizing-<U+FB01>eld was
  limited to a few hundred c.c.s. units, so that the investig
  ation of the behaviour of these metals in high <U+FB01>elds was
 reserved for further experiments.      In addition to this, the
 ferromagnetics were not of the shape to be uniformly mag
 netized, with the exception of iron ovoids. It was therefore
 thought desirable to repeat the experiment on ovoids of
 ferromagnetic metals, and to extend the investigation into still
stron er <U+FB01>elds.
     Iniis well-known researches on the changes of dimensions
of iron and other metals by magnetization, Bidwelli pushed
the <U+FB01>eld-strength to 1500; in the present experiment the
<U+FB01>eld-strength is greater than that of Bidwell by 700.        In
addition to ordinary soft iron and steel ovoids, wolfram steel,
from Bohler, in Vienna, was tested, with a result which

330      Messrs. Nagaoka and Honda on Change of Volume and
showed a remarkable di<U+FB02>'erence from ordinary steel as regards
the change of dimensions wrought by magnetization.                               As
was generally supposed, the change of volume is very small
in iron and nickel in weak <U+FB01>elds, but with strong magnetizing
force the effect becomes generally pronounced.
                           Met/10d       of Ewperz'ment.
    The same ap aratus as before described was used in
measuring the c ange of length and of volume. A small
alteration was made in the arrangement of the magnetizing
coil.     Owing to the strong magnetizing-current, a special
arrangement was provided for keeping the interior of the coil
at constant temperature. A double-walled tube of brass was
inserted in the coil, and a constant stream of cold water was
passed in the interspace for more than an hour before each
experiment.       As the resistance of the coil was only 0'56 ohm,
the rise of temperature was so small that the ferromagnetic
placed in its core was scarcely affected.                          The change of
length    was  measured         by    means   of   an    optical lever, as before
described *. For measuring the change of volume, the ovoid
was sealed in a glass tube with capillary neck (internal
diameter about 0'4 mm.) , and so placed in the tube that it
rested in the axial line, and never came in contact with the
wall of the tube.           The magnetizing-coil and the tube were
placed horizontal.           The motion of the meniscus was measured
by   a  microscope provided with micrometer ocular.                        For the
minute particulars we must refer the reader to the former
  aper 0n magnetostriction.

                             Change
  Iron (<U+FB01>g. l).——The change of length experienced by soft
iron is too well known to need any description.       The ovoid
elongates  in  weak  <U+FB01>elds till it attains a   maximum, being
longer by about 3 to 4 millionths of its initial length ; it then
decreases in length, and becomes shorter than in the unmag
netized state.  The contraction goes on gradually increasing,
and in the present experiment it does not seem to reach an
asymptotic value, even in <U+FB01>elds of 2200 O.G.s. units, where
the contraction amounts to about 1601,00.     The present result
agrees  qualitatively with Bidwell’s experiment, but the con
traction is much greater. The discrepancy is probably to be
accounted for by the difference of shape.
   Steel (<U+FB01>g. l).—Ordinary steel behaves just like iron, the
difference being the smallness of elongation and contraction,
and the <U+FB01>eld at which the elongation vanishes lies in the
stronger.   The <U+FB01>eld of maximum elongation for wolfram steel
is greater than for ordinary steel or iron, and that of no
elongation in the unannealed state is several times greater
than for iron or ordinary steel.  Such a <U+FB01>eld corresponds to
      ‘l-e-Z                      Fig.   1

                   the wolfram steel annealed the retraction

Length in     Iron, Steel, and Nickel Ovoids by Zlfagnetizatz'on. 333
characteristic as regards the <U+FB01>eld of no elongation becomes
exceedingly pronounced.          From the curve of length-change
it does not appear that it will ever cut the line of no elonga
tion, even in intense <U+FB01>elds.
    lVickel (<U+FB01>g. 1).—The behaviour of an annealed nickel ovoid
is nearly the same as observed by one of us.             With increasing
<U+FB01>eld the contraction reaches an asymptotic value, which in
the present case is greater than Bidwell’s result, obtained
from experiments on a nickel wire.               This discrepancy is to
be sought partly in the difference of shape, and partly in the
difference of treatment, as will be clearly illustrated by ex
periments on the change of volume. We have also reason
to believe that repeated annealing alters the elastic behaviour
of ferromagnetics as regards the strain wrought by mag
netization.
    The curves of elongation in iron and nickel plotted against
the intensity of magnetization are given by dotted lines in
<U+FB01>g. 1. The change of length at <U+FB01>rst takes place very slowly,
but on reaching saturation the rate of change becomes very
rapid.     So far as the present experiment goes, the rate does
not diminish except in annealed wolt'ram steel, in which we
notice a slight <U+FB02>attening.          In nickel we <U+FB01>nd a slight bend
when the magnetization becomes saturated.
                 Change   of Volume   by  Magnetization.
    Experiments by several physicists prove that magnetization
produces change of volume in ferromagnetics, in contradiction
to the popular belief, which is based on Joule’s experiment.
The alteration of volume accompanying the magnetization of
t'erromagnetics is generally very small in weak <U+FB01>elds ; but, as
will be seen from the present experiment, the phemonenon is
more marked as the <U+FB01>eld is made stronger.                    As we have
already     remarked,    the  change     of volume      as  measured      by
Cantone     *   with  an iron ovoid must        have   been   exceedingly
minute, as the magnetizing <U+FB01>eld was very small. Dr. Knott'l'
has published several papers on the change of internal volume
of ferromagnetic tubes, showing that iron, nickel, and cobalt
are subject to the change by magnetization.                As our result
regarding the same question was somewhat different, especially
in the case of nickel, we have thought it advisable to settle
the discrepancy by fresh experiments.

   steel, the effect of annealing is greater than in iron.                In
   strong <U+FB01>elds the volume-change of the annealed steel ovoid
   is nearly twice as great as in the unannealed state. Wolfram
   steel is very little affected b annealing as regards the volume
   change, but the change itse f is several times greater than in
   nickel or iron.      In fact, the motion of the capillary meniscus
   in the dilatometer can be easily followed by the naked eye.

      Nickel (<U+FB01>g. 2).—As specimens of nickel almost always
   contain traces of iron, the change of volume will probably
   depend on the chemical nature.                 In addition to this, the
   mechanical process which the metal underwent before it was
   brought to a form suitable for experiment must have subs

Length in Iron, Steel, and Nickel Ovoids by llfagnetization.           335
stantially altered its elastic behaviour.        The nickel rod which
we used in the former experiment was hammered from a
nickel plate to a prism of square cross-section.                   It con
 tained 1'75 per cent. of iron, besides traces of manganese
and carbon. The ovoids used in the present experiment were
 prepared from a thick plate, and were nearly pure nickel, the
quantity of iron which was present as impurity being im
measurably small.         As the material is likely to become
 homogeneous by repeated annealing, the ovoids were carefull
 annealed for about 50 hours.         The ovoid was wrapped wit]
 asbestos and placed in a thick metll tube, the interspace
 between the ovoid and the wall of the tube being <U+FB01>lled with
 <U+FB01>ne charcoal powder. The tube was then placed in a charcoal
 <U+FB01>re.    When the ovoid was annealed in this way, there was
 some trace of oxidation on its surface.                The change of
 volume after each annealing was examined, with a result that
 the process of annealing increases the effect.               It therefore
 appears that the previous history of the specimen exercises
 an important in<U+FB02>uence on the magnetization and on the
 dimensions of ferromagnetics as affected by magnetization.
 The anomaly in the length-change noticed by Bidwell in two
 specimens of nickel wire is probably not the effect of tem
 perature, but is to be ascribed to the cause above stated.
 In contradiction to our former result with a square prism, the
 ovoid showed increase of volume. The amount of increase
 was small compared with the decrease noticed in the previous
 experiment.     Cantone *‘ obtained tolerably large increase of
 volume in a nickel ovoid ; our former result was nearly half_
 as large, while in the present experiment there is a slight
 increase.    The discrepancy is probably due to the difference
 of treatment before the specimen was turned to the proper
 shape for experiment, and also to its chemical composition.
    The volume-change of ferromagnetics considered as a func
 tion of the magnetizing <U+FB01>eld takes place very slowly in weak
 <U+FB01>elds ; it then increases in a more rapid ratio till it reaches
      ‘
 the Wendepunkt’ ; then the change becomes slower, but goes
 on increasing nearly in a straight line. Up to H=2000
 there is no tendency to decrease in the rate of change. \Vith
 a still stronger <U+FB01>eld, the increase of volume will probably
 become more considerable.
    In our former experiment, the range of ‘the magnetizing
 force was con<U+FB01>ned to a few hundred c.G.s. units.                   In the
 present experiment,     the increased    <U+FB01>eld-strength      unveiled   the
“character  of the change    of volume    considered as      a  function of

       the intensity  of magnetization.    As will be seen from the
       curves (dotted lines in <U+FB01>g. 2), the increase in nickel and steel
       takes place quite slowly before the magnetization reaches
       saturation.  As soon as the magnetization reaches this state,
       the increase becomes very rapid, so that the branch of the
       curve ascends nearly parallel to the axis of volume increase.
       There we <U+FB01>nd that a slight increase in magnetization is
       attended with a large increase of volume.         As the rate of
       increase appears to be nearly constant it would be interesting
       if we could push the <U+FB01>eld-strength still farther, to see whether
       the volume-change ultimately attains an asymptotic value.

with the axis of H.             k” is at <U+FB01>rst negative, and attaining the
minimum value goes on gradually increasing till it becomes
greater than zero, and reaches a maximum of which the exact
position is very vague ; ultimately the curve for k” coincides
with that for k’. The position of the maximum for k' and that
of the minimum for It” lies nearly in the same <U+FB01>eld, which is
greater for wolfram steel than for soft iron, while that for
ordinary steel occupies an intermediate position.                           The abso
lute values of k' and k" are greater in iron than in steel.                        In
nickel, as already noticed, the values of k' and k” are far
greater than those for iron and steel, and, moreover, are of
opposite signs.          The maximum of Ir” or the minimum of k’
seems to lie in a weak <U+FB01>eld ; the rate of decrease or increase
is quite rapid, and the curves for k' and It” soon approach the
axis of H. Compared with the results of our former experi
ments, the absolute values of k' and k” are generally small for
iron, but far greater for nickel.                 This di<U+FB02>'erence arises from
 the fact that for iron the change of length in weak <U+FB01>elds is
less in this case than in the former experiment, and for nickel
the contrary is the case.                As regards the sign, these two
experiments show fair agreement.

340    Messrs.     N agaoka and Honda        on Change   of Volume and
   It will be seen from the above table that in iron and steel
there is increase of magnetization in low <U+FB01>elds till it reaches
a maximum, after which it gradually decreases.               The decrease
does not take place continuously, but reaches a maximum,
whence the magnetization begins to recover.                       Although
the former result here arrived at is the well-known Villari
effect, we do not know whether the maximum decrease
due to longitudinal stress has as yet been experimentally
ascertained.
   There is nothing remarkable in nickel.             Longitudinal pull
produces decrease of magnetization, which becomes gradually
less as the <U+FB01>eld-strength is increased.           This fact is so well
established by experiment that we need not enter into further
discussion of the subject.

change of magnetization 51 due to decrease of volume —a' by
hydrostatic pressure is given by

   As k’ +       is very small in nickel,      the effeet of hydrostatic
pressure is very small compared to that of longitudinal
pull. (See <U+FB01>g. 3, dotted-line.)            There is increase of mag
netization with the volume-contraction of the magnet. Such
an increase reaches a maximum in a low <U+FB01>eld, whence the
effect gradually diminishes.          Similar changes are also to be
noticed in iron and steel, quite contrary to experiment.               The
agreement       between      theory  and    experiment     is  very   close

a circular wire can be resolved in elongation and contraction
in directions perpendicular to each other and inclined to the
axis of the wire at 45°.          Taking these two principal axes of
strain for those of w and y, we obtain the following expressions

       Consequently the circular magnetization which will be
    called into play is equal to -§mr.k"H at distance r from
    the axis, the mean circular magnetization being —wR/c”H,
    where R denotes the radius of the wire.   The transient current
    which will be induced in the wire by suddenly twisting                                      it,   is
    proportional to k”H.
       Next suppose that the wire        traversed by an electric

                                        is           We therefore
    conclude that twisting the circularly magnetized wire gives
    rise to longitudinal magnetization proportional to k”C. Thus
    the circular magnetization produced         twisting     longi        by                a
    tudinally magnetized wire has reciprocal relation to the

       The view put forward by Prof. Ewingl' for explaining the
    existence of the transient current by means of wolotropic sus
    ceptibility    similar to what would follow from Kirchhotf’s

342        On Change of Volume and Length by Magnetization.
the   longitudinal magnetization is the same in iron, steel, and
 nickel.
     It has been established by G. Wiedemann“ that the longi
 tudinal magnetization produced by twisting iron wire traversed
 by an electric current is oppOsite to that in nickel.                  The
 opposite      character    of   the      transient current   in these two
 metals has also been observed by Zehnder‘l', and independently
 by one of us i. The existence of a maximum transient current
 in these two metals has also been clearly established by the
 latter, although there is some difference in the <U+FB01>eld-strength
 between iron and nickel.                It appears from the experiments
 of Dr. Knott§ that the area of the hysteresis-curve in the
 longitudinal magnetization produced by twisting circularly
 magnetized wire reaches a maximum as the <U+FB01>eld-strength is
increased; but on account of the feebleness of the current, the
 existence of the maximum in the longitudinal magnetization
 is not well established.          Judging from the course of the curve
 given by the same experimenter, it seems highly probable
 that the maximum would be reached if we could push the cir
cularly magnetizing force a little further. The conclusion
       is still an open question, although some experiments of
 Matteucci [I seem to corroborate the view above stated.
     Looking at the curves of k” H (<U+FB01>g. 3), we are struck with
the close resemblance of the curves representing the amount
of torsion produced by the combined action of the circular and
longitudinal magnetizing forces on a ferromagnetic wire. We
can no doubt coordinate the effect of torsion on a magnetized
wire with the Wiedemann effect.                  The discussion of the last
mentioned effect       we   hope      to  publish in the near future.
     In spite of the qualitative explanations which Kirchho<U+FB02>"s
theory a<U+FB02>'ords with regard to the etfeet of longitudinal pull, of
hydrostatic pressure in nickel, and of torsion, there are
instances in which the theory apparently fails in several
quantitative details, so that it necessarily calls for modi<U+FB01>cation.
We may remark that k’ and lc” are physically functions of the
strain, as borne out by the numerous experiments on the
e<U+FB02>'ect of stress on magnetization.                The present state of the
theory of magnetostriction may perhaps be compared with
that stage in the history of the theory of magnetism when the

XXXI.         Some Developments            in the Use of Price’s Guard- Wire
     in   Insulation Tests. By            Prof. W. E. AYRTON, F.R.S., and
     T. MATHER *.
          VE RYONE  who has to test very high resistances, such as
       those of short lengths of cable and of good joints in
insulated wires, cannot fail to appreciate theimmense advantage
of using Price’s “ Guard-“lire
                                     ” in
                                              eliminating errors due
                                                    'I'
to surface leakages.         Continued experience confirms the
opinion expressed        by one of us in the discussion on
Mr. Appleyard’s paper in .1896; and in our third paper on
Galvanometers, read before the Physical Sociel in May 1898              y        i,
we showed how the principle could be applied to galvano
meters, shunt-boxes, &c.
    For tests made              by
                            the “direct de<U+FB02>exion” method the
“              ”
  guard-wire      properly    applied affords complete protection
against   surface  leakage    where    the ends of the cable tested
are near the galvanometer, so that               possible to have the
                                                          it   is
wire connecting the conductor of the cable with the galvano
meter    terminal “air insulated.”           A dif<U+FB01>culty, however,
arises  when    the  ends   of  the   cable   are at a considerable
distance from the testing instrument; this may render “air
            ” of the
insulation             lead impossible, and so the leakage from
the lead must be measured and allowed for.              As this “lead
leakage” may     be as  large  as or   larger  than that  through the
mass of the insulation under test, the convenience and accuracy
of the measurement are somewhat impaired. It therefore
occurred to us that a guard-wire applied to the lead along its
entire length would prove of great value in cases such as
the one under consideration.         The most effective as well as
the simplest way of doing this             to use   isconcentric wire

    The arrangement     is   shown       symbolically                in the  sketch
 above.    It  will be readily understood that so long as the
 insulation resistance of the outer of the concentric is high
compared     with the internal resistance of the battery the
 method indicated gives complete protection against lead
 leakage and surface leakage, even if the concentric be laid
 along the ground for a considerable distance.
    Other instances in which special applications of the guard
 wire principle have been found convenient have arisen in
cases where it has been necessary to determine whether
a defective piece of cable was bad throughout, or bad owing
to one or more isolated faults.       When two tanks are available
and one of them can be moderately well insulated from
earth, the method of procedure is to coil about half the cable
in each tank, remove the metal sheathing (if any) from a short
length, say one inch, of the cable between the two tanks, and
connect the guard-wire with the insulated tank as well as

of the cable as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. In the case of braided and
other unsheathed cables, the covering of the portion between

          the two tanks need not be removed. An insulation test applied
          under the above conditions gives the resistance of the part of
          the cable in the earthed tank, and      comparison of this with
                                                                a
          the insulation resistance of the whole will show whether one
tau-wu   half  is worse than the other half.   By repeating this test with
          say one quarter of the cable in the earthed tank, and the
         remainder in the other tank, the question of local r. general
         leakage may be decided.                                          _
             Instead of two tanks, two drums, one of which can be
         fairly well insulated, might be employed, or one drum and
         one tank used, for we <U+FB01>nd that after the braiding of a cable has
         been thoroughly wetted       acts as a fair conductor for several

         immersion        conducive
                              is        to   constancy of temperature.
         Suf<U+FB01>cient connexion     with  the wet braiding can be made
         by wrapping bare wire round it.                        If
                                                  the cable be long this
         may be done at several places along its length.
            By employing the two drums above mentioned faults in
         braided and other unsheathed cables can be readily localized,
         without in any way injuring thevcable.        After connecting
         the guard-wire with the insulated drum the wetted cable                          is
         wound from the earthed drum to the insulated one, the galva
         nometer being connected with the inner conductor during
         the process.    When the fault passes to the insulated drum
         a sudden diminution of de<U+FB02>exion occurs.
            In some cases we have only used one tank (the earthed
         one in fig.    in testing part of
                             2)             coil of cable, the remainder

         between two tables.      By inserting metal sheets connected
         with the guard-wire between the beam and the tables errors
         which might otherwise arise from surface leakage are elimi
         nated.                                                                       .

appear   less than its true value.    If, however, the two tests
give about the same result (care having been taken to pro
perly discharge the cable between them) we have proof that
the effect of surface leakage is inappreciable.   It is frequently
more expeditions to make the two tests above mentioned than
to clean and coat the ends with paraf<U+FB01>n-wax in such a
way as to make one feel con<U+FB01>dent that no surface leakage
exists.
   In making     the guard-wire measurements it is desirable to
put  the  guard   as near the braiding or sheathing as practi
cable,   consistent  with keeping the resistance between the
guard-wire and the sheathing high compared with that of
the battery.      By so doing any error due to the guard-wire
is lessened, for the path over which surface leakage can
occur is made as long as possible and nearly equal to that
over which leakage takes place when no guard-wire is used.
An approximate correction is then possible, even when the
two tests with and without the guard-wire do not give the
same result.
   Suppose, for example, the swing of the galvanometer
needle on the <U+FB01>rst charge is s, divisions, and 82, s3 were the

by the expression

charge     insulation test in the following way.      Instead of
maintaining the potential of the guard-wire constant, while
that of the insulated conductor is steadily falling, cause the
potential of the guard-wire to fall at the same rate as that of
the insulated conductor.   Then no electricity can pass between
the conductor and the guard-wire, and surface leakage will
be absolutely prevented.
   A potentiometer and an electrostatic voltmeter can be con
veniently employed in carrying out this experiment, and it is
interesting to remember that the Thomson and Varley poten
tiometer was originally devised for the special object of
enabling the potential of one conductor to be made to
diminish as the potential of another conductor steadily fell

       XXXII.       The Frequency of Transverse        Vibrations of a
    Stretched   Inzliaruhber Cord.         By T.   J.  BAKER, B.Sc.*
            writer has observed        that the pitch of the note pro
 THEduced           by twanging an indiarubber band which is
 stretched     over the <U+FB01>ngers is influenced but little by the
 tension, particularly if this is considerable.
     The matter appeared worthy of further investigation; and
 for this purpose a short piece of indiarubber cord, of square
 section, was attached at one end to the middle of a tambourine
 diaphragm, while the other end was bound to a piece of twine
 which passed over a pulley-wheel and supported a weighed
 scale-pan.
     After placing a weight in the pan, the rubber was allowed
 to stretch for some minutes, and then the end nearest the
 pan was <U+FB01>rmly clamped.               The intensity of the note pro
 duced by transverse vibrations of the cord was rendered
 suf<U+FB01>ciently great by the tambourine to permit a determi
 nation of pitch by comparison with a sonometer and tuning
 fork.
     The sectional area of the cord under the various tensions
 employed was determined by measurements of its two dia
 meters at three different points in its length.
     For this purpose a micrometer-gauge reading to '001 cm.
 was employed.         The observations were continued until the
cord broke. This happened when its length had increased
six-fold.     The 38 sets of values thus obtained were plotted on
squared paper, and three curves were drawn showing the
relation between—

348       Mr. T.  J.  Baker on the  Frequency of Transverse
which these curves effect was found of advantage in the
calculations hereafter referred to.
    Inspection of the curve connecting length with tension
reveals that the relation is strictly linear between those points
at which the length of the cord becomes respectively 2% and
5 times its natural length.
    Untrustworthy readings were obtained with further stretch
ing because an increase of tension did not produce its full
effect until a very considerable time had elapsed.       With the
smaller stretchings this dif<U+FB01>culty was not encountered.
    The curve connecting length with frequency shows that
while the cord was doubling its natural length the pitch of
its note was rising rapidly; but that further extension was
practically without effect.
    When the cord had doubled its natural length, its frequency
of vibration was 91; and when its original length had been
sextupled the frequency was not more than 94.
    The discussion which follows relates to the conditions pre
vailing during the period in which length and tension are
 connected linearly.
    Since the observations show that equal increments of tension
 (between the limits above mentioned) produce equal extensions;
 and at the same time the sectional area is diminishing, it
 appears that the value of Young’s modulus must increase
 with increasing extension.
    Experiments have been made on this point by Villari
 (Pogg. Ann. cxliii.), by Rontgen (ibid. clix.), and by Mallock
 (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1889) ; but beyond ascertaining that
 Young’s modulus increases rapidly with increase of extension
 no de<U+FB01>nite relations appear to have been discovered.
     The values of the modulus for the cord used in these expe
 riments were therefore calculated by the use of curves
 and (ii.).
     In each case an extension of 1 cm. was chosen, and the
 increase of tension required to produce this was 16 grams
 wei ht.
     The mean value of the sectional areas before and. after each
 increase of tension was used in the calculation; and for this
 purpose curve (iii.) was employed.
     When the results are tabulated, it becomes apparent that
  Young’s modulus is proportional to the square of the stretched
 length  of the cord.
     The last column in the table exhibits this relation.

  An equation of this general shape is undoubtedly true,
but it has not the meaning which they assign to it.
  The H may refer to a particular junction, and in certain
cases does, but the E does not.       The E means the total
         of the complete circuit, always.
  I  venture to think that this will not be disputed, if the
matter be for a few moments carefully attended to.         To
assist attention we may go carefully over some elementary
ground—so elementary that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to secure for it that
amount of attention which is necessary for clearness.
   The thermoelectric power of a metal A at various tempe
ratures means the function which is plotted in an ordinary
thermoelectric diagram,-with temperatures as abscissae, rela
tively to some standard metal (lead) taken as the line of
reference or constant zero of thermoelectric power.

    Controversy also begins in respect of the function            *.
 There are those who decline to take     an  agnostic position with
 respect to the absolute value, or second limit, of this function,
 and who say that it represents absolutely the Volta contact
 force; that       the E.M.F. observed in the dielectric space
                    is,
 between two metals when         metallic circuit

 dielectric portion of a circuit, and       has no apparent con
 nexion with thermoelectricity; hence, those who assert that
 this great       E.M.F.    is   represented     by

   represent only the rate at which this E.M F. varies with

  let the copper be cut across in the middle, so that an inde
  pendent               can be introduced by wire electrodes and a
  current maintained across the two junctions.            “ The Peltier
  heat produced where the current passes from iron to copper
  is manifestly not the thermal equivalent of the work done.”
   [This sentence is ambiguous.             It may mean the “work
  done
          ” on the whole circuit, in which case it is true ; it ma '
                               ”
  mean the “work done             precisely at the junction, in which
  case   I  should say that   the word “ not ” ought to be omitted.
  The immediate context suggests the former interpretation; the
 next succeeding context suggests the latter.          The immediate
 context runs as follows]
      “In fact, if the two junctions be at equal temperatures,
 the amounts of Peltier heat produced and absorbed at the
 two junctions will be equal, and the work done by the
 independent E.M.F. will be spent solely in the frictional
 generation of heat.”        [This is undeniable, though not appa
 rently to the point ; but the next section continues]
     “Many recent writers, overlooking . . . obvious prin
 ciples, have assumed that the Peltier evolution of heat is
 the thermal equivalent of E.M.l". at the junction.             And in
 consequence much confusion, in respect to Volta’s contact
 electricity and its relation to thermoelectric currents, has
 clouded the views of teachers and students.            We <U+FB01>nd over
 and over again the statement that thermoelectric E.M.F.
is very much smaller than the Volta contact E.M.F. of dry
metals.       The truthis,   Volta E.M.F.   is  found between metals
all of one temperature, and      is     reckoned in volts, or fractions
of   a   volt, without reference to temperature.”          [Certainly]
“ If   it  varies with temperature, its variations may be stated
in   fractions ofa     volt per degree.”      [By all means]      “ On
the other hand, thermoelectric E.M.F. depends essentially on
zlzl'ference of temperature"         [the thermoelectric force of   a
complete       metallic  circuit  does,   and not the thermoelectric
force at any particular junction; that depends on the
temperature of the 'unction, and cannot be affected by the
temperature somew ere else] “and                 is essentially to be
reckoned per degree; as, for example, in fraction of a volt
per degree.”        [Not so an electromotive force of any kind
                             ;
whatever must be reckoned in volts.              Volts per degree  is
not E.M.F., but   is     the so-called relative thermoelectric power
of two metals]

“admirable discovery            that is really the central feature of this part
of the controversy.           For there are three, at least three, modes of
regarding it :—
     1st. A convection      of heat pure and simple—electricity acting. as a
fluid with a positive or negative speci<U+FB01>c heat, and conveying heat down
 or up a tem erature gradient.
     2nd. An 1.l\I.F. acting in metal from hot to cold or from cold to hot, and
 thereby either opposin or assisting the passage of a current, in the one
 case developing extra        ocal heat, in the other case consuming heat or
 developing local cold, proportional to the local             and the current.
     And this 2nd mode has two subdivisions z-The E.M.F. thus supposed
 to exist from end to end of a metal bar with its ends at di<U+FB01>'erent tempe
 ratures, may display itself :—
 either (a) as a gradient of potential in the air outside, detectable by an
                 abnormally    sensitive electrometer-needle,    but never yet
                 observed;
        or (b) as a change in the step of otential from metal to air, accord
                 ing to the temperature of t e metal; the air-potential outside
                 bemg left uniform.
     But   there is yet the third method of regardinrr the whole matter :—
     3rd.   As a mere modi<U+FB01>cation of the junction E.M.F. with temperature,
  so that the Peltier function, which had been of the value Mao—t), is
  modi<U+FB01>ed by addition of a term ékt'i, so that it becomes kt(t0— {,t).
     On this plan, no E.M.F. of any kind is supposed to exist in the single
  metal itself, no more than when its tem erature was uniform, all the
             is thrown upon the junctions; the E.M.F. of the circuit is simply
 the difference of the junction-forces, as it would have been had there
  been no Thomson e ect; but each junction-force, by reason of the
  Thomson effect, has somehow attained a uadratic term ; their dil'l'erence
  therefore permits thermoelectric reversa s and the observed law of the
  thermoelectric circuit, for subtracting the two junction-forces we get
                                  E=k (t1_t2)   (to—Z)
  This third mode is evidently the way in which several philosophers have
  been accustomed to regard the matter; and on the hypothesis that
  junction-forces in a metallic circuit are due to the a<U+FB01>init of metals for
  each other, it is natural to locate all the E.M.F. at the junction of two
  different metals, and to deny any E.M.F. between different parts of
   one and the same metal at different tem eratures.           (This is very dif
  ferent from the experimental fact that t e resultant E.M.F. round a
  homogeneous metallic circuit is zero.)         Those who regard the junction
  forces as physical would naturally take a different view.        For instance,
  take Helmholtz’s hypothesis of a speci<U+FB01>c attraction of metals for elec
  tricity, the same being a function of temperature: a differential attraction
  between the hot and cold ends of a bar would be just as essential as a
  diti'erential attraction at the 'unction of metals of dilferent kinds.   It has
  been asserted that Helmholtz’s view tends to concentrate the force at
  the junctions and to make the Peltier heat proportional to the rate of
  variation of the local junction-force with tern erature. But even if it does,
  and later we will show that it does not, no view makes this junction-forcev

    360             Prof. O. Lodge      on the Controversy
        And in case anything that        I can say can make the matter
     clearer,  I would reassert that since E.M.F. is work per unit
     charge conveyed, not only for the whole circuit but for any
     portion of a circuit, and since a unit charge conveyed across
    a junction develops an amount of heat            in,    it follows that
    the physical             located at that junction is measured by
    and is equal to    $JH     (assisting the current in one direction
    and thereby consuming heat or developing cold, opposing it
    in the other direction and therefore developing extra heat) ;
    unless some other mode of accounting for the appearance or
   non~appearance of the reversible heat is devised, or unless
    the reversible energy takes some other form than heat.
        Wherever energy appears or disappears in a circuit, there,
   in that place, must be located an                    1t ma be, so to
   speak, the frictional E.M.F. appropriate to Ohm s law in a
   homogeneous conductor; it may be the chemical E.M.F. at
   a <U+FB02>uid or semi<U+FB02>uid junction discovered by Volta ; or it may
   be the contact-force at a solid junction, of which the integral
   round a whole circuit of non-uniform temperature was dis
   covered by Seebeck, the locality of part of that E.M.F. by
   Peltier, and the locality and existence of the rest of that
              by Lord Kelvin.
       At a chemical junction the reversible energy need not all
  of it or much of it take the form of heat, and in that case the
  major part of the E.M.F. may be rightly called chemical, not
  physical; but at a metallic junction, as in a homogeneous
  conductor, heat is usually the only form of energy expected
  or observed, and in that case wherever the E.M.F. is located
  there the heat or cold must appear.          The ordinary way out of
  this conclusion is to suppose that electricity is a <U+FB02>uid with a
  real speci<U+FB01>c heat whose value changes from metal to metal, so
  that heat can be evolved or absorbed at a junction by a sudden
  change in the heat-capacity of the electric <U+FB02>uid <U+FB02>owing across
 the same as the Volta effect, or suggests that the Volta effect has any
 thing to do with the matter ; except on the hypothesis that the air layer
 intervening when a metallic junction is broken is utterly inert and
 im otent.
      t is no argument in favour of the impotence of the air layer to say
that it produces no apparent effect when 1t bathes the metal uniformly
all round; the question is what it does when uniformity all round does
not exist.    Balanced forces are not the same thing as no force, although
they produce the same zero accelerative effect. Nor does the absence of
acceleration prove the absence of all force.   A body subject to balanced
forces and obeying the <U+FB01>rst law of motion is a frequent spectacle—a
railway train or a snow<U+FB02>ake for instance—but a body subject to no forces
is decidedly rare.

continuous but temperature.      Each metal, referred to the standard, has
a certain thermoelectric   power at each temperature, and accordingly the

this precaution, t e integration can proceed over a discontinuity at every

either reference must be made to the real temperature of different parts
of the circuit, or else the simple plan of referring everything to a hypo

 same thing to hold for a dielectrically closed circuit of uniform
 temperature likewise. The argument in this case he considers
 quite rigorous, because there is now no questionable gradient

 of whether such effect he accidental or essential.

 uniform.
    It unimportant for the present argument, but may be worth while

been proved for     complex circuit in which differences of temperature are
                       a
superposed upon other sources of electromotive force. And from what
 has been said in similar small type just above, no such relation can truly
be asserted, without considerable care as to the form of the statement.

   It may be said that these two meanings are after all the same: and
so they are in      simple circuit of two metals, but not in

   But what has all this to do with the localisation of E.M.F.

364             Prof. O. Lodge on    the Controversy
only at a metallic junction does e=H individually.            At an
electrolytic or dielectric or what        I  may call a chemical
junction, that is one with chemical potentialities, the E.M.F.
is not purely thermal, and hence is not measured by the
 Peltier effect; it is chie<U+FB02>y of chemical origin and is calculable
 from the energy of combination of the materials on either
 side the boundary.
     Observe  I do not say that at such a junction there need be
 any chemical action (at least not any completed chemical
 combination in the ordinary sense) to account for the E.M.F.,
 but there is the possibility of chemical combination; and
 there will be actual chemical combination if a <U+FB01>nite quantity
 of electricity is transmitted across it. For conduction in an
 electrolyte is convective in its nature; whatever electricity
 travels, the material atoms travel with it ; and the travelling
 of oppositely charged ions in opposite directions involves
 chemical action at a liquid junction, involves transfusion of
 substance, involves what is practically, and may be actually,
 chemical recombination.        Possibly something of the same
 sort may be said, less positively, about electric displacement
 at a dielectric boundary.
     But at a metallic junction there is no such chemical
 potentiality.    You may pass a strong current across a zinc
 copper junction for years and you will not get any brass.         I
 would not deny that there may be a kind of material or
 “corpuscular” interchange even here: in fact in the light of
 recent most interestin work by      J. J.  Thomson it is probable ;
 but the corpuscles tlgrown across the junction from zinc
  become copper; and vice versa, those dissociated           from a
  copper atom settle into their new places as part of a zinc
  atom; there may thus be a tendency to an ineffective kind
  of transmutation, but there is no tendency to alloy. (See end
  of Chapter IV.)                                          .
     Why then if a metallic junction is chemically inert should
  it ever be held that the chemical a<U+FB02>inity of zinc for copper is
  the propelling influence which causes the E.M.F. located at
  such a junction?      What has ordinary chemistry got to do
  with this metallic E.M.F. P     I echo the question, and proceed
 to my second chapter.
                             CHAPTER    II.
                   The facts of Contact Electricity.
     Some   people   (for whom    I have a great respect), on the
  strength of the     fact that  metals in contact attract each
  other,  maintain    that this accounts for     their tendency   to

                 concerning     Volta’s Contact Force.                     365
combine and for their heats of combination, as well as for the
value of their contact
    Now, that metals in contact attract each other                 I
                                                                  fully
admit.      They   must,  because   they   are  oppositely charged.
 There was a time when people disputed the fact of the Volta
effect, but I  am not one of those, and never was.            All the
facts by which Lord Kelvin or anyone else properly dis
plays the Volta effect I fully admit, and am accustomed to
show to my class; though indeed in Lord Kelvin’s Friday
evening Royal Institution discourse (Phil. Mag. July 1898)
they are described anew with admirable clear-ness and pre
cision.    To avoid any possible mistake on this score,            willI
brie<U+FB02>y recapitulate the facts.
    Dry zinc and copper in dry air brought into contact
become oppositely charged.          Iftheir surfaces are arranged
so as to form a condenser of reasonable capacity, the charges
may be large.      When they are separated adroitly, the charges
 remain on the metals and raise them to a high (numerical)
potential which may readily be displayed by an electrometer
 or even a gold-leaf electroscope.
    A trace of moisture, e. of liquid electrolytic moisture, not
                          z'.
dry vapour, may be fatal to the success of this experiment;
 for
   if a   drop of liquid intervenes and connects the two metals
momentarily, after the true metallic contact has been broken,
nearly all their charge leaks across this conducting-bridge                  ;
 and the resulting charge, and therefore the resulting poten
tial of the separated plates,      is extremely small.       A water
junction between two plates has no appreciable power of
 charging them oppositely; practically no more power than
 air has.    In many respects      a water intervention acts very
like an air intervention  ;  in one respect only does    it strikingly
 di<U+FB01>'er :—its conductivity enables       itto abolish any effective
 display of the opposite charges otherwise produced, e. g. by
 metallic contact.    The same detrimental in<U+FB02>uence            exerted
                                                              is
by the conductivity    induced   in  air  subjected to  the  action  of
 .r- or of uranium rays;      such air behaves precisely like a
badly conducting electrolyte.        Nothing further need be said
to make clear the action of metallic uranium for present
purposes.
   It remarkable, in practice, how imperceptibly minute the
     is
quantity of liquid may be, in order thus to act detrimentally.
But after all   it only
                     is   aquestion of arithmetic :—
   Let  2  be the average thickness of dielectric intervening
between the zinc-copper plates, during their so-called close
contact, everywhere except at the place where they really
effectively, i.e. metallically, last touch as they are being

366               Prof. O. Lodge on the Controversy
separated ; and let 2! be the distance between the same sur
faces at the instant when the hypothetical moist or liquid
connexion is likewise last broken ; then in the dry case the
resultant charge is inversely proportional to 2, being in fact
                      7.2
of the order      —
                            electrostatic units, for the 'usual case of
                 12002
 circular    disks; whereas   in the moist case         must be sub
                                                        2’
stituted for 2.
    Now very minute drop of liquid pulls out before
           a                                                     snapsit
into a column 1r tenths of millimetre long, which then repre
                                 z a
sents   2'
        ;  whereas the dry      may be     tenth or even hundredth
                                               a                  a
of this magnitude, with well-made plates and careful mani
pulation.
 I    have emphasised this to negative any possible idea that              I
regard moisture as an adverse fetish, acting discontinuously.
It is   better away; but,        ifexists, its detrimental effect
                                      it                             a     is
mere arithmetical affair.
    No one,    I  hope, can now suppose that            imagine that

                                               it
the Volta effect       diminished.
                       is
 I    say once more—in accordance,I believe,with everybody:—
    (1) Two metals connected wholly or partly                by
                                                         liquid are in
approximately     the  same   electrical  condition  as       if
                                                            connected
wholly    or  partly by air. They do not become oppositely
charged unless they are at one (or more) point metallically
connected: then they do: and in order to be able fully to
display this charge on separation, the persistently-connecting
medium must be insulating, that               must be dry, i.e. free
                                               is
from liquid.        It must also be free from high-frequency
aetherial radiation or other ionising influence.
    (2) If the metals are connected bot/r metallically and electro
lytically, metallically at one place and electrolytically at
another, we have          common voltaie cell and
                            a                              continuous

current.
    (3) To complete the statement :—If the metals are con

                  concerning        Volta’s Contact Force.        367
nected    both metallically and dielectrically, that is if they are
insulated from each other except at one point where the
intervening dielectric is swept away, we have the normal

is,   agradient of potential in the dielectric between them.
    The safest and clearest mode of expression          what
                                                         is   I have
used     the Volta effect consists in an opposite charge acquired

which results from an E.M.F. of value depending on the con
dition of their outer surfaces, and controlled solely by this
           and the electrostatic capacity.
I      here avoid any statement involving the term metallic
potential, because   it  open to misconception owing to variety
                          is
 of de<U+FB01>nition. Some people prefer to say that zinc and copper
 in contact are at different potentials, whereas       prefer to say
                                                       I
 that they are at the same potential so long as they are in con
 tact but no one can deny that they are oppositely charged.
      :
    Some people, again, prefer to say that they are oppositely
charged by reason of an E.M.F. at the junction, which
 keeps them at different potentials:         prefer to say that their
                                              I
 charges are distributed so as to enable them to remain at the
 same potential, in spite of      difference in the speci<U+FB01>c Volta

 force existing at the dielectric boundary of each; in other
 words, that the                 at their surface; but again, no
                                    is
 one can deny that there exists in the dielectric between
 them       gradient of potential, the natural result of their
              a
 opposite charges   ;which same gradient can cause           charged
                                                              a
 electrometer needle to move, even without the magni<U+FB01>cation
 of potential caused       separation. In fact the magni<U+FB01>cation
                          by
 of potential by separation does not (within limits) increase the
 gradient, for the potential rises as the capacity diminishes,
 and so remains in direct proportion to their distance apart,
 so long as that distance     moderate.
                                is
    Nor can anyone deny that oppositely charged bodies, or
 surfaces between which there          gradient of potential, attract
                                         is
                                          a
 each other.    Hence, indirectly,     pivce of zinc attracts a piece
                                          a
 of copper with which          at any point in contact; and the
                               it   is
 attraction increases as the square of the potential gradient, and
 therefore as the square of the nearness together of the opposed
 or condenser surfaces.
    Signor Majorana (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1899) has designed
 some simple methods for displaying this attraction, one of them
 the same as a method     I had used for displaying the attraction
 of two metals exposed to Hertz radiation just before cohesion;

  but what has all this to do with the location of contact force
  at one junction rather than at another?                   What bearing has
  it upon the present controversy?                So far as   I  see, none.
                         I
      And further, would ask, what has this dielectric attraction
  got to do with the heat of formation of brass? But in asking
  this last question Ido not pretend that it is an easy one, and I
   would not dogmatise as to the answer. The question is brie<U+FB02>y
   treated at the end of the present chapter.                  I   only wish to
  indicate at this stage that the answer to the question is open
  to doubt, and that it must not be taken as indisputable that
  the heat of combination of metals has any connexion with their
  voltaic force, or with their thermoelectric force either.
       There was a time when l fancied that though the heat of
   formation of brass had no connexion with the Volta force,
   yet it might have some connexion with the thermoelectric
   force of contact, or, let us say, the Peltier effect.               This idea,
   too,  I  wish to abandon“, and for the same reason, viz., that if
   metallic a<U+FB01>inity were an ef<U+FB01>cient agent in propelling the
   current, then       I should expect the transmission of the current
   to result in some formation of alloy.                    Conceivably some
   secondary       influence  may    mask    the  display  of this result ; and
,  ifthenumerical determinations of metallic heats of combination
   correspond, when reduced to volts, with the E.M.F. anyhow
   observed in connexion with circuits or partial circuits formed
   of those metals, that would be a striking coincidence and one
  to be carefully considered.             So far as     I  am aware, no such
   coincidence has yet been indisputably discovered, even with
  a single pair of metals.                                                    I
      Experiments on heats of metallic combination have been
   made by Sir W. Roberts-Austen, by Dr. Galt, by Mr. F.
  J.    Baker, and by Mr.            J.   B. Tayler.        Doubtless also by
   other workers whom I forget at the moment or do not know
  of. The results obtained are not yet free from doubt and
   difference of opinion. Some of the results agree neither with
  the Volta nor the thermoelectric forces ; and this discordance
  is what     I expect will ultimately be believed.               On the other
  hand,     some     determinations     of the  heat  of  alloying of zinc and
  copper, taken in conjunction with the customary estimate of
  the size of atoms, do appear approximately to coincide with
  the order of magnitude of the Volta contact-force.                    (See end
  of   this  chapter.)
      If this is truly so, it is very remarkable, and must greatly
  strengthen the ground of those commonly called “contact
  theorists.”         It would seem unlikely to be the result solely of

accident.     On the other hand, it is undeniable that (either
 accidentally or otherwise) the order of magnitude of the Volta
 force can be calculated from the differential heats of com
 bination of the metals for oxygen; which may be written
 (Zn, O)-—(Ou, 0). Hence, if it turns out that it can likewise
be calculated from the heat of formation of brass (Zn, On), it
 will be either an odd coincidence or it will have an important
chemical meaning with regard to heats of combination or
 chemical a<U+FB01>inities in general.
    One way of putting its meaning may be that it tends to
 strengthen what      I may call von Helmholtz’s hypothesis *,
 which can be stated roughly thus :—-That the metals do not
 really attract oxygen, nor do they really attract each other,
 but that what they attract is electricity; that all chemical
attraction, apparently of matter for matter, is the consequence
of this real attraction of matter for electricity, the atoms being
electrically charged. Further, that the Volta effect is caused,
simply enough, by the differential attraction of zinc and copper
for electricity.      The orthodox way of putting it is as
follows :-——The zinc attracts positive electricity most ; hence,
when they are put into contact, electricity <U+FB02>ows across the
junction and the zinc becomes positive and the copper nega
tive. Another way of putting it is to say that the zinc free
surface attracts negative electricity most, and accordingly
pulls it in from the space around as soon as the uniformity
of the force is anywhere interfered with by an inert metallic
contact.     In either case its ready oxidisability by negative
ions is thus explained, and has not to be taken as an inde
pendent fact or basis.       Whereas, then, 1 had proposed to
calculate the Volta etfect as (Zn, O)—-(Ou, O), on this view
it would have to be reckoned as (Zn,E)—(Ou,E); though
what is to be considered precisely as meant by E may be
matter for further consideration.         I am not going to say
anything against this far-reaching hypothesis in a hurry. 1t

demands separate treatment in the light of electron theory.
    This is what  I intended when I admitted it possible that, as
Lord Kelvin     said, I had too great a veneration for the need
for oxygen in this connexion.        The sole reason why 1 think
that it is probably the oxygen <U+FB01>lm and not the aether dis
continuity which causes the force, is that its magnitude cor
responds so closely, not only in order of magnitude but in
relative details, with the appropriate energy of oxidation. At
the same time, if the electrical attraction is the cause of
oxidation tendency, this quantitative relation is not likely to
afford any means of discrimination.

370                   ~Prof. O. Lodge     on the Controversy
    The evidence that leads Lord Kelvin to the conclusion
that the aether or space or vacuum is just as effective (or
ineffective) as oxygen, is derived from such experiments as
those of Bottomley (see also von Zahn, &c.) to the effect that
the Volta force continues unchanged in a vacuum : that an
alteration of the metals affects its value largely, but that
                                                                                    '
a change of the surrounding medium does not matter, unless
it actually corrodes the metals and spoils them.
    But this evidence derived from experiments on vacua has
never seemed to me conclusive, because nothing like a real
vacuum is ever attained, and even if it were, it is known with
what surprising tenacity ancient air-<U+FB01>lms cling to solid sur
faces; the gaseous substance within molecular range of the
solid substance“ being almost a part of it and not readily
changed.       It clings by cohesion, just as the parts of the solid
substance itself cling.        It is subject to Laplace’s K, enormous
molecular pressure; Mere exhaustion, lessening the pressure
by one atmosphere, hardly disturbs it.
    It was the extreme di<U+FB01>iculty of making experiments in
vacuum and substituted-media crucial that long ago deterred
me from attempting them.             Mr.   J.Brown attempted some ’ ;
and now fortunately Mr. Spiers has made a brave and dis
tinctly successful attempt in the same direction, an attempt
that will, I hope, be persisted in          1’.
    That the free or bounding surface of the metal has some
thing to do with the Volta effect, at least in modifying its
value,  is   proved not only by the long-known observations,
say, of Ayrton        Perry, of Pellat and others, on the effect of
                      &

  §  To this I   should like to      that the gigantic differences of otential
caused by the contact and separation of insulators, or of        ameta and an
insulator, e. g. the contact and separation of mercury or tin amalgam and

indirectly concerned with the zinc~copper junction and the
contact-force there located‘.              I should say that so great a
variation, caused by a slight change of surface, shows that
there is something already going on at the metal-air surface
to vary.      I   am not aware of anything that can be done to
a metal-metal junction that will affect the Volta force—except
 of course heating it. Lord Kelvin, however, would say, I
 suppose, something like this :——In a simple Volta electro
 static arrangement there are three boundaries, zinc/copper,
 copper/aether,      nether/zinc,   and there is a contact-force at
 each.      The Volta effect observed is the sum of the three.
 Its seat is mainly at the zinc-copper junction; it is due
 to the attraction of the two metals for each other, and its
 value is calculable approximately from their energy of com
 bination.      The effect of any contact—force there may be at the
 other boundaries is to modify the observed magnitude ofthis
 true and chief Volta force. The Volta force also varies in a
 subordinate manner with temperature, and hence there is a
 minute reversible Peltier evolution of heat at the zinc-copper
 junction whenever a current passes.                 [End of hypothetical

                                Size of Atoms.
      The doctrine of Lord Kelvin about the energy of attraction
  of plates of molecular thinness approaching each other to
  within molecular distance and so virtually forming an alloy,
  though admirably ingenious, proves as it seems to me too
  much, i.e. gives too sharp an upper limit to molecular dimen
  sions ; for, as he shows with great clearness in a table in his
  Royal Institution discourse already often quoted, the estimate
  of 10“9 cm. for molecular thinness and distance would cause
  the combining metals to rise to a temperature of 7900° C.,
  or more than the probable temperature of the sun 1 Yet
     * The following quotation from Lord Kelvin’s Royal Institution
  Lecture may be made :—The result of the burnishing experiments “ shows
  that the potential in zinc (uniform throughout the homogeneous interior)
  increases from the interior through the thin surface-layer of a portion of
  its surface affected by the crushing of the burnisher, more by '32 volt
  than through any thin surface-layer of portions of its surface left as
  polished and scratched by glass-paper.”        If I  may say so,   I  should
  express this fact in exactly the same way, viz. that the natural p0tential~
   di<U+FB02>'erence between clean scratched zinc and dry air can be increased one
   third of a volt by burnishing its surface with a steel tool (a remarkable
   fact and one not easy to explain).   But  I should not go on, as the next
   sentence goes on :—“The difference of potentials of copper and zinc
   across an interface of contact between them is only about 2% times the
   ditference of potential thus proved to be produced between the h0mo~
   geneous interior of the zinc and its free surface, by the burnishing.”

  372            Prof. O. Lodge on     the Controversy
  there is nothing out of the way in a molecular estimate of
  10-9. On the other hand, an estimate of 10—8 yields a rise of
  temperature of 79°, which appears to agree very well with
  the order of magnitude (36° Roberts-Austen, 77° Dr. Galt)
  obtained in actual experiments on the heat of formation of a
  zinc-copper alloy, a truly remarkable coincidence.            One,
  however, that would be spoilt if the molecular-dimensions’
  estimate were only halved, for the theoretical rise would then
 be over 300°.
     With deference    I submit that the air-<U+FB01>lms, with which the
 metals employed in ordinary voltaic experiments are cer—
 tainly coated, ought to be left on them for the data to be
 applicable; and in that case, when the molecular approach is
 made, the metals are not so much alloyed as burnt ; so that
 a rise of temperature of several hundred degrees is reasonable,
 and a corresponding molecular estimate of say half 10'8 is also
 reasonable and likely.       But in the metallurgical making of
 brass it is not to be supposed that the metals entering into
 combination are coated with air-<U+FB01>lms of any importance, for
 their proportion of free surface is insigni<U+FB01>cantly            small.
 Hence I think the Volta effect has nothing really to do with
 the making of brass.
     To carry out the above combustion process, that is the voltaic
 approach of metallic foil of molecular thickness and its
 investing oxygen coat, it is not necessary to complicate matters
 by using two metals; and in the Phil. Mag. for May 1885,
 p. 364,   I endeavoured to make a somewhat precise estimate
 of molecular magnitudes in this way, and even to discriminate
 between the molecular dimensions of different metals, since .z'
 comes out proportional to the square root of the atomic weight
 divided by the square root of the density and multiplied by
 the square root of the heat of oxidation.
                             CHAPTER   III.
       Statement  of the present condition of the Controversy.
    The 0p osing sides of the old controversy used to be called
contact t eorists and chemical theorists. If this were ever
a correct designation it is not the correct designation now.
    There is an E.M.F. at a junction of two media, and this
may be called the E.M.F. of contact, without any view as to
its origin or magnitude.
    This contact             may be caused in a chemical or in a
physical manner. It is generally admitted,           I believe, that
the E.M.F.s concerned in thermoelectricity are caused in a
physical manner.                                  I
                       It is generally admitted, believe (I think

                corweminy      Volta’ 8 Contact Force.                  373
the statement   will not be objected to in substance         though its
purposely crude wording may be criticised), that the E.M.F.s
concerned in Volta contact electricity, as well as in ordinary
voltaic electricity, are caused in a chemical manner.          In
saying this   I am   not  intending any controversy,     am  I
                                                             only
trying to state. The best plan perhaps at this stage is to be
more explicit.
     Ihold that Volta forces can be calculated, as regards their
major part, from the di<U+FB01>'erential energy of combination of the
metals with oxygen (or other active surrounding element),
and      I
        have justi<U+FB01>ed this, more or less completely, by nume
rical calculations (B. A. Report, 1884 ; Phil. Mag. April 1885,
§17, pp. 272, 274. &c.) based upon the great fundamental
voltaic-cell paper of Lord Kelvin in 1851.
    Lord Kelvin, on the other hand, holds that the Volta force
can be calculated as regards its major part from the chemical
affinity of metals for each other, or, to be speci<U+FB01>c, from the
energy of combination of zinc with copper in the formation
of brass.    It is true that for the calculation to be made in
this order,  an estimate of molecular dimensions must be postu
lated, whereas his original calculation treated the order of
calculation inversely; but this is of no immediate consequence,
and no one at the present date has any serious compunotion
at including the order of ordinary molecular dimensions
among data practically known.
    Very well then, unless this statement he objected to, I say
that the opposite camps are involved both of them in contact
views, and both of them in chemical views.            It is not a
 question of whether physical contact or some form of chemical
 action is operative; it is a question of which of several con
 tacts is the really effective one, and what kind of chemical
 action or chemical af<U+FB01>nity is the active cause.
    Is it the contact and the chemical atlinity across the metal
 met-al junctions, or is it the contact and chemical a<U+FB02>inity
 across the metal-air junctions?
    The opposite camps are thus metallic versus dielectric.
     Isay oxygen.      Lord Kelvin scouts oxygen and says brass.
He also says sether, and         I   am   willing to say   aether,   too,   in
some sense later on,   the evidence permits
                         it'                   but meanwhile,
                                                    ;
it   ismore commonplace and safer to say oxygen: for un
doubtedly oxygen     there.

   Lord Kelvin does not deny the possibility, perhaps the
probability, of some E.M.F. at the metal-air or metal-vacuum
junction, which contributes to the total Volta effect, but                  I
apprehend that he does not believe its contribution to be

374             Prof. O. Lodge on    the   Controversy
of    an E.M.F. at the metal-metal junction, which again con
  tributes to the total observed Volta effect, but 1 assert that
  we know its contribution to be small.
     How big it is in my opinion is answered above in Chapter I.
  It is measured by the Peltier effect (Profs. Ayrton & Perry
  will here ejaculate, Stuff and nonsense! and Lord Kelvin
  will support them.         R. I. Discourse,       23 & 24.)   The
  metal-air force is of the order volts. The metal-metal force
  is of the order millivolts.
     Not much is known for certain about the Peltier or
  physical forces at metal-liquid or liquid-liquid junctions,
  and they are di<U+FB01>icult to measure ; but they have been partially
  measured by Bosscha and by Bouty (see reference in my
  Report, p. 189, Phil. Mag, March 1885).          They may also be
  theoretically estimated   in the way suggested b Dr.Hopkinson
  in the Phil. Mag. for October 1885.                . Bouty thinks
 that he has shown that the relation H=TdE/dt holds at
 such junctions.     \Vhat is certain is that if all the Peltier
  forces are added algebraically together in a complete circuit
 at uniform temperature, then, whether the completion be
  dielectric or electrolytic, 2(H)='l‘dE/dt; as Lord Kelvin
 and von Helmholtz have proved, for the two cases of (1‘)
 dielectric medium, (2) electrolytic medium, respectively.
     Thus the difference or controversy is no longer, if ever, a
 difference between contact and chemical action ; a chemical
 contact seems to be admitted now by both sides, but there is
 an essential and by no means a nominal difference on the
 question of the localisation both of the E.M.F. and ot' the
 chemical contact.     I  locate the Volta force (the chief part of
 it)  and  the chemical  contact   too, at the air boundary of each
 metal. Anything occurring at the metallic junction      I   regard
 as physical.    Lord Kelvin locates the chief part of the Volta
 force at what he is able to regard as an effectively chemical
 contact, the zinc-copper junction; and        I   presume that he
            whatever happens at the metal-wther boundary as
 regardsl
   h sica .
I?    f asked why I maintain the zinc-copper junction to be
chemically inert,  I   pass a current across   it, and point to the
absence of any chemical change there.           If am chatted for
                                                   I

 on metallic surfaces,     1  again pass a current, by whatever
means are possible, and show oxide (or more likely sulphate,
this acid radical having much the same differential energy
of combination with zinc and copper as oxygen has. Nor
is   that of chlorine very different.      But one can show oxide

itself if pressed, by using a lead electrode or a copper one
with an intense current).
   But if told that this cannot happen always, and that the
energy of combination with something (say sulphur) must
be very different, I fully admit it; but then       say that in   I
an atmosphere of which the active ingredient is sulphur (say
sulphuretted hydrogen) the Volta force will be different too.
Mr.    J.Brown * has shown that it               is,
                                         but the conclusiveness
of the experiment     evaded by pointing to <U+FB01>lms of sulphide
                           is
which introduce fresh contact-forces and complicate the circuit.
   So here begins      con<U+FB02>ict of experimental testimony and
                           a
interpretation.   Lord Kelvin depends on the experiments of

            The question    of   Expression in terms     of   Potential.
   Superposed upon the controversy as to the junction at
which the main contact force really exists, there has arisen
another controversy, chiefly concerned with words or modes
of expression, concerning the most convenient method of
de<U+FB01>ning the potential of         conductor, and especially the
                                        a

Professor Perry, to de<U+FB01>ne the potential of     conductor as the

376                Prof. O. Lodge      on the Controversy
    I  have never been able to see why these philosophers hesi
tate to complete the process and give the charge actually to
the conductor.          Why do they stop short outside?                  The
completion      of the process    is so easy   that  precaution    is needed
to avoid it.
   'It is usually an easier matter to measure experimentally
the potential of a conductor, a thing which can be connected
directly by a wire to an electrometer, than it is to measure
 the potential of a point in air or other insulator; the latter
operation requiring        a  water-dropper or      a   smoking match or
an in<U+FB01>nitely sharp point.
    It has been authoritatively stated that the heterogeneous
 molecular structure of a metal makes it diiiicult to af<U+FB01>x any
 meaning to the potential of an inaccessible point inside it ;
 but if this dif<U+FB01>culty were a real one it would surely apply
 still more forcibly to a heterogeneous molecular insulator.
 The di<U+FB01>iculty, however, seems to me purely imaginary from
any practical point of view ; we need have nothing to do with
the molecular structure of a metal in this connexion ; by
hypothesis it is a conductor, its molecules are all effectively
connected, and the potential of one point is the potential
of all. Nothing can be simpler than the statement that in
electrostatics every part of a conductor is at one potential.
We need not put on what Lord Kelvin has somewhere called
a molecular microscopic binocular, and examine the atoms on
all occasions.
    If  asked to de<U+FB01>ne the potential of a metal with reference
to some arbitrary standard conductor given as zero,                   I have
only to say— the work needed to transfer a small unit charge
from one to the other: or the potential energy of each unit
of charge existing on the metal, provided the removal of that
charge does not appreciably affect the potential : or, better,
dW/dQ.        Where is the dif<U+FB01>culty ? The process of charging a
conductor is experimentally easy, why not introduce the
process into the de<U+FB01>nition '.
   '  Nevertheless, Lord Kelvin says;—“ There has been much of wordy
warfare regarding     otential in a metal, but none of the combatants has
ever told us what e means by the expression.         In fact, the only de<U+FB01>ni
tion of electric potential hitherto given has been for vacuum or air or
other <U+FB02>uid insulator.    Oonceivable molecular theories of electricity within
a solid or liquid conductor might admit the term potential at a point in
the interior; but the function so called would vary excessively in inter
molecular space," Sac.    (Footnote to It. I. discourse, p. 13).
   He goes on, however,      “It would also var intensel       from point to
point in the ether or air outside the metal at distances row the frontier
           moderate in comparison with the distance from molecule to
small or
molecule 1n the metal.”     And with this sentence    I  can quite agree; as
well as with the bare fact stated at the end of the previous sentence.

      I have found in the reported discussion at the Electrical Engineers
   (Journ. Inst. E. E., 1885, vol. xiv. p. 233) the following ingenious and
      * It may be permissible to quote a sentence from Dr. John Hopkin

   of Electrical Engineers (Journal, 1885, p. 235) :—“ rofessor Perry de<U+FB01>nes

   the energy re uired to transfer a unit of electricity from near the copper to
   near the zinc t rough the dielectric.    On the other hand, as    I understand
   the matter, Dr. Lodge, and probably Clerk Maxwell, de<U+FB01>ne the difference
   of potential to be the energy required to transfer a current of electricity from
   the           to the zinc through the junction between the copper and the
   zinc. copperow, it appears to me that Dr. Lodge has very clearly shown that
   his way of looking at the matter is the more convenient; for, in the <U+FB01>rst
   place, it expresses, with the greatest ease, all facts that have been
   observed.      When co per and zinc are in contact with air there is a
   difference of potentia at the three junctions, and the sum of the three
   differences of potential is not equal to zero; and we have no dif<U+FB01>culty in
    explaining all the electrostatic effects that we have obtained.     Dr. Lodge
-   has so clearly proved the convenience of his way of looking at the matter
                                                   I
    that it would be only wasting your time if were to attempt to reproduce.
    his arguments.      It seems to me better to take that basis and pursue it.
    Now, if we take that basis as our starting-point, it is very easy to set
    forth all the theory of thermoelectricity, and the formqu given at the
    end of Clerk Maxwell’s chapter on that subject can be proved with the
    greatest ease ; it is also easy to extend these formulae to the case in
    which we have chemical action going on, and to foreshadow the precise
    method by which we may be able to ascertain exactly what the difference
    of potential is between copper or zinc or other metals and electrolytes.”
       He then makes some further remarks of considerable interest which
    were ex anded by him later in the Phil. Mag. for October 1885.             All  I
    would a d to the above admirable statement is that the emphasis required
    is upon the word “near ” in the 3rd & 4th lines, and that the immediately
    following speci<U+FB01>cation of ath—‘J‘ through the dielectric "—is not really

  I  trust that       I
                 have made it clear that                   I
                                             do not regard this
matter of the de<U+FB01>nition of potential as of the same importance
as the seat of         in the pile.   In no other part of this
paper have        I
                paid any attention to the wording of pro
positions in terms of potential; it is a subsidiary dispute
superposed on the main disagreement, which latter is in
no sense a-matter of words or de<U+FB01>nition.
   Nevertheless the two disputes are somewhat closely allied,
and the clari<U+FB01>cation of one ought to result in paci<U+FB01>cation
of the other.
                                     CHAPTER      IV.
       Some recent modes             of regarding      the jVeo/zam'sm     of   the
                            Chemical Contact Force.
   I have elsewhere tried to explain the mode in which                                I
suppose the oxygen to act to bring about that momentary
transfer of electricity which occurs across the junction of two
metals the instant they are put into contact.         The facts
postulated are (1) the fact of chemical af<U+FB01>nity between
oxygen and metal, of amount different for different metals,
and (2) the fact that oxygen atoms are, at any rate some of
them, negatively charged.
   On the strength of these facts                 I
                                          see a surrounding layer of
straining oxygen     atoms   seeking   to  move up to the zinc, but
unable to do so because of “the im ossibility of conferring
an absolute charge on matter,” as Iiaraday in his ice-pail
experiment put            it,
                        or because of the “incompressibility of
electricity,” or because there          no avenue for the supply of
                                             is
electricity of opposite sign.       Consequently we have         state          a
of siege,      kind of incipient polarisation, but no charge.

difference of potential; whatever force or potential-difference
exists between isolated zinc and air        chemical in its nature—
                                                      is
the result of chemical a<U+FB01>inity.          The force may be due, as
Helmholtz puts          toit,  speci<U+FB01>c attraction of zinc for elec

    copper; instantly    an avenue for the relief of the strain is
    provided, positive electricity <U+FB02>ows across the junction into
    the zinc, takes up its abode on the surface facing the oxygen
    atoms, the oxygen atoms approach slightly nearer all round,
    the surrounding molecules all round are polarised, their nega
   tive poles inwards, their positive poles outwards, a double
   layer is set up on the zinc, and lines of force appear all
    through the surrounding dielectric.     These lines reach from
   the zinc free-surface to the copper free-surface, distributing
   themselves according to the ordinary rules of electrostatic
   capacity, and their terminations on the copper constitute its
   negative charge. In other words, the oxygen atoms are
   slightly further removed than before from the copper, and it is
   to that extent protected even from its previous small tendency
   to oxidation; on the other hand, the oxygen atoms have
   approached slightly nearer to the zinc. Thus my doctrine is
  not a doctrine of chemical combination, but of chemical
  approach. The oxygen atoms approach nearer the zinc, recede
   further from the copper, and by these slight motions produce
  the whole Volta effect.
      But this it may be said is nothing but a voltaic cell, except
  that the electrolyte is replaced by a. dielectric, and so the
  current is momentary, not continuous.        Precisely, that is my
  meaning.
      But then, it will be objected, if a current did pass, there
  would be actual oxidation ; since for every electric unit that

  of zinc oxidised. To this agree.
      Well then, pursues the objector, consider a condenser of
  great capacity with its alternate plates made of zinc and
  copper, very close together, and then short-circuit it at some
  point ; there will instant] be a great <U+FB02>ow of electricity across
  the junction to charge t e condenser, and accordingly there
  will be a perceptible amount of zinc oxidised. Your mere
 approach of oxygen atoms without combination will no
 longer serve.
      At this point   I appeal to arithmetic.    The charge on an
 atom is of the order 10“11 electrostatic units.        The oxygen
 atoms immediately in so-called contact with the zinc are
 constituents of its condensed air-<U+FB01>lm, a film so dense as to be
 virtually a liquid, since it is subject to the intense molecular
pressure. Not really a liquid, because it is far above the
critical point, but not perceptibly differing from a liquid in
density.      If this be objected to, it is not essential to my
argument, because there is plenty of margin ; only it seems
to me likely to correspond roughly with the truth.               The

number of atoms per square centimetre in the layer facing the
zinc will therefore be of the order 1016. Of these only a portion
will be_oxygen ; and probably it may be said that only a small
    roportion are ionised and so open to combination. _But as
Ydo not need combination,                 I  see no necessity to postulate
ionisation,       or  to  care  what    proportion are in this condition.
 Certainly        I   need molecules capable             of being polarised
electrically, but that at the present date will hardly be denied
to any material molecules whatever.                                             p

      Very    well   then,  if  for any    reason   polarisation takes  place,
 the surface-density of the charge on either face of'the double
 layer can be 1016 X 10*“ =          a:    105 electrostatic units per square
 centimetre, at a maximum. The mechanical tension across the
 la 'er is 27:19, and the intensity of electric <U+FB01>eld there is 41m,
 w ich is also the gradient of electric potential.
      Now the thickness of the layer is of molecular dimensions,
 10-8 centim. say; hence the difference of potential between
 its faces, that is the difference of potential between the zinc,
 and the air in its neighbourhood, is 4mm, which is of the order
 (12 X 10‘ x 10-8 = 1.04), one-hundredth of an electrostatic
 unit, or 3, volts. Now plainly this is of the right order. of
 magnitude.           The Volta effect observed can be explained by
 such an electrical double layer, by such a chemical layer of
 straining oxygen atoms, at a metallic surface *.                            .
      That it can be equall well explained for metals in absolute
 vacuum or free aether {would not presume to deny; but                            I
 cannot do the arithmetic for that case, because of an utter lack
 of data.        It is to be observed, however, that the only gaseous
 or material substance needed (other than metal) is the coherent
 <U+FB01>lm on the surface; all the rest of the gas is merely a dielectric
 medium for the transmission of electrostatic induction or
 lines of force, and for this function an absolute vacuum serves
 perfectly.          Consequently, merely removing the plates into
 the receiver of an air-pump will make no practical difference.

lost by the other.

   7      some account of the mounting adopted in the Blythswood
  Laboratory for the echelon diffraction-grating (invented some
  two years ago by Prof. Michelson T), and to describe the
  method adopted for the determination of what may be called
  the constants of the instrument.
       The echelon grating in use here was by Hilger and was
  the <U+FB01>rst made in this country.              It consists of <U+FB01>fteen plates
  each about 7'5 mm. thick, made of light <U+FB02>int~glass, set
  originally with 1 mm. steps, but afterwards altered so as t
                                                                           '
  make the steps only '5 mm. wide.
                          § 2.   Method of Mounting.
       The mounting was adapted so as to make use of the tele
   scope and collimator belonging to a large goniomet-er already
  in use in the laboratory. The telescOpes in question had
  object-glasses of 28 inch focus and 2 inch aperture 1.
       In order to obtain the necessary preliminary dispersion a
   small solar spectroscope was employed, having movable dis
   persion- and back-re<U+FB02>exion prisms, so that both the telescope
   and collimator were <U+FB01>xed.             This form of instrument is ex—
   ceedingly convenient when the source of light cannot easily
   be shifted.
        A diagram and photograph of the arrangement are given in
  <U+FB01>g. 1.                          .
        The telescopes T1 and T3 are <U+FB01>rst set so that the slits
   31, S2 are in the solar foei of their respective object-glasses.
        The instruments are then so set relatively to each other,
   that the spectrum from the solar speetroscope focusses exactly
   on the slit S2.        In order to get any particular line of the
   spectrum on the slit S,, the handle H is turned (thus

       I When the mounting is made complete for the instrument, it is
   advisable to have short-focus glasses (say 6 in. or 8 in.), with the same
   aperture, so as to get as much light as possible.

      similar rod for opening and closing the slit S2.
         The condensing-lens C is used to focus the source of light
       (shown between the poles of a magnet) on the slit SI.                 All
      these adjustments are made with the echelon out of position.
      In order to obtain the best possible results with the instrument,
      the slits S], S, should both be set parallel to the steps of the
      echelon. The easiest way, of course, of doing this is to make
      both the slits and the edges of the echelon as nearly vertical
      as possible.       The instrument          is,however, nothing like so
      sensitive to this adjustment as the concave gratings with
      14,000 or more lines to the inch.
         When the adjustment           is complete and the particular line
      which          required to examine           tocussed on the slit $2, the

      echelon may be placed in the path of the beam.               It should be
      noticed that the focus of the orders when the echelon                    in   is
      position   is   not necessarily the same as that for the slit                      S2
      when the echelon         isremoved.     In this particular instrument,
      owing    to  some    error   in  the  plates, the focus was obtained
      when the eye )iece was about an inch further out than                  was   it
       with the slit   2   sharply focussed, with the echelon removed.
          In the mounting used here             form of parallel motion was
                                                 a
      adopted     for   moving    the  echelon    in and out of position; in
      setting, therefore, the echelon was moved across the <U+FB01>eld until
      the brightness of the lines seen in the eyepiece was a maximum.
      When once this position had been determined, marks were
      made on the stand and the echelon-mount, so that the grating
       could always be placed in that position.
          There was one other motion of which the                    rating was
      capable,    viz.,
                      a    rotation   round    vertical
                                                 a        axis in      centre of
                                                                           t   e

A tilt of one degree, therefore, will reduce the effective width
of a step to '75 of its ori 'nal value.
     Inposition 2 (<U+FB01>g. 4) t 0 width of the steps is only reduced
to 3 cos 0, where 6 is the angle of tilt, and cos 0:1, when 0
is small.                                                    ,
   The amount of light passing through the instrument is
clearly not much affected.      A tilt of one degree in this
direction will only diminish the effective width of the steps
by one part in 5000. As is shown later, a tilt of one degree
is approximately that required to obtain the double-order
condition from the single-order condition, or vice versa with
yellow light.
   It has generally been found best to work with the order
next to that obtained in the direct position, or even the second
order from that position.     When working in the equal-order
condition, it is best to work with the <U+FB01>rst and second orders
away from the direct position.      If the direct-position order
was used, it was found that the dispersion of the order, say,
to the left of the direct-position order the direct-position
order being supposed to be the left-hand one) was not equal
to-that of the order to the right of the other equal order.    In
<U+FB01>g. 5 the distance AB was not equal to the distance DC.
This would introduce uncertainties in the measurements.

may        position when two equal orders are showing, or two
          be a
orders one brighter than the other, this depending entirely
on the retardation produced by the plates of the echelon for
the particular light under examination.        The effect of not
working   with   the direct-position order,  but  with, say, the
third order away from        it,

more than '06 per cent., since the value of m in the equation (2)

394           Lord Blythswood and Dr. Marchant on
   With a current of 20 amps. (which did not heat the coils
 excessively), a <U+FB01>eld of about 24,000 C.G.S. units was obtained
across an 8 mm. air-gap.       When the air-gap was reduced to
 1 mm., a <U+FB01>eld of 40,000 C.G.S. units was obtained.
   In these experiments, however, it was impossible to use a
gap of much less than 8 mm., on account of the size of the
capillary of the vacuum-tube used to obtain the mercury
 spectrum.
   With the hollow pole-pieces the maximum <U+FB01>eld was about
 16,000 C.G.S. units with an 8 mm. gap.
   The <U+FB01>eld-stren ths were measured by means of a small coil
whose area had        een carefully determined electrically, by
comparison with a standard single-layer coil wound on a core
of measured diameter. This coil was used in conjunction
with a ballistic galvanometer which had been standardized by
means of the                from a '5 M.F. condenser charged to
                 discharge
a known potential.       The P.D. to which the condenser was
charged was measured by an Evershed voltmeter calibrated
by the potentiometer method with a Clark cell.
    § 6. Results obtained of the Zeeman Eject on      the Chief
                 Lines of the Mercury Spectrum.
   We may now consider some of the results obtained with this
instrument in the observation of the Zeeman effect on the
chief lines of the mercury spectrum.
   Attention was mainly directed to the blue (4358) line and
the green (5460), since these could both be photographed.
The blue line (fig. 7) photographed fairly easily, the exposure
necessary being from 10 to 20 minutes. The green line (<U+FB01>g. 10)
on the other hand, though very bright visually, generally
required about two hours’ exposure.          The other lines ex
amined were the two yellow lines ; but no good photographs
were obtained. Measurements on them were made with a
micrometer-eyepiece.
   In photographing and observing these lines, it is very im
portant that the tube should give a brilliant light. In order
to ensure this, fresh tubes were continually used, the exhaustion
being generally carried to 1 mm. or less. A drop of mercury
was put into the tube to give the requisite mercury-lines.     The
tube was kept heated by a spiritlamp placed underneath it ;
the lamp at the same time heated the iron of the pole-tips.
The alteration in the magnetic <U+FB02>ux caused thereby was mea
sured, and was found not to exceed 1 per cent.
   We may <U+FB01>rst consider the behaviour of the blue (4385)
line.   Photographs are given, taken both in the single- and
double-order conditions.              .       .     t

     A   double-image prism was employed to separate the outer
 and inner     components of the compound line. In the photo
graphs, components which are polarized parallel to the lines
of force form the top half of the line, and components
polarized perpendicularly to the lines of force are at the
bottom.
     Under a weak magnetic <U+FB01>eld the line appears as a triplet;
as the strength of the <U+FB01>eld increases the lower or inner com
ponent splits into a doublet, and the line becomes a quartet.
It should he noticed that in the double-order condition the
central line, which is composed of two outer components of
the two orders nearly superimposed, is very much brighter
than the outer components.
     In the single-order photograph with a slightly stronger <U+FB01>eld
(12,000), the side components of the orders on each side of
 the original single order have come near enough to the centre
of the <U+FB01>eld to become bright, and are superimposed on the
components due to the original single order. In a still
stronger <U+FB01>eld the two outer components split into two com
ponents each so that the resultant line becomes a sextet.            It
is somewhat dif<U+FB01>cult to follow the <U+FB01>nal splitting of       the  outer
components. It may, however, best be done from the single
                                         -
order condition.

     Starting from the condition (1) <U+FB01>g. 8, which is that shown
in the photograph with a <U+FB01>eld of 12,000 C.G.S. units, the line
6’ due to the order G is superimposed on the line A.’ due
to A; and similarly B’ is superimposed on the other com
ponent of A, both lines being thick.         As the <U+FB01>eld-strength
increases, the components of A get farther from the centre
of the <U+FB01>eld, and <U+FB01>nally fail to show on the photograph; the
right-hand component of B and the left-hand component of
O gradually get nearer the centre of the <U+FB01>eld and become

                           the    Echelon Spectroscope.                                               397
 brighter, and cleanly split, each into two lines. Next we have
  the outermost right-hand component of B, coincident with the
  outermost left-hand component of C as in (2), <U+FB01>g. 8, with a
  magnetic <U+FB01>eld of 21,800.
     With a still stronger <U+FB01>eld (23,800) the components of B
  and C coincide with each other; this is shown in (3) and also
 in the photograph. In this way we are able to trace out the
  gradual resolution of the original line.
.    The line therefore becomes a sextet, the relative separation
  of the components being shown below.

     The green line of mercury (5460) behaves somewhat dif
  ferently under the action of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld.        With a weak
  <U+FB01>eld of about 6000 C.G.S. units the line splits into a triplet, as
  shown in- the photographs, both with single and double
  orders.
     As the <U+FB01>eld increases in strength the inner component of
  the line, which is perceptibly broadened under the weak <U+FB01>eld,
  splits into a triplet, at the same time each of the outer lines
  splits into a doublet, the resultant being a septet.   The single
  order photograph shows the line as it ultimately appears in
  the strong <U+FB01>eld.      It is to be noticed, however, that the outer
  lines are really due to three orders.

is,   within limits of experimental error, double that of the
value of the same quantity for the components of the outer
lines, and the value of 87t/7t2H for both the blue and green
lines   is the same, within limits of experimental error.
     Whether this connexion holds good for other compound
 lines  is   aquestion which requires careful investigation, and
 on which further experiments are being made.
     In working with this instrument,         it   was found that the
 yellow    and  green  lines were    far  easier  to  examine than the
 blue, on account of the diminution in the dis ersive power of
 the instrument for the longer wave-lengt s.                 Using this
 grating    for ultra-violet  light,
                                   it    would   be  extremely   dif<U+FB01>cult
 to try and separate the components due to the central order,
 and those due to the other orders; even with the line (4358)
it   was some time before the splittin        of the outer components
 became at all obvious; and seeing 5131'. what has been called
 the constant (k1) of the instrument diminishes approximately
  as the square of the wave-length,      it   is  quite likely that with
  lines nearer the ultra-violet, components due to the <U+FB01>fth and
  sixth orders away might appear in the <U+FB01>eld. The constant
   (k2) also diminishes with shorter wave-lengths.
      In order, therefore, to make this valuable instrument more
  serviceable for this class of work, attention should be directed
  to the increase of the constant without too much diminution
  of the resolving power. As suggested by Michelson, this
  might be done       by   surrounding the instrument, say, with
   water. This, however, would reduce the resolving power to
   only one third of its original value.           A   better suggestion
 is   that of using thinner plates for the instrument and more of
   them. The plates might with advantage be made, say            4   mm.
   thick with, say, thirty plates and         '5   mm. steps, or even
   '25 mm. steps.      This would, we believe, make a more useful
   instrument for this work than one consisting of thirty        8   mm.
   plates,  though   theoretically    the  resolving-power  is  only  half
    what it   would be in the latter case.          There is,  of course,
    no doubt that this instrument forms       a  most valuable addition
   to the apparatus available for work on the Zeeman effect.

    GENTLEMEN,—
           MORRIS-AIREY,        in his paper in the Philosophical
MR. Magazine        for March, describes an experiment which
shows that when the electric discharge passes through a
mixture of hydrogen and chlorine, though the chlorine lines
are bright at the anode and faint at the cathode, there is a
considerable quantity of chlorine in the half of the discharge
tube next the cathode.      From this he concludes that there is
no appreciable electrolytic transport of the chlorine through
the hydrogen.     I do not think this conclusion can legitimately
be drawn from his experiments.          It is evident, that if the
chlorine is transported to the anode, the increase in the partial
pressure of the chlorine in this region will cause a diffusion of
chlorine towards the cathode, and the steady state will be
 reached when the backward <U+FB02>ow due to diffusion is equal to
the forward <U+FB02>ow due to electrolytic conduction, so that an
 electrolytic {low is consistent with the existence of a con
 siderable amount of chlorine throughout the tube, and this
 amount will be relatively more important as the amount of
 chlorine in the tube increases.       Mr. Morris-Airey worked
 with large quantities of chlorine amounting to 6 or 7 per cent.
 of the total amount of gas. In my experiments (Proc. Roy.
 Soc. lviii. p. 244) a very small quantity of chlorine was
 introduced into a tube <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen, and the effects
  observed were not merely the presence of the chlorine lines
 at the anode and their absence at the cathode when the
current was steady, but it was found that on the reversal of
 the current, so that the old anode became a cathode, the
 chlorine lines at <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>ashed out brightly at the new cathode
 and were faint at the anode, then there was a short interval
 during which they were faint at both electrodes, and, <U+FB01>nally,
 they became bright at the new anode and invisible at the
  cathode.   This seems very complete proof ot' the transport.
                                    Yours very trul ,

XXXVI.         Heat of Combination of Metals in                  the   Formation   of
         Alloys.  By ALEXANDER GALT, 17.80.,                     F.R.S.E.*
       a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, London,
 IN in   1883, Lord Kelvin T refers to the want of knowledge
 regarding the heat of combination of zinc and copper. Two
 or three years ago few experiments and no measurements had
 been made to determine the heat of combination of these or of
 other pairs of solid metals. Not only in connexion with the
  theory of contact electricity in particular, but generally in
  respect to chemical af<U+FB01>nities, it is important that we should
  have some knowledge in regard to this question ; and at
1 Lord Kelvin’s
                   request    Ihave since made an experimental
  investigation on the heat of combination of pairs of solid
  metals, particularly zinc and copper.
     The results obtained have been communicated from time to
  time to the Royal Society of Edinburgh: and the British
  Associatién for the Advancement of Science           The British
  Association in 1898 granted £20 in aid of the further prosc
  cution of the work.             _
     The method of procedure was to dissolve aknown weight
  of an alloy of two metals, and also under similar conditions
  the same weight of a mixture of the metals which are present
  in the alloy, the proportions taken bein       the same as those
  known to be in the alloy, and noting tie initial and <U+FB01>nal
  temperature in each case. The heat of combination of the
  metals in the alloy may be estimated at'ter noting the difference
  between the heats of solution in the two cases.
      Messrs. Johnson, Matthey, & (30., of London, kindly made
  for me and analysed twenty-two different alloys of practically
  pure zinc and copper, whose composition varied from 5 to
  90 per cent. of copper ,- and they also supplied separate
  specimens of zinc and copper similar to those used in making
  the allo s.   To facilitate solution the metals and alloys were
  <U+FB01>rst re need to powder by <U+FB01>ling with a <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>le. The method
  of experimenting <U+FB01>nally adopted was carried out in detail as
  follows :—One end of a short length of closed thin glass
  tubing was sealed to the top of a very small glass globe (see
  <U+FB01>g. 1). Near the point of attachment there were, on opposite

The glass tube was free to move up and down             “3-   1

a certain distance through one of two holes
bored in a short common cork, specially
selected.   Particular care being taken to see
that the globe was clean and dry, it was
drawn down from the cork about 6 centims.
and the cork was then <U+FB01>xed in a clamp.
The <U+FB01>lings ('5 gramme was the quantity gene
rally used in the experiments) were then most
carefully inserted into the bottom of the globe
through one of the openings, and the globe
was then drawn up close to the cork. Through
the other hole in the cork a thin short-range
thermometer, whose marked divisions corre
spond to O'O5° C., was passed.          The cork,
carrying the globe and attached tube and the
thermometer, was then carefully <U+FB01>xed in the
neck of a small <U+FB02>ask of thin glass containing
a de<U+FB01>nite quantity of nitric acid of density'
 1'360 at 15° C. To avoid possible heating
effects from the hand the rim of the <U+FB02>ask was
not held by the <U+FB01>ngers ; instead the rim was
placed in a slit made near the bottom of each
hinged limb of a small wooden tripod 4 or 5
inches long, a rubber band round this part
tightening the grip.                    .
    Holding the <U+FB02>ask by the top of the tripod,
it was gently shaken so as to give the acid a
rotating motion; in this way the <U+FB02>ask and
acid soon attained a uniform and steady tem
perature which was usually about that of the
room, and it was carefully noted.       The globe
containing   the  <U+FB01>lings  was   now   plunged to
near the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask by quickly
pushing down the glass tube to which it was
attached, the downward movement being
arrested by the knob on the tube.                                -
   If  the method of pouring the acid on the <U+FB01>lings or of
dropping the <U+FB01>lings into the acid had been adopted, a violent
action would have occurred, and it would not have been
possible to prevent the loss of heat due to escape of fumes.
But the plan adopted effectually got‘rid of this dif<U+FB01>culty by
the almost instantaneous projection of the globe containing
the <U+FB01>lings to the bottom of the acid *.        It was interesting to
   * Andrews, ‘Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers,’ p. 214 :—-“ Every chemist is familiar

                  Metals in the formation     qf Alloys,    7         407
watch the scouring effect in the globe due to the chemical
action; the <U+FB01>lings were almost instantly expelled from it
through the a ertures by reason of the rapid evolution of
gas.     But int e cases of a few of the alloys and mixtures
containing large percentages of copper this effect was only
partial, and a considerable proportion of the powder remained
in the bulb with the result that solution was much delayed.
In these instances the bulb was replaced by a tiny glass
basket suspended from a spiral hook formed at the bottom of
the glass tube, so that when the basket containing the <U+FB01>lings
was driven to the bottom of the acid the basket was over
turned and the <U+FB01>lings scattered over the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask.
v    When solution was started the <U+FB02>ask was quickly inserted
into a lar e cylindrical metal can through an aperture in the
 cover. T 1e can had a water-jacket round the sides and
 bottom, and the contained air could be kept at a practically
 constant temperature, which was a fraction of a degree
 centigrade below the maximum which would be attained by
the solution, by heating the water in the jacket by means of a
 buusen-burner placed below the can. The temperature of the
 contained air was read by a sensitive thermometer suspended
 in the can, the bulb of the thermometer and the bottom of the
 <U+FB02>ask being close together near the centre of the can.
     Solution was generally e<U+FB02>ected in 55 to 60 seconds, and
 while it was going on the <U+FB02>ask was shaken so as to give a
 rotatory motion to the acid. Complete solution and maximum
 temperature were nearly coincident in time.
     Each experiment was repeated from three to six times until
 consistent results for the heat of solution in each case were
 obtained, and the mean of these was taken. In each case of
 solution the nitrous products remained in the liquid, the <U+FB02>ask
 in which solution took place being kept gas-tight by the
 cork.
     The total weight of the whole apparatus—<U+FB02>ask, cork, ther
 mometer, and sealed glass tube with attached globe or basket
 -—-was 42 grammes, and the water equivalent was found to be
 5‘7 grammes.          The speci<U+FB01>c heat of the nitric acid used was
 repeatedly determined, and the mean of several values was '658.
 The speci<U+FB01>c heat of the metal used is negligible and was not
 taken into account.
 with the violent action of nitric acid on zinc and copper, and the abun
 dant evolution of gas which accompanies it. But the facility with which
 the gases may be condensed by the acid solution  is robably not so gene
 rally known, and when the experiment is made for t   e <U+FB01>rst time it cannot
 fail to excite surprise.”

copper, the quantities of metal and acid used in each set of
 experiments, the mean increase of temperature of the acid
per gramme of metal dissolved, and the absolute amount
of heat evolved in dissolving this weight of alloy and
mixture.

 its corresponding alloy to be the same    the difference between

 value of the heat of combination rapidly falls to zero, and then
 becomes positive.     The maximum positive value                  is
                                                                very

     Further experiments were made with the alloy which gave
 the greatest negative heat of combination, and also with the
 alloy which gave the greatest positive value. In each case
 when the solution of the mixture and that of the alloy had
 reached room-temperature, they were mixed together; but no
appreciable change of temperature was observed.

An Introduction         to  Di<U+FB02>'erential and Integral Calculus and
                             the
   szeremial Equations.          By E. GLANVILLE TAYLOR, MA.
   (Longmans,    1899,  pp. xxiv+568.)
          is an excellent text-book.       At this time of day much
THIS  novelty is not to be looked for, and indeed, considering the
Author’s object, novelty would militate against utility.       His aim
has been to present each subject in a clear and simple manner,
“ rather than to introduce                              In our opinion,
                              any special novelties.”
after a. careful perusal, he has certainly succeeded in investing the
subject with interest. All the best authorities have evidently been
consulted, and the portions most suitable for students thoroughly
assimilated and reproduced in a clear and lucid manner.
    The Differential and Integral Calculus are treated fully, i. e. to
the extent suitable for elementary readers, and there is, as has
lately been the case in recent similar works, a short but suf<U+FB01>cient,
for ordinary purposes, account of Elementary Differential Equations.
There is a very large collection of examples and many useful ones
have been clearly worked out, in many cases two, or more, alter
native proofs have been given.       The <U+FB01>gures have been well drawn
and the printing is very clear. The examples are freely distributed
throughout thetext, and answers immediately follow these exercises.
We have noted very few clerical slips. P. 26, Question 7 and
the Answer do not agree: p. 27, l. 2 up, for one +, read — :
p. 65,1. 3 up, for M read N: p. 77, line 1, for NR read NQ:
                                 ”
p. 100, l. 7, read “ namely        : p.  101, line 3, for “negative”
read   “ positive ”; p. 143, it might be stated that the 0’s (in
 § 155) are not the same, but general : p. 159, 1. 1 up, for

worth while, however, to point out that the scienti<U+FB01>c work of the
Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland is hardly completely repre
sented by the Archives néerlandaises and the three electro-techmcal
journals included in the list of journals abstracted. No doubt
much of the work published in these countries comes under revtew
at second hand, but abstracts of abstracts are apt to be scrappy if
not actually inaccurate.       We think also that the ‘ Report of the

 abstracted.     There is probably on an average as much matter in

 Le Magnétisme du Fer. Par CH. MAUBAIN. Paris: Georges
       Carré & O. Naud, 1899. Pp. 1 —100.
     The publishers are to be congratulated on the series of scienti<U+FB01>c
 monographs of which the little book before us is one.           They are
 clearly printed, well illustrated, and written by authors of un
 doubted eminence in the subjects with which they deal.          The only
 two defects which one cannot help noticing are the somewhat
 <U+FB02>imsy paper binding and—what is much more serious—the
 absence of an index.     Surely in these days it is almost unpardonable
 for any writer to produce a book on a scienti<U+FB01>c subject without
  preparing an index for it. Apart from these blemishes, however,
  we have nothing but praise to bestow on the work before us, where,
  within the small compass of 100 pages, the author gives a very
 exhaustive and up-to-date, if somewhat compressed, account of
 the phenomena of Magnetism.           The book is not intended to be an
  introductory text-book for beginners;           indeed, the necessarily
  concise nature of the author’s exposition renders it quite unsuit—
 able for this purpose.      But to the advanced worker, to Whom it is
 addressed, it will prove a most useful résumé of the numerous
 recent experimental researches in the domain of Magnetism.
     It is becoming increasingly more dif<U+FB01>cult to keep pace with the
 advancing wave of scienti<U+FB01>c research; and students of Magnetism

will feel grateful to M. Maurain for the exceedingly useful account
of what    has   already been done in this branch of experimental
science.    Beginning with a general account of the phenomena of
magnetic   induction,  the author brie<U+FB02>y describes the various methods
of measuring magnetic quantities, and the instruments used for
this purpose.        Next follows a. detailed study of the magnetic
qualities  of iron  and steel.   This is succeeded bya chapter dealing
with the vexed question of viscous hysteresis; and the next two
chapters are devoted to a. discussion of the dissipation of energy
by hysteresis, and the effects of temperature changes.         A short
sketch of the theories of magnetic induction concludes this little
book, which we can unhesitatingly recommend to all interested
in magnetic research.
Le  Phénomene de Zeeman.        Par A. Corrox.    Paris: Georges Cal-r6
      & C. Naud, 189').     Pp. 1—100.
   Another excellent little book belonging to the same series as
that referred to in the last notice.
   The steady improvement which has, since the commencement
of the 19th century, been taking place in the construction of
physical measuring instruments, has produced important results
in enabling the physicist to study many phenomena whose very
existence could not be detected by the crude apparatus at the dis—
posal of some of the early workers in physical science.          What
Faraday looked for, but looked for in vain, it has been reserved
for Zeeman, equipped with the wonderfully perfect instruments
now available, to discover and interpret. In the little book before
us, the author gives a connected account of the various phenomena
directly or indirectly related to the Zeeman effect. After a brief
discussion of the various forms of diffraction-gratings, the author
considers how a change in the wave-length of a given radiation
may be produced.       Next comes a short historical account of the
researches    which preceded Zeeman’s great discovery, and this is
followed by a detailed account of the discovery itself.        The re
mainder of the book deals with the most recent experiments
bearing on this subject.       Numerous references to original sources
of information are given. The book will prove extremely useful
to all interested in the subject with which it deals.

THE1.     ‘On a Particular Form of Surface, the Result of Glacial
and Subaerial Erosion, seen on Loch Lochy and Elsewhere.’           By
Dr. W. T. Blanford, F.R.S., Treas.G.S.
   This form of surface, <U+FB01>rst noticed by the author on Lake Como,
was afterwards observed in the Great Glen of Scotland and in

414                             Geological        Society       :—
 British Columbia.         It consists of an almost even plane sloping at a
 moderate or high angle, and cut at intervals by small ravines or
 channels. The sides of the Great Glen have been planed by glacier
 action to a greater extent than usual, and between Loch Lochy and
 Loch Oich, near Laggan, the sides of the Glen have a regular and
 <U+FB02>at slope of over 35° up to about 1000 feet above sea-level. Numerous
 stream-cut channels draining down this slope are, on an average, not
 more than 10 to 15 feet deep, but some quite exceptional examples
 may be 50 feet deep; these channels occupy less than a fourth of
 the surface.      In addition there are larger glens which, although
 they run out into shallow ravines where they cut the sloping side
of the Great Glen, are frequently 500 feet in depth among the
 hills.     If  these were ordinary stream-valleys before the Glacial
 Period, the cutting away of the ridges separating them to the extent
 of at least 250 or 300 feet must be attributed to glacial erosion on
 the sides of the Great Glen.                The erosion of the small ravines in
 the glacial slope must have been effected by streams in post-Glacial
 times, and the measurement of their rate of erosion might be
 expected to throw light on the amount of time which has elapsed
                                                              ‘
 since the Glacial Period in this district.                      The general effect pro
 duced by the whole evidence is . . . . the small amount of denudation
 that has taken place since the Great Ice Age, and the necessary
 deduction that no great period of time, measured in years, can have
elapsed between the Glacial Epoch and the present day.’

    The rocks strike east-sonth-east, and dip usually at a high angle
northward; a well-marked transverse fault divides the complex
into western and eastern portions.                     The Llandeilo rocks occupy

                    On   the Formation of Dendrites.                415
four strips of ground in the west and three in the east, but the full
succession does not occur in any one of these outcrops.     The effects
of compression are much marked in the purple conglomerate; the
matrix is dragged out along small shear-planes, and the pebbles are
stretched into phacoids, slip-faulted, and their extremities tailed out.
A deceptive appearance of unconformity is also produced at the
junction of grits and shales.        Fossils are found in some of the
rocks.     The Llandeilo rocks are of importance, as they reveal
 the existence of at least four shattered synclines, usually faulted,
and probably all overthrust on their northern boundaries.
    N o fossils have been found in the Llaubadrig rocks, and no more
 de<U+FB01>nite assertion of their age is possible than that they are pre
Llandeilo.     They are newer than, and their base may be conform—
 able with, the Green Series; but as fragments almost certainly
 derived from the latter series have been found in the highest zones,
 the relation between the two series is more likely to be that of an
unconformity.      The Llandeilo rocks contain fragments of limestone
 and pieces of quartzite; but in spite of this evidence in favour of
 unconformity between the Llanbadrig and Llandeilo rocks, the
 basal beds of the latter are found to cling closely to the highest
quartzite of the Llanbadrig Group.
    The quartzites are remarkable in the fact that they frequently
 contain patches of limestone, apparently deposited with them, and
 that they vary rapidly in thickness from about 30 to 200 feet at
 Craig Wen, where this variation is correlated by an inverse variation
 in the conglomerate. Although earth-movement may be partly
 responsible for this variation, some further explanation appears
 requisite, and this may possibly be furnished by erosion of the
 quartzite.    The overthrusting force appears to have come from
 a direction somewhat east of north.
    The igneous rocks are dealt with in two groups: those older and
 those newer than the earth-movement.            To the former belong
 granite, serpentine and its associates, and basaltic dykes.     In each
 area where they occur the serpentines are associated with masses
 of a peculiar purple limestone not known elsewhere; they also
 contain bands of ophicalcite, and schistose structures are common
 in the rocks. The later dykes belong to an acid and a basic set;
 the latter show some evidence of minor movement, such as faulting
 and a little shearing.       The acid dykes are microgranites, grano
 phyres,   and   quartz-porphyries.     In some cases the dykes are
 composite,    the  acid   material being  the older and the basic the
 later constituent.     As a rule, the basic material invades the edge
 of the dyke ; but in one case it has invaded the joints and cracks
 and caught up fragments of the acid rock.
    3. ‘Thc Formation of Dcndrites.’          By A. Octavius Watkins,
 Esq., A.R.S.M., F.G.S.
    If two plane-surfaces be separated by a <U+FB01>lm of suitable plastic
 material, and one surface be rotated slowly on the other through a
 small arc, the plastic material collects into branching forms similar

416               Intelligence and JIiscellaneous Articles.
to the structure of dendrites.  The dendritic form starts from the
part farthest from the axis, and the <U+FB02>ow of material is from
the smaller to the larger branches, the smaller uniting to form the
larger.  The author explains dendritic structure by the formation
of a <U+FB01>ssure in rock which becomes <U+FB01>lled with a thin <U+FB01>lm of
dendritic material; if the <U+FB01>ssure is slowly widened, the dendrite
starts where the widening commences, coinciding dendrites being
formed on each wall. This theory is in accordance with many of
the characters of dendrites, such as their method of occurrence, the
nature of the material, and their uniformity in thickness.

ON THE THEORY          OF THE FUNCTION OF THE CONDENSER IN AN
                   INDUCTION-COIL.  BY DR.‘ B. WALTER.
    WO years     ago Mr. T. Mizuno published in this Magazine*
         some observations on the relation connecting the spark-length
in the secondary of an induction-coil     with the capacity of the con
denser in the primary.      These observations have recently induced
Mr. K. R. Johnson‘l‘, of Stockholm, to offer a theoretical expla—
nation which, it is true, is correct, but which in my opinion presents
as little novelty as the experiments themselves.        In fact, some
time before the appearance of Mizuno’s paper,                        I
                                                          published an
articlei‘ containing   not   only an  account of an identical  series of
experiments, but also a. detailed theory of them. This article of
mine has been passed over unnoticed by Mr. Johnson, although
it was expressly mentioned by Mr. Mizuno, and in all probability
served as a basis for the latter’s experiments.
   In one particular, indeed, these experiments appeared to offer a
contradiction to my theory, viz., in that the capacity of the con
denser for maximum spark-length was greater the greater the
primary current.     An explanation of this fact—<U+FB01>rst discovered by
Mr. Mizuno—has not been attempted by Mr. Johnson. Now in a
later communication by myself § the fact is hinted at in the
remark that with increasing current the primary spark becomes
stronger—a    phenomena which of course vitiates the theory.
On the other hand, the relations once more recently discussed by
Mr. Johnson        I
                 regarded as having been already established in my
previously  mentioned   article.

generally taken        as   representing    the   actual   pressure with

physical pressures.
   Several thermodynamical proofs of Nernst’s formula have
been givenI.       It seems to me that in general in these proofs

stringent, in that the electrical work done in passing a unit
charge through the surface is equated to the corresponding

imagine reversible electrolytic solution to take place without
charging up the solution, and the removal of this charge can
only be brought about by the introduction of negative ions
into the solution, from which process more osmotic work
might theoretically be obtained. The neglect of this effect
may be shown to give correct results, but the arbitrariness
resulting from   it  makes       di<U+FB01>icult to recognize the nature of
                                 it
the real assumptions on which the formula depends for its
validity.     For thermodynamical proof to satisfactorily admit
                 a
of this,it    seems essential that the operations should be re
ducible to an exact cycle, in which also the possibility of
                                                                       '
carrying out the individual processes should be evident.
    The importance of the theory            so great, in view of the
                                            is

                                  it
many different phenomena in electrochemistry, that               seems   it
advisable that the exact nature of the assumptions which under
lie the validity of Nernst’s formula should be recognizable as
clearly as possible. The following simple derivation, byxa
cyclical application of the second law, which allows this
recognition, may therefore not be without interest.
    Take for simplicity the special case of          cell composed of
                                                            a
silver electrodes in concentrations 01, 02 (01 >02) of silver
nitrate, in the vessels          A
                                 and   B  respectively in the <U+FB01>gure.
We assume that the silver nitrate                is
                                              completely dissociated,
and that the ions both exert osmotic pressures                 (p1 in
A, p2 in B) against semipermeable partitions X and Y, by
the motion of which work may be done on or obtained from
the cell reversibly.     Electrical work may also be obtained by
allowing electricity to pass round the circuit formed by
balancing the cell against an accumulator D.
    In order, however, to make this operation reversible, the
two concentrations must be separated by some form of par
tition which will prevent diffusion, and yet allow the reversible
passage of electricity through it.         For this purpose we may

imagine a partition Z, impermeable to silver ions, but allow
ing the free passage of N03 ions through it. A partition of
this kind, though only imaginary, introduces no ideas di<U+FB01>'erent
in principle from those connected with the actually realizable

partitions X and Y, and so cannot affect the validity of the
cycle ; it would, however, have the e<U+FB01>’ect on any passage of
N03 ions from one side to the other, of making the negative
charges carried by these the sole charge transferred across it.
When the cell is on open circuit the tendency of N03 ions
to diffuse through Z from A to B, would therefore produce at
Z a potential step balancing     it,the amount of which, however,
may   be  easily  calculated   on  the    ordinary osmotic pressure
theory.
    The following cycle may now be carried out :—First, a

the expansion of     the  solution   in     against

 into which formula it is only the pressures of the metal ions
at the two electrodes which enter. This result, however,d0es
not follow except on the law of mass-action.
    A further question arises as to the effect of the presence of
 any other salts in the solution in addition to the silver nitrate.
 It is clear, however, that so long as these are not reversible
 with respect to the electrodes, they can be cut off from
 exercising any pressure on the partitions X, Y, and Z by
 partitions impermeable to these salts, although permeable to
 silver nitrate, and the cycle can be carried out as before
 without alteration of the <U+FB01>nal result.      It follows that all sub
 stances in solution which are not deposited on an electrode
 or otherwise removed from the solution to an inde<U+FB01>nite extent
 by the passage of a current, however small, should produce
 no effect on the potential step there *.                              _
    It will be seen from the above that Nernst’s formula
 depends     for its validity only on the osmotic pressure
 and dissociation theory, and on the reversibility of "the
 electrolytic solution and deposition of the metal at the
 electrode.     It       is,

    The subject of the e<U+FB02>lux of <U+FB02>uids was investigated by
D. BernouilliI. Since that time the subject has been inves

writers.' In the present case we have only to deal with the.
e<U+FB02>lux of gases.    So long ago as 1804 Leslie§ suggested the

424                I   Dr. F. G. Donnau on       the   Relative Rates             of
described               the method which was afterwards worked                          out by
Bunsen‘.   The subject was taken up by G. G. Schmidt?
in 1820; and be deduced from his experiments the law of
the inverse square root of the density,     e. the law which was
                                                           1'.
rediscovered by Graham.        The subject was then treated in                                   a
masterly fashion        de Saint-Venant and Wantzeli.
                               by                            They
obtained the equation for the adiabatic e<U+FB02>lux of an ideal gas
on the assumption§ that the pressure at the vena contracta                                       is
equal to the external pressure; and they likewise observed
that this equation leads to absurd results when the external
pressure becomes zero. Their experiments showed the etilux
to be independent of the external pressure. when the latter
is   less than about one-half the pressure in the gas-reservoir;
and they suggest empirical formulae for dealing with this case.
About this time occur the classical experimental researches of
 Graham          His experiments were conducted with minute
 holes in very thin-walled partitions; and he coined the word
 effusion to denote the e<U+FB01>iux in this case. It must be observed,
 however, that so long as the apertures are not comparable with
 molecular dimensions, the phenomenon of effusion          simply                      is
 that of etiiux on     small scale.
                              a      The important point      that                          is
 the diameter of the hole should be suf<U+FB01>ciently large,       when
 compared with the thickness of the partition, to render the
 effects due to viscosity negligibly small.      Graham’s experi
 ments established the law of the inverse square root of the
 density1l.     Hydrogen, however, showed       marked deviation,  a
 which was rightly attributed by Graham to the effect of
 viscosity being more marked in this case owing to the
             of the gas. The ef<U+FB02>ux of gases was investigated by
 I‘ilghtness
      eisbach“, and by Thomson and Joule‘l'l' but the theory            ;
 was not advanced beyond the point to which           been carried           it
 by Saint-Venant and Wantzel.       In 1886 the adiabatic theory
 of etilux was subjected to an elaborate experimental investi
 gation by Him II, who rediscovered§§ the phenomenon

observed   by Saint-Venant and Wantzel, and came to the
conclusion that the theory was incorrect.     In the same year,
however, Hirn’s experimental results were very fully re
calculated by Hu oniot *, who showed that they were not in
discord with the t eory when the latter was extended in some
important respects.     The experiments of Wilde led Osborne
Reynolds 1' to reinvestigate the theory, and he arrived, prac
tically simultaneously with Hugoniot, at the same important
extension of the theory.     Quite recently the ef<U+FB02>ux of gases
has been the subject of an elaborate memoir by Parenty       who                             it,

                              the adiabatic theory, and proposes
other formulae in their stead.     Finally, the secondary phe

carried out. The <U+FB01>rst remark to make is that 170 was not kept
constant, but-decreased considerably during the course of an'
experiment.      If, however, we neglect acceleration-terms we
may   consider  the  equations as giving the instantaneous e<U+FB02>lux
at any moment, and integrate between the limits of pressure,
corresponding to any actual experiment.                   Secondly, the
dimensions of the apparatus were so chosen that the back
pressure p, in the receiver (which was initially vacuous) never
attained its critical value, which is about one-half of ‘ 110.        '

    relative effusion-rates of two such gases as argon and oxygen,
     which approximate very closely in their behaviour at moderate
     temperatures and pressures to the ideal gas and yet possess
     very different values of 'y. The theory indicates that argon
     ought to effuse, when compared with oxygen, considerably
    faster than would be calculated from the densities alone.

      It      will be seen that the theory sketched in the foregoing
    section only leads to simple comparison-formulae for the case
    of effusion in which the back-pressure   small in comparison                 is
    with  the pressure in the gas-reservoir. The following expe

    Efu-sion of Argon, Helium, and             some other Gases.           429
riments were made with an initial pressure in the gas-reservoir
which was about 700 mm. in one series and about 500 mm.in
the others, the back-pressure rising from zero to 60 and
47'5 mm. respectively.     The principal condition was, however,
that the apparatus should be such as to admit of measurements
being made with small quantities (20—30 cc.) of the rarer
gases.     It was necessary, therefore, to employ very small
apertures in order to reduce the unavoidable error in the
time-measurement'x‘to a suf<U+FB01>ciently small percentage. There
was a limit placed to the thickness of the partition, seeing that
it had to withstand pressures approaching that of an atmo
 sphere without collapsing, and so the conditions imposed
tended rather in the direction of viscosity-effects.   As will be
seen in the sequel, such effects made themselves apparent.
They could doubtless have been avoided by the employment of
large quantities of gas and much larger apertures, but that was
not possible in the present case. The apparatus employed is
 shown in the <U+FB01>gure: a is the gas-reservoir, the gas beinv intro
 duced through the capillary tubing b cd by means of the gas
 syphon e. The pressure was read off in the closed barometer
        f
 gauge by means of a mirror-glass scale.       The effusion-plug,
 or partition containing the effusion-aperture, was placed at or
 near the lower extremity of the glass tube 9 ; It represents a
 ground-glass joint with external mercury seal.        During an
 experiment, the taps i,j, k, and I being closed and m open, the
 gas passed from the reservoir a into the ,vacuous receiver 11
 through the narrow aperture in the effusion-plug.     The tube 11
 led to a Ttipler pump, which served to evacuate the apparatus
 and to collect the gas again at the conclusion of an experiment.
 Both gas-reservoir and receiver were kept at a constant tem
 perature by being immersed in a very large beaker of water.
 The temperature of the water was maintained uniform and
 constant by means of a stirrer with horizontal screw-shaped
 blades driven by a Heinrici hot-air motor and an Ostwald
 temperature-regulator <U+FB01>lled with toluene.
     In order to make a measurement with the apparatus, the
  mode of procedure was as follows :—The end g of the bent
  capillary tube was drawn of? to a <U+FB01>ne point and sealed.     The
  taps j,
      2',     and m were opened and the apparatus exhausted.

  These taps were then closed, and the tube containing the gas
 over mercury brought over the sealed point                 by

mercury meniscus was secured by having a small quantity of
 glycerine in the gauge,    e. just suf<U+FB01>cient to lubricate

   It is evident from the results for hydrogen and oxygen
that there is a large viscosity-effect.   Thus for pure effusion
the time for hydrogen should be very nearly one-quarter of
that for oxygen,     e. 3‘“ 5"3.

  little closer, for here the calculated time is also 11'‘1 19"6,
 while the mean observed time is 11m 17"9.                A similar result
 is obtained by using von Obermaier’s * values for the relative
 viscosities. For the purpose of comparing argon and helium
with oxygen it was necessary to reduce the viscosity-cor
rection as much as possible, so no further experiments were
carried out with this form of effusion-plug.                  Microscopic
examination showed that the hole produced by the spark was
irregular in shape and more of the nature of a series of cracks
or <U+FB01>ssures than anything else.              These are no doubt of ex
cessively minute width and so, even with thin-walled glass
bulbs, relatively high viscosity-effects are unavoidable.
     The new effusion-plug was made by taking a circular disk
of platinum-foil (about             millim. thick), backing
                                  215                               with   it        a

glass   tube  w  (see <U+FB01>gure).       The  effusion-aperture employed in
the <U+FB01>rst series of measurements              was about 516 millim. in
diameter.       Preliminary experiments showed that the time
of effusion for any given gas varied somewhat from day to
day and—to       a   less degree—even during the course of             con      a
secutive series of measurements.              This source of error was
eliminated      by  comparing each gas directly with oxygen, and
usually   the  time    of effusion for oxygen was measured imme
diately before and immediately after that of the gas in
   uestion, and the mean of these two values taken.
     The first effusion measurements were made with oxygen
and hydrogen to enable the viscosity-correction to be applied.
The results were as follows :—
          Oxygen          10m   54"7         10'“   54"8,    10m   54"8.

   The time for hydrogen calculated from the densities alone
is 2'“ 44"4.   The apparatus        therefore practically free from

on the following         day showed that some                                 disturbance  had

 It appears very probable that the platinum had occluded some
hydrogen, and that the resulting volume-changes were the
 source of the variations.                  The apparatus was now allowed to
 remain exhausted overnight.                         Experiments with oxygen next
 morning gave      the   following              results        :—

The apparatus was left <U+FB01>lled with oxygen overnight, pumped
out the next morning, allowed to remain in connexion with
 the pump for an hour or so, and then re<U+FB01>lled with oxygen :—

    It  was accordingly concluded that the aperture had been
 again brought to a constant state and any occluded hydrogen
 removed. Argon was now measured :—
              Oxygen          .      .      .       10m       56"4.

That. is to say, argon e<U+FB01>‘uses too                      rapidly by about 3'5 per cent.
 when compared with oxygen by the inverse square-root law.
    In order to con<U+FB01>rm this result a second determination was
 made.       During the interval (week-end) the apparatus had
 remained exhausted and, as will be seen, the time of effusion
 for oxygen had considerably increased :

    The time for argon, calculated from that for oxygen by
 means     of the densities, is 12m 318'2. so that the observed
 time is 3'7 per cent. less, which agrees fairly well with the
 previous result.

   This deviation being in the direction indicated by the
adiabatic theory, the next thing was to measure some other
gas with a diatomic molecule and speci<U+FB01>c-heat ratio 1'4 ; for
in that case agreement might be expected between the ob

   The calculated value for CO is 10m 32"9.       The observed
value is only '4 per cent. smaller. Probably this deviation is
due to experimental error (compare the two results with
argon).
   The next gas investigated was carbon dioxide ; for as this
possesses a lower speci<U+FB01>c-heat ratio than 1'4, its time of
effusion ought to be greater than that calculated. Experiment
proved the contrary :—

   These    results indicate the presence of  small viscosity                     a
eifect.    This was probably caused by the gradual narrowing
of the aperture, which    shown by the successive results for
                                    is
oxygen.   Now   all the previous calculations have assumed the
absence of any disturbance due to viscosity.  The best way to
determine their value to re-calculate the experimental results,

introducing   correction for viscosity as determined

This could be done directly by means of the formula
                                t= lax/(Hm,
provided 1c, and It, remained constant.     But the results for
oxygen show that this was not the case.           It    probable,                          is
however, that any change in the size of the hole will chie<U+FB02>y
affect x1, since the out<U+FB02>ow       mainly an “effusion” flow.
                                                   is
These considerations suggest the following method of making
the viscosity-correction.   Calculate values for x1 and leg from
the last measurements for oxygen and hydrogen. Then in any
particular case correct the value of x, so obtained by assuming
that the change in 1:1      proportional to the change in the
                                    is
observed time of effusion for oxygen.         That this mode of
procedure     justi<U+FB01>able

                                    by  the  fact that the times

agree very closely with the observed times in each particular

      A sample of helium was now introduced into the apparatus.
After the effusion had proceeded for a short time, a complete
block occurred. The helium was pumped out, and the mercury
having been sucked out of the seal, the apparatus was cut above
 the tap and the effusion-plug removed for examination. There
 was a whitish deposit on the platinum.               The hole was cleared
 by cautiously heating the platinum to redness and drawing air
 through it.         On sealing the apparatus together again the hole
  was found to be clear, but on again admitting the helium
  another block occurred.          It was evident that the helium cons
  tained some impurity whichattacked the platinum or condensed
  in some way in the aperture. The helium was accordingly
   removed and the hole again cleared out as described.                     On
   sealing together again and testing with oxygen and hydrogen,
   a reatly increased viscosity-effect was observable.             When the
   e<U+FB02>usion-tube was cutout and the platinum foil microscopically
   examined, the cause of the viscosity could be seen in the form
   of two holes connected by a <U+FB01>ssure.              This was probably due
   to the corroding action of the impurity
                                                      " combined with the
   frequent heating.
       A new disk of foil was now pierced and soldered on to the
   platinum tube; but it was also found to show a very high
   viscosity-effect.     The origin of this was <U+FB01>nally traced to the
   cracking      of the enamel  at the junction of the platinum and
   glass tubes.
       Owing to the di<U+FB02>iculty of making this joint, a new e<U+FB02>'usion
   plug was constructed as follows :—A thick circular disk of
   platinum was made by welding several pieces of foil together.
   A circular hole was punched in the centre of this, and a thin‘l'
   disk offoil,which had been punctured in the manner previously
   described, was welded on so as to cover the hole in the thick
   disk.      The latter was then fastened by means of Uhatterton
    cement to a glass tube whose end had been turned over and
    ground to a <U+FB02>at <U+FB02>ange ; and this tube was sealed to the rest
    of the apparatus. After some trials an effusion-plug was
    obtained which showed only a comparatively small viscosity

          A piece of glass which was immersed in the helium was found to

Rayleigh to be '96, so that its value referred to oxygen is '865.

advisable to re-measure argon and carbon monoxide as a

negligible and that the observed time is 3'4 per cent. less than

considerable and, contrary to previous results, the observed

in agreement with former ones.                    If   We apply no viscosity

The want of agreement between this' and former resnlts may
be artly due to variable admixture with argon.
       he fact remains that all the results obtained for helium
are atfected by a more or less uncertain correction for
viscosity, and do not agree among themselves.                          If any one
were to be selected as better than the rest, it would be the
last one, as the hole "appeared to be practically free from
viscosity-effects in this case, and the specimen of helium was

back-pressure.              This was frequently con<U+FB01>rmed by experi

   As foreseen by the theory, the rate of effusion of argon,
when compared with that of oxygen, is very considerably
greater than the value as calculated by the law of the inverse
square root of the density.   The foregoing experiments agree
uniformly in showing that the deviation amounts to 3% per cent.
On the other hand, the results obtained with helium, although
not very uniform, show pretty conclusively that its behaviour
is unlike that of argon. "According to the theory, however,
it should behave in an exactly similar manner. These facts
seem to point to the omission of some factor or factors in
the basis of the theory.                                   .
   Now it will be obserVed that the theory assumes that the
gases obey the ideal gas laws, and hence excludes anything
of the nature»of the Joule-Thomson effect.         It therefore
appeared of interest to examine the question of the effusion
of an impevykct gas, with special reference to the        onle                   J

The <U+FB01>nal result may be stated as follows:—“A gas will effuse
more rapidly or more slowly than an ideal gas of equal density
according as K        positive or negative.”
                          is
    Now Joule and Thomson found K to be positive for all
gases, with the exception perhaps of hydrogen. For hydrogen
 K   was very small and its sign rather uncertain.     Accordingly
most gases will e<U+FB01>use in some degree faster than the usual
 theory of e<U+FB02>lux would indicate.       Now helium *      even more                      is
 “ perfect” than hydrogen. It          therefore just possible that
                                                      is
 for helium K       negative, in which case helium would effuse
                        is
somewhat more slowly than the ordinary theory would indicate.
    How far these effects would compensate each other, and in
particular what the relative importance of the correction-term
 is, Ihave not yet investigated, but hope to do so in   subsequent                      a
communication.

 3% per cent. faster than as calculated by the law ofthe inverse
square rootof thedensity.         This result is ’ independent of any

    2. This result is in q'ualitative agreement 'with the adiabatic
 theory of the e<U+FB02>lux of ideal gases, and                if this may be
                                                              is,
 granted, acg<U+FB01><U+FB01>'rination of the high speci<U+FB01>c-heat ratio of argon.
    3. When viscosity-effects are eliminated or allowed for,                                 it
is  found that hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide effuse
relatively-in the manner predicted                       by
                                               the theory for ideal
gases possessing the same, or nearly the same, speci<U+FB01>c-heat
 ratio.                                                                 .
    4. Carbon dioxide, when compared with oxygen, appears
to effuse about       per cent. faster than as calculated from the
                         1
densities. This result        not in accordance with the adiabatic
                                  is
 theory   of the eftlnx of ideal  gases.
     5. The results obtained for helium are not uniform, and are
 affected       by
                 viscosity-correction depending on an empirical
                     a
 formula.     They are suf<U+FB01>cient, however, to show that the
behaviour of helium         unlike that of argon,
                             is                          result which
                                                                   a                         is
 not foreseen        by
                    the theory.
   6.     If
           account be taken of the deviation of ordinary gases
from the ideal laws,          possible to obtain an expression for
                             it   is
the ef<U+FB02>ux which contains            correction-term involving the
                                       a
constant K of the oule-Thomson effect.
                         J
    7. The sign of this correction-term shows that               real gas       a
will effuse more rapidly or more slowly than an ideal gas of
equal density and speci<U+FB01>c-heat ratio, according as K              positive      is
or negative.
   8.   The suggestion       made that possibly the anomalous
                              is
results obtained with carbon dioxide and helium may be thus
explained.     The deviations of the observed results from the
 results calculated for an ideal gas are, in the case of CO2, in
qualitative accordance with the theory proposed.             In the case
of helium they would be so         that gas possessed
                                       if                    negative K.

XLII.         On some Improved Formulas and lffetlzods connected
              with Lenses. By Tnonss H. BLAKESLEY *.
       a paper read before the Physical Society on June llih,
IN 1897, I pointed     out the connexion between the distance
of an object from the <U+FB01>rst principal focus of a lens and the
relation of its linear magnitude with that of the image pro
duced : viz. that every change in that distance by the amount
of the focal length of the lens produced a unit of change in
the relation of these magnitudes; and    described methods I
means of which the focal length might be very accurate                                       ybly
                                                                                         '
determined upon these grounds.
I    also explained how the position of the two principal foci
might be accurately determined                       by
                                      placing the lens upon                                   [a
plane   mirror  and  <U+FB01>nding the  spot at which     an object be      if
placed its image inverted will coincide with it.
   The rules given apply equally well to combinations of
                                                       '
                                                         coaxial
lenses as to single lenses.
   Hence all focussing properties of lens-systems are really
determined when the three following matters are known :—
         (l) The focal length with proper sign.
         (2) The position of the <U+FB01>rst principal focus.
                                                                                               ‘
         (3) The position of the second principal focus.
   The <U+FB01>rst principal focus       de<U+FB01>ned as the point such that
                                      is                                                     if

system the beam will consist of parallel rays.

    If  the lens constants are    thoroughly known, we have an
equation of the form
                             1

 where A and B are both constants.
     In practice it would be possible to determine A and B by
 observing the values of c in the cases of two liquids whose
indices have been determined in other ways; but it is not
 necessary to take this course where a single lens is employed,
 because in that case the radius r can be expressed in terms of
 the focal length, the distances uo and no of the principal foci
 from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens, and the
thickness of the lens, the latter being easily measured by
calipers.     The formula for     then is

 which can be inserted in the above equation.
     Or if a compound lens is employed, the value of 1’ may be
  determined by a spherometer; but this instrument does not
 furnish the most accurate means of calculating such radii.
 This point will receive attention below.
     A telescope is an arrangement of coaxial lenses, some
 forming what is called the object-glass, others the eyepiece.
 Each of these portions may be far from simple, but each must
 have its own focal length and pair of principal foci.       When
 the second principal focus of the object-glass coincides with
  the <U+FB01>rst principal focus of the eyepiece, the focal length of
  the combination is infinite, for the k of this problem is equal
 to zero.    This is often considered to be the position of adjust
  ment for viewing distant objects; and in fact a telescope will
 always have a very long focal length though the actual value
  will differ with different eyes. Now if a telescope is in this
 condition of adjustment, having an in<U+FB01>nite focal length, we
_may divide _the system anywhere we please, and call one part
  the object-glass and the other the eyepiece.         All that is
  necessary is that the dividing surface shall be a plane at right
  angles to the common axis, or a sphere having its centre on
  the common axis.      The division itself may even take place
  through one of the lenses.
     The two portions of the system thus formed will have the
 following properties.
     The second principal focus of one of them will always
  coincide with the <U+FB01>rst principal focus'of the other.

           Formulae and Methods connected with Lenses.                      45]
   The ratio of the two focal lengths will always have the
same value, the magnifying-power of the whole, wherever the
division is made.
   When, for the purposes of celestial photography, a telescope
has a camera attached at the eye-end, the question arises how
far the eyepiece must be racked out in order to obtain an
image on the plate.
   If the optical properties of the eyepiece are known, e. its        1'.
focal length and the positions of its principal foci, then of
course the distance of the camera-plate from the second
principal focus   isknown.    But the camera-plate must be in
the second principal focus of the whole system.      Hence the
distance from the second principal focus of the eyepiece to
the plate must be the travel of the principal focus due to the
application of the object-glass,     i.

     If we have lens system, and coaxial with
                 a                                           it mirror,
                                                                  a
 either plane or spherical, and light     is  passed <U+FB01>rst  through the
lens in   a direction towards the mirror, and after re<U+FB01>exion at
the mirror, back through the lens in the reverse direction,
the combination forms     a   virtual mirror to which the following
very simple     rules apply:—
       The virtual mirror’s surface       is conjugate with the real
          mirror’s surface by the lens.
       The virtual mirror’s centre of curvature        conjugate with
          the real mirror’s centre    of curvature   by is
                                                        the lens.
    These rules enable one at once to determine the general
facts of the image-formation in any given case.
    If the virtual mirror  is   a plane one, its radius of curvature
is  in<U+FB01>nite, and either its surface or its centre of curvature
must be at in<U+FB01>nity, while the other must be at a <U+FB01>nite
distance.
    Hence to form    a  virtual plane mirror either the surface or
the centre of the real mirror must be in the second principal
focus of the lens.                   ‘
     Ifthe surface of the mirror makes this coincidence, the
surface of the plane virtual mirror will be at in<U+FB01>nity; but its
centre    isnot so, and may be easily found experimentally, as

itself.                               -
     If the    centre of curvature of the mirror coincides with the
 second principal focus of the lens, the centre of the curvature
 of the virtual plane mirror is at in<U+FB01>nity; but the plane itself
 will not be so, and its position may be easily found experi
 mentally as the place where an object coincides with an erect
 image of itself.
     Such virtual mirrors, whether plane or not, giving erect
 images, are of course often formed in front of the lens; and
 in such cases there is not the smallest di<U+FB01>iculty in passing an
             “
  object through the looking-glass.”
      The rules given above for the position of the centre of

    This affords a very convenient way of practically mea
suring the radius of curvature of the face of a lens, as a pool
of mercury is an easy way of producing the conditions.
    I  have mentioned above in dealing with the index of
refraction of a liquid that a knowledge of this value is im
portant ; and this optical method is in my opinion far superior
to that of the spherometer in making the determination.
    Those who may have followed the above remarks with care
will see that     I strongly advocate those optical methods of
measurement which depend upon making a coincidence
between the position of an object and that of its image.
These coincidences may be determined with very great pre
cision by any one accustomed to observation; and the appa
ratus required, though it may be made as elaborate as any
others, need be no more than the simplest. A small optical
bank about <U+FB01>ve inches long, a holder to slide up and down and
to carry a sharply-pointed piece of white paper, four square
inches of good plane mirror, at hand-lens of about 2 inches
focal length to determine coincidences, and a rule and calipers
to measure distances, are really all that is necessary to make
determinations of an accuracy far surpassing that in vogue at
present.
    I have examined a lantern-projector which professed to have
a focal length of 6 inches (=15'24 cm.). It actually possesses
one of 17'81 cm.
    A microscope objective whose nominal value was 1% inch,
made by the most eminent optician in London, was measured
directly, and indirectly by taking its two component lenses
separately and measuring their focal lengths and the overlap
of their principal foci.
        The <U+FB01>rst method gave 1'347

XLIIL      On the Controvers_     concerning Volta’s Contact Force.

          osmotic pressure hypothesis, strictly speaking, perhaps
rl‘HE
 ‘
    .   hardly belongs to my present subject, since whatever
controversy or question has gathered round it is of a different
kind from that concerning the seat of the E.M.F. The osmotic
pressure hypothesis does not concern itself apparently with the
Volta electrostatic effect, but with the mechanism of propulsion
in a voltaic cell : it hardly cares to discriminate between the two
cases, for they appear in many respects much the same; and
it locates the seat of the              quite de<U+FB01>nitely at a junction
on one side of which at least there is a liquid or substance with
loco-mobile atoms, and not at a metal-metal junction: it
deals entirely with moving ions, such as cannot exist in true
solids. Moreover it is not a hypothesis really distinct from that
of the recognized chemical combination associated with a cur
rent-producing cell, only it regards that chemical combination
from a different point of view—from the dissociation or
ionisation point of view.          Instead of saying that zinc is
oxidised or that zinc sulphate is formed, it professes to regard
atoms of zinc as shot off into the liquid in a non-combined or
free form: ultimately, no doubt, to enter into real combination,
but existing for a time, and always in a certain proportion, in
the form of practically free ions.         Thus the full discussion of
the osmotic pressure hypothesis is essentially chemical in its
nature, and need not here concern us. At the same time so
many people are interested just now in this remarkable view
of chemical combination, that         I   refrain from passing it by
altogether; though, as it is not a hypothesis specially and
long familiar to me, my remarks on it will not have any par.
ticular weight.       Fortunately there are several writings to
which a student of such matters can be referred—the treatise
of' van t’ Hoff, the work of Arrhenius and of Planck, and
the textbooks of Ostwald and of N ernst, especially of Nernst;
and likewise the excellent Report on these subjects presented
to the British Association in 1897 at Toronto by Mr. W. O.
D. Whetham, as well as to his book on ‘ Solution.’              F urther
more,   I may  refer   to the  works   of   Dr. J.  Larmor,    especially
Phil. Trans. vol. exe. p. 270; and to a paper by Prof.
Poynting in Phil. Mag. vol. xlii. p. 289 (1896), where it is
shown that the dissociation hypothesis need not be pressed

too   literally, that solution may be a kind of chemical com
bination, and yet all the facts deduced on the free ionisation
hypothesis can be true. This compromise                  however, criti    is,

condition of         liquid, where the particles are always within

    Without attempting to decide these moot points, we will
here consider the question open whether the statement in
terms of free ions             only
                                is     mode of expression, or whether

Poynting’s      paper,    for instance,   does not decide against the
latter possibility,           only attempts to show that
                               it                                     not             it   is
really necessary to grant free ions as             physical reality; but
                                                                    a
 Mr. Whetham evidently inclines to the idea that they are at
least free of each other, and adduces an argument in favour
ofthat view (pp. 233, 244, B. A. Report 1897) which               worthy              is
 of attention. But while assuming that opposite ions are free
of each other, he considers that they are both attached to the
solvent, and are by no means really and bombardingly free,
as are the molecules of gases.              Prof. Poynting appears to
 agree       ";

 metal but two liquids, especially when the two liquids differ

   The ideas underlying all such calculations are (a) that the ions
 migrate for two reasons: one their own random motion whereby
 they naturally diffuse on the average from the more concen
 trated to the less concentrated solution, carrying their charges
 with them, the other an organized motion caused by the pro
 pulsive in<U+FB02>uence on these same charges of the gradient of
 potential caused by their gradual ditfusive accumulation; and
 (b) that in the steady state ultimately attained the rate of
 migration of opposite ions must become equal otherwise the                      :

   So much stress has been laid upon the fact of different intrinsic velocities
    of opposite ions when under the same conditions, that it is apt to be
    forgotten that in ordinary electrolysis the conditions are such as to force
    equal, or at least electrically equivalent velocities, on anion and cation
    substance taken as a whole, in the steady state. The ions are ropelled
    not by outside forces acting from the electrodes, but b interna actions:
    the readjustment of the whole material must be attende to. The intrinsic
    speed of a projectile is greater than that of the gun-recoil,        yet, after a
     battery has <U+FB01>red, the centre of gravity of the whole is no nearer the
     target than before.       The mass-speeds are equal and op osite. In the
     electrical case the charge-speeds are equal and opposite.         irect experi

     be discriminated and followed. Even in such heterogeneous liquids the
     current-strength is the same across every section; but the local potential
     gradient depends on the local conductivity, and the concentration is
     arbitrary : it is still true, however, that the potential-gradient is the same
     for anion as for cation at any giVen place; and hence if they do ulti
      mately travei at the same pace in spite of intrinsically different ease of
     travel, the fact must be expressible as due to an accumulated osmotic

   To calculate the total E.M.F. of a cell, however, it is
necessary to take the other boundaries of the liquid into account.
It is useless to complete the circuit by liquid, it must be com
pleted by metals, and in the cases now being considered by
one and the same metal.        Each metal acts as a wall pre
venting cffective diffusion of one at least of the liquid ions :
the cathode prevents the cation from advancing, the anode
prevents the anion ; whatever else the metals may do will be the

be calculated in absolute measure.               .
   Now since the characteristic gas constant B, the absolute
speci<U+FB01>c heat of expansion per gram of perfect gas, varies
inversely with m the atomic weight, it follows that Rm is an
absolute constant, the same for every substance, or at least
only differing by a simple multiple, having twice the value
for electrolytic as for undissociated molecular substances ;
hence we may take its value as double that for, say, hydrogen.

nothing is wanted except this migration ratio and the con
centration ratio n/n' to calculate in absolute measure the E.M.F.
of such a cell, with the same metal at either end.
    A table of correspondences between theory and experiment
is quoted from Ostwald and Nernst by Whetham in his B. A.
 Report, and they agree very remarkably indeed when one
considers that the inunbers are absolute numbers and might
 have been in error by large quantities.             To illustrate this
 take a cell with decinormal solution of HUl on one side and
 centinormal solution on the other, so that the concentration
 ratio n/n’ = 10.
    For the migration ratio we might take Hittorf’s own
 numbers (which he tabulates in the form u/(u+v) &c.) ; but
 several more recent and presumably more exact deter
 minations have been made, and it may be convenient to
 quote    here    the    table     of absolute velocities given by
 Mr. Whetham as embodying the most recent measurements
 in 1897.     As 1 write them they give the ionic velocity in
 mikroms per second for a potential gradient of 1 volt per
 centimetre (a mikrom being 10—6 metre or 10“ cm., about
 double the wave-length of green light).

   These agreements, though not perfect, are clearly far and
away beyond anything attributable               chance, and they                  to
practically substantiate the essential features of N ernst’s theory,
a theory which seems to me to rank high among rational

                   concerning     Volta’s Contact Force.                   46l
calculations of this kind. The success of this brilliant concen
tration theory of batteries with one metal and two liquids, or
rather one liquid with different strengths, lends weight to the
supplementary suggestions of the same great chemist *, that
the E.M.F. of batteries containing one liquid and two metals
can likewise be calculated on similar lines.                 So long as the
metals are the same at either side, and only the solutions have
to be considered, this diffusion theory clearly represents a
great step in the direction of the truth, even if it cannot be
asserted at present to be the whole truth.
    But when the so-called solution-pressure of a metal itself has
to be taken into consideration, the ground becomes less secure
and satisfactory.
     When zinc dissolves in an acid this hypothesis assumes not
that the zinc is eaten away by combination with the acid
 radical, but that it as it were evaporates into the liquid, giving
 rise to free zinc ions having a certain osmotic pressure.
     If asked why zinc should evaporate any more freel into
 liquid than into air, it may be answered (as Mr. F. H. eville
 suggests), because the great cohesive force, Laplace’s K, would
 resist evaporation into air, but would be far less effective in
 resisting evaporation into a liquid n here the change of
density is much less sharply emphasised at the boundary.
 Hence though a certain repugnance may naturally at <U+FB01>rst be
 felt to this evaporation theory, it may turn out a reasonable
 mode of expressing facts, and                it demands careful con
                                                                               *
 sideration.
     The above mere cohesion consideration would tend, however,
 to make all liquids too much alike in their solvent influence on
 metals; the form given to the theory by Mr. VVhetham and
  Prof. Poynting, that the ions though free of each other are
  chemically attached to the solvent, seems far more plausible,
 and overcomes many dif<U+FB01>culties.               On either view the follow
  ing statements hold good.
     When a metal dissolves in a liquid there is no interchan e
  of ions, cations pass into the liquid, but no anions necessar<U+FB01>y
  pass out of it. Sometimes there is an interchange of cations—
  one set going in and another set coming out—as when iron
  displaces copper, or zinc displaces hydrogen.                Probably some

462             Prof. O. Lodge on           the Controversy
impurit   in the metal, enabling galvanic action to occur, is
essentia  to this process, but that is here not ,a matter of
primary importance.                            _
   Consider now a Daniell cell of the simplest theoretical
kind :
                  On | UuSO4 l ZnSO4 | Zn.
As soon    as the circuit is completed, zinc goes into solution
at one end and copper comes out.         The difference between
the energy of combination of Zn and On with SO4 gives the
whole E.M.F. ; since, as is well known, the dE/dt and therefore
the 2(11) happen in this case to be practically zero.
   But what about the location of the E.M.F.? Leaving on
one side the extraordinary contention in favour of the zinc
copper junction, there are three other junctions at which the
chief   ortion of the E.M.F. might be located; and at <U+FB01>rst
sight  theliquid/liquid junction at tbeporous partition seems the
most likely. For here         that the actual exchange of Zn for
                             it   is
Cu takes place  ;  and  hence     may be said, either heat must
                                       it
here be locally developed or else the energy must be used
in propelling the electric current and developing the same
quantity of heat elsewhere.
   But, as Hopkinson virtually pointed out (p. 341, Phil. Mag.
Oct. 1885), this involves the tacit assumption that the metallic
ions do all the travelling, while the SO,           stationary ;—in
                                                           is
that case the metallic zinc which oes into solution would at
<U+FB01>rst be merel       passed on, and         real energy-production
                                            t   e
would occur w ere zinc atoms took the place of copper atoms,
viz., at the junction of solutions in the porous partition.
After that there    is   amere passing on again, though now of
copper.
   But the migration ratio of the ions           in reality different
                                                      is
from this, and the $04       is    by
                                 no means really stationary.       As
another  extreme    assumption, suppose   that  the  $04  ion did  all
the travelling, then the zinc sulphate solution                 is
                                                       strengthened
and the copper sulphate solution           impoverished, and the
                                                is
whole positive energy of combination          at the surface of the
                                                     is
zinc, while  at the  surface of the copper  there  must be smaller   a
opposition force corresponding to the tearing of the SO4 away
from the Cu there.
   Now this concentration in one compartment and weakening
in the other compartment corresponds much more nearly than
the <U+FB01>rst hypothesis does with what      observed, the truth being
                                            is
of course something intermediate between the two extremes.
Anions and cations both travel, and so the total E.M.F.                  is
shared in certain proportions between all the junctions:

endosmose through t e porous cell.       Indeed, so far as know                  I
at present, the migration velocity of SO, has not yet been
very well directly determined.
   But, although all this is valid on any view as to the nature
of solution, the above mode of statement belongs to the old
fashioned view of' chemical combination, the notion of
metallic solution which was in vogue a few years ago.        It
may be well to state the matter also in terms of dissociation
ideas.
   The fashionable method is to think of the solvent as little
more than a menstrum fora stream of metallic ions to saunter
through.     We may think of the zinc ions travelling into the
liquid and some copper ions leaving                     it,

more so than a cell speci<U+FB01>ed by Hittorf ‘, who says that by

be made electropositive to zinc, so that copper shall go into
solution and zinc shall be turned out, being deposited upon a

   The theory which seeks to reduce the whole material
universe to electric charges, their motions and interactions,
constitutes a gigantic subject upon which         scarcely rash        it   is
to predict that    great deal will be said during the ensuing

   Meanwhile the mode of expression in term of corpuscles                                 is
less ambitious than that in terms of electrons, though both
are revolutionary and striking enough.     Let us take     then                  it

     At an electrode the corpuscle leaves its ion to do the best                   it
can, and passes on into the metal, each atom receiving                into   it

     charged cOrp'uscle is the mobile ingredient; so that superposin g
     a positive charge on a negatively charged atom is not adding
     something to the corpuscles already there, but is removing the
     extra negative corpuscle and another as well ; taking the atom
     down therefore instead of building it up, and leaving a void
    which automatically <U+FB01>lls itself up whenever it gets a chance.
    It is just possible that some kind of effective transmutation
    might be effected in an electric spark or are with different

        Whether combination of atoms takes place across any junction
    when a current passes, appears to be merely a question of
    relative mobility of corpuscles and atoms.         If the atoms are
    free to move, if it is easier to move an atom across the inter
    face than to detach from it a corpuscle, then combination occurs,
l   and the conduction is then necessarily on one side essentially
    electrolytic; and at a liquid-liquid junction there may be
    double atomic freedom and complete electrolysis.              But if
l
    the corpuscles are more detachable than the atoms, then the
    conduction is metallic and no alloy is formed.
        But now, pressing further the osmotic pressure view, if the
    metals can evaporate into a liquid they ought perhaps to be
   able to evaporate into each other, and so the                     at a
   junction ought     to be calculable as
                                         '

   but what shall we put into the brackets for the ionic velocities ?
   Not ionic velocities at all, but corpuscular velocities, and these
   corpuscular velocities may differ by reason of the different
   viscosity or obstruction offered by each metal ; which again
   perhaps may be proportional to the density; but the solution
   can hardly be treated as a weak one, or the gaseous laws as
   applicable.                       _                            .   .
       If gaseous laws are applicable to the corpuscles inside
   metal, the value of this characteristic constant B will be
   500 or 600 times the value for hydrogen; but inasmuch as
   the m, or e the electrochemical equivalent, is 1/500 or
   1/600 of the hydrogen value, the resulting ReT comes out
  just as usual.                   _                        _
       The viscosity or obstruction offered by metal 15 probably
  its electrical resistance; and so the corpuscular velocity in
  each may be proportional to the conductivity.

 but the interchange may or must begin as soon as current                         a

                 concerning   Volfa’s Contact Force.            469
 then the B aggregation there will be a force urging the
 corpuscles to <U+FB02>ow from A to B.
    In a gas the negative corpuscles are by far the most
 mobile ; indeed the positive corpuscles seem unable to move
 except with their atoms electrolytically.         It ma be that
 even inside a metal the negative corpuscles are likewise by
 far the most mobile, being readily handed on from one atom
 to the next, this process constituting metallic conduction;
 while the positive corpuscles remain attached to their atoms,
 which except in an electrolyte or a substance with some
 electrolytic properties are not subject to locomotion at all.
 Assuming this mobility of corpuscles of one sign solely, they
 are urged along a gradient of temperature in a metal for two
 reasons : one a mechanical force equivalent to a dp/dx acting
 on an element of volume, or l/n of this per corpuscle ; the
 other an electrical force dV/da: acting on its electric charge e.
    When there is no current these forces must balance.        So
                         1  dp      dV
                                —       =0,

that the negative corpuscles do all the travelling:            they                         if

speed of the negative and positive corpuscles or electrons
is nearly equal, but that in some metals the positive travel
slightly faster, in other metals the negative: the difference
being subordinate and secondary.
   It will turn out on this view that the “speci<U+FB01>c heat of

           Helmholtz’s View of Electric ZlIass-A<U+FB02>inity.
   The doctrine that matter has a speci<U+FB01>c attraction for
electricity * leads to many of the same conclusions as the sup
           that positive or negative electricity inside a substance
position
  as a real speci<U+FB01>c heat, and the two modes of statement may
be considered together; but we may speak in the language of
Helmholtz’s hypothesis as being the more important of the
two, indeed the only one seriously upheld as a physical
reality.    As has been suggested above, p. 369, it is to some
extent ambiguous, however ; for it is not certain whether the
af<U+FB01>nity or attraction is e<U+FB01>'ective at a metal-aether free surface
or at a metal-metal unction.          As usually stated, the attraction
is supposed to be an affair of mass or bulk and not of surface,
though no doubt any such internal volume electric stress
would give rise to something analogous to electrical surface
tension; but the whole may be really and essentially super
<U+FB01>cial, having to do with the free surface only; and in that
case it is dif<U+FB01>cult to distinguish it from chemical a<U+FB01>‘inity,
unless it can truly be shown to be independent of the pre
sence and nature of surrounding adjacent matter.                Even so
it may be considered as an early and crude statement of
certain consequences of the electron theory of matter, rather
than as a distinct and independent theory (of.                      J.

    However it be regarded, it is plain that the effect of an
attraction between matter and electricity must display itself

1.                      processes in nature are irreversible.      for     If
      / instance
     CERTAIN           mechanical energy be converted into heat,
only a part of it can, as a net result, he reconverted.           The
energy,   or  part  of     it,   is
                            dissipated.
      We are taught in the kinetic theory of gases that heat con
     2.
sists of, or    proportional to, the energy of molecular motions
                is
in the stationary state which involve no dissipation of energy,
and are therefore reversible.                    If
                                         this theory be true, there
should exist processes which, as they relate to an aggregate of
molecules, are irreversible, although they consist of molecular
motions each separately reversible.         Can any such process be
proved   to  exist?
      The analytical theorems which are supposed to prove the
     3.
existence of such processes have generally the following form.
It   is  proved that a function, always of the same sign,
diminishes or increases until         limit  a reached, which limit
                                                       is
may be a maximum or minimum for the function in question,
and when that limit        reached the motion
                             is                             is
                                                   stationary.   An
such function may be called the characteristic function of the
process in question, and shall be denoted by H.
   It suf<U+FB01>cient to consider the case where H
          is                                                      is
                                                         diminishing
                                                                   a

476           .        Mr. S. H. Burbury                       on certain
function and          d7?   negative.              It     does      not matter,          as   regards
the       question of reversibility,                      whether          4%   is       necessarily
negative, or only more likely at each stage of the process to
be negative than to be positive. It enough        distinction  is               if   a
exrsts between        the   forward motion in which                            E      1s   negative,
and the back-ward motion in which                              %      is   positive.          In   this
distinction consists the irreversibility. But the distinction
must exist at every stage of the process at which H exceeds
its minimum.
   4. The best known of these theorems           Boltzmann’s H
theorem in the theory of gases, wherein           proved that his     a it
function H continually diminishes till          certain state           is is                        is
reached, which involves the equal partition of energy.
   S0 Herr Planck in his treatise tlber irriversible Strahlungs
vorgdnge proves that a function       the entropy of his system,
                                                         L,
necessarily increases till   state     reached analogous to the
                                         a                is
equal partition of energy.    But in Planck’s theorem we have
to do, not with molecular motions each evidently reversible,
but with electromagnetic vibrations in aether, about which we
cannot say with the same certainty that they are reversible
separately. At present       propose to deal only with Boltz
                                    I
mann’s theorem, as     type of
                             a  theorems founded on molecular
motions certainly reversible.
                            The Directing Condition.
     5.   All the   molecular motions being reversible, the fact that
H > H0      cannot alone make                  (5—113   negative.        For    we may reverse
all the velocities, and that reversal in continuous motion
changes the sign of              (27H
                                        without altering the value of                         H—Ho.
Some further          condition          is   therefore required                     to determine
the sign of                 This we may call the directing condition.
     6. The directingcondition being de<U+FB01>ned, there arises the
question   whether or  not      exists in fact.
                                          it              does, the             If   it
diminution of H     an irreversible process.
                        is                      if not, the process
is  not proved to be irreversible.      Boltzmann’s condition in
his Theory of Gases        that the motion
                                 is              and continues to        is,
     “ molecular ungeordnet.”     That,      can  be de<U+FB01>ned, may
                                                               if   it
be,
be the most general form of the condition.        For my present

                        supposed Irreversible Processes.                                          477
theoretical purpose it is suf<U+FB01>cient to deal with the test-case
of elastic spheres, and for that case the condition may be
expressed as follows :—The chance that two spheres approach
ing collision shall have velocities within assigned limits is
independent of their relative position, and of the positions
and velocities of all other spheres, and also independent of
the past history of the system, except as this has altered the
distribution of the velocities inter $0.
   This condition of independence            as           is,
                                                    propose to show,  I
the directing condition required to make the diminution of H
in the test-case an irreversible process.             propose also to I
consider as far as possible   whether     this   directing   condition
can be assumed to exist in fact.

external disturbance happens to the system, the positions and
velocities of all the spheres at any time t are determinate
functions of t and the initial positions and velocities, and of
no other quantity whatever.     The condition of independence
cannot therefore strictly hold for all time, though it may hold
approximately.      For any two of the velocities, as u and                                        u',
are functions of the same set of variables.     It cannot there
fore be assumed at least without further investigation that
                                                                  '

 time dt, and again-after every subsequent interval dt, some
 external cause, say Maxwell’s demons, effects     redistribution                 a

 have seen, be occasionally                          positive. But as long as many of
 the factors F' '~Ff have                        a   great value,       it   is

 little interruption until every Eff—Ff     very nearly zero,               is

              P,-   . . .
 which H differs much from H0 is for that reason very small.
 Also for each interval P is less than unity. Therefore if H' is
 much greater than H0, the continued product P1 . . .P,, is
 inappreciably small, and in<U+FB01>nitely smaller than it would be if
 H were throughout the interval t' nearly equal to H0. The
existence of our directing condition caused H to diminish,
 and its continued existence prevents H from again increasing
 beyond a small amount. The process, aided as we have
 assumed by Maxwell’s demons, is in a de<U+FB01>ned sense irre
 versible.
    22. Let us next assume that no external interference takes
 place; but the system, once started, is left undisturbed to its
 own mutual actions.           What, under these circumstances,
 becomes of the chance we considered in Art. 21?             It there
appeared as the continued product of           a  number of factors,
many of which were very small. It is now the single chance
 of the system having, when H=Ho, that particular set of
 coordinates and velocities of which the subsequent increase
 of H to H' is a necessary consequence.          Let 0, denote this
particular state.     Then U} is itself the necessary consequence
 of a certain initial state C. And therefore the chance that H
shall ascend from H0 at time t to H' at time t+t’ is the chance
that the initial state, formed as we have formed          shall he 0.        it,
 It may be that           very improbable initial state.
                                 U   is   a                    If that
can be proved, then the ascent of H from HO to H'             impro                is
bable in the same degree.          am not aware that
                                              I             ever has             it

O    isimprobable as an initial state, then we have           clearly              a
de<U+FB01>ned sense in which one subsequent state               more or less       is
probable than another, viz. as           the necessary consequence

                            is                            think with        I
less propriety,    one   state  may  be   called more  probable than
another. We may prove namely that,                 and P’ being two

Boltzmann asserts that the system, as H diminishes, passes
from      more to a less probable state.

call the normal state, then the direct and the reversed state are
equally probable. If, therefore, the last external disturbance

negative. The physical importance of this result seems to me
to consist in the fact that to any system in nature external
disturbances are always happening, and they come generally
at haphazard without regard to the state in which the system
<U+FB01>nds itself for the time being. And therefore the last dis
turbance generally        recent.  But a process of this kind

not an irreversible process.

our test system of elastic spheres the diminution of H                                                    is
irreversible in the same sense as loss of kinetic energy by
friction.
   Nevertheless, withont being irreversible, the process has                                              a
 certain physical signi<U+FB01>cance.      Let us draw the curve for
 which       the abscissa and H the ordinate.
              t   is                            When H      very                                    is

When H differs much from its minimum,                   the curvature                                     is
generally  considerable.           follows  that   It

time,  H  will have  nearly    its  minimum      value.  Deviations  will
occur, but   there      no   proof  isthat with   increasing time they
become less frequent or less important.            There     no ultimate           is
state into which the system subsides by an irreversible pro
cess; but there      a state in which on average of in<U+FB01>nite time
                                  is
   will be. And this we may call, as we have already called
it, it

no such tendency.    A priori and directly that problem would
not be easy to attack. Indirectly and a posteriori it can be
shown that this tendency does exist. It follows, namely, from
the fact that our molecules, if elastic spheres have <U+FB01>nite radius,
if centres of repulsive force have <U+FB01>nite sphere of action, that
a  certain stream motion (de<U+FB01>ned post) must exist beyond the
accidental stream which in Maxwell’s distribution would exist
if the molecules were mere material points.
   And this tendency becomes inappreciable only when the
density becomes inappreciable.      Further this property holds
for an in<U+FB01>nite system, that is if our space S (Art.
                                                    8) is in<U+FB01>nite,
but the density, or aggregate volume of all molecules in unit
of volume, is <U+FB01>nite.                                    —

occur. This system will be in stationary motion,      Maxwell’s                 if
law of distribution prevails. Other laws may be possible, but                                    I
assume Maxwell’s to exist.    On this assumption we calculate
the values of      072, §2.      E3,
                            Case (2) the spheres have <U+FB01>nite
diameter. It can be proved, as      have shown in Chapter V. I

    Here every b is negative, and is a function                     of  r the distance

    of    .z',   z.             circumstances a sphere of <U+FB01>nite
                            Under     these
    diameter having velocity from left to right is more likely to
    experience a collision on its lower side, where   is less, than       f

    A sphere moving from right to left is on average de<U+FB02>ected

    our molecules instead of being elastic spheres were centres of
    repulsive force of <U+FB01>nite radius of action, the sphere moving
    to the right would experience on average a greater pressure
    on its under side.   A sphere moving to the left a greater

          MICHEL PETROVITCH,               Professor of Mathematics
      0    at  Belgrade, has described in a recent number of
the American Journal of Mathematics (vol. xxii. No. 1) an
interesting instrument for integrating differential equations
of the form Xdz+Ydy=O.
   Two curved templates, B, C (see <U+FB01>g. 1), made from thick
plank are plunged into a rectangular tank of water. To B is
attached a pointer Q, and to C a pointer R.             A pencil P is
                                 Fig. 1.
attached   by a vertical rod to an index A, which is placed at
the surface of the water.       AP, BQ, CR can be moved verti
cally  but   not  horizontally.     The lengths AP, BQ, CR are
drawn for convenience of the       same   length, I, though this is not
essential.    A board is moved horizontally behind PQR, and
the templates B, G are moved in and out of the water by
keeping Q, R upon curves previously drawn on the board.

The index A is continuously adjusted so as to be always at

board. The ordinates of P, Q, R measured from a horizontal

               XLVI.         The Reversibility of Voltuic Cells.
                         -
                              By T. SIDNEY Mooaa".
T HE     experiments described in this paper were carried out
      in order to test the reversibility of certain voltaic cells.
Five cells have been treated :—Copper-zinc in sulphates,
copper-cadmium in sulphates, copper-pine in chlorides, and
copper-cadmium in chlorides, in addition to.the _(Jlark cell.
Preliminary experiments were carried out With nitrate cells,
but the surfaces of the electrodes were spoiled by the nitrate
solutions, and these cells have been ut aside.
   The diagram of the apparatus is s own in <U+FB01>g.                  1.
     ABCDEF    shows the ordinary potentiometer arrangement,
F   being       experimental cell and E the Clark standard.
                the
G is an adjustable resistance, and by means of its three-wa
key H either the cell F may be placed in closed circuit with
G, or the accumulators may be opposed to the experimental
cell through the resistance G.                   ,   ;
   By means of this arrangement it is easy to get two deter
minations of the internal resistance of the cell F. Firstly, by
means of the direct'current when the cell F is in circuit with G,
and, secondly, by means of the reading of the potentiometer
when a current is running through F and in opposition to it.
But to calculate the internal resistance from the latter expe
riment it is necessary to assume that the experimental cell is
reversible.   Thus, if we assume that the cell is reversible, the

which had side-tubes blown in them.        These side—tubes were
 connected by a short piece of indiarubber tube, to which was
 attached a screw-clip.      It was found that, unless wads of
cotton-wool were placed in the connecting-tubes, it was neces
sary to have solutions whose densities only differed in the
 fourth place.   With the wads there is practically no diffusion,
and the internal resistance is not unduly high.     The solutions
 were   made   up approximately    to the  formula   R . IOQHQO,~

               During the experiments, so long as di<U+FB02>'usion was prevented,
            the         of the cells remained constant. Even under the
            most    unfavourable circumstances, viz. when the reverse
            current through 4000 ohms was running through the cell,
            the E.M.F. only altered about two millivolts.          The con
            clusion to be drawn from the preceding results is that the
            cells treated, and consequently all similarly constituted cells,
           "are reversible; for the differences in the values ofthe E.M.F.’s
            when calculated and when observed are not greater than
            might be expected as errors of experiment.
                 (5)         A few experiments were                                  also    carried         out       with           the

            With R=1000 ohms, it was found that the current was
       much too large, as the E.M.F. of the cell decreased very
       rapidly when running the current. But the reverse current
       gave a fairly good result, as might be expected.                                 For the
       direct current would cause the solution of HgQSO4 to become
       weaker, and the solid present would not immediately saturate
       the solution.          But the reverse current would cause HgQSO4
     Vto‘be formed in the solution, which would therefore deposit
       some solid, but would at the same time remain saturated.
       Thus, all the results from the reverse experiments are better
      than the corresponding direct results; but considering the
       nature of the cell, these latter are fairly good.
           Thus we may say that the Clark cell, besides the others
      treated here and these similar to them, is reversible.
           These experiments were carried out at the suggestion and
      under the direction of Dr. Lehfeldt, of the East London
      Technical College, to whom                  I   gladly acknowledge my debt.

    interpenetrating crystals may      be very variable, but in some cases
    the grouping of the crystals is found to obey a de<U+FB01>nite law.          It

   THE title of this book precisely describes its scope.           It is an
  account of the author’s important and careful researches on electro
   magnetic waves ; many of the results contained in it have already
  appeared elsewhere, but all interested in the subject will be glad
 'to have so complete and systematic an account of the author’s work
  in book-form.
       Perhaps the most striking feature of the book is the rigid,
  almost austere, exclusion of everything in the shape of mathematics.
  All controversial theoretical matter is carefully avoided, and
  the author abst-ains from the use of mathematical symbols in a way
  which cannot but be impressive to those who, to use the phrase of a
  well—known physicist, are accustomed to regard electrical pheno—
  mena through a cloud of analytical symbols.
      The cautious accuracy of the author’s exposition reminds one of
  the style of Faraday’s Experimental Researches.         The book is one
 which may be read with interest and pro<U+FB01>t by the beginner in the
 subject, and it will prove of still deeper interest to the advanced
student.                                                                  I
.     In' the <U+FB01>rst chapter, the author gives a detailed description of
 the vibrators and resonators used by him, and the methods of
 concentrating the Hertzian <U+FB01>eld between two wires or sheets of
 metal.      Chapter 11. deals with the methods of measurement.
Chapter      III.  contains an experimental analysis of the <U+FB01>eld, the
properties     of the  <U+FB01>eld comernti‘ated    by a couple of Wires being
deduced      from those of a <U+FB01>eld concentrated by a single wire.
Chapter IV. deals with the action of the resonator.          In Chapter V.
we have a most instructive account of the etfects produced by using
oil and water as dielectrics. Chapter VI. is a useful résumé of the
principal experimental results established by the author; and
Chapter VIL, which concludes the book, is devoted to a peculiar
system of non-wireless Hertzian wave multiplex telegrapliy devised
by the author.

THE following extracts from the preface will              serve instead of
an analysis.       “ Careful     consideration has been given both to
the early dif<U+FB01>culties and to the possible future needs of the
 beginner.     An endeavour has been made to introduce the several
 topics in such a way that the pupil may have, from the very start,
an intelligent idea of each step in advance, as well as of the
 ultimate purpose of the study.”             These statements have been
 veri<U+FB01>ed and are true.          The Author is evidently an excellent
 teacher of his subject.         The text, <U+FB01>gures, and typical examples
 (worked out)     are  all good.    It is an elementary work which gives
 a clear account of Logarithms and provides a correct introduction
 to more advanced text-books.          There is an Appendix which gives

  THIS work is       a translation of the eighth chapter of the <U+FB01>rst
  volume of Graham-Otto’s          Lehrbuch der Chemie.     Considering the
  importance of optical tests in the examination of many organic
  compounds, it may be safely asserted that a book devoted to this
  subject <U+FB01>lls a decided gap in chemical literature.            Within the
  compass of some 150 small pages, Dr. Landolt gives a very com
  plete account of the present state of our knowledge on this subject.
  The book is divided into three parts. Part 1. deals with the general
  principles of optical activity.        Part 11. is concerned nith the
   connexion between the rotatory power and the chemical composition
   of carbon compounds, and contains a wry clear and interesting
   historical account of this matter.       Part III. is devoted to the con
   nexion between the degree of rotation and chemical constitution.
   In this concluding portion of the book the imperfect and frag
   mentary nature of our present knowledge regarding this subject
   is fully exhibited ; a vast amount of experimental work still remains
   to be done before any satisfactory general explanations ran be
   arrived at.—-The translation has been admirably executed by Dr.
   McCrae.

  —The Geology of Mount Kenya.’           By J. W. Gregory, D.Sc., F.G.S.
     The three main zones of Kenya are characterized by different
  geological features.     The long slope of the forest-belt consists in
  the main of volcanic ash, though the remains of secondary parasitic
  craters occur in it.        The Alpine zone consists of coarser ash,
  agglomerates, and tutfs, interbedded with lava-<U+FB02>ows and traversed
  by numerous dykes, with the remains of some secondary centres
 of eruption.     The third zone, or central peak, consists of the plug
 which choked the central vent, of beds of agglomerate, and the thick
 proximal ends of the great lava-<U+FB02>ows.
     The rocks of the central core comprise an olivine-anorthoclase
  nephcline-syenite with aagyrine, and a black glassy lava with
 numerous white phenocrysts of anorthoclase; this rock is allied in
 some respects to the pantellerites, but receives a special name both
 here and in its occurrence in lava-<U+FB02>ows.
     The dyke-rocks fall into two categories—a series of phonolites,
 and one of basalts and dolerites.         One, at least, of the dykes is
 compound, including both these rock-types.         The basic group ranges
 from basalts with little olivine to coarsely
                                          I        crystalline dolerite rich
 in that mineral.
     The lavas belong to three main groups:—(1) Those of the
 nepheline-syenito series, (2) the phonolites, and (3) the basalts.
 The oldest lavas appear to be the phonolites, but they and the
 <U+FB01>rst group of lavas seem to have overlapped in age; the olivine
 ba-salts, which reach the surface from’a zone of secondary craters
 in the Alpine zone, are the latest in date.           The <U+FB01>rst group of
 lavas are rhyolitic in aspect, and consist of a brown or green
glass in which are embedded phenocrysts of anorthoclase, and
 green needles which show the optical characters of aegyrine.             As
 these rocks do not conform to Rosenbusch’s de<U+FB01>nition of pantel
 lerites, a new name is proposed for them; the author considers
 that the pantellerites may be liparitic equivalents of the dacites,
 while these Kenya rocks correspond with the nephcline-syenites.

 500                           Geological Societ       :~—
 The structure of the phonolites is trachytic, the grouudmass in
 cluding abundant small, lath-shaped plagioclases ; nepheline is not
 very abundant, and occurs in larger crystals than the other con—
 stituents, the chief of which is segyrine.               The basalts are often
 vesicular and columnar, and contain olivine, angite, magnetite, and
 apatite often in a glassy groundmass.
      The pyroclastic rocks vary in texture from coarse to <U+FB01>ne; they
  contain blocks of all types of the lavas, and also large crystals      _
                                                                                 of
  anorthoelase.
      The nepheline-syenite is the most deeply-seated, holocrystalline
  rock found on Kenya; and the mountain appears to represent a
  single, ancient, dissected, volcanic mass, with a shorter geological
  history and a narrower range of rock-types than its great companion
'volcano, Kilima Njaro. The author gives reasons for considering
  that all the different rock-types present may have resulted by
  differentiation     from the olivine—anorthoclase-nepheline-syenite
  magma, although this involves the conclusion that in some cases
  the basic materials must have concentrated in the glass and solidi<U+FB01>ed
  after the formation of the felspars.

  —The Elaeolite-Syenitc and Fourchites intrusive in the Coast Series.’
  By J. W. Gregory, D.Sc., F.G.S.
      The rocks described in this paper were given to the author by
  Mr.    C. W. Hobley        Mount Zombo, situated in long. 39° 13' E. and
  lat. 4° 26' 8., and 1519 feet high, is a massif of coarse-grained
  elmolite-syenite, consisting of anorthoclase, elaeolite, usually allo
  triomorphic, and :egyrine.             The rock must occur in the belt of
  Duruma Sandstone, unless the fossiliferous Jurassic shales run
  westward up the low valley of the Umba River. Associated with
  this massif is a series of dykes belonging to the olivine-less variety
  of monchiquites known as fourchites.                 Their phenoerysts consist
 of plagioclase, probably oligoclase, hornblende, and mgyrine, but
  augite and ilmenite are also present; the groundmass contains a
  certain amount of analcite.
      Unfortunately there is some doubt as to the exact age of the
  Duruma Sandstone into which the fourchites are intrusive.                    The
  author gives an account of the different- opinions as to the age of
  these rocks; the evidence at present available is only suf<U+FB01>cient to
  prove that they are post-Carboniferous               and pre-Callovian.      The
  sedimentary series on the coast-lands of British East Africa and
  Usambara, in his opinion, may be provisionally                     arranged as
 follows:—
     5. Pleistocene reefs, limestones, alluvium, and laterites.
     4. Jurassic shales and sandstones;     Kimeridgian, Oxf'ordian, and Callovian.
     3. Possibly a pre-Jurassic part of the Duruma Sandstone.
     2. Magarini sandstones;     ?Triassic.
     l. Sabaki shales ; Upper Carboniferous
      It is, therefore, probable that the igneous rocks are not older
   hen the early Mesozoic, and may be Jurassic or post-Jurassic.

            Bala   Lake   and  the River-System      of North Wales.’       By
Philip Lake, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
     In this paper the author begins by showing that topographically
Bala Lake belongs to the same valley as the River Wnion—the
valley of the Bala Fault ; and he believes that the whole drainage
of the valley originally <U+FB02>owed south-westward, and entered the sea
near Barmouth.
     He then examines the possible outlets, and shows that the lake
is probably rock-bound in all directions except towards the south
west, where there is no conclusive evidence.
     He describes the faults which occur near the watershed that
separates        the Wnion from the streams <U+FB02>owing into Bala Lake,
pointing out that they are closely related to the form of the valley,
and that the watershed coincides with a transverse line of fault.
 From this he infers that the formation of the lake is possibly due
 to earth-movements.
      The watersheds of several other similar valleys are examined,
 and are shown to lie in one straight line; whence it is concluded
 that they must have been produced by some general cause, probably
 a slight differential movement.
      The general drainage-system of North Wales is next discussed.
 Attention is drawn to the existence of a series of long and nearly
 parallel valleys running from north-east to south-west, which divide
 the region more or less completely into a number of strips.              The
 drainage of each strip is now independent, and <U+FB02>ows in most cases
 into the long valley lying south of it. But from the fact that the
 chief streams in each strip have their representatives (<U+FB02>owing in the
  same line) in the adjacent strips, it is concluded that before the
  formation of the long valleys the streams were continuous.
      The centre from which these streams radiate lies in the high
  ground near the sources of the Conway; and the author believes
  that this was the centre of an original radial system of drainage,
  and that this radial system was subsequently broken up into
  sections, by the formation of the long valleys which now run from
  north-east to south-west—each of these long valleys carrying away
  the drainage of one of the sections. He attributes the formation
  of the long valleys to faulting.

              The Banter Pebble-Beds of the Midlands and the Source of
   their Matcrials.’       By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.,
   F.G.S.
       The author states the results of occasional Work in the Buntcr

502                          Geological Society.
Conglomerate of Sta<U+FB01>'ordshire.          After a sketch of matter already
published, he gives additional particulars of the lithology of the
pebbles, more especially of the felstones and of some rather compact
dark rocks.        Of the former he has now obtained about thirty
varieties:     orthoclase-fclsites and porphyrites, some with, others
 without quartz; several contain tourmaline, which sometimes
 has replaced biotite, sometimes         felspar.    One pebble exhibiting
 reddish sphcrulites in a dark matrix, once doubtless glassy, but
 now devitri<U+FB01>ed, is not like any British rock known to the author.
 Of the dark pebbles, some are <U+FB01>ne-grained quartzites blackened
with opacite; others, varieties of ‘schorl-rock,’ and two (which
 Dr. G. J. Hinde has kindly examined) are radiolarian cherts, which,
however, cannot be more precisely identi<U+FB01>ed.
   The mode of transport and source of the pebbles are next con
sidered. The reasons, already published, for a <U+FB02>uviatile, as Opposed
 to a marine, origin are brie<U+FB02>y summarized.              If the former be
accepted,    certain  conditions    must  be  satis<U+FB01>ed, which  bear directly
on the position of the source.        These beds represent the destruction
of large masses of rock.          If brought by rivers, these must have
been important       and   powerful, of a continental rather than an
insular type.        Hence the necessary physical conditions exclude
limited districts near the Midlands, such as the Wrekin, Lickey,
Hartshill, and Charnwood, even if they included (which is not the
case) the right types of rock.          As regards the Longmynds, their
argillites, if they occur, are not common; their conglomerates do
                                                                            ’
not exactly resemble the Bunter pebble-beds; their ‘ Torridonian
is a. quartz-rhyolite rather than a quartz-felspar grit.         The rocks
required cannot be supplied from either Wales, the Lake District,
or the Pennine Range, and we have no reason to suppose them con
cealed under Eastern and South-eastern England.             We have there
fore to choose between a southern and a northern source.          Cornwall
and Devon might perhaps furnish the schorl-rocks ; possibly also one
or two varieties of felstone (though this is doubtful) and the right
quartzites and quartz-felspar grits occur in the Budleigh Salterton
pebble-bed.      But the characteristic flat ellipsoidal pebbles of grit,
dominant here, are not found in the Midlands.           Physical conditions
also seem opposed to a northward <U+FB02>ow of the rivers of Britain in the
earlier part of the Trias.       In Scotland, however, we <U+FB01>nd the right
varieties of quartzite, the Torridonian grit, and many felstones, some
apparently identical with, others closely related to, those in the Mid
lands. The rarity of tourmaline-rocks in that region is the only
dif<U+FB01>culty in looking to it or its vicinity for the main source of these
pebbles.

of the nature described on p. 392, but chie<U+FB02>y to the fact that,

ON AN        INTERFERENCE METHOD           OF MEASURING THE DIAMETERS

         OF DISTANT    PLANETS     AND   STARS.    BY M. MAURICE HAMY.
       In 1868, Fizeau pointed out that the observation of interference
    fringes might possibly furnish         method of <U+FB01>nding an upper limit
                                                    a
    to the apparent diameters of stars.
        If screen with two parallel slits
         a                                             placed in front of the
                                                               is
    object-glass   ota   telescope,  and  the latter     then       is
                                                               directed
                                                                          towards
a      celestial object,  a system of interference-fringes          as is known,  is,
    obtained in the focal plane. The fringes do not appear unless the
    apparent angle of the source situated in front of the apertures                            _is
    suf<U+FB01>ciently small.      In fact, each point of the source produces _1ts
    own system     of fringes, and in order to avoid complete confusion
    of the fringes,  it   is necessary that the apparent angle              of the         6
    source, viewed    from   the <U+FB01>rst nodal  point of  the  object-glass,   should
    be less than the apparent angle of              fringe, viewed from the
                                                             a
    posterior nodal point.
        This forms the basis for establishing an approximate relation
    between the diameter        6and the distance apart of the slits which
    causes the fringes to vanish.

    . The method has been experimentally             tested by Stephan (1873),
   who made use of the large telescope of the Marseille Observatory.
   On placing in front of the object-glass a lunular screen, which
   allowed the light to pass through the two opposite borders, he
   was enabled to infer the existence of an apparent diameter of
   0"'2.   In fact, the stars of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd magnitudes
   observed have an apparent diameter inferior to this limit.
      Since then, M. Michelson (about 1892) has made acareful study
   of the theory of these experiments, and has verified all its conse
   quences, by <U+FB01>rst using terrestrial sources of various dimensions.
  Further, using a 12-inch equatorial, he has measured the diameters
   of Jupiter’s satellites.
  _' M. Maurice Hamy has taken up the study of this subject, with
  a view to substituting large slits, which allow a great deal of light
  to pass through, for the very narrow apertures employed in the
   previous researches.       He has arrived at a formula which solves the
   problem.    Experiments have been carried out with the large equa—
  torial of the Paris Observatory.           The <U+FB01>rst measurements were
  made under unfavourable atmospheric conditions (on June and
   July nights). Nevertheless, their results are very concordant.
  The diiferences from day to day are, in general, less than one—
  tenth of a second.         On rejecting the highest numbers, which
  correspond   to  an   increase  in the apparent diameter due to irregular
  atmospheric    refraction,   the  definite results for Jupiter’s satellites
  are respectively
               I.               II.              I                IV.

  The agreement between the two sets of values is remarkable.
     M. Maurice Hamy has applied the same method to the measure
  ment of the apparent diameter of the planet Vesta, and <U+FB01>nds for
 it 0"'54.

 of direct micrometric measurements made with the enormous

 nishes the same result with much greater ease.
     The author concludes by shoniug that, in spite of its great sen
 sitivencss, the interference method is powerless so far as the
 determination of the apparent diameters of stars is concerned. It,
 in fact, the sun were transported to a distance equal to that of the
 star aCentauri, its apparent diameter would fall below the one
 hundredth of a second; and in order to determine this, even with
 the interference method, the telescope would have to be more than
 12 metres in diameter!
     One may, it is true, imagine an interference apparatus which is
 applicable, theoretically, to the study of the diameters of stars and
_which does not require a telescope of extraordinary dimensions ; but
 the experimental dif<U+FB01>culties connected with it are so great that
they do not appear to be capable of being surmounted—secures               de

 L.     On. the   Variation of the Electric Intensity and C0n~
      ductivity along the Electric Discharge in Rare<U+FB01>ed Gases.
      By HAROLD A. \VILSON, B.A., B.Sc., Trinity College,
      Cambridge*.
                        1.  The Electric Intensity.
                     has given a number of curves showing very
 GRAHAMT  completely the variation of the electric intensity along
 several continuous discharges in rare<U+FB01>ed nitrogen.                In the
 following paper several similar curves are given obtained
 under somewhat di<U+FB01>'erent conditions, and with other gases as
 well as nitrogen.       The results of some measurements of the
 conductivity of the discharge, between small platinum elec
 trodes, along the whole length of the discharge are also
 g 1ven.
     Skinneri has shown that very near the anode the electric
intensity is very small or zero when the positive column is
 not striated.     He also mentions that with a striated positive
column the potential-difference between the anode and an
exploring—wire near it was a mininmm when the exploring
wire was at a short distance from the anode, so that the
apparent electric intensity near the anode was negative.
These results are entirely con<U+FB01>rmed by the observations
described below.

   The interest attaching to observations of this kind has been
considerabl increased since Prof.         J. J.
                                              Thomson * has shown
how from     thecurves for the electric intensity to determine
where the ionization and recombination principally take place,
so  that
       it   was thought worth while to make a series of obser
vations with the object of con<U+FB01>rming and extending Graham’s
results.
   The method employed was to measure the di<U+FB01>'erence of
potential between two exploring-wires, kept at <U+FB01>xed distance  a
apart in the discharge, which could be brought into any
desired portion of the discharge by moving the electrodes
between which the discharge took place.

ported vertically.      The electrodes E, E'
were thin disks of aluminium which <U+FB01>tted
the bore of the tube loosely, and were
made slightly convex towards each other.
The electrodes were connected together
by three parallel glass rods each millim.
                                    1
in diameter, which passed through holes
close to- their circumferences.         These
glass rods were fused to glass tubes to_
which the electrodes were <U+FB01>xed, as shown                                    m
in the diagrams. In this way the elec
trodes were kept at        aconstant distance
apart,   but  were    free  to slide up and
down   in the tube     A B.
   The tube carrying the lower electrode
E' was <U+FB02>oated in mercury in the tube
C,   to which      abarometer-column was
attached    by means of which the level
of the mercury in          0could be varied,
and so the electrcides E, E' raised and
lowered. The upper electrode            E was
connected by means of a spiral 'of <U+FB01>ne
brass wire to an electrode at A, and the lower electrode E'
was connected with the mercury in         Cby wire sealed through

the battery of 600 small secondary cells which was used to
produce the discharge.

    At W a tube 1 cm. in diameter and 5 cms. long was joined
 on at right angles to the discharge-tube and two platinum
 wires W, W' were sealed in at the end of it. These wires
 extended to the centre of the dischar    -tube, and were coated
 with glass except for 21nillims. att eir extremities, which
 were one above the other and 1'5 millim. apart.        The wires
are shown on a larger scale      in <U+FB01>g.   2.   The  di<U+FB02>'erence of
 potential between W and W' was measured with a well
 insulated quadrant electrometer.
    A telephone, galvanometer, and ad-              Fig 2_
justable resistance were included in the
discharge circuit, and during a series of
observations the current through the
tube was kept at a constant value.
    The tube T was sealed on to a Topler
pump, McLeod gauge, and an arrange-

ment for introducing any gas into the
apparatus, &c.
    It was found that when a discharge
was passing the wires W, W' took
up their <U+FB01>nal potentials immediately, and that the electro
meter-reading was not appreciably affected even by con
necting either or both of them to earth through a very
high resistance such as a piece of damp thread, which of
course immediately discharged them when no discharge was
passing. The insulation between the wires W, W' was very
good, and they were able either separately or together to
hold a static charge for a long time.
    A millimetre-scale backed by a mirror was attached to the
discharge-tube, and the position of the electrodes E, E' with
reference to the wires W, W' read off on it.
    The method of obtaining a series of observations was as
follows :—The tube was <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled with the gas at the required
pressure and the discharge started, if necessary, by means of
an induction-coil.     The current was then adjusted to the
required value and its steadiness tested with the telephone.
When a steady current of the required value had been ob
tnined in a suf<U+FB01>ciently pure gas at the required pressure the
potential-difference between the wires W, W" was observed
with the electrodes E, E' in a series of positions from that
with the electrode E in contact with the wire W to that with
the electrode E' in contact with the wire W'.        The current
was kept constant during the series of  observations,  and unless
the gas pressure remained practically unchanged whilst the
series was being taken the observations were rejected.
   It was found very dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain entirely satisfactory

series of observations, partly owing to changes in the gas
pressure which occur sometimes when the discharge is passed
for any length of time, and partly owing to the dif<U+FB01>culty of
obtaining a sensibly steady discharge except within certain
limits of current value.
                                                                        '
   Another source of trouble is the spluttering of the negative
electrode which occurs even with aluminium electrodes, and
forms a conducting coating on the walls of the discharge-tube
which may cause the character of the discharge to change as
the electrodes are moved into a different portion of the tube.
The only remedy for this is. to open the tube and remove the
deposit as soon as it begins to have an appreciable effect. The
                                                                        ‘
backs of the electrodes were covered with disks of mica to
prevent spluttering there.
   The gases tried were air, nitrogen, and hydrogen.' All
were dried with P205, and the nitrogen was prepared from
NaNO2 and NH4Cl, and passed through FeSO4 solution and
H2804.        The hydrogen was prepared by electrolysis of dilute
HgSQt and passed through KMnO4 solution.                   Oxygen which
was used in some later experiments was prepared by heating
pure KMnO4.           The light from the discharge was in each case
examined with a pocket-spectroscope, and when no impurity
could be detected in this way the gas in the tube was con
sidered sufficiently pure.

 At pressures above 1 millim. the fall in the intensity near the
 positive electrode occurs so near to the positive electrode that
 it is difficult to observe; but 1 do not think there is any reason
 to doubt that it still exists.
                             ”
    The “ positive drop at the surface of the positive electrode
 measured by Skinner (lac. cit.) was always noticed in these
 experiments when one of the exploring-wires                                        came into
 contact with the positive electrode. It appears, as Skinner
 showed, to occur excessively close to the surface of the elec
 trode, near which the intensity is zero or even apparently
 nevative.
    i‘bat the electric intensity near the positive electrode can
 be really negative seems unlikely, and it is consequently
probable that the exploring-wires, when near the positive
electrode, either fail to take up the potential of the surrounding
 gas, or else that the wires so disturb the discharge that their
presence converts the very small                                             intensity into a
negative intensity        at  the         place           w   positive
                                                                 ere     the   wires are.  To
obtain information on this point some experiments were tried
in which the exploring-wires in the apparatus were replaced
by <U+FB01>ne platinum tubes from which a stream of mercury
could be allowed to <U+FB02>ow, breaking up into <U+FB01>ne drops
travelling two or three millimetres horizontally.                                      It was
thought that the jet of mercury would act as a “mercury
dropper,” and so take up the real potential of the surrounding
gas.     The platinum tubing used was 0'5 millim. external

510         Mr. H. A. Wilson    on the Variation oft/1e
diameter and 0'25 millim. bore, and was covered with a very
thin coating of glass.
    The apparatus is shown in <U+FB01>g. 4. The two tubes W, W’
were sealed to glass tubes provided with taps which commu—

 The two tubes were connected to the
 electrometer.
    With this arrangement it was found
 that the electric intensity indicated was
 not affected by running the mercury
 provided the stream of mercury was
 strong enough to go for a short distance
 horizontally before breaking into drops.
 Of course if big drops of mercury formed on the ends of the
jets, these caused an alteration of the electrometer-reading _:
 but otherwise running the mercury had no effect either in the
positive column or very near to the positive electrode, where
 the intensity was found as before to be very small, or even
negative.
    The ap arently negative intensity near the positive electrode
 was found to be m0st marked at low pressures and with small
 currents.   Increasing either the currentor the pressure dimi
 nished the length of the region of apparently negative
 intensity.
    Since it is probable that the mercury-jets really took up
 the actual potential in the gas, we must conclude either that
 the presence of the wires or jets disturbs the discharge to
 such an extent as to reverse the sign of the intensity near the
 positive electrode, or that the intensity there is really negative.
 Such a region of negative intensity in the gas indicates the
 existence of a source of            acting in the gas throughout
 the region in question. Such a source of E.M.F. may be
 imagined to be provided by positive ions shot off from the
 positive electrode by the excessively sudden potential-fall
 which occurs at its surface. Since the rise of potential in
 the region of negative intensity is usually only 1 or 2 volts, it
 is conceivable that the positive drop of 25 volts may project
 the positive ions from the positive electrode with enough
 energy to carry them against a negative intensity for a short
 distance, or they may be supposed to get across the region by
                                                                    '

electrode are very similar to those which occur between the
positive column and the negative electrode, although crowded

  Electric Intensity and Conductivity in Rare/fed Gases.                         513
    The form of the potential-fall curve in the electric discharge
through a bunsen-<U+FB02>ame             asis,  have shown
                                          I              very similar to

that of the potential-fall curve in the discharge in rare<U+FB01>ed
gases, and in the <U+FB02>ame nearly all the ionization appears to
occur on the metallic electrodes when these are red hot. It
seems to be the case in every kind of gaseous discharge that
the ionization occurs most easily at the surface of a metal. In
the ordinary discharge at low pressures                seems also very
                                                                it
probable that all the ionization due simply to the electric
intensity which may be called the primary ionization, occurs
at the surfaces of the electrodes, for                 only close to the

                                            is
 to produce ionization directly.          The curves for the intensity
 given   above   do   not  show   the   sudden   drops of potential and
 corresponding enormous intensities which occur at both elec
 trodes, only the beginning of the rise of intensity near the
 negative electrode       is shown. The negative ions formed at
 the surface of the cathode constitute the cathode rays, and
 produce the ionization which the intensity-curves show occurs
 in the negative glow.
     The effect of this secondary ionization in the negative glow
is   to diminish the intensity there to          very small value. As
                                                        a
 the negative ions get separated from the positive ions they
 cause the intensity gradually to rise.         This gradual rise in the
 intensity goes    on   until   it  suddenly stopped by the appear
                                      is
  ance  of the  positive   column.      In the positive column more
  secondary ionization occurs. In the case of a uniform positive
  column the ionization at every point must                 equal to the
                                                                      be

  positive  column,    like that  in  the ne ative glow,       due to the  is
  impacts of negative ions moving wit great velocity, then                        it
  follows that the break in the gradual rise in the intensity
  which occurs at the end of the positive column              due to the   is
  intensity having become great enough to give the negative
  ionsa   velocity suf<U+FB01>cient to enable them to produce as much
  ionization in the gas as the recombination which              going on.   is
  In the positive column the intensity,'according to Hittorf,                         is
  independent of the current-strength, which shows that the
  amount of ionization going on there               proportional to the

   The conductivity falls between the striae apparently instead
of rising,     as the intensity-curves lead one to expect.               It is
very probable       that  the  radiation   which   the   discharge      emits
may produce ionization on the small platinum electrodes,
which would increase the apparent conductivity of those
parts of the discharge which emit radiation.              Thus the nega—
tive glow and the luminous parts of the positive column
conduct better than the dark parts of the discharge.
   The fall in the conductivity near the positive electrode pro
bably corresponds to the increase in the intensity which
usually occurs there before the drop to zero close to the
electrode.
   In conclusion,      I wish  to say that my best       thanks are due
to  Prof. J. J. Thomson for valuable suggestions and advice
during the carrying out of these experiments at the Cavendish
Laboratory.

L1. On the Distillation of Liquid Air, and           the   Composition
  of the Gaseous and Liquid Phasea—PART              I.    At Constant
  Pressure.   By E. C. U. BALY *.
         experiments described in this paper were commenced
THE    with a view of obtaining the relation between the tem
perature and the composition of the gas evolved from liquid
air boiling under atmospheric pressure, so as to render
possible the determination of the temperature of boiling air
by the analysis of the gas evolved. They were, however,
extended beyond this, and analyses were made of both the
liquid and gaseous phases for all mixtures of oxygen and
nitrogen, thus completing the investigation of the distillation
of liquid air under constant (atmospheric) pressure.
   The measurements of temperature were all made by means
of a Callendar compensated hydrogen-thermometer.           This
instrument, which- is a constant-pressure apparatus, differed
from Callendar’s description’r in that the measurement of
volume-change was read by admission of mercury into a
graduated burette, instead of being weighed.     The tempera—
ture as shown- by Callendar may be calculated from the
e q uation
     ‘       T—
              —    V0T2~ '
                  V1_V2,’
where V0 is the volume of the thermometer-bulb ;
        V1 the total volume of the thermometer-bulb and the
             graduated burette ;
        V2 the volume of gas measured in the burette during
             the experiment; and
        T2 the absolute (hydrogen) temperature of V2.
   In the thermometer used throughout the experiments, the
volume V0 (at 15°) was 28'655 c. c. and the total volume V1
was 129'590 c. c. The adjustment in order to make both sides
of the apparatus, e. the compensating side and the thermo
                     2'.
meter side, quite equal in volume, was very carefully per
formed by means of the burette and then connexion was
opened between the two sections so as to ensure there being
an equalmass of gas on each side.    The <U+FB01>lling with hydrogen
was very carefully carried out.    The whole apparatus was
thoroughly exhausted, and pure hydrogen was admitted
to approximately      60 mm. pressure.
                       7                  The hydrogen was
prepared from the palladium alloy, the <U+FB01>rst fractions which
came off the palladium being rejected, and was dried over
phosphorus pentoxide. Every care was taken in the <U+FB01>lling,

 and the thermometer was several times         re<U+FB01>lled during the
  work.
     The correction for the contraction of the glass bulb was
 also determined, and an attempt was made to mea
  sure the coe<U+FB01>icient of expansion of glass between Fig-1
 the limits -—190° C. and 20° 0., the usual limits of
 the experiments.    The apparatus was a very simple          i
 one, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1, and depended on the con—               8
 traction of a glass tube of known length.       A tube
 A was taken, which just slipped through the con
 tracted neck of the tube B.          Both tubes were       A
 sealed at their lower ends, and A rested on the
 bottom of B by a <U+FB01>ne glass point, to minimise heat
 conduction as far as possible.   The whole apparatus
 was dipped into liquid air, while water was kept
 running through the inner tube A, thereby cooling
 B while A was kept warm. The contraction suf
 fered by B was measured by observing with a
 micrometer the distance between two lines, etched
one on A and the other on B, before and during
the cooling.    The apparatus worked very well, and
a satisfactory measurement was obtained in which
the total length of B cooled was 890 cm'.     The mean
linear coef<U+FB01>cient found was '0000073, Regnault’s
 measurement between 0° and 10° being '0000085.
    The measurements      of temperature were corrected in
accordance with the above found coef<U+FB01>cient, the volume of
the thermometer-bulb being taken as 28'655 (l—'0000219 t).
    For the temperatures dealt with in these experiments the
correction was about 0°‘37.
    The probable accuracy of the results with the thermometer
may be judged from the volume of the thermometer-bulb,
28'655 c.c., which caused the probable error to be very
small. The reading of the volume of the gas in the burette
was certainly accurate to '02 c. c., which means a maximum
error of about 0°‘02.    In practice, however, the results agree
better than this; for two determinations of the boiling-point
of oxygen, and two of the boiling-point of nitrogen, di<U+FB02>'er
respectively by only 0°'Ol, the measurements being made
several days apart.     The volumes of the various portions
of the thermometer were most accurately determined, and
there seems every reason to trust the measurements made
with it. As regards the practical use of the instrument, too
much cannot be said in praise of it. It is extremely quick
to take up temperature-changes and very rapidly worked,
and generally a n10st convenient and simple apparatus to use.

                          In the experiments on the composition of the vapour, the
                       method of working was very simple. The thermometer-bulb
                       was immersed in the liquid air contained in a vacuum
                       jacketed vessel, the top of which was loosely stoppered with
                       cotton-wool.   Samples of the gas evolved were taken from
                       time to time as the air boiled away, by means of        tube       a
                       passing through the cotton-wool, and the thermometer
                       reading was noted at each time. The samples of gas were
                       afterwards analysed by means of burning phosphorus, and
                       the results plotted as percentages of oxygen, against the
                       corresponding absolute temperatures.      Several series were

      If   the above        points be plotted and the curve drawn, the
complete relation will be obtained, and the temperature of
boiling air can be read direct therefrom if the composition of
the gas evolved be found.
      In order to further investigate the subject, a similar series
of experiments was carried out in connexion with the com
position of the liquid phase and its relation to the temperature.
The samples were taken by means of a <U+FB01>nely drawn piece of
capillary tubing which dipped into the liquid.                                This was
connected with a <U+FB01>lter-pump which was kept running during
the experiments.               Samples of the gas were taken from a
T-piece        between       the   capillary and the <U+FB01>lter-pump.                      The
liquid       air  did    not   fractionate    in     the     capillary,      but    boiled

    The two curves A and B represent the complete fractional
distillation of any mixture of oxygen and nitrogen under
 760 mm. pressure.            For they show the boiling-point of every
 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen at 760 mm., and also the
temperature at which any mixture of oxygen and nitrogen
 will liquefy and the composition of the liquid formed. It is
evident that the lines of equal temperature cut the two curves
at points of corresponding equilibria; that is to say, the com
positions of liquid and vapour phases in equilibrium at each
temperature.          In connexion with these corresponding com
                                                                  *

in a distillation of a mixture of two liquids under constant
pressure, the following formula might express the relation
between them         :—

where r' is the ratio of components in the vapour phase, and                          r
the corresponding          ratio in the liquid phase, and                        ratio
                                                                         P—‘the

of the vapour-pressures of the two components.                         This formula,
however, assumes the validity of Baoult’s law for every
possible mixture.           In an actual experiment, however, Brown
found that it did not hold good, but that in the equation
r’za' x C, C was remarkably constant.

   Lehfeldt. in his paper on “The Properties of     Mixture                              a

<U+FB01>ve in number, and the means from the two thermometers
were as follows :—

   In order      to complete the vapour-pressure curve for the
above, the ratios of the temperatures giving equal vapour
pressures with water and oxygen were plotted against the
water temperatures according to Ramsay and Young’s equa
tion T.      The vapour-pressures of water were taken from
Regnault’s values as corrected by Broch.                   From the straight
line passing through the points, data were calculated for the
vapour-pressure curve.                This was drawn, and gave the
boiling-point at 760 mm. as 900'60 absolute.
   As regards Estreicher’s measurements, of which there are
44, they have been plotted directly, but it is dif<U+FB01>cult to draw
a  curve through them for they are very scattered at the
higher temperatures. The point he gives as the mean of
 25 observations, P=743'8 mm. T=90 '44, agrees very well
with Olszewski’s values, and so do two more points. If, then,
these points be taken as correct and the curve drawn, this
can only be done by neglecting entirely many points at
medium pressures.             The curve, then, is almost superposed on

 Olszewski’s.       On the other hand, if the points at intermediate
 pressures be given some value, a very fair curve can be drawn
 which very nearly gives the same boiling-point as found on
 the Callendar thermometer as above, viz. 90°‘96 abs., the
 actual point being 900'90.            Which curve to adopt as best
 expressing    his   results   I  do  not  know, for no data are given
 of the 25 observations whose mean is given as one point.
 The difference between the boiling-point             I  have given and
 that found by Olszewski is 0°‘36.
     Of the boiling-point of nitrogen, Olszewski‘ gives a
 measurement in his series of <U+FB01>ve vapour-pressures, which are
as follows :—
       Pressure.                                  Temperature (abs).

         60 mm.       (meltingpoint)                    59'0
    The straight line of Ramsay and Young’s ratios was drawn
 for these points. The last two by no means agree, and were
 therefore given equal weight.            The vapour-pressure curve
 was drawn, and the boiling-point of nitrogen was given as
 77°‘38. The difference, therefore, between the boiling-point
 I have given and that obtained by smoothing Olszewski’s
 numbers is 00'16.        Olszewski’s values for the boiling-points
for the two gases are thus both lower than the ones 1 have
found.
    In order to test Brown’s suggestion that the ratio of the
partial vapour-pressures of the two components in the liquid
directly determines the composition of the vapour, it was
necessary to make measurements              of the vapour-pressures of
oxygen     and   nitrogen    with   the temperatures referred to the
Oallendar thermometer.            Since  these vapour-pressures were
only required between the temperatures 77° and 91° absolute,
two points on each curve were suf<U+FB01>cient, and the complete
curve was drawn by the Ramsay and Young method. Of
these two points, the pressure of 7 60 mm. at the boiling-point
was one, and for the other it was necessary to determine the
vapour-pressure of each gas at the boiling-point of the other.
This was carried out <U+FB01>rst for nitrogen by immersing a small
bulb containing atmospheric nitrogen into pure liquid oxygen,
and then measuring the pressure under which it lique<U+FB01>ed.
   The mean of four readings was 10:2805'4 mm., T=9U°'9li.

52¢;                  Mr. E. c. o. Baly on   the
    This result very nearly lies on the curve of Olszewski’s
smoothed results.
    The two points p= 760 mm. T=77°'54 and p=2805 mm.
T=90°'96 were plotted by Ramsay and Young’s method, and
the vapour-pressure curve drawn.
    The vapour-pressures of chemical nitrogen were also deter
mined. These were carried out similarly to those of atmo
spheric nitrogen with some intermediate points taken in
liquid air.      The boiling-point was not actually measured
owing to the dif<U+FB01>culty of preparing a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of
liquid chemical nitrogen. The Ramsay and Young ratios
were calculated and extrapolated to 760 mm., and from the
straight line the vapour-pressures were obtained. The values
obtained from the complete curve are given in the second
column.       Olszewski’s values are continued up to 124°
absolute.
     The measurement of the vapour-pressure of oxygen was
carried out very similarly to that of nitrogen.            A large
quantity of liquid nitrogen was made, and a small bulb con
 nected with a store of pure oxygen from KMnO4 was sur
 rounded with it.      When the bulb was about a quarter full of
 liquid oxygen, it was connected with a gauge and the pressure
 read. Two series of measurements were made with one prepa
 ration of oxygen, and a third with fresh oxygen prepared with
 the greatest care.     All three agreed absolutely to a tenth of a
 millimetre.     Great pains were taken with these measurements
 on account of their disagreement with both Olszewski’s and
 Estreicher’s. The result obtained wasp= l71'7mm. T= 780'08.
Olszewski’s and Estreicher’s measurements were about 1 57mm.
 at the same temperature.        A very extraordinary faculty for
 being superheated     was  shown  by the liquid nitrogen in these
 experiments.      Although it was to all intents boiling, that is
 to say it was in actual ebullition, the temperature was OO'S
 above the true boiling-point.     By dropping in pieces of copper
 wire or glass the temperature at once fell to the normal
 boiling-point, but if left the nitrogen rapidly superheated
 itself, and the temperature rose to exactly the same point as
 at <U+FB01>rst.     It appears, therefore, that unless these lique<U+FB01>ed
 gases   are in a state of extremely rapid ebullition, they become
 superheated to a very considerable extent.      This may possibly
 be the explanation of Estreicher’s and Olszewski’s results for
 vapour-pressures of oxygen being so much lower than the one
 I  have obtained.     It is true that Estreicher and Olszewski
 agree very well in their values at low pressures, but this may
 be quite easily accounted for, because they used the same
 thermometer, and because in my results the superheating is

always exactly the same in the same apparatus, and a small
quantity of gas bubbled through the liquid, such as Estreicher
used, by no means lowers the temperature to‘ the true boiling
point. In order to do this, a rapid current must be passed
through, and this would naturally vitiate the vapour-pressure
measurements.         The values of the vapour-pressures are com
pared in the following table.             In the <U+FB01>rst column are given
                   Vapour-pressures of Oxygen.

    For the sake of generality we shall suppose that the number
 of free positive atoms in unit volume is ahthe number of free
 negative atoms 112, and the number of molecules N. These
 are averages and do not imply that the atoms which constitute
 the set 11, are the same at every instant, but that we have
 reached a state in which the number of molecules which dis
integrate is equal to the number formed by recombination.
We shall regard the molecule as consisting of a pair of atoms
in contact, each of mass m and radius a, and one carrying a
positive charge e, and the other a negative charge -—e.
    We consider <U+FB01>rst the case in which the gas as a whole is
at rest.
    Let x be the electrical potential and R the resultant force
at a point.

matter density coincide with the points of least electrical
density, then the above calculation would indicate that we
should have very well de<U+FB01>ned planes of maximum luminosity.
   The planes of minimum electrical and maximum matter

we should still have planes of maximum luminosity, they will
not be so well de<U+FB01>ned.

wave-length 7t. Arguments of (in my opinion I) considerable
weight have been brought forward by Boltzmann and W. Wien
leading to the conclusion that the function is of the form

LIV.   Some Observations in reply to the Paper of Prof. C. G.
   K nott “ 0n Swan’s Prism Photometer, etc.” By 0. LUMMER
  and    E. Bnonnuu *.
     NDEB.     the title “On Swan’s Prism-Photometer,          com
        monly called Lummer and Brodhun’s Photometer,”
 Prof. C. G. Knott calls attention, in the January number of
 this periodical, to the fact that Swan had already, in 1859,
“ invented, described,                           ”
                         constructed, and used     the photometer
afterwards “ re-invented ” by us. The description given by
 Swan of his photometer-cube at that time is also reprinted.
     May we be permitted to offer some observations correcting
certain points in the above-named paper which seem to us to
be misleading?

publication has been delayed untilnow, although Prof. Knott
                                        “ familiar to all
says the Swan photometer has been                         officially
connected with the Edinburgh University Physical Labor
atory for some years past.”
    Now, however, that Mr. Swan’s precedence in the <U+FB01>eld                is
brought to our attention after this long interval, we desire
to be among the <U+FB01>rst to acknowledge it.        But the statement
that the photometer which we introduced into the technical
world   isnothing more than       re-invention of SWan’s photo
                                    a
meter seems equally unfair to us.

 prism combinations were discussed. Among these is to be
'found the one which, as we now know, was invented by
 Swan forty-one years ago.        This form was in our opinion,
 however, imperfect, and unsuited to technical requirements
 for the following reasons :—-Apart from the fact that the
 balsam spot is not perfectly transparent, its edges do not
 afford that extreme sharpness which can be attained by
 ground surfaces, and they deteriorate by continually drying
 up. In consequence of this the balsam-spot cube, as well as
 some of the other prism-combinations perhaps superior to                 it,
 has never been recommended by us, and we doubt whether
 any considerable number have found their way into practical
 use in technical industry.    Should photometers with balsam
 cubes, nevertheless, be now in use, they should of course be
 called Swan’s photometers.      But let us not forget that only
with the most imperfect of all our described forms does the
 cube of Swan coincide, and the coincidence only extends
 to our
         “ Gleichheit’s ”
                          principle     *.

of the radiation from surfaces of various kinds in high
vacuum.
    When a body is maintained at a high temperature the total
 radiation from its surface depends, other things being the
 same, on the temperature and on the character of the radiating
 surface. With a given temperature the total radiation, con
sisting of thermal, luminous, and actinic rays, seems to depend
 on the nature and on the ultimate texture of the radiating
surface; and the proportion in which vibrations of longer and
shorter period are present seems to be governed by the                       '
coarseness or <U+FB01>neness of the structure of the surface at which
                                                                     -
the rays take their origin.
    Very little progress has yet been made towards an inves
tigation of the question just referred to; and the results of
our experiments are intended to be a contribution in this
direction.
     In a former paper * by one of us the loss of heat in vacuum
from the metallic surface of platinum wires was determined;
and Schleiermacher'l' has compared the loss from bright
platinum wires and from platinum wires whose surface was
coated thinly with black oxide of copper.                 Further experi
ments on this part of the subject seemed highly desirable, and
were therefore undertaken by us.
    The radiating body was a platinum wire.                   The way in
which it was mounted is shown in <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 21. The pla
tinum wire, a b, is held, stretched between two spiral springs,
in a glass tube.       The outer ends of the spiral springs termi
nate in loops; and two pieces of glass rod, which are passed
into tubes 0 c, c’ 0’ (see <U+FB01>gure), pass through the loops, so that
the springs pull on these glass rod's.               Alter the rods have
been passed into their places, the ends of the tubes 0 c, c' 1! are
closed up, except one, which is used for exhausting. Flexible
electrodes are soldered to the loops of the spiral springs, and
are siher-soldered to stout multiple platinum terminals; and
by means of these, which are fused, with the help of some
white enamel, into the glass at d, d, the current is passed
throu h the platinum wire.               At 0, e platinum wires are
broug t through the sides of the tube, and serve as potential
electrodes; and it is to keep the platinum wiro ab in the
middle of the length of the tube, and to avoid pulling undulv
on the potential electrodes, that the two spiral springs, one
at either end of the tube, are introduced.

        Two exactly similar tubes were employed, as shown in
    <U+FB01>g. 2.       They were connected together 'by a side tube_as
    shown;      and by means of a branch tube, attached to this s1de
    tube and connected to a. Sprengel pump, the air was withdrawp
    from both tubes at the same time. By this arrangement rt
    was provided that the vacuum in the two tubes should be at

         In  one of the tubes the platinum wire was brightly polished
     and perfectly smooth just as it came from the maker’s hands.
     The other tube contained a platinum wire cut from the same
     bank, but with the surface covered with an excessively
     fine coating of soot.         The soot was put on by passing the
     wire carefully through the upper part of a clear para<U+FB01>in
     flame“.
         The usual arrangements were made for drying the vacuum
     of the tube, and of the pump, by means of phosphorus pent
     oxide; and the vacuum was measured by means of the Gim

      soot, and surfaces prepared with platinum-black and with a <U+FB01>ne coating

  means of an electric current.          Fig. 2 shows the electric con
  nexions.       A battery consisting of a suf<U+FB01>cient number of
  secondary cells was employed ; and the current was controlled
  by means of- suitable resistances, including a rheostat.             In
  the experiments here described the platinum wires of the two
  tubes, the resistances, and the battery were all connected in
  series, so that the same current passed through all *.
      The current in the circuit was measured by means of a
   Kelvin ampere-gauge, and the difference of potentials at the
  two ends of each of the platinum wires was measured by
  means of a high-resistance reflecting-galvanometer.
      This potential galvanometer had a resistance of about
  5000 ohms, and it was possible to insert in the galvanometer
  circuit an additional resistance of 10,000 ohms.
      In order to ascertain the absolute value of the readings of
  the potential galvanometer, a standard coil of platinoid wire,
  whose resistance was known very accurately, was joined into
  the circuit, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.          This resistance was of con—
  siderable length, and it was kept cool by being immersed in a
  bath of oil.
      The following was the order of experimenting.                   The
  pressure    in  the  tubes  was <U+FB01>rst reduced   as much  as  possible by
' means of the Sprengel pump; then a very small current,
  practically unable to heat any part of the circuit, was sent
  through the two platinum wires and the standard coil, and the
  potential-difference between the two ends of each was deter
  mined. This gave the ratio of the resistance of each of the
  platinum wires to that of the standard coil, all being cold, and
  at the same temperature. The current from the battery of
~
  storage-cells was now suitably increased, and readings were
  taken in the following order :—The current passing was <U+FB01>rst
  read. 'lhen the zero of the potential galvanometer was noted,
  and the de<U+FB01>exion of the potential galvanometer when con
  nected to the two ends of the standard coil was observed.
  The electrodes of the potential galvanometer were next
  applied to one of the platinum wires, and the de<U+FB02>exion noted;
  then the de<U+FB01>exion due to the second wire was observed.                A
  second reading was taken from the <U+FB01>rst wire and also from the
     * In   another set of experiments the platinum wires were joined in
  parallel, and, by means of two rheostats, one connected in series with
  each platinum wire, an attempt was made to regulate the current in each
  wire so that the temperatures in the two should be the same.   This was
  found very dif<U+FB01>cult to carry out; but it is intended to renew the
  attem t, and determine simultaneously     the radiation from two wires
  with i<U+FB01>erent surfaces, in the same vacuum, and at the same temperature.

second wire.        Usually these pairs of readings were identical,
or nearly so, as no reading was taken until after the strong
current had been passing through the circuit for suf<U+FB01>cient
length of time to allow the temperature of the whole to become
perfectly steady.         Generally speaking, <U+FB01>ve minutes or more
was allowed for this purpose.            Lastly the current was again
read, and the zero of the potential galvanometer noted.
    The readings detailed above enabled us to calculate the
current passing through each wire and the resistance in that
wire.       The length and cross-section of each of the platinum
wires (practically identical) were also known. Thus the energy
lost by radiation per square centimetre per second, C’R/JS,
could be calculated ; 0 being the current, R the resistance
and S the surface of the raliating wire, and                 J   being the
dynamical equivalent of heat, all in absolute measure.
a The
           measurement of the electric resistance of the wires also
enabled us to calculate the temperatures of the wires by means
of the results of a separate determination of the electric
resistances, at different temperatures, of the wires themselves.
    In a former paper*, the precautions and dif<U+FB01>culties con
nected with the determination of change of resistances of
platinum wires with temperature have been fully discussed.
In the present case each platinum wire, after having been used
in the radiation experiment, was wrapped round the bulb of
an air thermometer-I- of special construction; the bulb and
wire were then packed in a;bestos wool, and placed in the
laminated copper heating-jacket described and <U+FB01>gured in the
paper just referred to. The jacket was heated by means of
one of Fletcher’s powerful “ solid flame
                                                    ”
                                                      burners, by means
of which it could be kept for any length of time almost
absolutely steady, at any temperature below the softening
point of glass.
    By means of stout copper electrodes the platinum wire was
made one of the branches of a. Wheatstone balance, and the
electric resistance and temperature were simultaneously
determined.        A considerable number of readings between
15° (3. and 350° C. were taken, and from these an empirical
formula was constructed, or a curve drawn to represent the
relation between temperature and pressure at all intermediate
points.

    In one respect, the determinations, an account of which is
given in the present paper, are not perfectly satisfactory.
The temperature of the circumambient air in all these experi
ments was from 16° to 18° Cent. ; but we have not been able
to take account in a proper way of the temperature of the
envelope enclosing the vacuous space in which the radiating
wires were placed. In order to be able to see the condition
of the wires, and in particular to observe their appearance
when they became luminous, glass envelopes were used in
these experiments ; and owing to the nature of the arrange
ments and the method of experimenting, it was not found
possible to immerse the glass envelopes in a cooling bath.
 Consequently the glass became more or less heated during the
experiments, and the heating was unequal in the cases of the
bright wire and the sooted wire. It has already been pointed
out‘ that the proportion in which the radiations of longer
period and shorter period are present in the total radiation
 depends on the radiating surface, other things being the same.
 In the case of the sooted wire, the quantity of long-period
 radiation    in proportion, far in excess of that proceedin
             is,
 from   abright metallic polished surface. Consequently, wit
the same total electric energy supplied to both wires, the glass
tube containing the sooted wire became much hotter than the
tube containing the bright wire.
    It has also been pointed out'l' that with a substance like
glass, conducting badly and somewhat diathermanous,                        it   is
impossible to tell how much heat       returned to the radiating
                                                     is
wire from the interior skin of the tube, which no doubt rises
to a high temperature during the experiment.        To a certain
extent, therefore, the results which we have obtained must be
considered as not affording results strictly comparable with
those formerly obtained in which       metallic envelope cooled
                                                     a
with water was used.
    The absolute value of the radiation observed ought to be
somewhat lower in amount than would have been found had
the enclosing envelope been of metal and properly kept cool,
and the disturbance from this cause must have been relatively
greater in the case of the dull, than in the case of the bright,
w1re.
  Experiments           were  made with platinum wires from three
separate hanks.         A  pair of wires of equal length was taken in
each case.  One         of these was left with its surface exactly as

      explanatory.       At the head of each table the particulars as to
      the wires referred to in the table are given.

       the ratio between the radiation from the sooted wire and the
       radiation from the bright wire         is calculated.     Itwill be seen
       that the numbers are       in  fair  agreement.      What may be the
       causes of divergence from exact agreement               it impossible to
       say at the present stage of the inquiry; but
                                                            it is may be con
      jectured that part of       it   at least    isdue to the dif<U+FB01>culty, or
       impossibility, of keeping the vacuum which surrounds the
__‘     wires in these experiments unchanged.             \Vhen the pressure      is
        very   low, the  accession   of  the smallest   quantity of gas to the
        surrounding space     causes  an  enormous    change in the rate ofloss
        of heat, as has been shown in a previous part of this research,
        and as the temperature rises   it   is always found that the vacuum
        becomes deteriorated, owing to the expulsion of gas from the
        body of the wire itself. This gas must be removed by a fresh

          In the case of the bright wire, Pt5, the loss of heat was
       somewhat abnormal.        It     probable that the surface was

    same temperature.     In the paper of 1894, already referred
    to, the radiation from a very brightly polished and burnished
    silvered copper globe. and that from the same globe sooted,
    were determined.      The highest temperature reached was
    about 230° C., and in that case the sooted globe lost about
    ten times as much heat as the silvered globe under the same
     circumstances. When the silvered globe had become tarnished,
    the radiation from its surface was so much increased that the
    loss from the sooted globe was only three times that from the
     tarnished silver.

  LVI.     On the  In<U+FB02>uence of Proximity of Mass upon Electric
        Conduction-resistance.      By Dr. G.    GORE,   F.R.S.’
       a previous    research    on the    In<U+FB02>uence of Proximity of
IN Substances upon Voltaio           action (Phil. Mag. June 1897),
I  have shown that the presence of a mass of a heavy substance
near one of the electrodes .of a voltaic cell alters its electro
motive force; and as l have since then made a very tedious
research to determine whether the same in<U+FB02>uence affects the
electric conduction-resistance of 'metal wires,        I  beg leave to
describe, in the briefest possible form,        the  general arrange
ment adopted for testing the question.
    The apparatus employed consisted of an Elliott’s differential
                                ” in their
galvanometer (“ No. 96                          catalogue), having a
                 “               ”
resistance of      3140 ohms       in each coil, and a six-inch cube
of lead weighing nearly eighty pounds divided in two halves
vertically, and havin spaces cut out of its opposing surfaces
to receive a coil and t ermometer. Two coils were employed,
each being about 5} inch diameter and 2% inches long,
the insulated copper wire upon each being '002 inch diameter,
and having a resistance of “7432 ohms at 15°'5 C.”                 Two
similar and very sensitive thermometers were also used, read
able to a one-hundredth of a C. degree, and veri<U+FB01>ed at Kew.
    Suf<U+FB01>cient uniformity of temperature of the coils and
thermometers was secured by enclosing them in a nest of
<U+FB01>ve wooden boxes with intervening layers of cotton-wool and
sheets of brightly tinned iron, with layers of <U+FB02>annel outside ;
the inner box contained two smaller ones, 6 inches square
and 3 inches         apart, to contain the cube of lead, the
comparison coils, and thermometers. The nest of boxes was
placed in a carefully selected situation, so that the average
temperatures of the thermometers when in the two small
 boxes were as nearly as possible alike.
     Equal rates of transmission of temperature from the
 external atmosphere to the centres of the small boxes when
the leaden cube was in place, so that each thermometer
arrived at a maximum or a minimum at the same time, were
ultimately secured by lining the entire surface of the empty
box with plates of paraf<U+FB01>n one inch thick.
    The coils employed consisted of the pair of copper ones
 already mentioned; a second ditto about 3% inches long,
 wire '003 inch diameter, and resistance about 350 ohms ; a
 third pair about 5% inches long, wire '003 inch diameter, and
 resistance about 350 ohms ; and a fourth of aluminium wire,
 5% inches long and f inch diameter, wire "003 inch diameter,
 and resistance of about 1800 ohms.             The coveled wire upon
 all the coils was carefully insulated with paraf<U+FB01>n.

               0n the  Damping of Galvanomgter        Needles.         559
     The sources of voltaic current employed varied from a
  single couple to four hundred in series of small copper and
  zinc plates in a slightly acidi<U+FB01>ed solution of sodic sulphate,
 the galvanometer being used differentially and the current
 divided in parallel between the coil in the lead and that in
 the para<U+FB02>in-box.         With the four hundred cells a considerable.
 current passed.
     The greatest care was taken to adjust the galvanometer to
 perfect neutrality with the full current passing, and to make
 each air of coils perfectly equal in resistance when placed
 toget er in the centre of the space between the two small
 boxes and at exactly the same temperature.                          .
     After very numerous experiments extending over many
 months ; frequently exchanging the situations of the coils in
 the cube of lead and the paraf<U+FB01>n-box;             making corrections
 for minute differences in the two thermometers and small
 changes in the galvanometer;           and in all cases taking the
 observations of conduction-resistance when the two coils were
 at exactly the same temperature in the two boxes, no
 perceptible difference could be detected in the resistance of
 either of the pair of coils by the in<U+FB02>uence of the lead: the
 in<U+FB02>uence of the lead, therefore, if any, must have been
 excessively minute.          A single millimetre of movement of
 the re<U+FB02>ected image upon the scale at a distance of one metre
 from the needles could easily be detected; and the current
 from a single cell of the battery was quite suf<U+FB01>cient to send
 the image rapidly Off the scale when the galvanometer was
used nonditierentially.

        is well known that shortening the period of oscillation of
IT      a galvanometer-needle by increasing the strength of the
magnetic controlling <U+FB01>eld decreases the decrement, or ratio of
one complete swing to the next. It follows therefore that for
a given initial amplitude Of vibration a needle swinging in a
strong. controlling <U+FB01>eld will make a greater number" of
oscillations before coming to rest than when swinging-in a
weak <U+FB01>eld ; but since the time of each oscillation is less in
the former case it does not follow that the time required for
the amplitude to be reduced to a given fraction                         of
                                                           (say

     Examining the question theoretically,aud   making the usual
assumption  that  the  retarding forces   are proportional to the
<U+FB01>rst power of the velocity, one arrives at    the conclusion that
the time taken for the amplitude to becomel/m of its initial
value is independent of the strength of the controlling <U+FB01>eld,
and so the time taken by the needle in coming to rest from
a given initial de<U+FB02>esion should be the same whether the
period of vibration is long or short.
   For, making the assumption stated above, we have as the
equation of motion for a needle of magnetic moment M, and
of moment of inertia I, swinging in a uniform magnetic <U+FB01>eld
of strength H,

where  a is the deflexion at time t, and N is the coef<U+FB01>cient
allowing for the damping, by which is meant the resistance
tending to destroy the motion of the needle.    This resistance is
due to the viscosity of the air and of the suspension <U+FB01>bre, and
also to the eddy-currents set up b      the swingin      needle in
neighbouring metallic circuits.                       (if
                                         these retarding forces
that due to the eddy-currents must be proportional to the
<U+FB01>rst power of the velocity     but   ;   possible that those due

to the viscosity of the air and the suspension <U+FB01>bre vary as
 some function of the velocity other than its <U+FB01>rst power.

       With    a view to testing the conclusion arrived at bv the
    above reasoning, experiments have been made at the central
    Technical College, beginning in 1891 and continued at inter
    vals since that time, the results of which have shown decided                    a
    discrepancy between theory and experiment.                  The method
    adopted    was . to  observe   the   periodic    time  and    the corre
    sponding    decrement     with   di<U+FB01>'erel'it  strengths   of controlling
    <U+FB01>eld. Calculating out from these observations the values of
    the ratio tjh, i.e. the ratio of the periodic time to the loga
    rithmic decrement, showed that in most of the instruments
    tested the value of this ratio was not constant as indicated
    by theory.     As examples of the results obtained, three sets of
    experiments on galvanometers of different types may be
    quoted.
        The <U+FB01>rst set of experiments was made         Mr. Seaman in        by
    1891, on   a Mudt'ord’s Thomson     galvanometer similar to that
    illustrated in <U+FB01>g. of Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner’s
                          6'
    paper on “Gralranometers”        (Phil. Mag. July 1890,     70).                      p.

    small magnets aliixcd to the upper and lower ends, and the

         mirror a<U+FB02>ixed at the centre.     The mirror is enclosed in a
      small case with glass back and front so arranged that these
      glasses can be screwed nearer together or farther apart, thus
      enabling the space in which the mirror swings, and conse
      quently the air damping, to be Varied.         A pair of coils is
      placed  one behind   and   one before the  upper set of magnets,
     and a similar pair before and behind the lower set, the coils
     being enclosed in ebonite boxes <U+FB01>tted into a brass frame.       By
     thus placing the mirror outside, instead of at the centre of
     the coils, an improvement introduced           into the Thomson
     galvanometer by Mr. Mudford, the coils may be wound
     practically to the centre and much valuable space utilized. The
     strength of the controlling <U+FB01>eld is varied by sliding a magnet
     up and down a vertical upright <U+FB01>xed to the top of the instru—
     ment case.     As a result of these experiments Mr. Seaman
     found that the ratio t/k increased as the period increased,
     becoming, however, nearly constant at long periods.            The
     actual results are given in Table        and plotted asl.,curve  in              a

     values of t/h being taken in preference to those of X/t, as
     might appear more rational, because, as has been shown
     above,        the ratio t/7t that occurs in the expression for the

              Finally, Mr. Taylor made some experiments in 1896 upon
          a   Rosenthal galvanometer.      The suspended system of this
           instrument      illustrated in <U+FB01>g. 10 of the paper previously
                               is
           referred to, and consists of an astatic pair of needles fastened
           below the mirror, each needle being bent into the shape of                                  a
           horseshoe.    One pole of each needle passes into the centre
           of coil, whilst the other pole
              a                               on the outside of the coil,

            These experiments (which have been selected from amongst
         the large number made at the Central Technical College as
         being typical) succeed in establishing the fact that the ratio
         t/X does not remain constant when the strength of the con
         trolling <U+FB01>eld       altered, but they do not explain why the
                                           is
         conclusion derived from the theoretical equation          not borne                                  is
         out in practice.     At   the suggestion of Mr. Mather         made                                       I
         a series of experiments to <U+FB01>nd out if possible to what cause
         the variation in the ratio was due.       It has been shown above
         that the ratio t/X. will remain constant when the strength of
         the controlling <U+FB01>eld        varied, provided that
                                                        is     and N remain                            I
         constant. N,            to be noticed, allows for the damping
                                           it   is
         caused          by
                     the viscosity of the air and the suspension, and by
         the eddy-currents, and         therefore so far as the last cause
                                                             is                                                                    is

         strength   of the  controlling    <U+FB01>eld a<U+FB01>'ects the  strength  of the
         needle.   We   have   then   the following possible explanations of
         the variation of the ratio :—
             1.I  may not be constant.—This may occur through the
                        controlling magnet de<U+FB02>ecting the swinging system
                        slightly from the vertical, and thus altering the axis
                        of rotation  this   more likely to occur when the <U+FB01>eld

                        is  varied by moving the controlling        magnet in

                        the magnet up and down in       vertical plane passing          a

                  Damping of Galvanometer lVeedles.            565
   2.   N may not be constant.—This may occur in three ways :—
       i. The factor introduced by the air resistance may not be
           constant, the air resistance being possibly not pro
           portional to the <U+FB01>rst power of the velocity.             2
       ii. For the same reason it is possible that the factor
           introduced by the viscosity of the suspension may not
           be constant.
       iii. The factor introduced by the eddy-current damping
           may not be constant. There are three causes which
                                                   '
           may make this factor vary.                        _
   1n the <U+FB01>rst place, since the E.M.F. induced by the
swinging needle is proportional to the <U+FB01>rst power of its
velocity and to its strength, the damping effect of the eddy
currents will be proportional to the square of the strength of
the swinging needle ; and it is quite possible that altering the
strength of the controlling <U+FB01>eld may alter the strength of the
needle.
    Secondly, if the galvanometer coils have a self-induction
such that the reactauce is not negligible, at the periods used,
when compared with the resistance, the eddy-currents set up
will not only lag behind the induced E.M.F., but will be to a
certain extent choked out. And as these effects will be
greater at the fast periods, the damping will be diminished at
these periods, thus causing the ratio t/k to increase as the period
decreases.      I
                                                 .
    Thirdly, it is possible   that the eddy-currents will produce
a   rise in temperature suf<U+FB01>cient to appreciably affect the
resistance of the galvanometer coils.       This will diminish the
eddy-currents       most at the  short periods, thus producing an
effect similar to that due to self-induction, namely an increase
of t/A. as the period decreases.             .
    To <U+FB01>nd out if possible which of the above was the true
cause of the discrepancy between theory and experiment, it
 was decided to make some experiments in which the ratio t/A.
 was <U+FB01>rst determined for various strengths of controlling <U+FB01>eld
for a needle swinging in a system in which the eddy-current
 damping was reduced to a minimum, if not entirely eliminated:
and secondly for the same system but with considerable eddy
current damping introduced.         In this way it would be possible
 to discover whether the effect was due to the eddy-currents
 or not.
    Some preliminary trials showed that, to obtain satisfactor
 observations with vibrations of long period, it would be
 necessary to perform the experiments at night when there
 was comparative freedom from the disturbances due to
 traf<U+FB01>c, since, although the galvanometer was placed on a stone

566                  Mr. M. Solomon       on tlac
foundation-pillar, it was found impossible to get good readings
when the traf<U+FB01>c was at all frequent.        The whole set of obser
vations was therefore made between twelve and six on the
morning of'Jnne 23rd, 1898.        A sixty-ohm simple re<U+FB02>ecting
galvanometer was used with an astatic combination of four
small needles a<U+FB01>ixed to a wire to the upper end of which the
mirror was fastened, the whole being suspended by a single
silk <U+FB01>bre. This system swung between the coils of the galva
nometer, and as_it had no mica vane the air damping was not
great. As the coils were of <U+FB01>ne wire, and the parts of the
galvanometer nearly all of wood, the eddy-currents would be
very small when the coils were on open circuit, and the
damping in that case would be almost entirely due to the air
resistance and the viscosity of the suspension.        When, how
ever, the galvanometer circuit was closed by short-circuiting
the terminals, eddy-currents would be set up, and would
introduce a considerable factor in the damping; so that if the
alteration in the ratio t/X. is due to the factor introduced by
the eddy-currents, it would be observable with the galvano~
meter circuit closed, but not with it open.
   The determinations of the period were made by observing
with a stop watch the time taken in executing several com
plete swings—from <U+FB01>ve or six when the period was long, to
twenty when it was short. The time was read as the spot of
light passed the zero of the galvanometer scale. Unfortu
nately in the experiments with a period of' 16 seconds the
true zero was about 25 divisions out, in such a direction as to
cause the observed period to be too small.          Had the ampli—
tudes of the <U+FB01>rst and last swings used in determining the
period been observed, it would be possible to make an accurate
correction : as this was not done, it is only possible to make
an approximate one, which will not, however, be far wrong,
and which has been made in the results given in the table.
   In observing the decrement when the period was long, the
amplitudes of successive swings on both sides of the Zero were
observed.    If these be a, b, c, d, e, . .. &c., we have
      Decrement =    a    b___      _a+b_b+c_               8w

                                         to calculate the decrement
   By thus using
                   3%
                         instead  of;
any zero error is eliminated.         A specimen of the actual
readings obtained in an observation of this type is appended.

                                     is
that astatic combinations are generally used. The variation in
the ratio will depend upon the alteration in strength in each of
the magnets of which the combination                is
                                             composed      and since     :
some of these magnets may be nearer the controlling magnet

that one of the magnets in the astatic combination may be
more favourably situated, by being near metal parts of the
instrument, for example, for producing eddy-currents, in
which case any changes in its strength will have a propor
tionately larger in<U+FB02>uence on the total change in the eddy
 current damping.        In addition, the change in the strength of
any particular magnet will depend upon its initial magneti
 zation, on the steel of which          made, and also to
                                          it   is             certain        a
extent on its previous history.       When we remember, further,
that the percentage change in the Vaer ot' the ratio t/7t
 depends upon how much of the damping                  due to eddy  is
currents and how much to the other causes, viscosity of the
air and the suspension, we see that we may expect the ratio to
vary in    a very great number of different ways.          »

as to carrying out the experiments, which were made at his

the phenomena considered, but also a careful account of Felici’s
celebrated experiments on this subject.            It is probably in connexion
with his experimental researches rather than his theoretical work
that the name of Felici will go down to posterity.                  The dates of
publication of the three memoirs fall between 1854-55.                      Con—
sidering the enormous advance which has been made since that
time, it is hardly to be wondered at that Felici’s interpretation
and mode of statement of certain phenomena partake of an archaic
character: more especially is this the case in the lust memoir,
which is concerned with the so-called “ unipolar ” induction.                The

A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., F.G.S., and Capt. J. It. Roberts,
I.M.S., and on the petrological examination of the specimens sent
home by them.          It is divided into three parts. Part. I. refers to
the work of previous observers, and embodies a. brief petrological de
scription of the four granites and aplite intrusive in the sedimentary
rocks of Gilgit.      Part II. consists of a topographical account of the
Gilgit rocks from Askole and Nanga Parbat on the south to the
northern passes leading into the Russian Parnirs.              Part III. recites
the author’s conclusions from the facts recorded in the paper. Briefly
stated, they are as follows :—
    That at one period in the elevation of the Hindu Kush the strata
were thrown into a. series of folds and compressed into a. series of
uniclinal beds with a vertical dip.
    That the direction of the main drainage of the area was deter
mined before. or at the commencement, of the last series of earth
movcments that crumpled up the strata.
    The sedimentary rocks were profusely invaded by granite and
diorite, and profoundly metamorphosed by contact-action.
    As regards the age of the rocks, the author gives his reasons for
identifying the Gilgit limestones with the conformable Garbo-Triassic
series of the Himalaya.               This series was mapped by Mr. R.
Lydekker,    F.1t.S.,   in the    neighbouring    district of Kashmir, and it
has been traced up to the border of Gilgit.               Sir Martin Conway’s
specimens,    reported    on  by   Prof.  Bonney  and   Miss Raisin, enable the
author to connect it with the limestones of Gilgit.                   From this
correlation the author concludes that the oldest rock in the Gilgit

572             Intelligence and illisecllancous Articles.
area is of Silurian or Lower Carboniferous age, and that the most
recent are of Triassic or even later age.    As all the granites are
intrusive in the most recent beds, it follows that the granites are
younger than the Trias. The author gives his reasons for believing
that the oldest granite was erupted while the crumpling of the
Gilgit rocks was in progress; but that a portion, at all events, of
the younger granites was erupted after the crumpling had taken
place.
   The author otl'ers an hypothesis to explain certain structures
found in the Gilgit granites, including the granophyric structure so
common in them.
   All the Gilgit granites. the author believes, came from the same
igneous reservoir, the di<U+FB02>'erences in them being due to gradual and
progressive sili<U+FB01>cation caused by the gradual crystallizing-out of the
comparatively basic minerals: the process extending over a long
period of time measured in years.

GENTLEMEN,
      the December number of the Philosophical Magazine for 1891
IN   will be found a table of Zonal Spherical Harmonics, published
by Professor Perry.      Some time ago               I
                                            had occasion to use these
tables and found that in one or two places the values givenv
were erroneous.      My work did not involve P,, but the test                      I
applied   to the  others  was severe, as is shown by some of the
corrections being quite small.               I
                                     have checked the values     send        I
several  times,  and Mr. H. F. Skey has also kindly checked them
for   me.
