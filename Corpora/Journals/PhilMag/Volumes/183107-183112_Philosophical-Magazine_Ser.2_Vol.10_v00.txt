I.     On the Thermo-Magnetism of Homogeneous Bodies, with
    illustrative Experiments. By Mr. W.M. STURGEoN, Lecturer
    on Experimental Philosophy at the Hon. East India Company's
    Military    Academy, Adiscombe”.
                               [With a Plate.]
 1.                or nine years have now elapsed since Dr. See
      EIGHTbeck, a Prussian philosopher, unfolded a most import
ant secret of nature, by the discovery of magnetic powers in
various metallic combinations, by merely submitting their
 points of union to different degrees of temperature;—a dis
covery of equal, if not superior interest, to that of electro
magnetism by CErsted the illustrious Dane.              Each of those
discoveries marks a distinct and important epoch in the                  hi
story of experimental science, and each philosopher now en
joys that degree of fame to which he is so justly entitled.
    2. Philosophers in every civilized country have repeated
the experiments of those celebrated men, admired the beaut
and interest of the phaenomena they present, and vied wit
each other in adding new facts to those already known. Heat,
magnetism, and electricity are now blended in our experi
ments, and new sciences have been reared upon the phaeno
mena they have jointly presented to our notice.
    3. The discovery of CErsted, and the train of curious and
interesting phaenomena to which it has directed our view, rest,
principally, upon the action of metallic combinations, and a
mode of excitation, which to philosophers have long been
known;–whilst the discovery of Seebeck, on the contrary, not
only depends upon new arrangements, but also upon the novel

2             Mr. W. Sturgeon              on the Thermo-Magnetism                     of
 mode by which he calls forth the electric powers, and interro
 gates the magnetic phaenomena they display.
    4. In this mode of research, however, as well as in the
former, combinations of two, or more distinct metallic bodies
were still employed; and it appears that, by whatever inge
nious contrivances other philosophers have pursued the                                       in
 quiry, combinations of two, or more bodies have generally been
 considered necessary for the display of thermo-magnetic phae
nomena. I am not aware, however, that any experiments are
yet before the public illustrative of thermo-magnetic action
in one solitary piece of metal, or other homogeneous body.
   5. In my “Recent Experimental Researches in Galvanism,
 Electro-Magnetism, &c.” a small work lately published,                                        I
have stated that simple metallic bodies not only display dif
ferent electric powers as regards each other, but also that
the various parts of each separate metal are relatively in dif
ferent electric states at one and the same time, although in
close connection with each other by the best known conduct
ing material; that           is,
                            by the metal itself. And have shown              I
by several experiments                     on
                                     homogeneous metals, that those
magnetic powers, which are regarded                 inseparable from the
                                                              as
electric, can readily                 be
                               brought into play either              the gal           by
vanic     or       by
                the thermo     process,         circumstance,      which                      to
                                                       of a
me appeared highly confirmatory               the hypothesis.
    6. Since writing that work,          have been induced
                                                 I                     prose            to
cute those   inquiries          still
                                  to  greater
                                      a        extent;      and the   experi

 by  heat      single pieces
               in                     metal were not very successful;
                                            of
although the pieces were alloys, and consequently not homo
geneous metals.          found however, after some trials, that
                             I                                                                by
hardening one end              piece

                                          steel, and keeping the other
end   quite   soft,   the  thermo-magnetic       energies were always
called into  play    when   any  part  near       the centre                         of

was heated, and the extremities left             the ordinary tempera

          the atmosphere.

                            the same treatment, displays thermo
magnetic properties, which are easily detected                 the galvano   by

   13. Fig. 2. will represent this frame of bismuth.        It was
heated successively at the points a, b, c, d, close to the angles;
but those angles were kept out of the flame of the spirit-lamp.
These points were selected for the points of heat, from a                                               no

   To  prevent    confusion,   the side a b,    only,   is chosen to show
the directions of the electric currents. It is to be understood,
however, that those currents were continuous round the rect
angular frame.

the current changed when the point of heat was at b; at                                                      all

    needle is more deflected than if the heat were confined to a
    single point. When the whole side a b is uniformly heated, in
    consequence of the superior energies attributable to the half
    nearest to a, the current is directed from b to a ; but the
    energies of this resulting force are necessarily very feeble.
                                     Third Class of Experiments.
       22. Three rectangular frames of bismuth, which              shall                               I
    distinguish by the letters A, B, C, were cast in the same mould,
    and from the same mass of metal. The longest side of each
    frame measured 4-5 inches, and the shorter sides 2 inches.
    The weight of the whole was 21 ounces; so that the average
    weight of each was 7 ounces.      They were cast under different
    circumstances, as regards the temperature of the mould, agita
    tion, position, &c.
       23. The rectangle A was cast whilst the mould was quite
    cold;     its
                plane horizontal, and                       its
                                             longest sides parallel                                              to
    the magnetic meridian.        The metal was        poured into the       all
    mould (which was simply           groove      one

    the longest sides     the rectangle, and about 1.5 inch from one
    of  the angles. The metal consequently flowed from this point
    to  every other part       the mould.    Two powerful bar mag
                                             of
    nets were applied        the two longest sides whilst the bismuth
                                        to

    metal was set. The mould was kept perfectly             rest     the                 at                all
    time.

    The    magnetizing    process   was carried                         on

                  the mould was the same          whilst casting the rect

       25. The rectangle         was cast whilst the mould was quite
                                              C

 8      Mr. W.    Sturgeon on the Thermo-Magnetism        of
  energies of which are directed in one and the same way round
  the rectangle.
      28. In the side c d there are two neutral points; one of
  which is exactly at the gate, or that point at which the metal
  was poured into the mould. I mention this circumstance more
                          I
  particularly, because have observed that, when the point of
  heat is situated on different sides of the gate in any of these
 frames of bismuth, there are generally opposite currents eli
  cited; or, in other words, the gate is generally a neutral point.
  The letter o in figs. 4.5. and 6. denotes the gate in each.
     29. Experiments with the rectangle  B-By      consulting fig. 5,
 it will be observed that the   greater  part of the side a b is neu
 tral. No deflection of the needle could be produced when the
 point exceeded one inch from either of the angles a or b.
     30. The side c d has three neutral points, one of which is
 at the point o, where the metal entered the mould.         The two
 short sides, b c and d a, have each one neutral point.        In a d
 it is at equal  distances from the   angles   a and d.   In b c the
 neutral point is nearer to c than to b.
     31. The opposite angles a and c are decidedly neutral
 points; but when the angles d or c were heated, very power
 ful currents were excited. The arrows on each side of the
 angle b are both directed the same way, and consequently
 would represent that angle of one uniform character; but it
 was found by repeated trials, that there are two neutral points
 very close to the angle b, but on different sides; and so close
to each other, that it required a very fine-pointed flame to
heat one of those points without heating the other also.
     32. Experiments with the rectangle C. — There are three
neutral points in each of the long sides of this rectangle; one
of which is at o, the point where the metal entered the mould.
 In each of the short sides there is one neutral point, situated
nearly at their centres, as is shown by fig. 6.
    33. The angles c and d are perfectly inactive when uni
formly heated; but the angles a and b, although represented
by the arrows as causing conspiring currents on both sides of
each angle, have, in fact, each of them two neutral points very
close to each other; so that the needle will be deflected vari
ously by heating different adjoining points about either of
those angles.
    34. When those parts of the rectangle which are opposite
to the arrows i i are simultaneously heated, the energies of
the conspiring currents become very powerful indeed; and
the needle may be driven round on       its pivot through a   whole
circle  by  followingit   up with the side    of
                                              the rectangle. The
electric currents excited       this rectangle are more powerful
                               in
                                                                than

than in either of the two former; particularly when heated
opposite to the arrows i i. The thermo-magnetic powers of
A and B, however, when those rectangles were heated at two
or more conspiring active points, would frequently deflect the
needle over an arc of 30° or 40° by the first impulse.
   35. The rectangle A was so exceedingly sensible by the
slightest inequalities of temperature in         various parts, that     its
the heat  imparted      the finger  by

whatever.

edges of curvilinear frames as close as possible to the mag
netic needle, I cast several into an elliptical form; the diameters
of each of which were nearly as to 3 to 1. Every one of these
frames became magnetic by heating at various points, in the
manner already described; and the thermo-magnetic energies
were as promptly displayed in every part of the curve by heat
ing an individual point, as in any thermo-magnetic circuit
whatever.
   41.     Imust not omit to mention a very extraordinary cir
cumstance which occurred whilst varying the experiments
with one of those elliptical frames; because the same cause.
frequently produces very singular changes in the thermo
magnetic character of curvilinear and other frames of bis
muth.
   42. Having proceeded in the usual way (11),                 succeeded                   I

those points are indicated by the arrows in fig. 8; the
arrow always pointing in the direction of the current when

    43. It would be needless (indeed almost endless) to de
scribe all the peculiarities which have attended the numerous
repetitions of the preceding experiments; and the variety of
circumstances under which I have cast rectangular, triangular,
and curvilinear frames of bismuth; as the phaenomena already
described, with a few summary remarks, will pourtray their
general character.
     I am not certain that any peculiar property is communi
cated to bismuth by the magnetic process (23), or by the
position of the metal as regards the cardinal points, whilst

              have frequently cast rectangles under these cir
cumstances, but have not found more regularity in the display
of their thermo-magnetism than in those which were cast
under circumstances quite different.
   In general, small, and well-formed rectangles (17) (fig.                                                 3.)

   44. The experiments which I am now about to introduce
present phaenomena, perhaps somewhat less complicated,
though by no means less curious, than those I have already
                                                                                                          |
described.
    I  had observed, whilst experimenting with a rectangular
frame of bismuth of large dimensions, that the needle would
sometimes be deflected in one direction and sometimes in the                                              -
other, even when the point of heat was not varied.                   Struck
by this unusual phaenomenon,                    I
                                        proceeded to examine it with
some degree of minuteness, and with an intention of ascer
taining       its
               cause.

 such   compound      apparatus,   would not    very materially     have af

   14      Mr. W. Sturgeon      on the Thermo-magnetism      of
   ridian, the greatest deflection was again produced in the op
   posite direction to the former.
      46. Considering this as one step at least towards the dis
  covery of the cause of this novel phaenomenon,          I proceeded
   to examine the   opposite  side of the  frame,   which  I supposed
  might possibly present similar effects.         For this  purpose   I
  heated one of the points in that side which by previous trials
  was found to be very active, and then placed it directly over
  the magnetic needle, keeping the plane of the frame in the
  magnetic meridian, and the same end north as had been in
  that position whilst experimenting with the other side. The
  needle was deflected in precisely the same direction as        I had
  always found it to be by a similar position of the frame, and
  with the same point of heat.      I afterwards inclined the plane
  of the frame sometimes eastward, at others to the west; but
  in no instance could    I  obtain the least indication of results
  similar to those which    I had noticed whilst the opposite side
  of the frame   was nearest to the needle.        Thinking that the
  different active points   might  possibly   operate  under different
 laws, I next heated the point which had before presented
 the extraordinary phaenomenon, still keeping the other side
 nearest to the needle; but nothing remarkable was noticed by
 this variation of the experiment. The needle continued to be
 deflected in one uniform direction, whatever inclination was
 given to the plane of the rectangle.       I tried the other sides of
 the rectangle in precisely the same way, but obtained no un
 usual results. It now appeared evident that one side of the
 frame was endued with peculiar properties which the other
 sides could not be made to exhibit, which soon proved to be
 the fact.
     47. When this side was heated at one particular point, two
distinct electric currents were called forth; one of which may
be distinguished by the name of general current, because it
pervaded every part of the metallic frame; the other cur
rent was perfectly local, and could be traced only to a short
distance from the point of heat.          It never reached further
than the angle, and returned into itself on the opposite face
of the solid prism which formed that side of the frame.
     48. From this singular result, it appeared likely that some
inaccuracy might possibly have occurred in the conclusions
I   had already drawn from the former experiments.              Fortu
mately the rectangles were not broken, and          I had an oppor
tunity of examining them again: but it seems that they were
of too small dimensions to produce local currents, as found   I
them to operate exactly as at first.         On trying one of the
circular rings, however, another curious fact was discovered,
                                                                which

which at that time was not a little surprising.   A reference to
fig. 10. will assist the illustration of this singular property
discovered in the ring of bismuth.
   49. When the outside of the ring at b was held for a few
moments in the point of a well-defined flame of a spirit-lamp,
the electric current in every part of the ring was in the direc
tion of the exterior arrow; but when the inner side of the
rim opposite to b was similarly heated, the current proceeded
in the contrary direction, as indicated by the interior arrow.
And so directly opposite and close to each other were these
two active points, that a transverse section of the metal at the
point b, would have embraced them both. I have since that
time observed active points similarly situated in other pieces
of bismuth.
   50. Experiments with a solid Prism of Bismuth.--That side
of the rectangle (47) which had exhibited local electric cur
rents was now cut from the frame, for the purpose of ascer
taining whether phaenomena similar to those described (47)
would be exhibited by this prism when examined as a distinct
individual mass.     Fig. 11. will represent this prism or bar of
bismuth: when heated at b, the former active point, the barbe
came highly magnetic, displaying those energies in a very ex
alted degree. The electric current was traced from the point of
heat towards the end c, along that side of the prism which in
the figure is hid from view. It proceeded across the end c, as
shown by the curved arrow; and returned to the heated point
along the front face of the prism: so that when heated, if the
front face a, b, c were placed over and parallel to the needle,
 and the end c north, the north end of the needle would be
 deflected towards the east; and by simply turning the prism the
 other side up, the needle would be deflected towards the west.
 By thus turning the bar, at suitable times to promote the de
 flections, the needle could be made to sweep an arc of 90°.
    51. The other two faces of the prism were nearly neutral,
 each of them partaking of the opposing currents in the active
sides.
   52. The bar was afterwards heated at various parts of              its
surface, and the direction and energy           of
                                          the currents ascer

racter as when the bar was heated at the point b only.
   54. The neutral end a was now cut off at the point b; and
the remaining bar displayed thermo-magnetism to whatever
end heat was applied. The currents still passed over the same
faces, and, as regards the point of heat, uniformly set out over
the same face and returned by the other. Hence the apparent

 which the electric currents flowed over the surface, there were
necessarily two longitudinal lines more active than any other
part.   These lines passed through the dense and opposite
cavernous sides, and may be termed the lines of greatest
energy. . The neutral lines were also a consequence of the
recurved flow of the electric currents by intersecting them at
right angles; and as those intersections were in a series of
points nearly parallel to the axis, those neutral lines were
nearly parallel to the axis also.
   57. When the other end of the cylindrical bar was heated,
the lines of greatest energy were still on the same parts of the
surface, but the electric currents flowed in an opposite direc
tion to the former; so that to whatever end of the bar heat
was applied, the current uniformly proceeded from the heated
end along the dense side c d, and returned over the opposite
or cavernous part of the surface a b, a b.

cold end of the bar, but returned to the point of heat in di-,
rections indicated by the arrows, and at no great distance

   67. When any point is suddenly made pretty hot, without
elevating the temperature of the opposite side, which can easily
be done when a cylinder is employed of more than two inches
diameter, the electric force is very considerable, and will de
flect the needle to an angle of 20° or 30°; and by dexterously
turning it the other side up before the returning needle ar
rives at the magnetic meridian, another impulse is given, and
the angle increased on the other side. Two or three turns of
the cylinder in this way will cause the needle to sweep a con
siderable arc; but the arc over which the needle passes will
be very much increased if the needle be followed up by the
active sides of the cylinder, still keeping the one parallel to
the other.
               Remarks on the preceding Experiment.
   68. There is a peculiarity in the phaenomena displayed in
this experiment which has not been observed in any of the
rest:—When a cylinder of antimony is cavernous on one side,
I have shown (57) that the electric current invariably flows
over the same parts of the surface; but in cylinders of uniform
density on every side of the axis, the law of thermo-magnetic
action is very different, and the route of the electric current
over the surface of the metal entirely depends upon the situa
tion of the point of heat.
   69. When a cylindrical bar of antimony is uniformly dense
                       at its
on every side of         axis,     will invariably present        regular
                                                                                           <U+017F>º.

to each other when cast into cylinders, which are regularly
and uniformly cooled on every side; and there is so little dif
ference in the general aspect of a transverse fracture of the
two metals, that were it not for the difference of colour, it
would require some practice to distinguish the one from the

that the same cause, whatever it may be, is the fountain of the
thermo-magnetism in both metals.

WHAT    is life?—The great variety of definitions by which
  physiologists have attempted to exhibit an idea of life,
shows that it is no easy task to do so correctly. The subtile and
untangible character of the subject to be defined is doubtless
the grand cause of the difficulty. , Bichât, a French physio
logist of great celebrity, defined it as follows: “La vie est
l'ensemble des fonctions qui resistent à la mort +,”—Life is
the totality of the functions that resist death.           It is a trait
from the pencil of a great master, but it is by much too indefi
nite to exhibit a distinct view of the subject.        Functions seem
to be rather the result of    life, than to be life itself. But what
is the amount of their resistance? for death finally overcomes
them; and of what class of bodies are they predicable?—
Richerand defined it thus: “La vie est une collection de
phénomènes qui succedent pendant un temps limité dans                                     les
corps organisésf,”—Life               collection
                                     is                 of
                                                     phaenomena that
occur  during    limited  period  in aorganized  structures. But the
boundaries
              of a
                 this limited period are left undefined, and must
consequently     be  supplied       by
                                     the imagination                  of
                                                            the reader.
They may include even the phaenomena                   of
                                                  death, for anything
that the definition shows           the contrary.

definition is very brief.         It is as follows: “Life is the active
state of the animal structure”.”            This evidently excludes the
torpid state. . It excludes also vegetables, which it might
indeed be made to embrace by the insertion of a single word.
But if life may exist even in a state of rest, surely it cannot
be well defined, merely by calling it a state of action.
     A writer, who regards the above definitions as savouring
too much of materialism, not to say atheism, gives us another
definition,-the briefest of all: “Life is inherent activity+.”
This, it must be acknowledged, is scanty enough: but it
is abundantly comprehensive; for it includes everything of
which inherent activity can be predicated, be it mind, or be it
matter. Yet this is going a great deal further than                     author                               its

     failure seems to be attributable, chiefly, to an unnecessary
      effort at brevity,+brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio,-perhaps it
       might be worth our while to try the effect of a fuller enumera
       tion of particulars.     What we lose in point and neatness, we
       may gain in perspicuity; and upon this principle I submit the
       definition that follows:–Life is that attribute or energy of or—
      ganized structures which renders them susceptible to impres
      sions, and enables them to discharge functions.              It is real, or
      it is  potential:—real,    if the energy    is in  operation;    as in the
      case of an animal in motion, or of a plant protruding                 buds                            its
      and blossoms;–potential,           the energy if     dormant,           the

as may be seen by perusing his Sylva Sylvarum.                                                   The    mosses
that grow on trees he regards as being nothing          more than a
sort of excretion which the tree cannot assimilate; and the
misletoe he represents as being produced, not from seed, but
merely from superabundance of nourishment.
   Yet the truth of the doctrine began to be at last suspected,
and subjected to the test of observation and experiment.            It
was a scrutiny which it could not stand, and beneath which it
fell refuted. The credit of the refutation is due partly to
Harvey, who contended that            animals spring fromall      egg                                    an

and yet they are evidently endowed with life.—To this we
will reply by the following question. Has it been proved
that they are not the product of generation?—If the higher
orders of animals, the animals with which we are best ac
quainted, are evidently the product of generation, ought we
not to conclude from analogy, that other and inferior orders
of animals, with which we are less acquainted, are the product
of generation also? or at the least of some process analogous to
it,  and leading            to
                            similar issue.

But if the solids originate in the fluids, how can the fluids

Blumenbach can see no ground for adopting this opinion.
If you grant vitality to the blood because it is the material
out of which the living solids are formed, as well, says he, may

remarkable plants are nourished by it #. We do not think
that the case is fairly put.        Blood is an elaborated fluid            for                            fit

mosphere,   upon Batrachian Reptiles.” By Marshall Hall, M.D., &c.
   Dr. Edwards had found, by a series of experiments, that the batra
chian reptiles, when immersed in hot water, live for a shorter time in
proportion as the temperature of the water is higher; and that at
108° of Fahrenheit they die almost instantaneously.       The author of
the present paper observes, that the extinction of life in these cases is
owing to a cause of a more immediately destructive agency than the
mere suspension of respiration : he finds that if only the head of the
animal is placed under water of 120°, the animal struggles, but soon
ceases to move ; but if the spine as well as the limbs be immersed,
convulsions supervene, and the muscles become rigid: in both cases
the action of the heart continues.        If one of the limbs, which after the
extinction of    sensibility  still remains flexible, be separated from the
body, and placed in water of 120°,                              its
                                               muscles contract and become

the Ganglions in furnishing Electricity for the production of Animal

   The author  considering   animal heat as depending on the ganglions,
infers from the  analogy  of the structure of the abdominal ganglia with
the electrical organs  of fishes, that animal heat arises from the elec
tricity supplied by these ganglions.

   When elastic plates on which sand has been strewed are thrown
into sonorous vibrations, the grains of sand arrange themselves in
lines which indicate the quiescent parts of the plate, and have been
called the nodal lines. This fact was discovered by Chladni, who
also observed that the minute shavings cut by the edge of a glass
plate from the hairs of the violin bow employed to produce the                                         vi

 the centre of the heap, and rolling down again on the outer sides.
 The powders are collected in the same situations on the vibrating
 plate, although the plate may be considerably inclined to the hori
 zon, and remain there even when the inclination is so great as to
 prevent grains of sand from resting on the nodal lines.                A piece of
 gold leaf laid upon the plate was raised up in the form of a blister
 at that part which corresponded with the centre of the clouds, even
 to the height of one-twelfth of an inch.
    On attaching small pieces of card to different parts of the surface
 of the vibrating plate, the currents of air are modified in various
ways, as shown by the different positions of the clouds, and the pro
duction of partial accumulations of the powders. When a tuning
fork is made to vibrate, and a little powder of lycopodium is
sprinkled over         it,

      A paper was read, entitled, “Researches in Physical Astro
 nomy.” By J. W. Lubbock, Esq. V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal
  Society.
      The first part of this paper relates to the theory of the moon.
 The method of solution pursued by Clairaut consisted in the inte
 gration of differential equations, in which the true longitude of the
 moon is the independent variable: the time is then obtained in
 terms of the true longitude; and by the reversion of series, the lon
 gitude afterwards obtained in terms of the time. This method
 is the one adopted by Mayer, Laplace, and Damoiseau.                   The au
 thor has been led, by reflecting on the difficulties of this problem,
 to believe that the integration of the differential equations in which
 the time is the independent variable would be at least as easy as
 the former process; and it would possess the advantage of employing
 the same system of equations for the moon as for the planets. The
lunar theory proposed by the author, and developed in this paper,
is an extension of the equations given in his former Researches in
 Physical Astronomy, already published in the Philosophical Trans
actions; by including those terms, which, in consequence of the
great eccentricity of the moon's orbit, are sensible; and by sup
pressing those which are insensible from the great distance of the
sun, the disturbing body.         He has not yet attempted to obtain nu
merical results, but proposes at some future time to engage in their
computation.
    In the second part of the paper, he investigates the precession of
the equinoxes, on the supposition that the earth revolves in a re
sisting medium; an investigation which may also be considered as
a sequel to the author's last paper on Physical Astronomy.                   The
effects of the resistance of such a medium is to increase the latitude
of the axis of rotation (reckoned from the equator of the figure)
till it reaches 90°. Such is now the condition of the axis of the
earth; but as the chances are infinitely great against this having
been    its original position, may not       attainment  its    this position         of                    be

    A paper was read, entitled, “An Experimental Examination of
 the Blood found in the Vena Portae.”       By James Thackeray, M.D.
 Communicated by Sir Astley Cooper, Bart. V.P.R.S.
    The author, in the course of an inquiry into the properties of the
 blood, was led to notice some peculiarities in the contents of the
 vena portae, and to investigate this subject more minutely.           The
 results of the experiments which he made for this purpose are
 chiefly the following.     The blood contained in the vena portae is
darker than that of the other veins, inclining more to a ruddy hue
than to the Modena red. Being less homogeneous, it has the ap                                                 *
pearance of being less perfectly elaborated. Its specific gravity was
found to be very variable, but it is in general less than ordinary
venous blood.      It coagulates much more quickly, and contains a
larger proportion of serum, but a much smaller proportion of al
bumen, than blood taken from other veins.           The serum obtained
                                                                                            a its

   In citing, with much praise, the recently published maps and sec
tions of Hoffmann on North-Western Germany, the English inquirer
is cautioned against the general application, in Germany, of that part
of the table of superposition, in which the coal measures are desig
nated as some beds, subordinate to a vast thickness, 3000 or 4000
feet, of red sandstone and conglomerate, the whole of which are
grouped by Hoffmann under the one term of rothe-todte liegende. It
is shown, on the contrary, that, however well this classification may
apply to a small part of Germany, it is by no means the rule in the
N.E. part of Bavaria, in Bohemia, and Westphalia; in                    which                     all   of
countries there are successions         the carboniferous series, very simi

view      Professor Sedgwick which restricts the name

    Mineral Conchology—Belemnites, 12 species, Scaphites, Nautili and
    numerous other univalves as well as bivalves common to the English
    lias. Some of the higher beds are described as containing Trochi,

    is likewise stated to be of common occurrence, and that a species of
    Fungia, a genus of corals hitherto unobserved in the lias of England,
    also occurs.
       Inferior Oolite.—The inferior oolite of Germany is next described, as
    being quite analogous to that of the Hebrides and the coast of York
    shire, viz., a great arenaceous formation, for the most part highly fer
    ruginous.    It contains many characteristic British fossils, and uni
    formly caps the lias throughout Wirtemberg, Bavaria, Hanover and
    Westphalia, and in some parts (near Banz and in Franconia) it
    passes up into an iron-shot, true oolite (Oolitischer eisen-stein of
    Münster).

    confounded with the lias grits, from which they are clearly distin
    guished both by fossils and superposition.

within a certain limited district, between Kehlheim on the S.E. and
Pappenheim on the N.W., to pass upwards into a slaty, compact
limestone, which is exposed in plateaux overlying dolomitic Jura
kalk on both banks of the river Altmühl, but is of sufficiently
fine texture, in only a few quarries near Solenhofen, to be worked as
lithographic stone *. The quarries are then described, and their
fossil contents, as collected by the author or observed by him in the
collections of Count Münster and others, are enumerated.             Seeing
the    prevalence   of  Pterodactyli, Insects,  Crustaceae, and  Tellinites,
 and knowing that these fossils, together with certain plants, are
 also found in the Stonesfield slate of England, and further that these
slaty beds at Solenhofen immediately surmount limestones, which
 by their contents are found to be the equivalents of the middle and      in
 ferior oolites of England on which the Stonesfield slate also rests—he
 is led to consider it probable that the Solenhofen and Stonesfield
 slates are of similar age; an opinion which he believes has been re          º
 cently expressed by Dr. Boué.
     The whole of this slaty group of Solenhofen, &c. is seen near the
 mouth of the Altmühl to thin out between masses of dolomite ; the
 whole being surmounted by green-sand and cretaceous deposits.
      The author inclines to the opinion that the higher members of the
 oolitic groups of England, viz. Coral Rag, Portland Stone, &c., have
 not yet been defined in any part of central Germany, though they
 may exist in Hanover; and he is unable to say whether the limestone
 of Nattheim, Heidenheim, &c., so abundant in corals, is referrible to
  the upper part of the great oolite or to the coral-rag.
      Green Sand.—It is remarked that wherever this formation shows
  itself in Germany, it is nearly always divisible, as in England, into
  lower or siliceous sandstone, and upper or cretaceous sandstone;
  the former known in certain districts as the quader sandstein, the
  latter as the plâner kalk. Numerous sections exhibiting these two
  formations are given in various parts of southern Hanover and the
  northern flank of the Hartz, where the lower sandstone is sometimes
  an highly ferruginous rock, at others a white sandstone, in which
  character it ranges from the northern flank of the Hartz into Saxony
   and Bohemia. In Westphalia the green-sand series is said to ap
   proach still closer to the mineral type of the English group, and sºc
   tions are described near Bidofeld, Soest Weil, &c. in which not only
   an upper and a lower green-sand with many characteristic fossils are
   described, but also traces of a separating stratum of blue marl or gault.
       Chalk.—The author states that the chalk is quite as clearly sepa
   rated from the plâner kalk in Hanover, as the chalk of the South
   Downs is from the malm rock or upper green-sand in Western Sussex.
   He remarks that on the northern flank of the Hartz, Professor Sedg         :
   wick and himself observed it to be quite vertical, whilst the under
   lying green-sands were by great faults thrown up into unconformable
   juxtaposition; and he further refers to a memoir recently read by
    himself, in which the chalk with flints is stated to occur in southern
     .* For a specific account of this range, see Von Buch's Letter to Brong
   niart, 1823.

    mountains; and he points out as a necessary inference arising there
    from, that the Hartz and Böhmerwald-Gebirge have been elevated
    at distinct periods.
        Tertiary Formations—Those           peculiar transition-tertiary forma
    tions described by Professor Sedgwick and the author at Gosau, and
    in the Austrian Alps, are stated to have been not as yet discovered in
    central Germany, but only along certain points encompassing                  such                                     it,

     In this paper Mr. Baily has entered into the merits                  this cele                of

 when       commenced his astronomical career, the transit instrument
           he
 was but little known, and not fully appreciated; and although                   had                      it
 been introduced into the observatory                   Roëmer, yet        by
                                                                          was soon                 it

 The instrument used for this purpose was 3-feet quadrant: and         on                                      he
 usually took about                  14   or

 them with      Lyrae

 ascertained         by
                    frequent comparisons with the sun), and thus computed
 their  right ascensions relatively        those stars. The declinations were

                         himself, and the trifling discrepancies noted and
 allowed for.
    By the help        these instruments, Lacaille determined the positions

    When Lacaille had finished his observations and his catalogue,                                                                  he

income would not warrant the expense. He tried several modes                                                                        of

tions and     distances,         I
                            always derange the former measurement so
completely, that the situation of the wire could not by possibility be
taken for a measure. Thus, each individual measure is not a previous
one, altered and amended, but is entirely new and independent.
  “It    will be seen that the above observations corroborate the pre
sumed motion of the star C in direction, and indicate a considerable
acceleration in it since 1825, compared with the mean velocity during
the previous forty-two years; while the distance continues very nearly
the same as it was at that date. Compared with Sir J. South's ob
servations, the change of angle amounts to 7° 38' in six years, or
1°,267 per annum; while, previously, the mean motion was supposed
to be only 0°,5813.       But in the observations appended to the mea
sures by Messrs. Herschel and South, in 1822, we were forewarned
to expect an acceleration, if the motion were orbitual. My observa
tions of the star C, however, being made on one night only, may be
liable to an error of one or two degrees, especially as the position of
the star B, and           its
                       extreme proximity                to   A,

Cuv.; Zanclus, Cuv. & Val.; Holacanthus, Lacép.; and Platar,
Cuv.: the Heniochus being the species recently described by
MM. Cuvier and Valenciennes as the Hen. monoceros. In this
individual the spine in front of each orbit is strong, almost equalling.

   Mr. Gray added that the three figures of birds of this genus which
were published by Buffon, and which had of late years been re
garded by M. Temminck and by M. Cuvier as representing

states of but one species, were none of them sufficiently correct in
the details to enable him to refer either of the present species to the
representations given in the ‘Planches Enluminées;' but that

the first species exhibited by him.    He had not, however, obtained
this bird from the Cape of Good Hope,          his

under the skin, and soon detected a small opening that conducted
the air to the pouch, which was readily inflated by blowing through
the opening, and so long as it was shut the pouch continued dis
tended.       That this opening was not artificial,—the effect of the
rupture of the fine membrane lining the air-bladder,                         was evident
from    its   not opening directly into

into the     pouch     appears     proved     from the fact that after detaching

    Mr. Owen, having examined the body            this hybrid animal after     of
 its death, reported that                  its

in this bird the fold of skin terminates an inch below the opening
of the ear, while in the Sociable Vulture it passes upwards and sur
rounds the upper part of the ear; and that the breast-feathers of
the Pondichery Vulture are short and rounded, while those of the
Sociable Vulture are very long and somewhat sabre-shaped.
    Mr. Gray stated, that since M. Ruppel's Monograph was written,
he had apprised that scientific traveller, in answer to his previous
inquiries on the subject, that a specimen of another vulture rejected
by him as a doubtful species (the Vultur Angolensis, Lath.) exists
in the British Museum, to which it was presented on the return of
the unfortunate expedition up the river Congo.

the vasti and cruraeus are much weaker and thinner, and are evi
dently little adapted to support the thigh and trunk upon the tibia.
    The psoas magnus and iliacus internus are, on account of the form
of the pelvis, proportionally longer muscles than in man. Beneath
them exists a small distinct muscle passing from the fore part of the
ilium, over and attached to the capsule of the hip-joint, to be inserted
into the root of the trochanter minor. This muscle is not found in the
Chimpanzee.       The pectineus is a narrower muscle than in man, and
gives off, in the Chimpanzee, a small slip, which is continued under
the femoral vessels and outwards to the origin of the sartorius. The
gracilis is a very powerful muscle in the Orang, but is comparatively
of less bulk in the Chimpanzee, in which it is inserted beneath the
sartorius. On this muscle being removed, a number of others appear
passing from the pelvis to the inner part of the thigh, among which
it is difficult to select those which are precisely analogous to the
 muscles in the corresponding region of the human subject.                        Mr.
 Owen, however, distinguished the adductor longus ; an accessory
adductor arising from the upper part of the symphysis pubis; the
 adductor brevis; and the adductor magnus.

the second toe; it also gives rise to a lumbricalis, which is inserted

    The extensor brevis digitorum pedis arises from the os calcis, and
 divides into three portions; the strongest of which gives two ten
 dons to the second toe, one being inserted at the base of the proximal
   halana, the other expanding over the second and distal phalanges
  ike the tendons of the extensor longus. The remaining portions go
 to the fibular aspect of the third and fourth toes.
    The peroneus longus and brevis arise together from the outer, fore,
 and back part of the fibula; on the latter aspect they are in con
 nection with the flexor longus pollicis.  The tendon of the peroneus
 brevis is inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little
 toe. The tendon of the peroneus longus passes under the cuboid
 bone, without the interposition of a sesamoid bone, crosses the foot,
 and is implanted into the metatarsal bone of the thumb of the
 hinder hand, of which, as far as the structure of the articulation
 will permit, it is a flexor. There is no peroneus tertius.
     The thumb is very short, consisting, in the female at least,
 of only two bones, set on at right angles to the foot, and at a
 great distance from the toes. In this part, however, the power of
 a considerable muscular apparatus is concentrated.                Receiving no
 tendon from the flexor longus pollicis, it is rendered more inde
 pendent in        its

     Mr. Owen concluded his observations with some remarks on the

   In the hip-joint the most remarkable circumstance      the freedom                   is
 ofmotion      the rotation inwards; this
                  in                          however, more limitedis,
than   inthe opposite direction.    The motions      flexion and ex            of
tension, abduction and adduction, are also very free. On examining
the cause       of
              the limitation   the inward rotation, he found
                                          of                        be                               it   to

astrong band of ligamentous fibres arising from the posterior margin
of the cotyloid cavity, and passing along the back part of the cap
sule to the root of the great trochanter; when this was divided the
rotation inwards was as free and extensive as happens in other cases
after a division of the ligamentum teres.    The synovial membrane is
reflected over a greater part of the anterior and upper than of the
back and under part of the cervir femoris. The marginal ligament
of the articular cavity is four lines in depth, a remarkable thickness
for the size of the cavity. The blood-vessels enter the joint by the
 usual notch, and supply abundantly the process of synovial and
 adipose substance called the gland of Havers.
   The motion at the knee-joint is sufficiently free to allow the heel
 to be brought to the buttock, and even beyond, as in natural
flexion it is carried external to the thigh. The only circumstances
 remarkable in the structure of the joint are, that the internal lateral
ligament is longer, and the ligamentum mucosum stronger and of a
more ligamentous nature, than in the human subject.
   The motion at the ankle-joint is so free, that the dorsum of the
foot can be brought into apposition with the fore-part of the leg;
and it is worthy of remark, that when this motion is produced, the
effect on the tendons passing behind the ankle-joint is such, as to
cause a flexion of the toes similar to that which is produced in
perching birds by bending the tarsus upon the leg. In the opposite
direction the foot may be brought so far back as to form a right
angle with the leg. Lateral motion is also very free, especially the
turning of the sole inwards, to which aspect it naturally inclines.
A certain degree of motion is allowed between the first and second
set of tarsal bones. The ligaments of the ankle-joint are disposed
as in the human subject, one at the inner and three at the outer side.
   The ligaments that connect the metatarsal bone of the thumb to
the internal cuneiform bone, are two in number, one at the upper
and the other at the lower or plantar aspect; these limit the motions
of flexion and extension, but allow very freely abduction and ad
duction. From this circumstance when the peroneus longus acts on
the foot in turning the sole outwards,          its
                                            tendency     bend the me

Account            AFRIAL VOYAGE MADE IN A BALLoon on
                  OF AN
     SATURDAY. THE 30TH OF APRIL 1831, BY T. FortsTER, M.B.
     F.L.S. &c.
    Saturday, April 30, 1831, Dr. Forster, who had long been
OSdesirous of pursuing his observations on the clouds in the loft
regions   of the air, engaged to ascend with Mr. Green's balloon;
and at half-past five o'clock in the evening, the air being calm and
fine, and the barometer standing at 29-29, thermometer 63°, wind
variable and gentle, the aéronauts proceeded to the gardens of the
Dominican Friars at Moulsham near Chelmsford, and at a quarter
before six they left the ground, amidst the huzzas of hundreds of
spectators.    The balloon, which was forty eight feet in vertical and
thirty two in horizontal diameter, and filled with carburetted hy
drogen from the gas-works, rose at first with a gentle motion, and
was carried by a mild easterly breeze over the village of Writtle.
At the elevation of about a thousand feet they hung out the anchor,
which is found to give additional steadiness to the car; in a few
minutes more they perceived the balloon checked in              its
                                                              velocity,
and      change
         a            current was evident; by this current they were
                        of
carried nearly back again, the balloon still ascending and pro
ceeding, though very slowly,        inremarkably gentle S.W. current:
                                      a
when they had got beyond the N.E. end                of
                                                     Chelmsford, and
at  the elevation       of
                    probably   about four thousand feet, when nearly
over the Convent        New Hall, the current again changed; they
                             of
threw out some more ballast, and the balloon began          mount ra
                                                               to

 scarcely perceived to move; till at length, at the altitude of nearly
 six thousand feet, it became perfectly motionless, and so remained
 for almost a quarter of an hour. Dr. Forster describes the sensation,
 at this period, to be most delightful;-balanced in the air, under
 a floating and inflated bag, in a perfectly calm and tranquil region,
 among the grotesque forms of evaporating clouds, and viewing in
 delicious tranquillity a vast and apparently concave panorama of
wcountry, bounded on one side by the sea, and everywhere inter
 spersed with towns and villages, and the yellow and varied tint of
 the fields, the aërial travellers, enjoyed a temporary repose from
 the noise and bustle of the world, which is seldom felt on the sur
 face of the earth.     More ballast being thrown out, the balloon
 again rose, and Dr. Forster now felt a disagreeable sensation, like
 pressure on the tympanum of the ears, just like what Garnerin,
 MM. Charles and Roberts, and others have described; in conse
 quence of which he determined to open the valve, and they rapidly
 descended again into an inferior current, which carried them to
 Broomfield, where they eventually landed at twenty minutes before
 seven o'clock.
    During, and subsequently to this aérial voyage, Dr. Forster made
 and recorded the following observations:
    1st. That the balloon, when rising gently, gyrated in the same di
 rection as the earth and planets do in their diurnal rotatory motion,
 that is from right to left: this motion was however so gentle, that
it was only to be ascertained by observing objects below; in coming
 down the balloon oscillated in the same direction.
   2ndly. The currents of air which they successively met with in
ascending, came down during the next day in the same order
 of succession: the S.W. wind for example, into which they got,
came down first on the following morning, and brought the rain.
From repeated experiments, Dr. Forster has reason to believe this
to be the case with most of the upper currents of air.
    3rdly. The wavy cirrocumulus clouds are far beyond the reach
of       all
        balloons, and even when the clouds are seen from the greatest
altitudes they seem      much above the ordinary clouds
                                     as                             they                    as        do
 above the earth.

change of weather, when the barometer rises or falls rapidly. One
remarkable observation which Dr. Forster made, was, that on the
occasion of descents from mountains, the deafness felt has always
been accompanied by a sense of fullness about the ears; but this
very unpleasant accompaniment of the difficulty of hearing was not
felt after the descent from the balloon; the deafness in the latter case
being simply dullness of hearing.      In both cases it soon goes off.
The sensation which is     experienced  when up in the higher regions
of the air is not     actually deafness, but a snapping in the ears;
which    goes  off as one  begins to descend;  and the deafness which
comes on in descending still lower, and which is worse on arriving
at the ground, seems to be a sort of counterpart to the sensation ex
perienced aloft. This very curious subject deserves
                                               -        further investi
gation.
  With respect to giddiness and the fear of any danger from the
sudden falling of the balloon, Dr.Forster observes, that having been
accustomed to mount to very great altitudes, he felt neither of
these disagreeable annoyances; but observed that on looking directly
down, at the grapple hanging below, and on the ground beneath,
he felt a disagreeable sensation, scarcely amounting to vertigo; but
such as would have become so in persons not accustomed to great
heights; and he therefore recommends aérial travellers to keep
their eyes on the horizon rather than the ground directly below
them, particularly if the car be large enough to admit of the choice.
    The basket in which Dr. Forster ascended was a small one con
 structed for the purpose of lightness; but he is constructing a light
 circular willow basket capable of holding a proper set of instru
 ments, in order to be ready, should a                         fit
                                             opportunity for another

   76        Meteorological Summary        for 1830.-Hampshire.
        BARoMETRICAL PREssure.—The mean pressure this year is
   ,  , , of an inch higher than the mean of the last fifteen years; but
   the number of changes is less than in any year in that period.
        On the 19th of January a depression of 1:05 inch of mercury
   occurred, with a strong wind, first from South-east, and then from
   the North-east, accompanied with a heavy fall of snow.
        The mean of the pressures at 8, 2 and 8 o'clock coincides with
   the annual mean pressure.
       TEMPERATURE.—The mean temperature of the external air this
   year is lower than that of any year since 1816. The mean tem
   perature of January and the first part of February was very low,
   and we "<U+017F>ave never registered so low a degree of temperature as
   that which occurred in the night of the 2nd of February.               There
   is a difference of half a degree between the annual mean tempera
   ture at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M., the latter being the highest.                 The
   annual mean temperature of spring-water this year is the lowest
   during the last ten years.
        WINDs.—The duration of the South-west wind this year is un
   precedented, being more than one-fourth of the period; the wind
  from the West is the next in duration ; but that from the South
   has prevailed the least number of days.
       The North-east and South-east winds are equal in point of time.
       The number of strong gales of wind, or days on which they have
   prevailed this year, is as in the following scale:
             N.     N.E.      E. S.E.   S.    S.W.   W.     N.W.   Gales.

      January was very cold and cloudy, with frequent falls of snow;
  it  having  snowed more or less on fifteen days.
       February was rather dry and mostly frosty, with a cloudy atmo
  sphere, and occasional gales of wind.            The minimum temperature
  in the night of the 2nd was the lowest that had occurred the last
  fifteen years.
      March was fine, calm, and very dry, and a high pressure               pre
  vailed the latter part of the month, when the spring began to open.
       April commenced with a snow-storm for several hours, and was
  alternately fine and showery, with frequent strong gales.               In the
  night of the 4th the frost was severe, and did much injury to the
  bloom of the trees in open situations.          Vegetation was checked the
  first part of the period by the cold nights and hoar frosts; but
  the warm rains, followed by clear sunny days during the latter part,
  caused a rapid growth.
       May was dry and pleasant, with much warm sunshine till the
  20th,
           when the air became arid and blighty, and the roads very
  dusty, insomuch that vegetation began to droop.               The latter part
  of the month was          showery, accompanied    with  strong   gales.
       June was cold, showery and windy. The crops of grass, from
  the nature of the weather in the spring, were generally abundant;

but from a continuance of wet, much of the early cut grass was
spoilt before it could be put in ricks sufficiently dry.
    July was also cold, showery, and windy till the 12th; but the
latter part of the month was fine and dry, with four or five hot
 days and nights, which matured the wheat.
    August was fine and dry till the 8th, during which time much
exertion was made by the agriculturists in securing the wheat
 crops.      The remainder of the month was showery and windy; and
 as scarcely any good opportunity occurred to get in the wheat in
 a dry state, much was lost out of the standing sheaves in the fields
 before it could be carried.                                                       *
     September was wet and windy, which occasioned d" culties in
 ge . g in the barley and oat crops, both of which were abundant,
 and far superior in quality to those of several years past. The fruit
 crops were also abundant, but they were generally deficient in na
 tural flavour, and mostly worm-eaten.
     October was very dry, calm, and fine, with a high atmospheric
 pressure.
    November was boisterous and wet, which caused floods in many
 places; but the air was mild for the season, with the exception of
 a few days.
     December was also wet and windy, and after the 10th, cold and
 frosty, with snow at intervals, and a low pressure.
     The frequency of aurorae boreales in the autumn was remarkable:
 fair descriptions of their appearances may be seen under the monthly
 meteorological reports in this work.

   General Observations.—This month has been alternately wet and dry;
the dry period was from the 5th to the 19th, during which time no rain
fell here, and the air was frequently arid with a North-east wind, accom
panied with a great evaporation.
   For several days upwards of three-tenths of an inch evaporated, and on
the 18th, the day before the rain came on, half an inch in depth ascended
from the evaporator, which clearly indicates the greater power of the air
in eliciting heat, and carrying off so much moisture from near the surface
of the earth immediately before the change from dryness to rain, and
which was verified by the hygrometer's, then pointing out the maximum
dryness for the month.
   There were several hoar frosts in the first part of the month, when great
blights prevailed, and their effects have since been made manifest by the
trees being much thinned of their fruit. Comparatively speaking there
were but a few warm days this month, and the mean temperature of the
external air is about one degree under the mean of May for many years past.
   On the 5th, at three P.M. a heavy flash of lightning was experienced
here, and was succeeded by a loud clap of thunder; distant thunder also
frequently occurred in the morning of the 24th.
   At half-past ten o’clock in the night of the 30th, a few light corusca
tions ascended due North from an aurora borealis, which was low in the
Northern horizon, and two meteors fell over          This may

   The planet Mercury was seen here with the naked eye in the fine even
ings, from the 1st to the 13th; and Venus was seen at moon of the 16th,
notwithstanding she is still in the superior part of her orbit.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one solar and two lunar halos, two meteors,
one rainbow, one aurora borealis, lightning and thunder on the 5th, distant
thunder on the 24th, and four gales of wind, namely, two from the North
east, and two from the East.

   1. Sector levels.-The sector was placed upon the pillar
in the shade, weighted, and the bubble of the cross level brought
to   its

of the air, (noted              by

in  one column A. With the nut of the inder the latter was
 moved until the bubble had run nearly             the object-end       to                                of

in   seconds          of   one division of the scale.                        This value we can
confirm         by   the arc first read off and the difference   the two                  of

   The experiments on levels differently mounted (given in Phil.

Fortin's level-tube, which might be sufficient, when resting

zontal in the transverse direction, and in making the proof
level parallel to the cylinder; both sources of error tending
to give a measurement in defect.        In some instances it was
attempted to place the proof-level parallel in direction to the
cylinder, by bringing the middle of each end of the former to
the highest point of the adjoining shoulder of the latter; the
bar being prevented from toppling by a delicate wedge of
mahogany gradually introduced between the sides and the arc
until the cross-level of the frame arrived at its mark. When
 the proof-level was placed in contact with both arcs (which
was more frequently the case), the deviation from parallelism
with the cylinder could not possibly amount to a tenth of a
 degree, a quantity too small to be sensible in        effect    the         its              on

 with the plates reduced, and the results          those made pre       of
 viously were, for the reason assigned, too discordant                                        to    be

   It is a good verification of the measurements to find the
reversing points of the proof-level the same on the cylinder
as on a plane made as nearly horizontal in every sense as pos
sible.   But it is to be remarked that unless the plates of the
proof-level are true planes, the reversing point may not be
the same on the cylinder as on the plane.     For want of a per
fect plane this satisfactory confirmation could not be obtained;
but the reversing points with the proof-level on the cylinder,
as may be seen from the statement below, agreed within the
fraction of a second of their mean value.

IX.        Notes on some recent Improvements                             of      the Steam-Engines
    in Cornwall.                By    W. Jory         HENwood, F.G.S. Member of

            To Richard Taylor, Esq. F.S.A. F.L.S. &c.
        Dear Sir,
THE   same excuse which was offered by Mr. Farey for his
  long silence on the subject of my paper* may, perhaps,
now serve for mine on that of hist.       shall not attempt a           I
regular discussion of his papers, as the digressions and the
many objects they embrace, would, I fear, be unsuitable to
your pages, and tiresome to your readers. I purpose confining
myself to the various alterations and improvements which
have been made in this county since Messrs. Boulton and
Watt, and their agents, ceased to superintend the steam
engines on our mines; with the addition of a few incidental
observations on some of Mr. Farey's statements.
   In my former communication to you on this subject, I said
that “ variation in the elasticity of the steam employed by
no means affects the invention [my views would have been
                                                          I
more correctly expressed, had said the merit or principle of
the invention] of expansive working;” and, notwithstanding
Mr. Farey's indignant attempts, he has advanced nothing
which bears the semblance of proof of the contrary.
   Mr. Farey saysf, Mr. Watt “proposed in 1782 to work
his engines by stopping the supply of steam when the piston
had only moved one-fourth of          course.” Will that gentleman
                                                     its
particularize the engines          this county which now expand
                                                in
more than three-fourths of their stroke?          “Mr. Watt’s en
gines with such boilers” (which will not retain steam            more                               of
than       3%
         pounds per square inch above the atmosphere) “can
        be        exert competent power
                           to                     drain deep mines,
not     made                                                                 is to

Jeffery and Gribble's engine at Stray Park performed the best
duty, being the first that reached 35 millions, and maintain
ing for twelve months an average rate of 32 millions. Woolf’s
engine at Wheal Abraham was first reported in October in this
year, and performed 34 millions. Number of engines reported,
29 ; average duty, 20,534,232.”     In the early part of 1816,
a single engine of 76-inch cylinder was erected at Dolcoath
mine by Messrs. Jeffree and Gribble (see preceding note), in
place of an old and defective double one; which accounts for
the diminished consumption of coal which the extract from Mr.
Taylor's notice of Dolcoath exhibits. In the same year Mr.
Woolf replaced an old engine of 63-inch cylinder, but which
had for a short time previously been worked by higher steam
than usual, with one of 66-inch cylinder at Huel Abraham:
the latter, if I am not mistaken, was set to work about the
12th of November.
    Ibelieve I have now satisfactorily shown that Mr. Woolf,
instead of being the first to introduce the expansive action of
steam in one cylinder, was positively preceded several years
by Capt. Trevithick, and probably so, a short time, by Messrs.
Jeffree and Gribble. Mr. Farey says, “He” (Mr. Woolf)
“altered another old engine at Wheal Unity, by adding a
small cylinder to           it;
                        the performance was improved         about            in

the Huel Unity engine did not answer expectation, and the

Mr. Woolf’s patent expired,           of the old Boulton and
                                                       most
Watt's engines in Cornwall were altered to work by high
pressure steam on his system: some few had an extra cylinder
added.” Instead of the pressure of steam in general use being
raised at that period,                 I
                          assert no such alteration took place
in a more marked     degree,  then, than had before obtained;
and the alteration which at all took place was not in conse
quence of Mr. Woolf’s assertions or performances, but of those
of Capt.Trevithick. Will Mr. Farey name an engine to which
a cylinder was added (that it might be worked on what he calls
Mr. Woolf’s system) after the expiration of that patent? He
proceeds +, “The advantage of the change from low-pressure
to high-pressure steam, on Mr. Woolf’s system, was manifest
in    all
      cases; but    was greater
                             it     less, according    or

was used stronger and with more           less expansive action.”or

X.      On Chemical Symbols and Notation; in Reply to Pro
    fessor WHEwell.        By Mr. John PRIDEAUx, Member of
    the  Plymouth Institution.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
      Gentlemen,
    the last Number (May 1831) of the Journal of the Royal
INInstitution, is an article by Professor Whewell, “On the
employment of Notation in Chemistry;” going to show the
advantages of using symbols in that science; and to remove
anomalies in the foreign notation, by reducing it to mathema
tical consistency and symmetry.        } concur with all that is
therein stated of the practical convenience and utility of such
symbols, and      Iam glad to see Professor Whewell's eminent
name enlisted in their advocacy. They constitute a prompt,
impressive and peculiarly legible short-hand; expressing in a
few letters and dots what would occupy several lines of writing,
and what no writing will give with the same distinctness,
a great point in a science of which the materials and modifi
cations are so numerous and so complex.          In experimental
notes   they are of  great service, placing constantly  before our
eyes the entire analysis of every material employed; and for
the same reason, as well as on account of their compactness,
are aptly suited for comparison and tabular classification. But
I  am not yet convinced that it is desirable to sacrifice this
graphic simplicity, in order to convert them into an algebraic
notation; to which, when requisite, they are easily accommo
dated. Such of your readers as feel interested in this question,
and have not seen Professor Whewell's paper, would do well
to read it before proceeding with this.
   The chemical symbols of Berzelius were contrived “pour
faciliter l'expression des proportions chimiques, et de nous
mettre en état d’enoncer brièvement et avec facilité le nombre
d’atómes élémentaires qui se trouve dans chaque corps com
posé.” To this purpose they seem happily fitted; exhibiting,
in signs no less natural than compact, the entire constitution
of the substance through        all
                                the grades            of
                                              analysis.
   Thus    anatom     of
                      potassium,    (kalium

                                            K,   forms potash;    an   atom   of
nitrogen   N,                                    N,   forms nitric acid, and
                with five atoms oxygen
KN    forms nitrate    of
                      potash.
    In this concise symbol        we
                               see the acid and alkali, and the
elementary composition      of
                            each: the bases expressed     their        in

atoms placed over the symbol.

of alumina, sulphuret of iron, arseniuret of cobalt, &c., we
should employ a single letter for each, unless their decompo
 sition were concerned in the research. In short, however
contrived, they must be variable and varied, as in other sci
ences, for algebraic adaptation; and they would be analytical
so far only, as decomposition is connected with the calculation,
as will be exemplified below.
    Although juxta-position implies multiplication in algebra,
the signification is arbitrary; and in another science, equally
mathematical, with elements susceptible of every mathematical
   ower, we can so place them without fear of understanding
 CLV as Cºx L x V, or 534 as 5 × 3 × 4. This position implies

the symbols are severally constructed for the occasion, free
from the restrictions of any rule of intelligibility; lime, com
posed of an atom of calcium and one of oxygen, being signified
by L; whilst oxide of silver, also of an atom of each ingre
dient, is made (s -- O): sulphuric acid, one atom sulphur and
three oxygen, is (S + 3 O); whilst nitric acid, of five atoms
oxygen to one nitrogen, is only N. The chemistry is in fact
sunk in the mathematics, simple as they are; and the scheme,
without the text, is totally unintelligible.
  Berzelius would express it thus:                     AgN         with            Ca Sº

Ca being lime; Ag, oxide of silver; Sº, two atoms hyposul

being not in question) in the symbols, as well as the proxi

form must be affected by the state of the combination; and
arbitrary or hypothetical statements may impede our attain
ment of correct views on a subject of prime importance in
mineralogy.

                of reducing them
much more generally applicable to mathematical use; far less
so to that of temporary record and tabular comparison in

                                                  Thulite.
  In a list of minerals which I published in 1823, as an Ap
pendix to an elementary work on Crystallography, I described
this mineral as having a cleavage parallel to the planes of a
rhombic prism of 92° 30', which description was given on the
authority of some fragments of a reddish mineral received by
Mr. Heuland, from Sweden, under the name of Thulite.      since                 I
find that the mineral                   I
                         then measured was Bisilicate of man
ganese.         I
            have lately obtained and measured the true Thulite,
and have found it agree in                             its
                                  cleavages and angular mea

                               had been before found

or  not             do
               not know.     have lately obtained specimens                           of

Phillipsite are one and the same mineral.
                   Velvet Copper Ore of Werner.
   On dissolving this mineral in dilute nitric acid, a skeleton
remains which is insoluble in any acid; and when the very
minute portion I had to examine was placed on charcoal before
the blowpipe with a drop of nitrate of cobalt, it ultimately be
came black; whence I concluded it to be silica. The part dis
solved in the dilute acid contained sulphuric acid, copper and
zinc.
                           Native Nickel,
so called, although    a sulphuret.     I have measured the fibres
of this substance,  and find them   regular  hexagonal prisms with
apparent cleavages oblique to the axis, but the cleavage planes
are too imperfect for accurate measurement.
                             Poonahlite.
   I   am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Heuland for some
specimens of a beautiful variety of apophyllite from Poonah,
in the East Indies, accompanied by some slender crystals,
which    I  at first supposed were mesotype or needle-stone,
but which differ from both substances in measurement; the
Poonahlite being a rhombic prism of 92°20'. The crystals
traverse the mass of the apophyllite and matrix instead of
forming groups in the cavities; and among several hundred
                 I
crystals which have examined on my own and on Mr. Heu
                            I
land's larger specimens, have not observed one with a na
tural termination.     The hardness is nearly the same as that
of needle-stone, as far as I can discover from an experiment
on very small crystals.
                              Glaucolite.
   This mineral has a cleavage parallel to the planes of          a
rhombic prism of 143° 30' nearly.
                             Couzeranite.
   This is described in Leonhard's Handbuch, as a right rect
angular prism, and by Dufresnoy in the Ann. de Chim. et de
Phys. xxxviii. p. 280, as an oblique rhombic prism; and it would
appear from the analysis of the latter to be a distinct species
of mineral. Mr. Heuland has lately supplied me with a spe
cimen containing this substance in small imbedded crystals;
                             I
on examination of which find that it has the form, cleavage,
and angular measurements offelspar. The crystals are small,
and the matrix in which they are imbedded is partly white
and partly black.     Those in the white part are colourless and
     -                                                translucent;

j
and probably coloured by the same kind of matter as colours
the matrix. Hence the analysis of the black crystals, which
are the only ones yet analysed, must fail to give the true con
stituents of the mineral, and the theoretical chemical formula
must be incorrect.     The crystals are similar in form to the

Pseudomorphous Crystals from a Mine at Haytor, in Devonshire.
    Inthe year 1827 some crystals were found in this mine,
which were described by Mr.W. Phillips and Mr. Levy, under
the name of Haytorite". It was obvious that the substance of
the crystals was calcedony; and as they nearly agreed in form
and angular measurement with Humboldtite, it was supposed
they might have derived their pseudomorphous character
from crystals of that substance, although from the solidity and
state of aggregation of some of the crystals which were first
              it was difficult to imagine the mode by which the
borrowed forms could have been produced.              It    however,                is,
equally difficult    tocomprehend the manner         which the well     in
known pseudomorphous crystals                         of
                                          steatite, imbedded       the                         in
same substance, could have been produced.              These present
the forms      ofquartz and             of
                                  carbonate     lime, and they con
                                                            of
sist ofsteatite   apparently  homogeneous    with the mass     which                      in
they are imbedded.        We might indeed suppose that cavity                             a
partly occupied by crystals           quartz and carbonate
                                             of                  lime                       of
had been filled     by  steatite; that  subsequently  the quartz  and
carbonate       lime had disappeared and left moulds which were
               of
afterwards filled     by
                       the same kind                  of
                                          steatite. But      not easy

SURPAss THE BEAUTY of THE FIELD of THIs MicroscoPE,
though his firm conviction that this instrument ought not to be
good has so far warped his judgement as to make him assert,
that “nothing more can be made to grow in it [the field] than
in that of any ordinary compound microscope having a well
figured object-glass of the same power, and angular aperture,
used with an Huygenian eye-piece, also of equal power with
that applied to the instrument in question.”
   Several persons have, to my knowledge, compared my                               in
strument, which be it remembered costs but six guineas
and a half, with “ordinary compound microscopes” made by
the first opticians, for which they had paid twenty or thirty
guineas, and have declared it decidedly superior in every re
spect.    If the Doctor means that it is not so perfect as a com
pound microscope with an achromatic object-glass, I agree with
him most cordially.        Neither is a twenty-guinea telescope,

                        Sirth Class of Experiments.
      88. Experiments with irregular Masses                 of Antimony.
THE    object of these experiments was
  if the same laws of thermo-magnetic
                                                          that of ascertaining
                                              action, as regards
the crystalline arrangement of the metal and point of heat, as
those which were developed in the experiments with cylinders
and cones of antimony could be traced in masses of an irre
gular figure, by making the point of heat in various parts of
those fine smooth extensive faces of crystalline laminae which
are to be met with only in fractures of large masses which
have been very gradually cooled from fusion.
   89. The experiments were made by heating, separately,
particular points in those lamellated faces, and then tracing
the direction of the electric currents by expeditiously apply
ing the antimony to a magnetic needle, and noting minutely
the character of the deflection; and it appears, from the uni
formity of the results of a considerable number of experi
ments on various pieces, that the thermo-magnetic phaeno
mena elicited in irregular masses have precisely the same re
lation to the position of the metallic films and point of heat
as those displayed by cylinders and other regular forms of
antimony.
   90. It will not be necessary to enter into a detailed account
of the several experiments which were instituted for this                  in
 quiry, as a description of those which were made on one of
the irregular pieces, and of the resulting phaenomena, will be
sufficient to illustrate the whole.                  I
                                         And have every reason to
believe, that the same laws which govern these phaenomena,
will be found to appertain to           all
                                         similar crystalline arrange
ments   of  antimony;     that  they   will uniformly       developed
                                                                be
under similar circumstances, and consequently that they are
intimately related       the crystallization         of
                                                 the metal.

were made, weighed about three         pounds;     was separated

                                                     of

 the directions of the electric currents as indicated by the de
 flections of the magnetic needle, when the point of heat was
 near to the angles a, b, c, respectively.
    92. When the spirit-lamp was held for a few moments at
 the angle a, still keeping the point of the flame on the face
 of the fracture, the electric streams were diffused over every
 part of that surface from the point of heat towards the op
 posite edge; as shown by the directions of the arrows, fig. 16.
 Comparatively strong currents were detected in the edges a b,
 and a c; but in consequence of the general flow of these cur
 rents being nearly at right angles to the edge b c, no magnetic
 force could be detected when that side was held over and
 parallel to the needle.    On leaving the face a b c, the electric
 tide swept  the general  surface of the metal, flowing in various
 directions, and returning by numerous windings to the point of
 heat. By this distribution, and consequent attenuated state
 of the electric force, the thermo-magnetic energies were com
 paratively very feeble on every part of the metal excepting the
face a b c; on which alone they were displayed with prompti
 tude and regularity.                                        -
    93. When the point of heat was at b, the whole of the tri
 angular face became again magnetic, displaying phaenomena
 of precisely the same character as those which had been eli
 cited when the point a was excited; and the distribution of
the electric forces had again a decided reference to the point
of heat; emanating therefrom, and flowing with as great an
uniformity over the surface of the fracture as if it had been
a conductor from the copper to the zinc of a single galvanic
pair. The arrows in fig. 17. will indicate the distribution of
the electric force over the surface of the lamellated fracture
when the point of heat was at b.
    94.  When the fracture was      heated at c, the thermo-mag
netic phaenomena      were  again   displayed   with very nice pre
cision and    uniformity   on that   particular  face of the metal;
whilst on the other     parts  of the surface   they  were confused
and irregular; showing that the electric forces on those parts
were dispersed in various directions, and enfeebled by their
separation, or by their returning to the point of heat, through
the body or general mass of the metal.        Fig. 18. will show the
direction of the electric tide on the face a b c, when the point
c was excited by the flame of a spirit-lamp.
                            Remarks.
    95. The uniformity displayed in the results of the preced
ing class of experiments confers on them a very interesting
character in these investigations. In connexion with those on

118        Mr. W.            Sturgeon on the Thermo-Magnetism                            of
 regular masses, these experiments establish a very important
 point, by exhibiting in the most striking and satisfactory man
 ner an intimate connexion between the crystalline arrange
ment of the metal, and the distribution of the electric powers
 by heat; for, to whatever point in the flat lamellated face of
this system or group of parallel scales heat was applied, the
electric forces were directed over the planes of the laminae
from the heated point; and having traversed the general sur
face of the metal, returned to that point again, across the edges
 of the films, in precisely the same manner as in the experi
 ments with solid cones and cylinders, a circumstance highly
 demonstrative that the thermo-magnetic forces in both sets of
 experiments have the same specific origin, and are actuated
 by the same cause.        The fountain of        the phaenomena apall
 pears  to      be  the crystalline arrangement          the metal, and       of
 the direction       of in
                     the electric and magnetic forces             refer             to    be
 able to  the point      heat.of
    96.It   very often happens that fractures such           have been             as
 described (88) (91), are bordered           some            on
                                                       their sides with   of
 piles or  groups       laminae, unfavourably situated for experi

 their planes,       in
                    the face     the fracture. When, however, the
                                        of
 method     ofexperimenting      becomes known, these trifling                                        in
 conveniences are not          much consequence

to the opposite side.

certain circumstances connected with               casting.          its

 demonstrative of the connexion in that class of homogeneous
 bodies. And I am inclined to believe, that future labours in
 this curious philosophical field of research, will ultimately
 establish crystallography amongst those interesting sciences,
 which are subordinate branches, and obedient to the laws, of
 electricity.
    103. There are, however, thermo-magnetic phaenomena dis
 played by homogeneous metals, when experimented with in
 certain forms, which do not appear to be very reconcilable to
 the hypothesis of electro-crystallography. They seem to de
 pend upon some other cause than any which that hypothesis
 embraces: and as they are exhibited under different circum
 stances to any which have yet been noticed, the experiments
 by which they are elicited will require to be described as a
 distinct class.
                     Seventh Class of Experiments.
    104. Notwithstanding        the opinions which have been set
 forth to show that     thermo-magnetic      energies are not exalted
 in combinations of    metals,   by  employing   them of large dimen
 sions, and that a     pair  of   particles, however small, or wires
 exceedingly thin, will develop the same extent of power as two
 bars of considerable dimensions; I was led to imagine that
 the same law might probably not extend to the innate mag
 netism displayed in homogeneous metals by heat.                My in
 quiries were therefore directed to large masses of those metals,
 in which, whilst experimented on in small pieces, I was unable
 to discover the least trace of this extraordinary power; and
 the results were such as to answer my anticipations in the most
 ample and satisfactory manner.                                    -
    105. Experiments with large Masses of Žinc.—The first
 piece of zinc in which     I detected thermo-magnetic action was
a  rectangular   cake,  or flag,  which had neither been rolled nor
 hammered. It was about 14 inches long, 8 inches broad, and
 •75 inch thick, and weighed about 17 pounds.               This mass
of  zinc,  when heated at one corner         only, displayed   magnetic
powers in a very exalted       degree,   and would deflect a compass
needle, on which the magnetism of the earth was not neutral

     111. When one of the ends a d, fig. 20. of the rectangular
 mass is uniformly heated, the distribution of the electric
 forces will be indicated by the arrows in that figure.             Here
 again, it will be observed, that the electric forces are projected
jrom the heated end into the area of the plate, and by re
 curving sweeps, return to that end again along the parallel
 margins of the metal.        In this case, the neutral lines, and lines
 of  greatest  energy,   are parallel to each other, and also parallel
 to the sides a b, dc of the     rectangular  plane.
     112. As a similar distribution of the electric forces to that
 represented by fig. 19. is uniformly elicited by heating any
 of the angles separately, the same system of arrows will serve
 to illustrate that distribution, to whatever angle heat may be
 applied.             If,

              *:  partially heated, to a much greater angle than
any that has ever been ascribed to diurnal variation.    This re
sult, insignificant as it may appear, and far from answering my
expectations as to the extent of magnetic power developed by
the sphere, sufficiently warrants the prosecution of the inquiry.
The experiment has demonstrated the existence of the mag
netic power in a homogeneous sphere of zinc, and the deve
lopment of that power by heat.        The field of inquiry is thus
successfully penetrated, and future investigations may possibly
lead to the most interesting results.
    119. A sphere of 10 inches diameter, which is the largest
I  can at present command, is much too small for experiments
of this character. With a globe 30 or 40 inches in diameter,
experiments might be made on a magnificent scale, and I ap
prehend with the most satisfactory results.     A metallic sphere
of such   dimensions,   with the  necessary machinery for experi
ment, would require a sum, which perhaps but few indivi
duals would be found willing to lay out on an inquiry which of
is more of a national than of an individual interest. Researches
of this nature would be the most likely to be successful were
they pursued under the patronage of governments, or of
wealthy scientific associations. The experiments might then
be carried on under advantages the most favourable to insure
regularity and uniformity in the results, provided they were
conducted under the superintendance of persons who have
proved themselves competent to the task. They might also
be pursued to an extent which no individual could hope to ar
rive    at,

Both have an alimentary and a sexual apparatus; for both
grow and propagate their kind.    Both have an apparatus for
the propulsion and distribution of fluids, which they have the
capacity    of assimilating to their own substance.—But animals
have additional faculties, and the additional faculties in ques
tion have their source in additional organs; while the organs
conferred correspond to the wants of the individual.               The food
of the   plant  is  already  digested;     but the animal has         food             its               to
digest.     Hence the necessity              stomach. The plant

   The    same condition is necessary to the vegetating plant.
Grew     having   discovered, in a leaf that he was examining, a
number of little bags or bladders, filled as he thought with
air, drew the conclusion, and maintained the doctrine, that
leaves are the lungs of plants.        M. Papin, with a view to as
certain the    point  in question,   introduced into the receiver of
an air-pump an entire plant, root, stem, and leaf: the con
sequence was, that it very soon died.           He then introduced a
plant by the root and stem only, with the leaves and branches
exposed to the influence of the atmosphere: still the plant
died after a while; but it lived much longer than in the former
case, and warranted him in concluding, as he thought, that leaves
are indeed the lungs of plants". Whether this conclusion
was legitimately drawn from the premises, or not, we will not
at present stop to inquire.         Enough was done to show that
plants cannot continue to live without the access and contact
 of atmospheric air. They will not even grow with vigour
unless they have an abundant supply; as he who has the ma
 nagement of a hot-house too often discovers to his cost.          The
plant that grows where there is no free circulation of air springs
 up slender and sickly. The plant that is exposed to the action
 of the stormy blast springs up stout and robust.
    Of the truth of the same conclusion as applicable to animals,
 it will scarcely be necessary to offer any formal proof. It comes
 so completely home to every one's own experience, that he
 must be a bold man who would deny                  yet     proof were  of it;        if
 wanted,      would

exceptions are the most striking;—not in the department of
 Fishes, though their element is even the water; but in that of
the Amphibia. Live toads, snakes, and lizards have been
found imbedded in solid masses of stone, or of coal, at a great
depth below the surface, and without any possibility of the
access of air *.     They are facts occurring about as often, and
are about as well authenticated, as the sight of a mermaid.
 We cannot well refuse our assent either to the one or the
other; and yet we cannot give it without a sort of sceptical
reluctance.      Yet if the fact in question is anything different
from that of a long protracted hybernation, we are altogether
without the means of accounting for                           of it.

   Similar observations are the result of our inquiries into the
animal kingdom.      The bear is a native of the polar regions.
The elephant, lion, and tiger are indigenous only to countries
near the equator.    A forcible and sudden change of climate
would be fatal, we may believe, to either.     For although bears,
lions, and elephants are found to live in countries of which
they are not natives, it is only under the protection and fos
tering care of man. Man lives in almost            climates, but not          all
with  equal  comfort.    He can accommodate himself              cold                                to

denly exposed to a temperature that is either much lower or
much higher, they are roused indeed into life, but the expo
sure kills them. The natural and gradual increase of return
ing solar heat is that which suits them the best.—Thus the
attribute of life preserves them even in hybernation, and is
ready to give them fresh activity when the due temperature
returns.

    Sleep has been said to be the image of death.      But it is
only a transient suspension of some of the functions of life.
The exercise of function fatigues the organs, and hence they
require a period of repose.   Such is sleep, which lasts only
till the fabric is recruited. Hybernation might be said to
be the image of death also ; but it depends entirely on tem
perature. When the temperature sinks to a given degree,
hybernation begins; and when it rises again to the same degree,
the exercise of function is resumed.   But if death once super
venes,         its

plane-polarized light is incident, and the light emerging from
the interposed crystal is resolved into two streams of plane
polarized light (by the analysing plate), of which one only is
transmitted to the eye. It is known that circularly or ellipti
cally polarized light will, if incident on the crystal, form rings;
but it has not been remarked as a general theorem, that rings
will be visible if the analysing plate be so constructed as to
resolve the light emerging from the crystal into any two kinds
of light, of which it suppresses one and transmits the other to
the eye.     Now by means of Fresnel's rhomb, or (imperfectly)
by a film of mica, the analysing plate may be made to resolve
the emergent light into two circularly-polarized rays, one of
which it transmits to the eye, while the other is suppressed.
Supposing the light to be thus analysed and supposing the
incident light to be circularly polarized, theory gives this
result: the tint will depend only on the gain or loss of the
extraordinary on the ordinary ray: there will be no brushes:
the appearances will not alter as the crystal is turned about
the incident ray. These conclusions are completely supported
by experiments on uniaxal and biaxal crystals and unan
nealed glass. Iceland spar, for instance, shows rings without
brushes: nitre, &c. exhibit the lemniscates in their whole ex
tent without any interruption.

              A LETTER          was read, from Joshua Trimmer, Esq.
                    to the Rev. Dr. Buckland, V.P. G.S. “On the diluvial
deposits of Caernarvonshire, between the Snowdon chain of hills and
the Menai strait, and on the discovery of marine shells in diluvial
sand and gravel on the summit of Moel Tryfane, near Caernarvon,
 1000ft above the level of the sea.”
   The object of this paper is to point out evidences of extensive dilu
vial action in that part of Caernarvonshire which lies at and near the
N.W. base of the mountains of Snowdonia. This district is traversed
in a direction from N.E. to S.W., and nearly parallel to the mountain
chain, by two remarkable beds of roofing slate, well known by the
name of Penrhyn Slate, dipping usually to the S.E. at a considerable
angle, and extending along a series of hills of moderate elevation,
between the Snowdonian chain and the Menai strait.           Great part of
the surface of these hills, and of the still lower ground between them
and the Menai, is so covered by accumulations of drifted gravel, sand
and clay, that the slate is seldom accessible, without first    *...;OWn

Some          the older writers considered this bird                                                a
duced between the Wood Grouse and the Black                          Grouse,  and had
named      it accordingly: modern authors have, however, established
its   distinction         as   species; and the female and
                                a                                        egg are now          its

  Mr. Yarrell availed himself of the opportunity to state that the
hybrid Grouse of White's “Natural History of Selborne' is believed
to be a young black Cock, having nearly completed                              his first moult.
He added that he was indebted to Mr. Sabine for the information
that the Tetr. rupestris of Pennant's ‘Arctic Zoology' has been killed
in Perthshire, and that the specimen is preserved in the collection of
Lord Stanley, the President of the Society.
   At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Martin referred to the notes
of the dissection of a specimen of Testudo Graeca which he had laid
before the Committee on the 26th of April, and stated that the
correctness of these notes had been subsequently confirmed by the
examination of another individual of that species, in which he had
observed the same lengthened form of stomach; similar intestines;
and a caecum agreeing with that previously described.     The urinary
bladder also corresponded in form and size. The trachea bifurcated
in the same manner; and the bronchiae had the same remarkable
sigmoid flexure, and were furnished with the compressing muscle
which he had before noticed.
   Mr. Owen remarked that he had ascertained the existence of a
cacum in another species of Tortoise, (Emys concentrica, Leconte,)
which he had recently dissected.
   The preparation of the cacum of the Testudo Graeca having been
laid upon the table, it was pointed out that the part so termed in
this instance consisted of a pouch formed by the oblique insertion
of the small into the large intestine, the upper end of the latter
being dilated as in the human subject into a caecum caput coli: but
that it by no means corresponded with the caeca of birds, and might
almost be regarded as wanting when contrasted with the develope
ment of the same part in some of the Ophidian Reptiles, as in the
genera Python, Boa, &c.
   A living individual, apparently referable to the Gulo barbarus, L.,
was exhibited. It was presented to the Society by Edmonstone
Hodgkinson, Esq. of Trinidad, who describes it as being “playful
and gentle, although easily excited, and very voracious.        It is ex
ceedingly strong, as is indicated by        shape; and    its

   A stuffed specimen and a skeleton of the Acouchy (Dasyprocta
Acuschy, Illig.) having been laid on the table, the following notes
on the anatomy of that animal were read by Mr. Owen.
   “The subjects examined were the male and female Acouchies
which were exhibited to the Committee on the 23d of November
last by Mr. T. Bell, in whose possession they remained alive till
May, when they both died in one of the remarkably cold nights of
that month.
     “The following circumstances were common                     to both animals.
     “On laying open the cavity of the abdomen                    the intestines were
 found to be generally adherent to each other and to the parietes of
 the cavity, arising from recently effused 1 mph : they were also of
 an unusually dark colour, owing to their contents.
     “The stomach consisted of a simple cavity, of a full oval shape,
 without any contraction between the cardiac and pyloric portions.
 The aesophagus had a course of nearly an inch within the abdomen
before        its
              termination. This              circumstance worthy

    “The lungs were divided into three lobes on the left side and
four on the right, the fourth being the lobulus medius seu impar,
occupying the space between the pericardium and diaphragm. The
heart terminated obtusely, with a slight indication of a double aper.
The aorta gave off the carotids and the subclavian arteries by a
common trunk.
     “The rings of the trachea were incomplete, their extremities
being separated behind by a small space.
     “The cricoid and arytenoid cartilages were of large size as com
pared with the thyroid; the apices of the latter were continued into
each other; the chordae vocales were very short but distinctly
marked, and with a small sacculus on each side.           There were no
cuneiform     cartilages;  the epiglottis was  triangular with the aper
prolonged into a small mucro. Viewed from above, the aperture of
 the larynx was circular, and was directed from behind forwards.
 The tongue was subacuminate, minutely papillate above, with a
middle longitudinal line extending half an inch from the tip : it had
 no elevated posterior part as in the Guinea-pig, Beaver, Hare, &c.
 but at the root of the tongue there were numerous elongated cuti
 cular processes, and on each side of the fauces a fold of membrane,
 whose action is evidently to obviate too rapid transmission of the
 food through the fauces.                              -
     “In the male the testes were found within the abdomen, with the
 extremity of the epididymis projecting through the abdominal ring;
 but as the whole gland could be pushed with ease through the
 aperture, the Acouchy cannot be considered one of the true testi
 conda. The levatores penis were very distinct, arising from the upper
 part of the pubes and terminating in tendons which ran along the
 convexity of the dorsum penis to the glans.
     “In the female the ovaries were found of very small size and
 apparently in a scirrhous state.
     “In both there were small clavicular bones, about the thickness
 of a small pin, and eight lines in length, which were connected by a
 ligament of the same length to thesternum. Their office appeared to
 be to afford a fixed point of attachment to a muscle arising from
 the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae analogous to the
 levator claviculae in Apes, and to give origin to part of the deltoid,
 by which it is better adapted to draw forwards the humerus.”
     The following notes on the anatomy of the Thibet Bear (Ursus
  Thibetanus, F. Cuv.) were also read by Mr. Owen.           The subject
 examined was a young individual which had lived about two years
 in the Society's Garden.
     “An extensive abscess was found under the scapula, which ap
 peared to have communicated with the cavity of the chest; but the
  lungs, heart, and liver having been removed before the animal came
  under my hands,     I had no opportunity of ascertaining the connec
  tion it had with diseases of those parts.
      “The length of the animal from the nose to the root of the
  tail was 3 feet 4 inches: that of the intestinal canal 33 feet. Every
  part in the abdomen was loaded with fat. The stomach resembled
  the human in shape, and had a well marked contraction between
                                                                     the

the cardiac and pyloric portions; the muscular parietes of the
latter were half an inch thick; and, as in the Bears generally,
had a tendinous appearance externally on each side. The intes
tines were simply villous internally.          The biliary and pancreatic
secretions entered at a distance of four inches from the pylorus.
There were four or five longitudinal rugae in the terminal six feet
of the intestinal canal; and the diameter was smallest at this part.
There was no calcum, nor any valvular apparatus in any part of the
intestinal canal.
     “The anal follicles were two in number, of the size of hazel-nuts.
 One of them was filled tensely with a yellowish-brown cheesy sub
stance, which had a strong acetous odour; the contents of the other
were of more fluid consistence, but had the same odour; the excre
 tory orifice was just capable of admitting a common probe; the
lining membrane was thin, of a white colour, but not so distinctly cu
 ticular as is commonly found; it resembled more the lining mem
 brane of the urinary bladder.        Each follicle was surrounded by the
 fibres of a muscle which was inserted into the crus penis.
     “The spleen was of a trihedral shape, 7 inches in length, 1% in
 breadth, of a light mottled pink colour and granular texture; the
 splenic vein contributed to form the vena porta in the usual manner.
 The pancreas was of about the same size as the spleen; but the py
 loric portion bent at right angles with that which passed behind the
 stomach.
     “The kidneys consisted each of about thirty lobules. The ureters
 terminated separately but close together at the neck of the bladder.
 The urinary bladder was a narrow oblong bag, and about half an
 inch of the urachus still remained permeable from the fundus
 vesica.
     “The tongue was long, broad, and thin at the extremity, with the
 edges turned down.         On the upper part was a longitudinal mesial
 groove extending four inches from the tip. The surface was uni
 versally papillose, and with the simple papillae were intermixed

carbon.    An experiment performed with this view showed that the
water given  off by the oxalic acid was acid, and that it contained
formic acid. This acid appears at first in but small quantity, be
cause it is mixed with so much water, but it distills more and more
concentrated, and towards the end of the operation, when the oxalic
acid is dried, it has a very penetrating smell and a sharp taste.
According to the proportions found of 6 volumes of carbonic acid
for 5 volumes of oxide of carbon, and supposing that it is the de
ficient volume of this gas, which with the assistance of water forms
formic acid, it will appear that for 12 proportions of oxalic acid
there is formed one volume of formic acid.
    This theoretical result appeared to me to agree very well with
experiment; but I did not satisfy myself of it by a direct mode.
The hydrogen was unquestionably supplied to the formic acid by
water, and not by the oxalic acid, for the carbonic acid and oxide
of carbon ought to have been produced in equal volumes; added
to which, it is a necessary consequence of the well-known nature of
oxalic acid, as shown by the experiments of MM. Dulong and
Döbereiner.     I may remark, that if the decomposition is not urged
too strongly, nearly             all
                           the oxalic acid      destroyed;      sensible

came much darker with persulphate of iron, and of a blueish black
colour with the protosulphate of iron; these are characters which,
as we shall presently see, indicate the presence of pyrogallic acid,
but not that of gallic acid; the same brown liquor was abundantly
precipitated      into a glutinous elastic mass by gelatin.             It therefore
contained a different kind of tanning from that which exists in the
gall-nut. It may be inferred from these results, that heat, by acting
on gallic acid, occasions             elements   its  unite         to

 brown, and metallic silver is precipitated; with protonitrate of    mer
 cury it gives an orange yellow precipitate, which becomes            gra
 dually of a dirty green colour.
    When pyrogallic acid is slightly heated with concentrated sul
 phuric acid, it does not impart any particular colour, and is not sen
 sibly   decomposed,     which is rather a remarkable      circumstance.
 Purified gallic acid was treated in the same way, with the intention
 of discovering a tanning matter: the acid assumed a fine purple
 colour, which disappeared on the addition of water, and crystallized
gallic acid was precipitated.       If the solution of gallic acid in sul
phuric acid be exposed to a greater heat, part of the purple colour
 yet remains; but almost the whole of the gallic acid is converted
 into a powder of a fine brown colour, which has the characters of
 ulmin, and without the development of tanning matter.
    The compounds of pyrogallic acid with bases were not examined,
 except the pyrogallate of alumina, which is easily obtained by dis
 solving freshly precipitated gelatinous alumina in pyrogallic acid.
 A very acerb liquor is formed, which is rendered turbid by heat, and
 becomes transparent again on cooling, precisely like acetate of
alumina.      It produces an exceedingly abundant white coagulum
with gelatin. The pyrogallate of alumina is capable of being cry
stallized.    It appears to redden litmus paper even more strongly
than the acid itself, as if the alumina in this case also acted like an
acid.     The gallate of alumina also possesses properties similar to
those just described.
    According to the opinion expressed by Berzelius, that which
chemists have imagined to be pure gallic acid contains much
tannin; endeavours were made to combine the latter with the sub
limed acid, with the intention of reproducing a substance similar
to gallic acid; but every effort was unsuccessful.
   From the observations which have been detailed, M. Braconnot
concludes:
    1st, That gallic acid obtained in the humid way, and properly
purified    by animal charcoal, may be considered as pure and un
mixed;
    2ndly, That when it is exposed to heat it is converted into a
tanning matter and pyrogallic acid;
   3rdly, That on combining the latter with tannin, gallic acid can
not be reproduced.—Ann, de Chim. xlvi. p. 206.

   If  the subjoined analysis of an ore of Tennantite copper from a

   General Observations.—This month has been alternately dry and showery;
but from the powerful influence of the solar rays in June, the showers of
rain were seasonable, and aided the growth of the crops.
   In the morning of the 9th at nine o'clock, a large double halo appeared
round the sun, with two parhelia outside of the exterior halo; the inner
edge of the interior halo was twenty degrees distant from the sun’s centre,
and the inner edge of the exterior halo was 22° 35', while each of the
parhelia was twenty-six degrees from his centre, and they had white trains
seven or eight degrees long.
   In the night of the 12th there was sheet-lightning from ten P.M. till
three A.M., when it was accompanied with thunder and heavy rain; the
lightning, which was vivid and of a blueish colour, had nearly ceased to dis
charge itself from the clouds when the rain came on.
   In the afternoon of the 14th two parhelia appeared at the exterior edge
of a large solar halo, from half-past four P.M. till sunset.
   Hay-making began here about the middle of the month: the hay was ricked
in dry order, and was found to be average crops, and more in some places.
The wind having prevailed nearly the whole period from the western side
of the meridian, there has been no arid, but rather a moist air, which, with
much sunshine, has had a beneficial effect on the growth of the wheat,
so much so, that with a fortnight's fine, dry weather it would be     for the                         fit
sickle.   Comparatively speaking the barley and oats are rather backward
in  growth, yet, like the wheat, they have       promising and plentiful ap

 XXI.     On Isomorphism.     By H. J. Brooke, Esq. F.R.S. L.S.

            new and important theoretical doctrines relative to
SOME
    the chemical composition of minerals have, within a very
few years, been advanced, and very generally adopted, on the
continent.    They have also been favourably received by some
persons in this country, apparently on the credit of the pro
posers, and without much, if any, inquiry into the merits of
the doctrines themselves.                                -
   The theory of Isomorphism was first introduced by Mr.
Mitscherlich, and was founded upon the observation of a very
near agreement in the forms of crystals of certain chemical
compounds.      Thus sulphate of iron and sulphate of cobalt
crystallize in oblique rhombic prisms, and apparently of the
same measurements; and hence the atoms or molecules of the
oxides of iron and of cobalt are assumed to be isomorphous, or
to possess the same identical forms; and the same apparent
agreement having been found to subsist among the arseniates
and phosphates of lead, the molecules of the arsenic and phos
phoric acids are also assumed to be isomorphous.                -
   From other observations it appeared, that barytes, strontian,
and oxide of lead ought to be isomorphous; and hence that
the salts of those substances, when produced by the same
acid, ought also to be isomorphous.
   But on examining the sulphates and acetates it was disco
vered that their respective angular measurements were not

alike, and they were ascertained therefore not to be strictly
isomorphous.       The sulphates are right rhombic prisms, and
a corresponding dihedral angle of each afforded the following
measurementS:
              Sulphate of barytes............   101°42'
                           strontian..........  104
                           lead................ 103 42
    It became    necessary  therefore that the doctrine of isomor
phism, in the strict sense of the term, should as a general prin
ciple be abandoned; and it is not unreasonable to conclude
that the crystals which suggested the theory, and which ap
pear to measure alike, may really differ in some small quantity
which the goniometer does not detect.
    But although the doctrine of isomorphism, or absolute
identity of form, cannot be supported, it has been said that
the forms in each respective case belong to the same system of
crystallization, and they have therefore been termed plesio
morphous by Mr. Miller, of Cambridge, in a paper on some
artificial crystals, read to the Cambridge Philosophical So
ciety, in March 1830; and if even the class of primary form
can be indicated with certainty by the chemical composition
of a crystallized body, a benefit will so far have been con
ferred on science by the theory of Mr. Mitscherlich.
    But the doctrine of isomorphism has been carried much
further by Mr. Rose, and other eminent chemists on the con
tinent, and has given rise to a theory, from which some check
to the progress of mineralogical chemistry is greatly to be
apprehended.
    It is well known to mineralogists, that there is a consider
able diversity in the chemical composition of some minerals
which have been regarded as belonging to the same species.
Among the most remarkable examples are amphibole, pyrox
ene and garnet.
    Before the theory of isomorphism was proposed, it was
conceived that amphibole was composed of some invariable
elements in definite proportions, although, from the disagree
ment in the analysis of different specimens, neither the nature
nor the proportions of those elements had been accurately
determined.
    It was also supposed that the differences in the actual com
position of different specimens were occasioned by the acci
dental mixture of extraneous matter with the real constituent
elements of the mineral.        This view is taken by Haüy, and
is illustrated in reference to amphibole as follows:

 pounds; and hence what might appear as isomorphous sub
  stitution under one formula, might become foreign matter
  under another, which equally well represents the original
  analysis.
     But even if the varying results of analysis had supported
 the new theory, it might fairly have been inquired, whether
 the known disagreements in chemical composition could not
 be accounted for upon any other probable supposition.
     Now the obvious one of accidental mixture, which is so
 apparent in the Fontainbleau sandstone, might probably have
 rendered any new theory unnecessary, for the observation
 and the statements of Haüy already given might generally
 have furnished an explanation of the disagreements in ques

 the time the mineral was formed, and hence might have be

and extraneous silicates thus produced might not be cemented
together and cased up, as it were, by the true amphibole, in
the same manner as the sand in the Fontainbleau mineral:
and if this were the case, the result of analysis would be such
as it now appears, approaching more or less nearly to definite
composition, as the different foreign ingredients happened to
be present in quantities more or less nearly corresponding to
definite proportions.
    But the theory of isomorphous substitution appears to
involve the much more general chemical law, that any indeft
nite number of binary compounds may combine together in all
possible proportions; that 1 atom of silicate of lime may, not
merely mix, but combine with 100 or 1000 atoms of silicate of
soda, together with as many of silicate of potash, and a dozen
other substances. For the doctrine of substitution implies,
that if 1000 atoms of silex should exist in circumstances fa
vourable to the production of a compound mineral, and that
in the formation of such mineral there should be required
 1000 atoms of lime to be combined with the silex, and only
999 atoms should be present, these would, according to the
existing doctrines of chemistry, combine with 999 parts of the
silex, and the remaining part would combine with a particle
of magnesia or iron, or some other matter supplied from the
other elements surrounding              But this separate binary atom
                                         it.

replace or be replaced by any of them without occasioning
any change in the form of the compound. Therefore eudya
lite, whose form is a rhomboid, might be composed wholly of
silicate of zirconia, a compound which occurs as a square prism
in zircon, or it might be composed wholly of silicate of iron
or magnesia, which is the composition of olivine, whose cry
stalline form is a right rhombic prism.  Hence the same che

the different situations in which it and various substances are
placed in relation to each other, serve only to exhibit instances
in which the quantity and intensity of the repulsive power
varies, thereby enabling experimentalists to deduce general
laws which govern a diversified series of phaenomena.-Elec
tricity and magnetism, on the other hand, present still more
curious instances of invisible forces exercising functions which
rival gravitation in the important parts they sustain in the
oeconomy of nature.     Modern discoveries have developed the
intimate nature of their connections; and the display of polar
forces being their most remarkable feature, is so peculiar to
them alone, that we are induced to look upon them as modifi
cations of the same elementary principle.      These powers are
likewise connected with heat and      light, which latter are in
most cases coexistent.— Electricity is the basis of chemical
affinity, and heat is either absorbed or evolved in chemical
action; the former is in most cases accompanied with a simul
taneous change in the latter, whilst the latter in peculiar cir
cumstances induces electrical phaenomena.- Magnetism is
weakened or destroyed by an excess of heat; whilst the more
refrangible rays of light possess evident magnetic properties.
   Thus are      allthose subtle agents connected together
                                                                                                  in in

different effects which     they  communicate         matter,  and  to the
variety  of forces which harmonize the routine              natural phae      of
nomena. Gravitation alone appears
                                                            in to   its be

experiment has yet shown, being consequent upon any change
which may take place either           temperature                            or
                                         in                 electric state.  in
Are we then      to conclude that heat and electricity are removed
from the sphere         of   its
                             action? that they act independently                                          of
its general influence?             If
                                 such     their relation
                                              is              each other,         to
our conceptions        ofrelation and quantity are violated, and the
nature   of their existence must not only                       be

   2nd, Perfect solidity is accompanied with perfect elasticity.
   This proposition, although inserted in the form of a postu
late from being dependent on the foregoing, is yet capable of
being demonstrated.                   If
                            after collision two elastic bodies re
cover their  shape with a force equal to that by which they have
been compressed, they will recoil from each other without any
alteration being effected in the sum of their motions.       This
will likewise  happen, however much we consider the extent of
compression to be enlarged or diminished; perfect elasticity
being always consequent to an equality existing betwixt the
force of the contracting and that of the dilating vibration.
This vibration may be therefore conceived to be infinitely re
duced; the body will then be perfectly solid, and this finally
becomes the limit of perfect resiliency.
   Exposition           of a principle   is proposed to explain
                                                    by which            it

jorm, the length of each being indefinitely greater than                                               its

to be exerted. Since perfect resiliency however occurs, the
force of impact will be reflected in contrary directions, and the
supplementary momentum will be exerted at p on                     fd
                                                               in the
direction p v, and on fd in the direction p w in both lines; it
will therefore tend to augment the rotatory, and simultaneously
lessen the rectilineal motion.       The actual ratio which these
quantities will have to each other, after the condition of the
medium is established, will be influenced by the following cir
cumstances; 1st, It is equally probable that the point of con
course p may be anywhere situated in the lines a b, df; the
extreme cases are, when it coincides with their extremities or
centres of gravity: in the former by the above formula the
rotatory motion is #ths of the whole; in the latter it is 0; the
mean quantity or ºths will, therefore, show the ratio of the
whole quantity of rotatory momentum generated in the me
dium by this cause singly, and ºths that of the remainder,
by which the lines continue their rectilineal motions. 2ndly,
The rotatory motion by the diversified concourse of the
particles will be performed simultaneously
in planes perpendicular to each other.
 For while a b revolves in the plane a r b,
another particle may communicate a rota
tory impulse in any other direction va,
which by a well-known principle in dyna
mics will cause the line a b to revolve at
the same time in the planes a t b, a rb,
perpendicular to each other. In this manner the whole quan
tity of rotatory momentum effected by the first cause will be
nearly doubled, whilst the elastic recoil will tend further to
diminish the rectilineal motion of the particles.      Before ascer
taining exactly this ratio, the principles of chance require to
be employed in estimating the frequency of peculiar modes
of concurrence, and thus discovering the mean results of the
combined action of the whole medium.             It is not intended,
however, to enter upon this investigation at present, as it is
unnecessary to prove the truth of what has been advanced,
that the primitive-momentum is separated into two parts, one
of which is employed in sustaining a rectilineal and the other a
rotatory motion.

have yet to learn.
    I   shall now proceed to examine the observations on the
ascent of spiders communicated by M. Virey to the French
 Institute in June 1829, and published in the Bulletin des
Sciences Naturelles for October in the same year, p. 130–134;

 several interesting particulars which have recently come to
my knowledge.                   already rendered it sufficiently ap
parent that M. Virey does not comprehend my views relating
 to the ascent of gossamer-webs and spiders, any notice of the
 allusion made to them in the present article is unnecessary;
I   pass on therefore to the author's remarks on the power
 which he supposes spiders to possess of darting out their lines
 to a distance.          “Je m'étois assuré déjà,” he writes, “que

                                                 of
likely     influence the result. My former conclusions, how
          to
ever, were most unequivocally confirmed, and         am confident          I
in  asserting that these animals have not the power        darting                      of
their lines even through the space       half    inch.     of         an

                       Mr.   J. Blackwall's               Eramination of
escape so as to form one line or more of greater or less tenuity
and strength, as may suit their convenience. When suspended
by a vertical thread, for example, they frequently suffer another
thread to be carried out horizontally,                              if   blown upon in that
direction; but that they have tubes so organized as to enable
them forcibly to project their lines to a distance, as M. Virey
 conjectures, is quite inadmissible.

186     Mr. Blackwall’s    Observations          on Aéronautic Spiders.
   To  obviate such objections as might be urged against the
use of glass or glazed earthen vessels by the advocates of the
electrical hypothesis of the ascent of spiders, I have in many
instances employed polished vessels of silver, tin, iron, &c.
 without producing the least difference in the results.          I am
not ignorant that these results have been represented as abso
 lutely subversive of my views. Spiders, it is argued, are com
pelled to dart out their threads by the electrical excitation
 occasioned by currents of air, the phaenomenon being con
 sidered inexplicable on any other principle whatever; but it is
 not found expedient to assign a reason for this sudden con
 version of the power ascribed to these animals of propelling
 their lines to a distance, into a merely involuntary action en
 tirely dependent upon air in motion. The fallacy of the fore
 going supposition may be proved by placing spiders of the
 same species on copper rods insulated by water, and subject
 ing them to the influence of a stream of air so slight as scarcely
 to be perceptible.    Under such circumstances, any electricity
 induced in the    spiders by the feeble current must be carried
 away as speedily as it is excited, by so excellent a conductor
 as copper; nevertheless, the animals can emit or retain their
 liquid gum at pleasure, as lines may frequently be seen stream
 ing from the papillae of some individuals; while others, on the
 same rod, do not let out any, and may be instantly diverted
 from their purpose, should they make the attempt, by the
most trifling causes of disturbance.       It is manifest, therefore,
 that spiders do not fly, in the strict sense of the word; and
that they are not raised into the atmosphere by the agency
of electricity is equally evident; in short, not a doubt can be
entertained by those whose minds are open to conviction, that
 their ascents are effected by means of upward currents of air
impingeing against the lines which proceed from their papillae.
    The two species of aeronautic spiders, whose proceedings
are detailed in the Linnean Society's Transactions, vol. xv.
           I
part ii., have ascertained to be Thomisus cristatus and Lycosa
saccata, both of which are distinctly mentioned as aéronautic
spiders by Dr. Lister*.                      I
                             The first have described as having
two pair of eyes situated in the anterior part of the head and
arranged thus, "... ; the second as having three pair in front
whose arrangement is thus represented by dots                    ::

expert in climbing, nor so tenacious of life under similar cir
cumstances.          I
                 may remark, that in experiments instituted to
decide how   long  spiders can live without food, the influence
of season should not be disregarded.     In winter, unless a high
temperature be maintained by artificial means, the vital func
tions are performed with much less energy than they are in
summer: of course the natural demand for sustenance, if it do
not cease altogether, is greatly diminished in the former period,
and the animals suffer little comparatively from abstinence.
   Another spider of a diminutive size, frequently observed to
take aérial excursions, is the Drassus ater of Latreille, which
appears to be identical with the Aranea obtectria of Bechstein.
   Aéronautic spiders, properly so called, or those species
which instinctively employ their lines to sail in the atmosphere,
will probably be found almost exclusively among such as are
active during the day and decidedly erratic.      Numerous facts
tend to corroborate this idea, the correctness or inaccuracy
of which can only be determined by more extended observa

                1821 in Kastner's Archiv., &c. No. 1. by Prof.
Kupffer of Kasan. It was discovered by Mr. Mengé, near
Lake Ilmen in Siberia, accompanied occasionally by a tita
nious iron-ore in modified rhomboids, of which a description

and figure, but without measurements, were

   Probably from having seen only the iron-ore, Prof. Rose
of Berlin has stated that this was the ilmenite of Kupffer.

Mr. Mengé, who discovered it with the preceding ones near
Miask, and whose mineralogical labours have probably not
been exceeded by those of any of his contemporaries.
   The Mengite occurs in imbedded crystals in masses of fel
spar and mica in a granitic rock.        Its primary form is an
oblique rhombic prism, whose terminal and lateral edges are
to each other nearly in the ratio of 13 to 18. The planes are
too dull for the reflective goniometer, and those of the larger
crystals not sufficiently flat to afford very accurate measure
ment by the common goniometer.
   The crystals of this substance present the accompanying
figure, the measurements being nearly as follow:
                       P, M = 100°

 190      Mr. Brooke     on Sarcolite and Wollastonite.

 ceived from Dr. Donati, have enabled me to give the annexed
        and measurements of this substance;       É.   primary form
 of which is a square prism, whose terminal and lateral edges
 are in the ratio of 62 to 55 very nearly.
    The planes ............ a 1,     a2,  b1,    b2,    c,  d,  e,

               P, d    =    90

               M, e =      153 26
               M,d =       135
    The plane b2,     as the symbol denotes, and as appears in
 the figure, occurs singly on each angle, instead of being ac
 companied by a corresponding plane on the other side of c.
                     Wollastonite from Vesuvius.
    This is the  same mineral as was, according to the ticket
 accompanying specimens from Vesuvius, formerly named
 2urlonite or 2arlite. The crystals are generally very imperfect,
 and the surfaces very dull; a specimen, however, in the pos
 session of Dr. Somerville presented some bright and well
defined crystals, an examination of some of which has en
abled me to give the annexed figure and measurements.           The
primary form is an oblique rhombic prism.             There is one
cleavage parallel to P, and three others parallel to the three
planes a 3, h, c2; that parallel to h is the brightest, and        I
have supposed it parallel to the edge of the prism, and have
thus assumed a different cleavage angle from that usually
assigned to tabular spar.      I have, however, found a cleavage
corresponding to the plane h, in specimens from the Bannat,
in which the cleavages usually observed and hitherto quoted
are those parallel to P and c 2. The ratio of the terminal
and lateral edges of the prism which          I  have taken as the
primary is very nearly as 25 to 40, and the obtuse angle of
the terminal plane is 91° 56'. The planes are more than
usually perfect, several of the measured angles having agreed
exactly with those given by calculation.

the brewer, the distiller, the sugar-refiner, and the chemist.
   I  shall now have the honour of laying before the Royal
Society a description of a contrivance which,            trust, will be              I
found to answer all the desired        purposes;    and which, while
simple enough to be intrusted to the hands of common work
men in every variety of fire-place,                           I
                                              hope to prove, by the
results of  my  experiments,    to be sufficiently  delicate to extend
considerably our knowledge of the expansion of metals, upon
which so much labour has been bestowed by some of the first
philosophers.

of   iron, “en admettant toujours une progression uniforme
jusque dans les plus hautes températures.” The experimental

                                                  some practical difficulty

194        Mr. Daniell     on a New Register-Pyrometer,
bar pressed, being of such very slender dimensions, would
obviously be liable to bend, and thus frustrate the experiment:
in addition to which,          I
                          can speak from my own experience,
the platinum spring plate and the centre pin would be liable
to a change of texture, which would impede the motion of the
lever, and it would finally become welded to the index; for a
very moderate pressure at a high temperature would produce
this effect.
   The conclusion, indeed, of these Essays seems to admit that
the author did not expect that the platinum pyrometer could
ever come into general use: “enfin, ces corrections ne peuvent
manquer d’ajouter a l'utilité du pyrométre d'argile, soit dans
les travaux chimiques, soit dans les arts; quand même le
pyromètre de platine, plus exact mais moins usuel, serait ré
servé pour en assurer la marche, et pour servir à des recher
 ches plus importantes.”
   M. Guyton, however, although he abundantly proves the
incorrectness of Mr. Wedgwood's estimate of the higher
degrees of temperature, is very far indeed from establishing
the point at which he so earnestly laboured, namely, the re
gularity of the contraction of the clay pieces; or from substi-.
tuting a more correct value of the degrees throughout the
whole range of the gauge than the one which he so completely
overturned.     His comparative experiments with the platinum
pyrometer, at the boiling points of mercury and linseed oil,
 and the melting point of antimony, led him to reduce the
 equivalent of each degree from 180° Fahr. to 62°5.            The
 zero point of the clay pyrometer was thus carried back to 517°
 instead of 1077°; but it seems to have escaped his notice that
 this zero point was declared to be ared heat visible in the day
 light, a description which cannot be mistaken, and which
 clearly could not be below the temperature of boiling oil,
                                               all

  Nevertheless, it is a curious fact, that M. Guyton's Essay
contains proof that his determination is erroneous, and that
mine is a near approximation to the truth.     As a collateral
means of verifying the indications of instruments intended to
measure high degrees of temperature, he refers to the calori
meter as capable of affording the necessary data by a calcula
tion from the amount of heat communicated to known quan
tities of ice or water by bodies in a state of incandescence;
and he quotes the very exact experiments of MM. Clement
and Desormes, who had in this manner determined the fol
lowing points:

they would have been estimated at about 20°Fahr.; and taking
 Mr. Wedgwood's original determination of the fusing point
of silver at 28° of his scale and the zero point at 1077°, the
 former would come out about 1650°.                  By raising the zero
point a little, (and it is much more probable that the tempe
rature of a red heat fully visible in the day-light is above 1077°
 than below it,) we arrive at something like an approximation
 to the truth.      These wide discrepancies, and the practical
 disuse of both Mr. Wedgwood's and M. Guyton's pyrometers
 for a long time past, prove the expediency of further investi
 gating a subject of so much interest and importance.
     The pyrometer, which I shall now proceed to submit to the
judgement of the Society, consists of two distinct parts, which
I   shall designate as the Register and the Scale.
     The first is a solid bar of black-lead earthenware, eight
 inches long, seven-tenths of an inch wide, and of the same
 thickness, cut out of a common black-lead crucible.                  In this
 a hole is drilled three-tenths of an inch in diameter, and 7%
                                                                                                              is its
 inches deep. At the upper end of this bar and on one of
                                              an
                                              length                               its

 observed, that the exact indication            this amount    of not     the            is              in

 which the black-lead may undergo                 high degrees      at heat;                      of

                                          the accurate measurement                                            of

          calculation of the absolute expansion of the bar indi
             the scale may be performed as follows:—As radius
to double the sine of half the arc read off, and found in a table
of natural sines, so will the radius B be to the chord of the
same arc; and this divided by ten (the radius of B being ten
times the length of the radius h) will  f            #.     the length required.
Suppose the arc read off upon the scale to be 4°,
         Radius.    Sine of 22.
then 1-0000000 : 0348995        X2
                                   Inches.

                                                      Inch.
                                           : 5 : 3489950      -   10  =  -0348995.
     Now in working out this proportion it will be observed,
 that the multiplication by 2 and by 5 being both constant
 may, in conjunction with the division by 1-0, be omitted; and
 leaving out also the final division by 10, the case resolves itself
 into seeking the sine of half the arc, read off upon the scale, in
 a table of natural sines, and reading it as the decimal of an inch.
     Moreover, the chords of small arcs are so nearly propor
 tional to their arcs that, the number of degrees measured upon
 the scale never exceeding 10, they may be considered without
 sensible error as denoting equal increments of expansion. The
  following short Table of the value of a degree, and minutes
  of a degree, may therefore be useful in practice.

     The chord of ten degrees derived from this Table by mul
  tiplying 00872 by 10 would therefore be '0872, whereas it is
  more accurately 0.871; but the difference being only roºmsdth
  of an inch may, in most cases, be disregarded.

                                     for the ellipticity of Saturn.
It must be observed that the above calculations take into
account only the first power of the ellipticity, and therefore
cannot be very accurate with respect to Jupiter and Saturn,
the ellipticities of which are not very small.     We may, how
ever, affirm that the ellipticity of Jupiter accords very well
with the theory we are considering.     That of Saturn is consi
derably less than what the theory gives.     Herschel remarked
an anomaly in the shape of this planet, which, however, sub
sequent observations have not yet confirmed; viz. that the
equatorial diameter was not so large as a diameter about mid
way between the equatorial and the polar.        It would seem, if
this be   true,  that some cause has  operated   to compress the
parts about the equator.     The same cause would account for
an ellipticity less than what our theory requires.         Possibly
the rings   may   have something to do with this.
   Venus, Mercury, and the Sun, in as much as they possess
no ellipticity discoverable by instruments, do not contradict
the theory.      But Mars forms an exception.      Its ellipticity is
ascertained           by   observation         to

centrifugal force to gravity at       equator, which ratio differs

204       Rev.   J.   Challis on the Ellipticities of the Planets.
The following values of                     +. are calculated from                               the masses       of
the bodies of our system, as given by Laplace.                 For the Sun,
54-31; Jupiter, 5.33; Saturn, 3.06; Uranus, 1.97; the Earth,
1; Venus, '981; Mercury, 651; Mars, '5; the Moon, 23.
It is observable that the order of magnitude of these quan
tities is the same as the order of the bodies arranged accord
ing to their masses.          It follows, therefore, from our theory,
that because in the greater masses the velocity of propagation
is greater, the materials of which they are composed possess
greater elastic force. This may be owing, not to any differ
ence in the constituent elements, but to a greater degree of
proper caloric, or of the force, whatever it be called, by which
the constituent atoms are held in their positions relatively to
each other.        For it is not unreasonable to suppose that the
proper underived caloric of any mass, such as we know exists
in the earth and forms the principal part of                caloric,    some           its               is
function    of the   mass,  and       specifically  greater      the mass                        as               is

is converted almost entirely into bipersulphate, even before

XXVIII.       Experiments on    Vanadiate of Ammonia, and on
   some other Compounds of Vanadium.           By Mr. John PRI
   DEAUx, Member of the Plymouth Institution.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
      Gentlemen,
      the absence of detailed information on vanadium, a sum
 INmary   of experiments on the minute scale, on a portion of
vanadiate of ammonia, with which       I  was favoured in a letter
from Professor Berzelius, about a month since, may be not
unacceptable to your chemical readers.         It was accompanied
by the information, that the atomic weight of vanadium is
855.87: that it combines with 1, 2 and 3 atoms of oxygen,
with the latter quantity forming vanadic acid; that by driving
off the ammonia, in an open vessel, the acid would be ob
tained; and that by the same process, out of access of air, the
                                                                -
oxide would be produced.
   The acid was the first subject of experiment. It is a dull
orange red powder, as described in your last Number, p. 152;
and the neutral salts it forms with alkaline and earthy bases
are white; which would hardly have been expected, consider
ing the analogies of vanadium with chrome. With excess of
acid, however, they are yellow.
   1. Vanadiate of potash is very soluble, and showed no dis
position to crystallize, although evaporated slowly to dryness,
with frequent intervals of cooling, and afterwards redissolved
and left to spontaneous evaporation.
   2. Vanadiate of soda is scarcely so soluble, but not more
disposed to crystallize.
   3. The quantities employed amounting to only about 2 grains
of each salt, and the indisposition to crystallize being perhaps
due to the smallness of the quantity, the two solutions were
mixed and abandoned to spontaneous evaporation; the glass

  being occasionally made to vibrate, by striking on the edge
  with a steel blade. The salts were, however, left on the glass
  in two successive coatings; and a film, which had formed upon
  the liquor, was studded beneath with brilliant globules, in
  which no facets could be discovered by the microscope.
     4. Vanadiate of ammonia is much less soluble, falling like
  cream of tartar; it crystallized freely, on cooling, in acute
 rhombic blades, like spear-heads.
     5. Vanadiate of lime is still less soluble than the last, and
 also crystallized in cooling.     Crystalline form not unlike the
 other, but thicker.     The crystals were, however, so irregular
 that but few could be defined.
     6. Vanadiate of barytes.       A solution of 1:482 grains of
 vanadiate of ammonia, containing an atom of water, was mixed
 with a solution of 1.312 grain of chloride of barium; the whole
 fluid became full of coagula, which settled, by boiling, into a
 heavy white power.       The residual liquor was evaporated and
 tested in the usual manner, and the decomposition was found
 complete, so far as could be ascertained by this mode.
     This precipitate affords a convenient method of recovering
 the vanadic acid used in experiments.        Mixing together the
 various soluble     vanadiates,  solution of muriate of barytes
 may be added, in     slight excess, keeping the liquor hot.   The
 vanadiate of barytes will quickly subside, and may be readily
washed.      It is then (whilst quite recent) to be thrown into
40 or 50    parts of water, with a little excess of sulphuric acid;
when it will assume the deep orange colour of bi-chromate
of potash. It may digest for half an hour, with occasional
shaking; when carbonate of ammonia is to be added, a small
lump at a time, letting it dissolve gradually, and mixing up
the liquor well before each addition, till the liquor is neutral,
avoiding much excess of the carbonate. The precipitate will
then be white or will become so by boiling in the liquid; and
after washing to remove the adhering solution will not be
discoloured by fresh sulphuric acid. The liquor will contain
sulphate and vanadiate of ammonia, which are to be separated
by crystallization.                                  -
    In the following  experiments,   solution of vanadiate of am
monia was dropped into excess of the metallic solutions; the
persulphate of iron was prepared by heating protosulphate in
a test-tube with nitric acid, and contained that acid in excess;

212   Mr.   J. Prideaux's   Experiments on Vanadiate   of Ammonia,
more water were added, by which it was dissolved; and after
the subsidence of a yellow sediment the solution was pale
blue and strongly acidulous.       The yellow sediment dissolved
in liquid ammonia, and was vanadic acid.
   Carbonate of barytes in fine powder was added to the solu
tion, to get rid of the excess of sulphuric acid. It produced little
effect, till heat was applied; when effervescence took place,
the liquid became pistachio-green, and a flocculent dark olive
precipitate appeared; which gradually subsided, leaving the
liquor still blue and acidulous.        Liquid ammonia did not
render it neutral, until a nearly black precipitate had fallen in
considerable quantity; almost the whole of -which was taken
up again by ammonia in excess.
      the second attempt the precaution was taken to add car
     In
bonate of ammonia in decomposing the salt, that the first
impression of heat might fill the crucible with an atmosphere
of that substance. The remaining oxide, however, still con
tained vanadic acid.
   The solution in muriatic acid was blue, and could not be
neutralized without precipitation.     Before neutralization took
place, liquid ammonia threw down an olive precipitate, and
made the liquor green, as above.       The green liquid, poured
off, and gradually neutralized with ammonia, gave a dark
brown precipitate.     The olive precipitate dissolved green, the
brown one    blue, in muriatic acid.
   After various experiments, in none of which did the oxide
of vanadium neutralize the acid employed, or yield with it
a crystallized salt, the solutions were mixed together, and
thrown into an excess of caustic potass, largely diluted.       A
deep brown light precipitate fell, doubtless hydrate of the
oxide (most probably of the protoxide), leaving the liquor of
the same colour but transparent.      A portion of this liquor was
withdrawn, and mixed with bi-carbonate of potash, when it
bleached, but without precipitating. The remainder was then
poured off and tried with muriatic acid, in slight excess, which
produced the green colour mentioned before, but without
disturbing the transparency.      Caustic potash was then slowly
added, and whilst still acidulous, an inky precipitate fell; after
which a reddish brown one followed, when the liquor became
neutral.
   The reddish-brown and purple precipitates were both solu
ble in acids, alkalies, and distilled water, and were therefore
difficult to wash; both also reddened litmus paper. The brown
precipitate became purple on the surface, when no great depth
of water lay on     it,

appears to have possessed remarkable placidity of temper, and an
amiable and benevolent disposition.
   When very young he was placed at the Grammar School in Pen
zance, whence he went to Truro, where he finished his education.
Although quick and industrious in his school exercises, he was
found very deficient in the qualifications for the class of his age;
but by industry and attention he subsequently acquitted himself to
the entire satisfaction of his master.
   In his boyish days he was fond of romance, of writing verses and
ballads, of fireworks, shooting and fishing. The taste for poetry
increased with his years, and Dr. Paris has given some specimens of
his poetic talent which are not unworthy of his genius. At twelve
years of age he composed an epic poem, of which, however, not even
a fragment has been preserved.      His love of fishing he always re
tained : it appears, indeed, to have increased, rather than dimi
nished with his years.-‘‘His temper during youth,” says Dr. Paris,
“is represented as mild and amiable. He never suppressed his feel
ings, but every action was marked by ingenuousness and candour.”
   In February 1795 he was apprenticed to Mr. Borlase, a surgeon
and apothecary, and afterwards a physician at Penzance; and al
though his mind had been for some time engrossed with philoso
phical pursuits, it does not appear that he had any decided turn for
Chemistry, until after he had been placed with Mr. Borlase; but he
then commenced the study of it with ardour.        “As far as can be
ascertained,” says Dr. Paris, “ one of the first original experiments
on chemistry performed by him at Penzance, was for the purpose
of discovering the quality of the air contained in the bladders of
sea-weed, in order to obtain results in support of a favourite
theory of light; and to ascertain whether, as land vegetables are
the renovators of the atmosphere of land animals, sea vegetables
might not be the preservers of the equilibrium of the atmosphere
of the ocean. From these experiments he concluded, that the dif
ferent orders of the marine Cryptogamia were capable of decom
posing water, when assisted by the attraction of light for oxygen.”
He seems also to have paid attention to Geology while with Mr.
Borlase;—during his walks his usual companion was a hammer, with
which he procured specimens from the rocks on the beach.--. In
short,” observes Dr. Paris, “it would appear that, at this period, he
paid much more attention to philosophy than to physic; that he
thought more of the bowels of the earth than of the stomachs of
his patients; and that when he should be bleeding the sick, he was
opening veins in the granite.”
   During his stay with Mr. Borlase he became acquainted with
Mr. Davies Gilbert (then Giddy), who accidentally hearing that he
was fond of chemical experiments, expressed a desire to have some
conversation with him; and during this he soon discovered ample
evidence of young Davy's singular genius, and the consequence was
an offer of the use of his library or any other assistance he might
require for the pursuit of his studies.
    In October 1798 Davy quitted Penzance to superintend the
                                                                 Pneu

 Pneumatic Institution at Bristol, established by Dr. Beddoes for the
 purpose of investigating the medicinal powers of factitious airs or
  ases.     “It is now generally acknowledged," says Dr. Paris, “that
 the Art of   Physic    has not derived any direct advantage from the
application of a class of agents, which undoubtedly held forth the
fairest promise of benefit.”        “The investigation, however,” he con
tinues, “into the nature and composition of the gases paved the
way to some new and important discoveries in science; so that to
borrow a Baconian metaphor, although our philosophers failed in
obtaining the treasure for which they so eagerly dug, they at least,
by turning up and pulverizing the soil, rendered it fertile. The
ingenuity of the chemist will for ever remain on record; the phan
toms of physicians have vanished into air.”
    In a letter to Mr. Davies Gilbert, dated Clifton, November 12,
 1798, Davy says, “We are printing in Bristol the first volume of
the West Country Collections, which will I suppose be out in the
beginning of January.”           Dr. Paris informs us that “the work an
nounced in the above letter was published in the commencement
of the year 1799, under the title of “Contributions to Physical and
Medical Knowledge, principally from the West of England; col
lected by Thomas Beddoes, M.D.”
    The following are Dr. Paris's observations on this work: “The
first two hundred pages, constituting very nearly half the volume,
are the composition of Davy, and consist of essays ‘On Heat, Light,
and the Combination of Light; ‘On Phos-oxygen, or Oxygen and
 its Combinations;' and On the Theory ‘              Respiration.'of

speculations of the wildest nature, although it must be confessed
that he has infused an interest into them which might almost be
called dramatic.    They are certainly highly characteristic of that
enlightened fancy, which was perpetually on the wing, and whose
flight, when afterwards tempered and directed by judgement, en
abled him to abstract the richest treasures from the recesses of
abstract truth.”
    “Taking it for granted that caloric has no existence as a ma
terial body, or, in other words that the phaenomena of repulsion do
not depend upon the agency of a peculiar fluid, and that on the
contrary, light is a subtile fluid acting on our organs of vision
only when in a state of repulsive projection; he proceeds to examine
the French theory of combustion; the defects of which he con
siders to arise from the assumption of the imaginary fluid caloric,
and the total neglect of light.   He conceives that the light evolved
during combustion previously existed in the oxygen gas, which he
therefore proposes for the future to call Phos-oxygen.”
   “In following up this question, he would seem to consider light as
the Anima Mundi, diffusing through the universe not only organi
zation, but even animation and perception.”
    “Phos-oxygen, he considers as capable of combining with addi
tional proportions of light, and of thus becoming “luminated phos
oxygen ('From the decomposition of which, and the consequent
liberation of light, he seeks to explain many of the most recondite
phaenomena     of nature.”
   “We      cannot but admire the eagerness with which he enlists
known facts into his service, and the boldness with which he ranges
the wilds of creation in search of analogies for the support and                                                          il

together gave a faint light, which he shows was occasioned by the
silica contained in the epidermis. In the same letter he announces
a more important fact—“I made a discovery yesterday, which
proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments.                   The gaseous
oxide of azote is     perfectly   respirable   when   pure.     It is never dele
terious but when it contains nitrous gas. I have found a mode of
obtaining it pure, and I breathed to-day, in the presence of Dr.
Beddoes and some others, sixteen quarts of it for near seven
minutes.     It appears to support life longer than even oxygen gas,
and   absolutely   intoxicated me. Pure oxygen gas produced no al
teration in   my    pulse, nor any other material effect; whereas this
gas raised my pulse upwards of twenty strokes, made me dance
about the laboratory like a madman, and has kept my spirits in a
glow ever since.       Is not this a proof of the truth of my theory of
respiration ? for this gas contains more light in proportion to                                                      its

 the manipulations employed and the difficulties overcome would ex
ceed the limits of a lecture.” Well knowing how valuable every
 minute circumstance is to the chemist, Dr. Paris searched into the
archives of the Institution ; the result of the examination of the
Laboratory Register, we shall give in Dr. Paris's words:                        appears               “It
from this    register   that  Davy   commenced his        inquiries   into the com
position of potash on the 16th, and obtained his great result on the
 19th of October, 1807 *.         His first experiments, however, evidently
did not    suggest   the truth: he does not appear to have suspected the
 nature of the alkaline base until his last experiment, when the truth
 flashed upon him in the full blaze of discovery.                     His first note,
dated the     16th,   leads us to infer that he acted on a solid piece of
potash, under the surface of alcohol, and several other liquids in
which the alkali was not-soluble; and that he obtained gaseous
matter, which he called at the moment ‘ alkaligen gas,” and which he
appears to have examined most closely, without arriving at any con
clusion as to         its
                      nature.     On the following day,             for the first timehe

of the autograph account of the results, the substance of which is
as follows:—“When potash was introduced into a tube having a
platina wire attached to it —so- and fused into the tube so as to
be a conductor, i.e. so as to contain just water enough, though solid,
and inserted over mercury, when the platina was made negative,
no gas was formed, and the mercury became oxydated, and a small
quantity of the alkaligen was produced round the platina wire, as was

the mercury was made the negative, gas was developed           great quan                 in

of the animals of the larger species were so gnawed and splintered,
and evidently of such ancient fracture, that no doubt could exist of
the cave having been a hyaena's den, similar to Kirkdale and Kent's
Hole. All the ancient remains were found in the upper regions of
the fissure, and were so firmly imbedded in the detritus, as not to
be extracted without difficulty with the pick-axe.    Further on he
found a wet tenacious loam, abounding with an innumerable quan
tity of bones, belonging exclusively to birds.    After working six
days he came to a cavern, ten or twelve feet high, extending about
forty feet from north to south, and varying from eight to twenty
feet from east to west; the floor of which was covered with bones
 of sheep: and on digging into the mud and sand of which it con
sisted, the bones of sheep, birds, cuttle-fish, and foxes, were disco
vered.    Some fine stalactites depended from the roof, and partial
spots of stalagmite appeared on the floor. In a fissure that branched
from the mouth of the main entrance there were found, among the
sand, a piece of black Roman pottery, and two coins, one of Didius
Julianus, and the other of Julia Mammaea, together with bones of
sheep, cuttle-fish, foxes, and birds.
    The author considers that there exist evidences of the operation
of water at three distinct periods of time:—the first indicated by
the bones of the hyaena, and the other gnawed bones firmly im
bedded in the diluvial detritus: the second, when sand was depo
sited by the sea in the second fissure, that washed in through the
vertical chimney, and that inundated the whole valley up to Glas
tonbury: the third irruption of the sea occurring within these fif
teen hundred years, and choking up the adit from the level by which
the sheep and foxes had entered, floating in the bones of the cuttle
fish, and depositing the thin crust of mud which covered the sand.
The coins and pottery he supposes to have been introduced through
this entrance from the level.
   The author next gives an account of the Hutton caverns, situated
on the northern escarpment of the range, commonly called Bleadon
Hill. This cavern had been discovered some time ago and noticed
by Mr. Catcott in his “Treatise on the Deluge:” but afterwards it
became inaccessible by the falling in of the roof and sides. The
author, led by some indications of pieces of ancient bones in the
rubbish of some old pits, sought for this cavern by sinking a shaft,
and succeeded in opening into       it.

     The experiments of the author, of which an account is given in this
 paper, were made with a glass tube, about an inch in diameter, one
 end being drawn out into a slender tube of the interior diameter of
 one eighth of an inch, and having a piece of bladder tied over the
 other end. When this Endosmometer, as it has been called, is by means
 of a small funnel introduced into the narrow end filled with alcohol,
 and immersed in water, the water penetrates through the blad
 der, and the spirit rises rapidly in the narrow stem.               The author
 found on trial that this action was apparently not affected by a pow
erful current of voltaic electricity passed through the bladder, by in
troducing positive and negative wires on both sides of                  On sub               it.

   A paper was read, “On the Friction       of Fluids.” By George
Rennie, Esq., W.P.R.S.
  The object of the author in this paper is to trace the relation sub
sisting between the different quantities of water discharged by
orifices and tubes, and the retardations arising from the friction of
the fluid. The results of the experiments hitherto made with a
view of ascertaining the effects of the friction attending the mutual
motion of solids and fluids, are exceedingly discordant, and there
fore undeserving of confidence. Whether, for example, the retarda
tion from friction be proportional to the surfaces, or to the velo
cities, are points by no means satisfactorily determined.
    The experiments of the author were designed to measure the re
tardations experienced by solids moving in fluids at rest; and of
fluids moving over solids. For this purpose, he employed a cylinder
of wood, about eleven inches in diameter and two feet in length,
traversed by an iron axle, upon the upper part of which a small
pulley was fixed. A fine flexible silken cord was wound round the
pulley, at one end, and had a weight attached to the other end. A
frame was provided, allowing the apparatus to slide up and down;
and the cylinder to be immersed at various depths into the river
Thames.      When the velocities were small, the retardation was found
to be   nearly  as the surface : but with great velocities it appears to
have but little relation to the extent of the surface immersed.     The
resistances of iron discs and wooden     globes revolving in water were
found to be as the squares of the velocities.
     From the experiments made on the quantities of water discharged
by orifices of different shapes and sizes from vessels kept constantly
 full, the author concludes, that they are in the ratio of the areas of
 the orifices, independently of their shape; and nearly as the square
º
 roots of the heights.     In pipes bent at various angles the retarda
       occasioned   by the flexure was not in proportion to their num
   er.
   : A paper was read, “On the Sources and Nature of the Powers on
 which the Circulation of the Blood depends.”          By A. P. Wilson
Philip, M.D. F.R.S. L. & Ed.
   In the first part of this paper the author discusses the opinions
which ascribe the powers that maintain the circulation in the veins
to the elasticity of the heart, the resilience of the lungs, and the
dilatation of the thoracic cavity in the act of inspiration.   He shows
                                                                      of all
experimentally that the circulation continues unimpaired when
those causes have ceased   to  operate; and that the very structure

the blood could be maintained in them by any cause corresponding
to a power of suction in the heart.
    The latter part of the paper is occupied by an inquiry into the
sources and nature of the powers which really support the circula
tion of the blood.     The capillaries, he observes, maintain the mo
tion of their blood long after the heart has ceased to beat; this
motion not being immediately affected even by the entire removal
of the heart; but being accelerated, retarded, or arrested, according
as the action of the capillaries is increased, impaired, or destroyed,
by agents of which the operation is wholly confined to the vessels
 themselves. As the destruction of the heart does not immediately
influence the motion of the blood in the capillaries, so the action of
this organ, when in full vigour, can produce no motion of the blood in
the capillaries, when these vessels are themselves deprived of power.
 Experiments are related with the view of proving that the arteries
and veins, and more particularly the latter, are also capable of car
 rying on the blood they contain, even in opposition to the force of
 gravitation, with the greatest ease, and without the aid of any ex
 traneous power.      With regard to the nature of the power exerted
 by the blood-vessels, the author shows that the capillaries are as
 readily influenced by stimulants and by sedatives, as the heart itself;
 and that the arteries and veins may also be made to obey the action
 of stimulants; and further, that the power of the vessels bears the
 same relation to the nervous system as that of the heart, which is
 peculiar, and very different from the relation subsisting between
 that system and the muscles of voluntary motion. From the whole
 of the facts and experiments stated in this paper, the author de
 duces the conclusions, that the circulation is maintained by the
 combined power of the heart and blood-vessels, and that the power
 of both is a muscular power.

         June 14, 1831.      Joshua Brookes, Esq. in the Chair.
     A letter addressed to the Secretary of the Society by Charles
  Telfair, Esq., Corr. Memb. Z. S., dated Port Louis, December
  15th, 1830, was read.         It referred to previous unsuccessful
 attempts on the part of the Society's valuable correspondent to
  transport from the Mauritius to England living Gouramies and
   Tanrecs, and promised a repetition of the experiment. Mr. Tel
  fair states that he has now a pair of living Tanrecs fully grown
  ready to send to England when he can place them under proper
  care.    “They live on boiled rice, but will probably not exist long
  upon that alone, as their natural food is chiefly composed of worms,
  insects, lizards, and the eggs of snails, of which it would be difficult
  to carry a sufficient supply in a living state on board ship. Fresh
  supplies might, however, be obtained at Madagascar or the Cape of
  Good Hope, at St. Helena, Ascension, and the Cape de Verd
  Islands; and the animals might thus arrive in good health in En
  gland, where they would probably survive for some time burrowing
  under a dungheap, or living in straw in a hot-house or green

habits.   In the Mauritius they sleep through the greater part of the
winter, from April to November, and are only to be found when
summer heat is felt, which being generally ushered in by an electric
state of the atmosphere, the negroes (with whom they are a favour
ite food) say they are awakened by the peals of thunder which
precede the summer storms or ‘pluies d'orage.'             Even in summer
they are not often seen beyond the holes in which they burrow,
except at night. Their favourite haunts are among the old roots
of clumps of bamboos. They have a very overpowering smell of

     PREPARATION OF IODIC ACID.                            BY ARTHUR CONNELL3 A.M.

a hydriodate and an iodate, from the latter of which the iodic acid
may be separated by the original method of M. Gay-Lussac, and
more perfectly by the recent method of M. Serullas (Ann. de Chin.
et de Phys. xliii. pp. 127 and 217); secondly, the action of euchlo
rine, as suggested by Sir H. Davy; and, thirdly, the action of water
on the perchloride of iodine, and subsequent separation of iodic
acid by means of alcohol, as also proposed by M. Serullas (see Phil.
Mag. and Annals, N.S., vol.                  149):   ix. these Mr. Connell pro

Two    great views, one a succession of violent revolutions,
  the other the elevation of mountain-chains by forces act
ing from beneath, having been successively introduced into
geology, it was natural to inquire if they were independent
of each other; if mountain-chains could be raised without
producing real revolutions on the surface of the globe; if the
frightful convulsions which must have accompanied the up
burst of masses so great and of an aspect so contorted as
those of high mountains, were not the same with those revo
lutions on the surface of the globe which are proved to have
taken place by the mineralogical and zoological lines of de
marcation observable in the sedimentary deposits.
   The principal object of the researches, of which the follow
ing is a brief sketch, is to show, term for term, the connection
of these two series of facts.
   It will be necessary to premise a few words respecting the
principles on which these researches        have been conducted.

the clearest   line of demarcation that can be found between
two systems of consecutive sedimentary deposits. This idea,
which has been developed in the lessons of the most distin
guished professors, has, it may be said, become common. . It
was indeed on a fact of this nature, generalized certainly be
yond measure, that Werner founded his principal division in
the series of rocks.     Now it follows from this difference,
always clear and without passage, between the upheaved beds
and those which are horizontal, that the elevation of the beds
has not been effected in a continuous and progressive manner,
but that it has been produced in a space of time comprised
between the periods of deposition of the two consecutive rocks,
and during which no regular series of beds was produced;—
in a word, that it was sudden, and of short duration.
    It has been in vain attempted to explain the geological facts
observable in high mountain-chains, by the action of the slow
and continuous causes now in force on the surface of the globe.
No satisfactory result has been obtained by these means. In
fact, everything shows that the instantaneous elevation of the
beds of a whole mountain-chain is an event of a different order
from those which we daily witness. It is evident that such a
convulsion would interrupt the slow and progressive forma
tion of the sedimentary deposits, and that some anomalous
circumstance would be nearly universally observable in that
point of the series of rocks which should correspond with the
moment when an elevation of beds took place. It is well
known that those geologists who have most carefully exa
mined the sedimentary deposits, and those naturalists who
have investigated the remains of animals and vegetables which
 they contain, have generally remarked that between different
 terms of the series of these rocks there are sudden variations,
 not only in the position and local character of the beds, but
 also in the fossil animals and vegetables entombed in them.
 From observations which did not comprise a sufficiently ex
 tensive area, some of these variations (to lessen the value of
 which too many attempts have perhaps been subsequently
 made) were at first supposed more general than they really
 are. When two formations appear to pass insensibly into
 each other, there is never more than a small depth of beds
 of which the classification may remain uncertain; and when
 certain fossils are common to two successive formations, they
 generally constitute a fraction, often even inconsiderable, of
 the total number of species found in each of the two forma
 tions. This is more particularly seen in the comparison       in
 stituted by M. Deshayes (in a work impatiently expected by
 geologists) between the catalogues of the species of shells
                               I
                             2 2                       discovered

244         Elie de Beaumont's      Researches on some    of
discovered in the three groups, which he distinguishes in the
beds above the chalk, and the catalogue of species now ex
isting.   It is sufficient, that in the series of superimposed beds
there are points more remarkable than others, on account of
the changes they exhibit, both in the deposits and in the             in
habitants of the same country, to be struck with the accordance
 of the two orders of considerations above noticed.
    Among those observations which render it impossible to
 consider the dislocation of beds which characterizes a moun
 tainous country as the result of local phaenomena, which may
 have been repeated in an irregular and successive manner,
 we may place in the first rank the constancy of the direction
 in which sedimentary beds are tilted up even for immense
 distances.                                         -
    Practice has   taught   miners from time immemorial the prin
 ciple of constancy in directions, and it is one of those circum
 stances which they most usefully employ in their researches.
 The observation of constancy in the direction of beds in the
 coal-measures, has served to discover a bed of coal at a             di
 stance, though invisible on the surface. It was by combining
 the observations made in numerous metallic mines, that Wer
 ner arrived at the conclusion, that, in the same district, all
 the veins of the same nature were due to cracks parallel to
 each other, formed at the same time, and subsequently filled
 at the same period.       The remarkable phaenomenon of con
 stancy of direction has been gradually shown to be more im
 portant, by the labours of those geologists who since De
 Saussure and Pallas have attentively examined mountain
 chains.    It has been admitted by degrees, that the circum
 stance which best characterizes mountain-chains, when com
 pared with each other, is the direction which the elevation
 of the beds has impressed upon them,--a direction naturally
 observable in the crests composed of such beds. For more
 than thirty years M. Humboldt has pointed out the equally
 remarkable accordances and discrepancies observable in the
 direction of mountain-chains, whether close to, or remote from,
 each other.     M. von Buch has also shown that the mountains
 of  Germany    are divisible into at least four systems, clearly
 distinguishable from each other by their directions.         So clear
 a mode of distinction even led him to conceive that the various
 mountain systems were produced by phaenomena independent
 of each other; and it is at the same time very probable, that
 not only, as is proved by observation,     all beds upheaved    at  the
 same time have been      so  raisedin  the same direction, but also
 that this constancy  of in the direction  of  the upraised beds   in  a
 certain assemblage       mountains,  is  the result of this collection
                                                                      of

     the Revolutions which have taken place on the Globe.                           245
of beds having    been thrown up at the same time by a single
effort of nature: whence it would follow that the number of
the epochs of elevation would not be unlimited, but that it
would at least be equal to that of the directions of those chains
which are clearly distinct,     a number not incompatible with
that of the solutions of continuity observable in the sedimen
tary deposits.
    It became necessary, in order to carry the subject beyond
these vague and general views, that a comparison should be
instituted between the number of those lines of demarcation
observable in the sedimentary deposits, and the same number
of mountain systems. It has been attempted to accomplish
this by combining the two great principles above noticed;
namely, that the highly inclined sedimentary beds are up
heaved strata, and that in each mountainous district all the
beds upheaved at the same moment have been so raised in the
same general direction.
    The examination of the surface of Europe has in this man
ner already led to the determination, both with respect to age
and direction, of the twelve systems of mountains to be suc
cessively noticed in the sequel, as also their relation to twelve
solutions of continuity observed in the series of sedimentary
deposits.
    I. System of Westmoreland and of the Hundsruck-The cor
respondence of this nature which may be referred to the most
ancient geological epoch has been made known by the re
searches of Professor Sedgwick, recently communicated to the
 Geological Society of London. The mean line of bearing of
the different systems of slate rocks in the lake mountains of
 Westmoreland, is shown by this author to be nearly N.E. by
 E., and S.W. by W. This causes them to abut successively
 against the carboniferous zone; from which it follows that
they must also be unconformable to            Professor Sedgwick

where they are in general but slightly removed from their
original horizontal position. Such are also the transition rocks,
so rich in organic remains, of Dudley and Gloucestershire,
which appear to have been deposited at the foot of the pre
viously elevated mountains of Wales, and which are them
selves only affected by dislocations of a more recent date.
   Such would also appear to be a part of the transition beds
of Southern Ireland, known by the recent researches of Mr.
 Weaver. This distinguished geologist remarks that some
parts of the system resemble, both in mineralogical and zoo
logical characters, the rocks of Tortworth in Gloucestershire.
The principal rock masses in the South of Ireland are com
posed of grauwacké, quartz rock, and limestone; they con
tain crinoidal remains, Trilobites, Orthoceratites, Ellipsolites,
Ammonites, Euomphalites, Turbinites, Neritites, Melanites, and
several species of Terebratula, Spirifer, Producta, and other
bivalves, Hysterolites, and many genera of Polyparia. The
anthracite and accompanying pyritiferous strata are charged
with the remains or impressions of plants, belonging chiefly
to the genera Equisetum and Calamites, with traces of Fu
coides.
   The transition rocks of the Bocage (Calvados) and the       in
                                       Fº
terior of Britanny bear a great resemblance to those described
by Mr. Weaver in the South of Ireland.      They are like them
composed of numerous beds of slate,                 quartz rock,
and limestone, containing fossils of the same class, and pre
senting mines of anthracite.
   Finally,  I am induced to refer to the same epoch the slate
and  grauwacké   rocks with anthracite (worked for profitable
purposes, and which contain vegetable impressions differing
but little from those discovered in the coal-measures), which
form the S.E. angle of the Vosges, and which appear to rest
against the granitic masses of the environs of Gerarmer, Re
miremont, and Tillot; masses which probably were themselves
raised at the formation of the old N.E. and S.W. lines of
elevated strata.    Independently of the geological relations
which are apparent between the different parts of the vast
deposit of transition rocks above noticed, they have also in
common remained unaffected by the ancient N.E. and S.W.
system.
   When these beds are not horizontal, they are dislocated
in directions the most marked of which, probably produced
immediately after their deposit, is comprised between an
E. and W. line and one E. 15° S. and W. 15° N. Thus
the masses of granite and porphyry which, in the S.E. part
                                                                of

  of the  Vosges, constitute the summits of the Ballon d'Alsace
  and the Ballon de Comté, range from E. 10° or 15° S. to W.
  10° or 15° N., and have thrown up the anthracitic rocks in
  this direction. The coal-measures of Ronchamps are deposited
  at the foot of these mountains on the edges of the upheaved
  beds.   The Ballon d’Alsace rises 2586 English feet above the
  town of Giromagny, built on a level with the coal-measures;
 and the Ballon de Gebweiler, situated more to the N.E., rises
  3067 English feet above the same point. Among those in
 equalities on the surface of the globe, the date of which we
 can with probability refer to so remote an epoch, we cannot
 cite any more considerable.
     The transition beds of Britanny and of the Bocage of Nor
 mandy, on which the coal-measures of Littry and Plessis
 are deposited, run in a direction comprised within the above
 mentioned limits, as is also the case with the transition beds
 of Ireland, so ably described by Mr. Weaver. The South of
 Ireland is a hilly and diversified region, composed of ridges
 having generally an east and west direction, and attaining
 their greatest elevation in the mountains of Kerry, where Gur
 rane Tval, one of Magillycuddy's Reeks, near Killarney, rises
 3410 feet above the sea. The transition rocks of the same
 region have a general direction from east to west, and dip
 to the north and south with vertical beds in the axes of the
 ridges. The strata, as they diminish in inclination, on each
 side form a succession of troughs, the beds dipping rapidly to
 the north or south, and bending to horizontality between the
 ridges.
    These rocks decline gradually towards the north, and finally
pass beneath the unconformable deposits of the old red sand
 stone and carboniferous limestone of the midland counties; a
 discordance rendered particularly striking by the horizontal
position of the carboniferous limestone of some districts.
    In Devonshire and Somersetshire the grauwacké and slates,
sometimes containing small seams of carbonaceous matter, also
present a nearly east and west direction, and are seen clearly
to have been upheaved previous to the deposition of the Exeter
red conglomerate or todte liegende, because the latter covers
the edges of the former, as may be seen in many situations.
    The grauwacké chain of Magdeburg has also a direction
comprised within the above-noticed limits; and according to
the observations of Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison,
it contains the abundant impressions of true coal plants. This
same direction is again observed in the older rocks of the
Hartz, where we are certain that the dislocations were in part
                                                        effected

      the Revolutions which have taken place on the Globe.                                      249
effectedprior to the deposition of the secondary beds which
extend at the foot of the mountains; and particularly before
the formation of the coal-measures of Ilefeld.
   This system, joined to that previously noticed, and perhaps
also to others which have not yet been studied, has produced
an undulated surface and a dislocated structure in the ancient
land (ur und uebergangsgebirge), in the inequalities of which
the first beds of that mass of rocks was deposited which
Werner named floetz gebirge, and the English and French
geologists secondary deposits, deposits of which the carboni
ferous series (old red sandstone, mountain limestone, and coal
measures) constitutes the lowest part.
  III.   System of the North of England.—From the latitude of
Derby to the frontiers of Scotland, the surface of England is
divided by a mountainous axis, which, taken as a whole, runs
nearly from south to north, stretching a little towards the
N.N.W. In that chain which, being wholly formed of beds
of the carboniferous series, is called the great carboniferous
chain of the North of England, the forces of elevation appear
on the whole to have acted (though not without considerable
deviations) on a line bearing nearly north and south (inclining
but a few degrees to the N.N.W. and S.S.E.).                Hence great
faults have originated, by one of which                 western limit  its                       is
tracked through the Peak            Derbyshire.  of  This      prolonged         is
through         an                           high

               anticlinal line into the             western moors
Yorkshire, and there the western escarpment                  the chain       of

                     enormous breaks from the heart               Craven              of
to  the foot     of
                 Stainmoor. Another enormous              break,  passing
under the escarpment            the Cross-fell range, meets the pro
                                       of

                   the Craven fault                          an

the lake mountains             once explained.

     InProfessor Sedgwick's memoir, whence the above                  de                   is
rived, we find direct proofs that                      all
                                             the fractures above men
tioned took place immediately before the formation                    the                  of
conglomerates             of
                      the new red sandstone (rothe todte liegende),
 and      he
          affords the strongest reasons for believing that they
 were  produced           by    an
                          action both violent and        short duration;of
 for we  pass     once from the inclined and
                     at                             disrupted   masses                           to
 the horizontal conglomerates now resting upon them; and
                no         any effect that indicates       slow progress
 there    is   trace           of of                                         a

 250         Elie de Beaumont's Researches on some       of
    The elevation of the chain of the North of England has
 very probably not been an isolated phaenomenon.        If we glance
 at the  geological map  of  England    by  Mr.   Greenough,     and
 that which accompanies the memoir of Dr. Buckland and
 Mr. Conybeare on the environs of Bristol, we are naturally
 led to remark that the problematical rocks which pierce and
 dislocate the coal deposits of Shrewsbury and Colebrooke
 Dale, and those which constitute the Malvern Hills, appear
 connected with a series of fractures which run nearly north
 and south, being prolonged across the recent transition beds
 and the carboniferous rocks to the environs of Bristol.
    The coast, with a north and south direction, which bounds
 the western part of the department of La Manche, may pro
 bably also be due to a fracture of the same class as those of
 the great carboniferous chain of the North of England.
    IV. System of the Pays Bas and of South Wales.—From the
 environs of Aix-la-Chapelle to the small isles of St. Bride's
 Bay, Pembrokeshire, over a length of about four hundred
 English miles, the different portions of the carboniferous series,
wherever they are not concealed from observation by more
recent formations, are seen in a greater or less state of com
plete dislocation.    There are situations, as at Liége, Mons,
 Valenciennes, the Boulognais, and the Mendip Hills, where
they have suffered very considerable contortions and disloca
tions. Throughout a large portion of this extent, these beds,
 which in no part rise to great heights, are covered by more
recent deposits, resting horizontally on their edges.       The vast
sheet of recent deposits which covers the carboniferous series
between the environs of Boulogne and those of Bristol, might,
even throw doubt on the mutual connection of the dislocations
in the Pays Bas and the coasts of the Bristol Channel: it is
nevertheless certain that the dislocations in both situations
possess common characters; such as not widely differing from
an east and west direction, without however preserving the
same line of bearing for great distances, and only producing
small protuberances on the surface of the land, notwithstand
ing the contortions of the beds in the interior.
    In the environs of Liége and Aix-la-Chapelle, the direction
of the carboniferous beds becomes nearly parallel to that of
the argillaceous slates and grauwacké of the Eiffel and the
Hundsruck; but it is probable that this arises from the frac
tures of the carboniferous series having been inflected in such
a manner as to follow the ancient dislocations of the pre
existing rocks; for it would be difficult not to admit, from the
facts previously noticed, that the elevation of the slate and grau
wacké of the Eiffel and the Hundsruck, following a direction
                                                              nearly

     the Revolutions which have taken place on the Globe.                      251
nearly N.E. and S.W., was not referrible, like that of the
analogous rocks in Westmoreland, to a much more remote
enoch.
 Pº.    dislocation of the coal-measures of Saarbruck is also
probably referrible to the same epoch as that of Glamorgan
shire and the Pays Bas, as it offers nearly the same direction
and characters.
   In the environs of Bristol the magnesian conglomerate
horizontally covers the edges of the dislocated carboniferous
beds, and the grès de Vosges is seen at Saarbruck in the same
position.    The elevation of the beds now under consideration
ought therefore to be anterior to the deposition of the mag
nesian conglomerate of Bristol and of the grès de Vosges;
but as the todte-liegendes (grés rouge), properly so called,
does not on any point rest on the carboniferous beds elevated
in the direction in question, we may be permitted to presume
that their elevation took place after the deposit of the todte
liegendes.
    V. System of the Rhine. — The Vosges and the Swartzwald
form two groups of mountains, to a certain extent symmetrical,
terminating one opposite the other in two long cliffs, the ge
neral directions of which are parallel to each other, and to
the course of the Rhine which flows between them from Bale
to Mayence. These two cliffs, between which extends the great
valley of Alsace, are the most clearly defined characters of
that assemblage of mountains which M. von Buch has grouped
together under the name of the system of the Rhine. They
are partly formed by beds of the grès de Vosges, and appear
due to great fractures or faults, with a direction nearly S. 15°
W., and N. 15° E., which have broken them after their depo
sition. The epoch of this disturbance has necessarily preceded
that of the deposition of  allthose beds which extend from one
cliff the
     to      other, forming  the slightly undulating base      the          of
basin   ofAlsace, and  among  which occur the red       variegatedor
sandstone (grés bigarré), the muschelkalk, and the variegated
marls (marnes irisées).    The last three formations have ex
                                                                            byof

sea during that period       tranquillity which succeeded those
                         of of
commotions, the effects     which have been       well preserved.

the lignite deposits, such as those of Fureau (Bouches du Rhone),
and Koepfnach (Switzerland).            The grès de Fontainebleau,
resting on the marls of the gypseous formation, is the lowest
portion of this series, in the same manner that the lias sand
stone, resting on the variegated marls (marnes irisées), is the
lowest portion of the oolitic series.       The former is to the ter
tiary arkose of Auvergne, what the latter is to the Jurassic
arkose of Avallon.        The two tertiary series are not less                                 di
stinguished by the remains of the large animals which they
contain, than by their mode of occurrence.              Certain species
of  Anoplotherium     and Palaeotherium discovered at Montmartre,
characterize the former, whilst other species of Palaeotherium

256         Elie de Beaumont's Researches on    some of
and that of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, are respectively
nearly parallel to those of the system of Westmoreland and the
Hundsruck, of the system of the Ballons and the hills of the
Bocage, and of the system of the North of England. The cor
responding directions only differ in a few degrees, and the two
series have succeeded each other in the same order; leading to
the supposition that there has been a kind of periodical recur
rence of the same, or nearly the same, directions of elevation.
   XI. System of the Western Alps.-The opinions in accord
ance with which M. Jurine named the granitic rock constitu
ting Mont Blanc Protogine, can no longer be sustained. The
tertiary beds which have been deposited horizontally in that
part of the valley of the Rhone which runs N. and S. are
constantly contorted and thrown up as they approach the
Alps. A similar observation has been made in the valley of
the Danube by Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison, who
found the cretaceous and tertiary beds to extend horizontally
to the foot of the Bohemian mountains, and to be thrown up
on entering the Austrian Alps. Messrs. Lyell and Murchi
son have made analogous observations on the tertiary rocks
of Lombardy.      Professor Buckland and M. Brongniart have
pointed out the tertiary aspect of the fossil shells discovered
at the Diablerets, at more than 8000 feet above the level of
the sea; shells the relative age of which certainly does not go
back beyond the last portion of the cretaceous epoch.
    Although we are generally accustomed to consider the
union of those mountains bearing the single name of the Alps
as constituting an undivided whole, we can easily recognise
that this vast assemblage is due to the crossing of several
systems, independent of each other, and distinct both in age
and direction.     We should therefore not feel surprise that
their structure is more confused than that of a chain thrown
up by a single effort, such as the Pyrenees. Throughout nearly
their whole extent, and especially on their eastern side, we
still perceive traces of numerous small chains of mountains
with the same direction as the Pyrenees, and elevated in like
manner prior to the deposition of the tertiary rocks. The
system of Mont Viso is strongly marked in the French Alps.
These traces of comparatively ancient dislocations are, how
ever, often marked by disturbances of a more recent date.
   The highest and most complicated portions of the Alps,
those near the Mont Blanc, Mont Rose, and the Finsteraar
horn, are principally due to the crossing of two recent systems
which meet at an angle of from 45° to 50°, and which are      di
stinguishable from the system of Mont Viso and the Pyreneo
Apennine system, as well by their age as their directions.     In
                                                    consequence

           the Revolutions which have taken place on the Globe.                           257
    consequence of the crossing of these two systems of furrows
    and ridges, the French Alps form an elbow near the Mont
    Blanc, and after having followed a direction from E. 4° N.E.
    to W. 4° S.W. from Austria to the Valais, they suddenly
    turn to fall into a line from N.N.E. to S.S.W. If there was
    only a simple curve in a single chain of mountains which
    merely formed an arch, we should find the direction of the
    beds to bend and pass from the direction of one of the sy
    stems to that of the other.     We however observe, that the
    direction of the beds and crests distinctly belong either to one
    or to the other, and that the two systems penetrate each other,
    as we should conceive they must do if they are the produc
    tions of two entirely distinct phaenomena.
       In the Western Alps, that is to say, to the westward of the
    St. Gothard, and particularly in the mountains of Savoy and
    Dauphiny, the greater part of the dislocations are referrible
    to two systems of ridges, the mean direction of which is N.N.E.
    and S.S.W., or more exactly N. 26° E., and S. 26° W. The
    constant direction of the beds in these mountains has long
    since been remarked by De Saussure, and more recently by
    M. Brochant; and they with reason concluded, that in              those        all

which there is a want of continuity, and a sudden variation
of character, constituting a new interruption in the series of
sedimentary deposits.
    The waters which have transported the materials of the
first of these formations would appear to have been received
into lakes of fresh water which covered, in one direction, the
 N.W. portion of the department of the Isère, La Bresse, and
perhaps, Alsace, and even the environs of the lake of Con
stance; and in the other, the portion of the department of the
Basses Alpes between Digne, Manosque, and Barjols: whilst
the materials of the second formation appear to have been
violently carried by temporary currents which have discharged
themselves into the Mediterranean.          These latter currents
are generally known as diluvial currents, though they offer
nothing in common with the Deluge of history, and though
their passage took place before the human race appeared on
our continent, where they destroyed animals of species now
extinct.    Discussions will still perhaps be carried on respect
ing their origin, which may have merely been the result of
the melting of the snows, instantaneously effected when the
principal chain of the Alps was elevated; but it seems generally
admitted that their passage immediately followed the last dis
location of the Alpine strata.
    If we cast a general glance on the Alps and neighbouring
 countries, we may observe that the crests of the St. Baume,
the Lebaron, the Ventoux, and the Montagne de Poet, in the
 South of France, the principal chain of the Alps from the
 Valais to Austria, and the less elevated crest, comprising the
 Pilate, &c. in Switzerland, are so many different chains, which,
 notwithstanding their inequality, are comparable with each
 other both as respects their parallelism and their common
 analogies to the system of the Western Alps. This parallelism
and these analogies would alone afford us powerful reasons
for believing that the whole of these mountain-chains were
formed at the same time, and are only different parts of a single
 system of fractures produced at the same moment.           We can
at furthest conceive the idea of   dividing  them into two groups,
 —that of   Provence,  and that of the Alps;   but we are prevented
 from doing this by the analogous relations observable among
 the different fractures, and by a general movement which we
 may consider the surface of a part of France to have suffered
 when it contracted a double slope; ascending in one direction
 from Dijon and Bourges towards Le Forez and Auvergne,
 and on the other from the shores of the Mediterranean towards
 the same countries. These opposed slopes present at their
junction a kind of crest, situated precisely in the line of eleya

 tion of the principal chain of the Alps. This line, which may
be observed to run in a more     or less marked manner from the
confines of    Hungary   to  Auvergne,   appears to be connected
with the   principal anomalies unveiled in the interior structure
of our continent by geodesical measurements and observations
with the pendulum.       We may even suppose that the forma
tion of this line gave, as it were, the signal for the appearance
of the craters of elevation of the Cantal and Mont d’Or, round
which the volcanic cones of Auvergne have been subsequently
thrown up.
    The two opposite slopes, above mentioned, were not pro
duced until after the existence of those lakes in which the
older transported substances were accumulated; for it can be
ascertained that the bottom of the lake which covered La
Bresse and the N.W. portion of the department of the Isère
has suffered a considerable elevation from the north towards
the south, and that the bottom of the lake which extended
between Digne, Manosque, and Barjols, has been elevated to
a great degree from the south towards the north.
    The ancient deposits of transported substances, forming
horizontal beds at the bottom of the latter of these lakes, on
the edges of tertiary deposits, previously dislocated when the
Western Alps were thrown up, are in their turn dislocated near
Mezel (Basses Alpes) in the direction of the small chains which
                                  -
ridge Provence, such as the Ventoux and Lebaron, parallel
to the principal chain of the Alps.
    To determine the date of this last order of dislocations it
will be sufficient to remark, that the diluvian deposit is in no
part affected; that it covers the edges of the dislocated beds
with no other slope than that which the current impressed on
them at their origin; and that thus the elevation of the beds
in question necessarily took place between the older deposit of
transported substances and the passage of the diluvian cur
rentS.
     If weattentively consider, on a terrestrial globe of suffi
cient size and good execution, the most prominent and the
most recent systems of mountains which ridge. Europe, we
may remark that each of them forms a part of a vast system
of parallel chains, which extends, far beyond the countries

these vast systems, of which the European systems are re
spectively portions, originates in a single epoch of dislocation.
                         I
From this view am led to suppose, for example, that the
principal chain of the Alps is contemporaneous with a vast
assemblage of mountain-chains which spread round the Medi
terranean, and being prolonged across the continent of Asia,
run parallel to a great circle which should pass through the
middle of Morocco and the north of the Birman empire, and
appear at the same time connected with each other by paral
lelism and by the similarity of their relations to the great de
pressions of surface filled by the sea, or but slighty raised
above      its
          level. Besides the principal chain            the Alps,                  of
and the small chains       Provence,of this system  comprises,                                           in
Europe, the Sierra Morena, and         large portion     the Spa

nish chains, on the one hand, and the Balkan on the other:                                               in
Africa,     includes the Atlas:
            it                       Asia, the central trachytic

        of                            the peak       by
                                                   Elbrouz, more              of
elevated than the Mont Blanc,      also the long series    moun                          of

contain the most elevated mountains on the surface of the
earth.
I     am also led        to suppose that the system   the Western Alps   of
constitutes      a    portion      vast system, comprising the chain
                                   of   a                                                                of

Cape Tres Furcas       Cape Blanc, and the Littoral Cordilera

                 I          suppose that the chains

 that paroxysms of internal energy, accompanied by the eleva

whole regions of the earth, were a part of the mechanism of
 Nature; and what has happened again and again, from the
most ancient up to the most modern periods, may have hap
pened once during the few thousand years that man has been
living on          its

nearly rigorous constancy of their temperature, in order that
they should not cease to embrace their internal masses ex
actly, the temperature of which diminishes sensibly. They
must therefore depart in a slight and progressive manner
from the spheroidal figure proper to them, and corresponding
to a maximum of capacity; and the gradually increasing
tendency to revert to that figure, whether it acts alone, or
whether it combines with other internal causes of change
which the planets may contain, may, with great probability,
completely account for the ridges and protuberances which
have been suddenly formed at intervals on the external crust
of the earth, and probably also of    the other planets.all

   The late W.    Phillips says,  “it cleaves parallel the planes                          to

   Mr. Haidinger,            Treatise
                               in    his    Mineralogy, says thaton                                           º
Epidote and Zoizite are easily distinguished by their colours.

Zoizite, differing from the angle         Epidote,      says; “this

 The temperature of the atmosphere            was about 64°   during
 these observations.
    Exp. 2.     A bar of soft iron, of the same dimensions as that
 of platinum,   was substituted for the latter in the register. The
 experiment was repeated five times; twice with the register
 immersed in the mercury, and three times exposed only to the
 vapour.    The time of exposure varied from twenty minutes
 to ten, from the first moment when the metal began to boil.

 appropriate expansions.

  Exp. 4. It was a principal object to ascertain whether any
and what difference existed in the expansion of different spe
cimens of the black-lead earthenware: two or three registers
which I had cut out of the same crucible gave me almost
identical results by exposure to boiling mercury.      then se                           I
lected another   specimen  by  a different manufacturer.    Its
grain was very fine, and                   its
                              texture more close and compact

reading was precisely the same.     The expansion was there

                       *)
                   will exceed 1 when a exceeds 30°.
    This calculation may, however, be abbreviated,   as the cal
culation of a b may be saved by immediately substituting the
values of (15) in the equations (16).   Combining the value of
a b with one of the equations (16) in which the same differences
of the excentric anomalies occur, for instance, the third equa
tion (15) with the first (16), we obtain
k(,-4)–(0          1   2)=        (1+3*****{}**::::::::=2}+:
                                     tang 2 &   4 sin (3–2)? sin 2).
consequently in every equation we shall have a function of this
form:                    2a –sin 2 v
                X (a) =      4 sin wº
whose value may be given in a table.
  The function may be reduced to the following form:
             X (a) =              # 2      (1   + cotanga")—# cotang                     w
                   =              }a       +    #   (a cotang      w–1)        cotang a

noulli, viz.

changes between a = 0 and r = } ºr from # to 3 ºr ; and the
introduction of this quantity would have the additional ad
vantage that, if two equations were combined, in which 3–2

of sin (3–2) and sin (3+2) is very simply represented by
equations (9). As this advantage, however, disappears in the
case of the other combinations, it appears more convenient to
use tables for the function:

are required, being so very simple, and the calculation being
more than sufficiently accurate if conducted with five decimal
places, the time required for the calculation is not very con
siderable.   If cases should occur in which observations only
for which r exceeds 90° could be combined, one might either
directly calculate the formula, or use this form:
  (28)           w(x) = *(180–2)–

  It appears to be most convenient to begin with trials of
assumed values of a. We have agreeably to the above-given
notation:
                       a = }(E,-Es)      3 (E3–E).   –
   It will      easily be decided whether a is to be taken negative
or positive, whenever it differs considerably from 0. If there
is no semi-revolution between any two successive observations,
a will always be < 45°. The quantities 3 + x, y + 3, being
by their nature always positive, and at the same time < 180°,
if the period of the observations does not embrace a whole
revolution the quadrants in which 3 and y are to be taken, are
consequently fully determined.
    As soon as a, 3, y and then likewise a b have been deter
mined, only two of the equations (4) are required for deter
mining a, b, and s, and for obtaining, consequently, the pro
jected ellipsis in magnitude and position with regard to the
 star at rest.          If,

   To make the mathematical axis (or line of rotation) of the
transit parallel to the horizon, the line of collimation of the
object-glass A, and afterwards that of B, must be rendered
parallel to the line of rotation. This will be the case when
the line of collimation of the telescope C, placed against either
object-glass, preserves during a revolution of the axis of the

              cursory soever be the survey we take of the present state
          of physical science, we must be convinced how extensively
dependent it is upon the Differential and Integral Calculi, in some
or other of their varied modifications.            So complete, indeed, is this
dependence, that he who attempts to pursue any one branch of
           inquiry beyond                   its
                                    simplest and most elementary state, will

more logical clearness, displayed in a happy development of first
principles, than the subsequent investigation commonly exhibits. At
all events, it is a task in which there are more failures than are com
mensurate with the difficulty; except it be admitted that to produce a
good elementary book be an undertaking of a higher order than is
commonly supposed. In mathematical science this is peculiarly the
case; and in that branch to which Mr. Young's book is devoted, this
difficulty has been felt more strongly than, perhaps, in any other. The
universal complaints which we hear of the unintelligibility, not to say
inconclusiveness, of the processes and reasonings which stand at
the threshhold of the Differential Calculus, must convince us that
there is a radical defect somewhere, and stimulate our search for its
place and         its
               essential character.

pher.     Many explications and discussions have appeared at different
times, more or less converging towards a correct theory of these
cases; and we think the doctrine may be called complete as it ap
pears in the work of Mr. Young *.
    The doctrine of curves and curve surfaces is also developed with a
neatness and elegance which we do not recollect to have seen in any
English work; and though Mr. Young refers to Monge and Leroy as
the authors whom he has principally had in view as models, yet upon
looking into the work of the latter, we remark several great improve
ments in the execution; and as to that of the former, the portions which
it could contribute to any elementary work are necessarily very few.
We were particularly pleased with the demonstrations of the theo
rems of Euler and Meusnier upon the curvatures of surfaces, and with
the somewhat novel way in which the evolutes of curves of double
curvature are explained (p. 224.).      Regard, however, must be had
to a little correction on p. 225, as supplied in the Errata. We have
remarked a few typographical errors in other parts of the work which
it would be well to annex to the list already given, and which we
hope the publisher will do.     The paralogisms of some other writers,
—distinguished ones too—are pointed out in the Preface, and in the
body of the work; and many steps which have hitherto been deemed
unquestionable, have been shown by Mr. Young to be altogether
fallacious.    We wonder, indeed, when we see them pointed out, why
 they did not occur to ourselves nor to anybody else till now ; and
 we look upon the aptitude displayed in these detections to be highly
 characteristic of a mind which looks with a laudable anxiety to the
 purity of the fundamental principles of science.
    The advantages furnished by the Syndics of the Cambridge Univer
 sity press in bringing out mathematical books, amounts almost to a
 monopoly; and the general prepossession of the public in favour of
 Cambridge men actually completes that monopoly, and shuts the
 door against           all
                   competition from mathematicians less advantageously

ther the well-intended attempt of the founders of those funds to
encourage the publication of valuable books has not been indirectly
the cause of much injury to science, by shutting out from the contest
all but a privileged body of competitors. It is like a statesman who
shall offer a bounty to one manufacturer and refuse it to another: it
is easy to see the consequences of the latter, and draw the parallel
between the two cases.        And           effect has been greatly aggra

between Nerve and Muscle.” By Wm. Charles Henry, M.D., Phy
sician to the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Communicated by Wm.
Henry, M.D., F.R.S.
   It has long been a subject of controversy among physiologists
whether muscular contraction is the immediate consequence of the
action of a stimulus on the muscular fibre, or whether it is neces
sarily dependent on a change taking place in the nerve distributed
to the muscle, and excited by the stimulus.    This question, the
author observes, is one which, from             very nature,      its
                                                                  incapable                    is                      of
a  direct solution, because the intimate connection             nervous fibres            of
with every part           of
                        the muscles renders         impossible      distinguish

    primarily made. The continuance                the motions     ofthe heart                      of

entire removal            of
                        the heart from the body, has been adduced                                                      as
 an  argument       the independence
                     of                      the contractile property

clusive, because the nervous fibres remaining                 the heart, and

   The inefficacy of opium applied to the cardiac nerves in arresting
the motions of the heart has often been alleged as a proof that those
motions are independent of the nerves. But the author found on
trial that a solution of opium injected into the cavities of the heart,
or introduced into the intestine, immediately arrested the muscular
actions of these organs.
   These phenomena appear to the author to accord best with the
hypothesis that the immediate antecedent of the
                                                   contractions of the
muscular fibre is a change in the ultimate nervous filament distri
buted to that fibre.
   A paper was read, entitled, “Experiments on the Length of the
Seconds' Pendulum; made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich."
By Captain Edward Sabine, of the Royal Regiment of Artillery,
F.R.S.
   The experiments described in this paper were made with the
original convertible pendulum constructed by Capt. Kater, and em
ployed by the author in Portland Place, in the year 1817; except that
  the tail pieces were removed, and the moveable weight dispensed
 with: and they were made on the vacuum apparatus established in
 the south-west angle of the Pendulum-room, the place assigned for
 it by the Astronomer Royal. Having had reason to suspect that the
 retardation of the vibrations of the pendulum performed in circular
 arcs, when the weight was above, was greater
                                                        than that assigned by
 the formula commonly employed, the author first investigates the
 correction necessary to be applied from this cause. He next as
 certains the reduction to a vacuum for the small residue of air
 which the apparatus still contained, or for the small portion which
 may have introduced itself by leakage.            The alteration of rate for
 each degree of Fahrenheit is then determined to be 0.441, a quan
 tity almost exactly the same as that which was
                                                              deduced from a
 former inquiry. The result of the present inquiry               that the vibra            is,

the mind is guided by the perceptions received from the sense of
touch, in interpreting the signs furnished us by the sight, the author
proposes to explain these phaenomena by an hypothesis of his own,
which he states in the following words. “Over and above the gift
of two external or cranial eyes, man has been by his adorable
Creator endowed with an internal cerebral organ, which performs
the office of a third eye, by being the common recipient of impres
sions propagated either from one, or both of the external eyes; and
the mind, in her chamber of percipience, steers with regard to ex
termal objects by the same principle on which the mariner steers by
his compass. Thus the two cranial eyes are analogous, in principle
and situation, to two magnetic compasses placed upon a ship's deck;
while the third, or cerebral eye, corresponds to another compass
placed in the cabin below; and the mind, situated like the captain
mariner in his cabin, knows, from consulting the cerebral eye, on
what point of direction the body is steering; although the mind no
more perceives either any external object, nor yet any image in the
cranial eye, than the mariner perceives (even in the vulgar sense
of the word perceiving) the far-off land, or haven, towards which he
is surely making his way.”

     The object of the first paper is to show that every substance
  susceptible of magnetism by induction, when interposed as a screen,
  tends to arrest the action of a magnet upon a third substance: this
  intercepting power being directly as the mass and inversely as the
  susceptibility to induced magnetism. Thus, although a single plate
  of iron, about the sixteenth of an inch thick, effectually intercepts
  the action of a revolving magnet on a disc of copper, the same re
  sult is not obtained when the disc acted upon is also of iron, instead
  of being of copper; unless the mass of iron interposed be very con
  siderable.    The screening influence he found to depend on the mass
  of iron that is interposed, and not on the surface merely. He was
  led to suspect that a similar effect might be obtained by employing
  substances not of a ferruginous nature, provided they were inter
  posed in considerable masses, and the result of his trials justified
  his conjecture.     An account is given of several experiments made
  with large masses of silver, copper, or zinc, of about four inches in
  thickness, which being interposed between a revolving magnetic
  plate and a delicately suspended disc of tinned iron, completely in
  tercepted the action of the magnet on the iron.
     The author considers this interceptive property to be more or
 less common to every class of substance; and that in order to render
 it sensible, it is only necessary to employ the bodies in masses, bear
 ing some direct ratio to their respective magnetic energies. Thus
 lead, having a weaker magnetic energy than copper, must be em
 ployed in a larger mass in order to produce an equal effect; and to
 render the screening power of ice sensible would require it to be
 above thirty feet in thickness.         instead        If,

in both these ways at the same time. But these different modes of
action appear to be in some inverse ratio of each other: for when
the retentive or absorbing power of the substance is considerable,
the power of the magnet becomes soon controlled; because the par
ticles of the substance first acted upon, begin to operate as screens
to the succeeding ones, and the induced magnetism, after a certain
point, proceeds entirely by communication from particle to particle,
until the whole power is expended. When, on the contrary, the
retentive power of the given substance is small, little or no screen
ing energy exists between              particles,  its  which case the magnetic

  A paper was read, “On the Atmosphere of Mars.” By Sir James
South, F.R.S.
  The author refers the origin of the hypothesis of the “Extensive
Atmosphere of Mars” to the observations of Cassini and Roener,
made at Briare and Paris in the year 1672. By the former it would
seem that a star     of the fifth magnitude became invisible with a
three-feet   telescope  when at a distance of six minutes from the
planet; whilst by the latter the same star, after having undergone
occultation by the planet, could not be perceived with a large tele
scope till Mars had receded from it a distance equal to two thirds
of his own diameter; although with the same instrument stars of
similar magnitude might be easily distinguished even when in con
tact with the moon's limb.
   As opposed to these observations, the author advances his own.
One, dated Blackman-street, February 19, 1822, in which a star of
the ninth magnitude as seen with the five-feet equatorial suffered no
diminution of      its
                    apparent magnitude,            distance     at
                                                                103 seconds

                                           the planet, was perceived after
emersion, when only one second and one tenth from it; the instru
ments  of observation     this instance were the five-feet equatorial and
                                 in
the thirty-inch Gregorian reflector, the former instrument being used
by the author, the latter                  by
                                Mr. Henry South. The third was made
at Campden Hill,            on

eight-feet achromatic        six inches aperture; and

 37 Tauri was with power         320 seen actually touching the planet's

brightness than might fairly          attributed be   the diffused lightto                            of
the  planet.
   From these observations, and the apparently contradictory ones
of                 ofRoener, the author         this paper infers, that the
                                                               of of

meriting further investigation.
   He then directs attention        the fact that 37 Tauri was of
                                                to                      red                      a

easily reconcilable, and that    hypothesis     an

rays passed by the edge of the body, without suffering any deviation
from a rectilinear course.           It is well known that, under these cir
cumstances, the real shadow is broader than the geometrical
shadow, indicating a deflexion of the rays from the edge of the
intercepting body.           By varying the distances at which the obser
vations are taken, it is found that the rays are not bent at a sharp
angle, but pursue a curvilinear course, the concavity of which is
towards the shadow, the curve itself resembling an hyperbola.                           A
luminous halo also appears beyond the shadow ; the breadth of
this halo agreeing accurately, at                           all

            June 28, 1831.        Rev. W. Kirby in the Chair.
   Mr.   Vigors   exhibited,  on the part of Captain Cook, specimens of
several Birds    recently  presented   by that gentleman to the Society,
and also of some other Birds shot by him in the South of Europe,
some of which were interesting on account of their rarity, and others
with reference to the localities in which they were obtained. Among
them was a specimen of the Pica cyanea (Corvus cyaneus, Pall.), a
species not included by M. Temminck in the ‘’Oiseaux d'Europe',
which had been killed by Captain Cook in Spain. There were also
specimens of the Falco tinnunculoides ; of the Sturnus unicolor,
Marm., killed in Spain; of the Lanius meridionalis, Temm., a species
referable to the genus Collurio as recently distinguished by Mr.
Vigors; of the Sylvia conspicillata, Marm., killed in Spain; of the
Saricolae cachinnans and stapazina, Temm., also killed in Spain; and
of the Fringilla domestica, Linn., which is met with in great num
bers in Spain, and consequently extends far beyond the southern
limits assigned to the species by M. Temminck.
   A collection of Birds presented to the Society by H. H. Lindsay,
Esq. of Canton, were laid upon the table. They were accompanied
by a letter from that gentleman to the Secretary, of the date of
Jan. 25, 1831, stating that the collection had been formed during
the summer of the previous year in the neighbourhood of Manilla,
and adding some notes respecting the various species, as well as the
names in the Tagallo or native language of the country. The col
lection consisted of about fifty-six species, fifty of which at least had
not previously been in the Society's Museum, or in any other public
collection in England.—Mr. Vigors pointed out the different species;
and announced that a catalogue of them was in preparation, which
would shortly be submitted to the Committee.             In the mean time
he characterized the following species.

   This description is taken from a bird in the state of change, the
amethystine feathers on the back, tail and breast, appearing par
tially through a ferruginous ground, but sufficiently numerous and
defined to indicate the adult plumage.        A younger bird in the col
lection has   nearly  the whole of the   upper  body ferruginous with an
amethystine feather here and there breaking out.             In a note ap
pended to the description of the species, Mr. Lindsay states that the
natives considered them of extremely rare occurrence.

  Skins of numerous species of Mammalia obtained in Dukhun,
(Deccan), East Indies, were exhibited by Major W. H. Sykes, Corr.
Memb. Z. S. They were accompanied by a Catalogue of the Mam
malia noticed by Major Sykes in Dukhun, which included also ob
servations on the habits of each species, with occasional remarks on
their rarity or abundance, on their geographical range, and on
other interesting points connected with their history.
   The following species were enumerated :—
   Semnopithecus    Entellus, F. Cuv. Makur of the Mahrattas.-Is
found in large troops in the woods of the Western Ghauts; and is
not venerated by the Mahratta people, nor do they object to                      its
being killed.

    This Bat belongs to the same section as Dr. Horsfield's Rhin.
insignis, but differs from that species in being much smaller; in
having the ears larger and more rounded; the nose-leaf with the
upper lobe concave, ridged beneath and revolute above; and the
front lobe oblong and notched in the centre. It differs from the
Rhin, crumeniferus, Pér. and LeSueur, (which is the Rhin. marsupi
alis of M. Geoffroy's lectures, and the Rhin. Speoris of M. Desmarest,)
in being much smaller, this species having the fore arm nearly half
as long again as the Dukhun bat. The upper nose-leaf also is much
more produced, and finally the colour of the fur in this species is
reddish.      The fore arm of the Rhin. Speoris as figured is 2 inches
2 lines    long,  and the body and head 2 inches 2 lines.          In the Duk

     Hyst. cauda albá.
     This animal appears to be distinct from the European species,
which it closely resembles in form and covering. It is nearly a third
larger. All the spines and open tubes of the tail are entirely white,
which is not the case in the Hyst, cristata. The spines of the
crest also are so long as to reach to the insertion of the tail. The
ears are much less rounded, and the nails are shorter, infinitely
deeper and more compressed, and with deep channels below.
 The white gular band is more marked; and, finally, the Asiatic
species is totally destitute of hair, spines where wanting being
 replaced by strong bristles even down to the nails.

narrow streak from the anterior corner of each eye towards the angle
of the mouth. Suborbital sinuses very small; in dried skins not
observable; nor does the animal dilate them unless very much
alarmed. Limbs long and slender; black tufts at the knees. Body
light. The female has horns, but they are slender, cylindrical, and
without rings. The buttocks present a heart-shaped patch of white.

    Major Sykes subsequently called the attention of the Committee
to a Monkey presented by him to the Society, and now living at
the Gardens.         It was obtained at Bombay, where it was believed
to have been taken from Madagascar; and as it has some characters
in common with the Cercopitheci (especially with the group of which
the Cerc. Sabaeus forms a part) and the Semnopitheci of India, it
was remarked that it may ultimately prove to be a connecting link
between the African and Asiatic monkeys.                  It wants the long limbs
of the Semnopitheci ; and although              tail     its

Chelydra, however, in the peculiar plate which covers the symphysis
of the sternum being here comparatively very small, not

he was unable to trace, and he could not therefore affirm that they
were found in the state in which he observed them.
   From these facts Mr. Gray stated that he was inclined to regard
it as probable that the Ocythoë is only parasitic in the shell of                        Ar
gonauta; that the shells are only resorted to by females during the
breeding season for the protection of their eggs; and that the chief
purpose of the dilated portion of the anterior arms is to retain the
animal in the shell.  He remarked, that no author, so far as he was
aware, had distinctly stated of his own observation that these parts
are expanded in the form of sails before the wind, a service which
they seem to be incapable of performing, except in poetic fiction.

  RED COLOURING      MATTER PRODUCED BY THE ACTION                                       OF
         NITRIC ACID UPON ALCOHOL, &c. BY M. RouchAs.
Whº            equal quantities of nitric acid and alcohol act upon each
         other, the products are, azote, nitrous and nitric oxide, car
 bonic, acetic and nitrous acid, water, and nitric aether: if one part of
 alcohol and three parts of acid be used, oxalic acid is obtained.
 M. Rouchas remarks, that having lately caused three parts of nitric
 acid to act upon one part of alcohol, the above-mentioned products
 not only resulted, but also that when ammonia, potash, or soda, or
 their carbonates or bicarbonates, were added to the solution, a fine
 red colour was produced, which he considers as a new fact. The
 same effects are produced by sugar, starch, and some other vege
 table substances.
     M. Rouchas observes that this colour does not appear to be
  similar to that which accompanies purpuric acid; and he concludes
  from his experiments:
•    1st, That nitric acid, while acting on alcohol, sugar, starch, &c.
  among other well-known products, occasions the formation of a
  peculiar non-azotized red colour.
     2ndly, That the alkali acts in developing the colour merely by
  neutralizing the excess of nitric acid which exists in the solution,
  and thus separating      it;

                                                       nitric acid has the

                         PERCHLORIC ACID,
   M. Sérullas has discovered that perchloric acid is obtained by
distilling chloric acid. The watery part is to be rejected as use
less, and a colourless dense liquid is observed to adhere to the sides
of the vessel. When the heat is increased, and which ought to be
sufficiently strong to heat every part of the body of the retort, the
liquid passes into the receiver; this is perchloric acid: although
concentrated, it does not inflame paper like chloric acid, but it
gives to the paper, when put in contact with a red-hot coal, the
property        of forming very vivid sparks.
  During the distillation of the chloric acid, chlorine and oxygen
separate, and a portion of the latter combining with the undecom
posed chloric acid, it passes to the state of perchloric acid, which
is very permanent, and may be distilled at a high temperature with
out any decomposition.     The acid distilled has a light rose colour,
probably derived from a little manganesiate of potash contained in
the chlorate of potash; but on concentrating it by heat, it becomes
colourless.    To be quite sure that the chloric acid is pure, it may
be redistilled.  This process is much preferable to that of Count
Stadion, which is complicated, and also dangerous in the execution.
There remained some doubts as to the composition of perchloric
acid. M. Sérullas has ascertained that it is composed of two atoms
 of chlorine and seven atoms of oxygen.—Ibid. p. 142.
                          RED SOLUTIONS OF MANGANESE.
   The red colour of the sulphate of manganese procured under
certain circumstances, has been attributed to the presence of per
oxide, deutoxide and red oxide. Mr. Pearsall             however, is,  opi             of

which       assigns for this opinion, are the following: the red solu

           manganese and the solution              of

the middle of the horse-shoe it forms three thicknesses of wire, and
on the ends or near the poles it is wound so as to form six thick
nesses.  With a battery of 43 square feet, the magnet suspended

induced  magnetism    in a piece of soft iron so energetically as to
raise 155 pounds.    When two batteries were employed so that the
poles could be rapidly reversed, a curious fact was observed. After
one of the batteries had been removed, the curvature, with a weight
added, in     all

the poles were reversed. This effect must have been instantaneous,

the rectilineal motion of the particles.”
   Insert in place of the above.—If we suppose it equally probable that
the point of concurrence p, may be anywhere situated in the lines
ab, df, the extreme cases will be where it coincides with their extre
mities and centres of gravity.      In the former by the above formula
the  rotatory  momentum would be # of the whole, in the latter it is 0.
The mean      quantity or ºr will therefore be the ratio of the whole
quantity of rotatory momentum generated in the medium on this
supposition.     But amidst the diversified concourse of the particles,
there are   peculiar modes of concurrence which do not hold with this
supposition and which in regard to the total effect throughout the
medium will tend to augment the above ratio.

   General Observations.—This     month has been remarkably fine, dry, and
warm, so that very little interruption was experienced in getting in the full
crops of corn, which were carried in good condition in this neighbourhood.
The only heavy and continued rain was on the 2nd instant, when upwards
 of an inch fell in seven hours, accompanied with lightning and thunder,
and crossing winds; but on this occasion there was scarcely any difference
in the pressure of the atmosphere.     In the evenings of the 10th and 11th
twelve meteors appeared; many of them were large, with long sparkling
trains.   On the 17th lightning and thunder again occurred, and, as neally
opposite winds prevailed at the same time, a smart shower of rain fell here;
for opposite winds, which of course have different temperatures, invariably
condense the atmosphere they pervade, and induce rain.      Some injury was
done by the lightning in Hampshire.       On the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st,
strong gales of wind blew, first from the West, then from the North.
   The mean temperature of this month is about one and a half degree
higher than the mean of August for many years past, which was occasioned
 by the comparative dryness of the weather, and the consequent strong ter
restrial radiation.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are, two solar halos ; seventeen meteors; lightning
and thunder on two days; and four gales of wind, two from the North, and
two from the West.

fusing the residue with sulphur and carbonate of potash. Sul
phovanadate of potash is formed, from which sulphuret of
vanadium may be precipitated by sulphuric acid.
    Vanadium is very difficult of reduction by the usual methods,
that is to say, by heating the oxide in a charcoal crucible; for
it is reduced only at the places in which it is in immediate
contact with the charcoal, and the interior is a suboxide, as in
fusible as the metal itself at the temperature at which man
ganese undergoes fusion.
    With potassium the reduction is easy; pieces of vanadic
acid, which have been previously fused, are to be mixed with
pieces of potassium of equal bulk in a porcelain crucible; the
cover is to be well fastened on, and the crucible is to be heated
with a spirit-lamp.     The reduction occurs almost instantane
ously with a kind of detonation. The crucible, when cold, is
to be put into water to dissolve the potash, and the reduced
vanadium is to be collected on a filter; it is obtained in the
state of a black powder, which shines in the sun, and takes a
grayish metallic lustre underthe burnisher.        But in this way a
true idea of the  aspect  of the metal is no more obtained, than
of that of gold  precipitated  from solution by the salts of iron.
   When the method discovered by M. Rose for the reduction
of titanium is employed to reduce vanadium, the experiment
succeeds more completely than with potassium. For this pur
pose, chloride of vanadium is prepared, by passing a current
of dry chlorine over a mixture of vanadic acid and very dry
charcoal. This chloride is a volatile fuming fluid, and it is to
be introduced into a glass bulb blown on a barometer tube; a
current of dry ammoniacal gas is passed through the tube until
the chloride is entirely saturated. Sal ammoniac sublimes,
which may be expelled from the tube by another spirit-lamp.
The reduced vanadium remains in the bulb, and an inconsi
derable portion is reduced at that part of the tube which is
kept hot. On cutting the bulb afterwards in two, the vanadium
is found in the state of a silvery white stratum, which on the
side next the glass reflects like a mirror, and is white like po
lished steel.    Ifwater and atmospheric air are not entirely
excluded, a small quantity of black powder is found in the
middle of the mass; this is suboxide of vanadium, and is easily
detached.

a yellowish red colour, and formed entirely of a mass of inter

a fine green colour to glass, which appears brown while it is
hot.       #.
            blue colour of the salts of vanadium cannot be pro
duced, even on adding metallic tin to the flux.     With borax
it also gives a green glass. In this reaction vanadium resem
bles chromium, but the green colour produced by the former
may be changed to yellow by the oxidating flame, which does
not happen with chromium.        This change is easily effected,
especially with the glass of borax. With carbonate of soda it
is not reduced to the metallic state. Vanadic acid is composed
of 74.0449 parts of vanadium and 25.9551 of oxygen, that is
to say, 35-0533 of the latter, and 100 of the former; conse
quently the metal is combined with three times as much oxy
gen as in the suboxide.      Its saturating capacity is equal to
one third of the quantity of oxygen which it contains, that is
to say, 8:6517.
   4thly, Intermediate Orides of Vanadium.—We have seen
that the suboxide and oxide of vanadium, when exposed to
the influence of the air, acquire the property of colouring
water green. The vanadic oxide and acid combine together
in different proportions; two of these compounds have the
property of forming with water a solution of a fine green co
lour. Other compounds are purple and orange coloured.
They pass, by the influence of the air, from one degree of
oxidation to a higher one.

wards orange yellow. By spontaneous evaporation, they yield
crystals      pale orange yellow colour, which lose their water
               of  a

retted. Nevertheless, there are several modes of obtaining
sulphurets of vanadium; hitherto, only two have been formed,
proportional to the oxide and vanadic acid.
    1. Sulphuret of Vanadium.—This is obtained in the dry way
by exposing suboxide of vanadium to a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen at a red heat. Water, hydrogen, and even sulphur
are disengaged, and the vanadium is slowly converted into a
sulphuret.      This sulphuret is black; it becomes compact by
pressure; when burnished it has not a metallic lustre. Heated
in platina foil, it burns with a blue flame, and leaves upon the
platina a circular pellicle, which is translucent, blue at the cir
cumference and purple nearer the sulphuret. Water does not
remove this pellicle, but it disappears at a red heat, leaving
minute drops of vanadic acid.        In this state sulphuret of va
 nadium is    entirely  insoluble both in sulphuric and muriatic
acids, and in the caustic alkalies.      Nitric acid converts it into
 sulphate of vanadium.
    The salts of vanadium are not decomposed by sulphuretted
 hydrogen, but the hydrate and the salts of vanadium are con
 verted by the hydrosulphurets into sulpho-vanadates, which
 dissolve in water; the solution has a rich purple colour. Acids
 poured into these solutions occasion a brown precipitate, which
 soon subsides and then appears black; it is the sulphuret of
 vanadium: it may be washed and dried without undergoing
 any alteration; it dissolves with a purple colour in the alkaline
 hydro-sulphurets.       The alkaline carbonates also dissolve it
 when boiling, but the colour of the solution is brownish yel
 low. The sulphuric and muriatic acids do not decompose                                        it,
 although the liquid from which            has been precipitated re

    Sulphate of Vanadium.—This salt is obtained by dissolving
vanadic acid or oxide (as obtained by the calcination of vana
date of ammonia) in sulphuric acid, mixed with an equal
quantity of water, and by passing sulphuretted hydrogen into
the solution diluted with water, in order to reduce the last
traces of the vanadic acid dissolved. Oxalic acid may be used
for the same purpose; the liquid is to be evaporated until the
excess of sulphuric acid begins to concentrate; the salt is then
deposited in the form of a transparent crystalline crust of a
dirty blue colour. The excess of acid is to be drained from
the salt, and then it is to be washed with absolute alcohol.
The salt gradually swells, and is reduced to a light crystalline
powder of an ultramarine blue colour; it is then washed with
alcohol, which it always renders of a blue colour, although
but a very small quantity is dissolved.           It is afterwards dried
by being placed under a receiver, with a vessel containing
 snlphuric acid or chloride of calcium. An essential difference
 appears to exist between the salt which crystallizes in the
 concentrated acid and the blue pulverulent salt; but I do not
 know in what it consists.         It is probable that the former is a
 supersalt; for the blue powder which I analysed is neutral
 sulphate.        In this state sulphate of vanadium appears but
 slightly soluble in cold water; it first diffuses itself through
 it,  and dissolves with extreme slowness, but               hot water        in               it
 dissolves     readily:  the  supersulphate       deliquescent is     warm              in
 moist air, and becomes            syrupy consistence; while the same

duum is no longer soluble even in concentrated acetic acid.
Acetate of potash does not precipitate the salts of vanadium.
Concentrated acetic acid dissolves hydrate of vanadium, but
the solution becomes green by spontaneous evaporation, and
leaves a granular powder, composed of deep green opake
microscopic crystals, the form of which is either a cube or a
very short rectangular prism; they dissolve very slowly in
                                                          -
water; the solution is of a deep green colour.
    Formiate of Vanadium. — Artificial formic acid dissolves
hydrate of vanadium, and gives by spontaneous evaporation
a blue, opake, saline mass, which is easily soluble in cold
water; but this solution, which contains no excess of water,
becomes gradually green by contact with the air.         The salt
when perfectly dried is of a violet colour, with a tint of brown,
and is not completely soluble in water.
    Succinate of Vanadium.—Succinic     acid dissolves very little
hydrate of vanadium; the solution is but slightly coloured.
By evaporation the succinate is obtained in the state of a
white powder, mixed with crystals of succinic acid. Neverthe
less, the salts of vanadium are not precipitated by neutral suc
 cinates, but the mixture soon becomes greenish.
   Benzoate of Vanadium.—A boiling solution of benzoic acid
dissolves a little hydrate of vanadium; submitted to a slow
evaporation the solution deposits a yellow powder, and the
excess of acid crystallizes around                  it.

340                   Mr. Nixon         on the Measurement           of the

  sected by the intersecting point of the threads of the latter,
  This being effected, the stand was glued at the sides (only) to
 the surface of the plank, and the slight deviation in the                                     bi
 section of the wire, occasioned by the setting of the glue, recti

    Illumination of the Wires.—In the          daytime  a square foot of
 white pasteboard set up on the plank at a distance of about
 six inches from the northern object-glass of the cylinder, was
 so inclined as to reflect the light from the window up the cy
 linder and telescope.       At night, or on a gloomy day, the
 lantern (M) of a transit instrument was substituted, and so
 situated that the tube (N) containing the lens was of the
 height and in a line with the cylinder and telescope.            In lieu
 of a lamp, a white wax taper, about one-third of an inch thick
and five inches long, was fixed within the socket of the lantern,
the summit of the taper standing an inch or two above the
level of the lens-tube (N). The wires of the cylinder and
threads of the telescope could now be seen, on looking through
the eye-glass of the latter, with the utmost distinctness in
front of the pale taper mildly illuminated by the light reflected
from the tinned sides of the lantern.            When the taper had
burnt down      nearly  to the level of the    lens-tube,  the light be
came so intense that the wires            appeared   to  split; and, on
the other hand, when the taper stood too high, they looked
dim and       ill
              defined.        general, whether the lantern

XLIII.    Notice on Oralic Acid. By Edward TURNER, M.D.
   F.R.S. L. & E. &c., Professor of Chemistry in the University
   of London*.
  N a former Number of this Journal+           had occasion to            I
    publish some remarks on the volatility of oxalic acid; and
about the same time M. Gay-Lussac published in the Annales
de Chimie et de Physique, vol. xlvi. p. 218, a short memoir on
the easy decomposition of oxalic acid by the agency of heatf.
In my notice the sublimed acid is described as supporting a
temperature of 330° Fahrenheit, without any decomposition;
while M. Gay-Lussac, speaking of the crystals in their ordi
nary state, describes them as being decomposed at so low a
temperature as 230°Fahrenheit.        As these statements may
be thought contradictory, while at the same time a correct
knowledge of these facts is required for understanding an                                         in
teresting point of theory,–the action of the sulphuric on oxalic
acid,    I have re-examined the subject with the hope of cor
recting any inadvertence which may have been committed.
   In the experiments which                I
                                 have made with this view, the
heat was applied through the medium of a small mercurial
bath, heated by a lamp: the acid to be decomposed was con
tained in a small glass tube, the sealed end of which was
plunged into the bath, and                 its
                                  other extremity connected                                       in
the usual manner with        mercurial trough.

the bath    during    the whole continuance           the experiments.
By operating         this way
                     in            found that my former statement
                                      I
was  strictly correct.     Oxalic acid containing only one equi
valent   ofwater,    whether prepared                     by
                                                merely heating the or
dinary crystals        or   by
                           sublimation, sustained         temperature         a                   of
380° without yielding either water              gas. As the thermo

meter rose from 830°          340°, gas began slowly
                                 to                          appear, and           to
at 370°    itwas   freely  disengaged.                   It
                                               hence follows that the
best temperature for subliming oxalic acid                 330°:      then    is             it
sublimes with    rapidity,  and   yet there         loss  is     no
                                                              decomposi            by
tion; but before exposure              this degree
                                          to              heat, the acid      of
should previously           be
                            dried          as

temperature.
   But does not necessarily follow, because my statement
        it                                                                                        is

of water, is decomposed by heat          at a lower temperature than
 the same acid after two        equivalents    of water have been re
 moved. Thus, on operating with the fully hydrated acid in
 the same manner as with that which had fully effloresced on
 the sand-bath, fusion took place at 209°, as stated by M.
 Gay-Lussac, and not at 220° as I had found in heating some
 crystals, which must previously have lost a little of their water
of crystallization.      As the temperature of the bath rose to
230°, the fused mass remained quite tranquil, yielding a little
water, but not a particle of gas.             At 240° there was still
scarcely any gas, and very little at 250° or 270°. Even at
290°, though there was violent ebullition from the rapid
escape of aqueous vapour, yet the evolution of gas was by no
means abundant: it became free at 310°, and was rapid at
320°. In a second careful experiment the results were pre
cisely similar.     It is therefore apparent that oxalic acid, as
deposited in crystals from solution, is decomposed at a consi
derably lower temperature than when it - contains only one
equivalent of water.
   My observation on the decomposition of oxalic acid by sul
phuric acid induces me to dissent from the explanation which
M. Gay-Lussac has suggested. Sublimed oxalic acid, acted
on by a considerable quantity of strong sulphuric acid, began
to effervesce by being kept for a few minutes in a vessel of
boiling water. The action indeed was slow, but it was per
fectly distinct and continuous, the disengaged gas consisting
as usual of equal measures of carbonic oxide and carbonic
acid. The effervescence was much more free at 220°, and
still more so at 230°; and yet the same acid, exposed to mere
heat, would not have yielded a particle of gas at the tempera
ture of 330°. Oxalic acid, in                its
                                       most hydrated state,      mixed    if
with  a  large excess      sulphuric acid,
                          of                    decomposed
                                                        is       nearly   at
the same temperature         as    after having lost two-thirds
                                  it    is                                         of   its
water, effervescing with moderate freedom               220°; whereas
                                                                  at

    The most remarkable fact displayed by the preceding com
parison is the beautiful accordance of the results obtained
from two metals whose expansions are so different as those of
platinum and iron.                 The temperature indicated by the latter
exceeds that          by   the former in the instance of the fusing point
of  gold      35°,    and in that of silver only 29°; and this excess is
in accordance with the conclusion of MM. Dulong and Petit,
exhibited in Table II., that the expansion of iron increases
in the higher degrees in a greater proportion than that of
platinum.
    The discrepancy between the temperatures derived from
the observations with my first pyrometer and the present are
considerable, but may be sufficiently accounted for by the dif
ferences in the circumstances of the experiments, without im
puting inaccuracy to the instrument.                         In the paper to which
I  have before alluded, I stated that                      “I    did not offer the re
sults as      positive     and accurate determinations of the different
degrees, but only as nearer approximations than any that had
yet been furnished from actual observation. The only method
which I had it in my power to adopt for the purpose, I do
not consider to be susceptible of absolute accuracy. The ar
                                                                                    j,
rangement made consisted of a muffle of black-lead placed in
an excellent draught-furnace. This muffle was furnished with
a door, through a round hole in which the stem of the pyro
meter was passed up to the shoulder.                           Another door,
could be stopped at pleasure, admitted a full view of the                                in
                                                                                    terior.

352        Mr. Daniell               on a New Register-Pyrometer,
terior.   The metal to be tried was placed in a small black
lead  receptacle,   of the same thickness as the pyrometer tube,
in the middle of the muffle. Now it is evident that the pyro
meter so situated would indicate the mean heat of the whole
of the muffle; which heat might, and did, vary in different
parts. Of two pieces of silver of the same size placed within
an inch of each other, one fused some time before the other.”
I  also suggested that “means might be contrived to surround
the instrument with the metal in a state of fusion; but that it
required particular opportunities, which it was to be hoped
that those would avail themselves of who had them in their
power.”
    That the latter method is the only one which can admit of
accuracy will be evident from a few reflections. Setting aside
the inequality of the heat of different parts of the same
heated muffle, which however is a consideration of the utmost
importance, it is obvious that           temperature must consider
                                                     its

influence. Just           piece

                                              fusion. When once                                           in to a a
liquid state, both would rapidly rise             the temperature

most intense heat which it was possible to produce in a fur
nace; and to measure the utmost limits of expansion in a
platinum bar.      For this purpose I made use of an excellent
wind-furnace in the Royal Institution, in which upon former
occasions hob-nails had been completely fused into a button.
    Exp. 19.-The register I, which had not been the least        in
jured by the previous experiments, was fitted with a new bar
of platinum which had been drawn as a wire, was gºths of an
 inch in diameter and very ductile. The iron bar was also
 adjusted to a new register, and both were placed upright in a
 well luted crucible. About half an inch of powdered charcoal
 was strewed upon the bottom to prevent any adhesion; and two
soft iron nails, and a piece of unglazed Wedgwood's porcelain,
 were thrown in for the purpose of affording some indication
 of the degree of heat attained. The crucible was then set in
 the furnace, another smaller crucible inverted upon       it,
                                                           covered
 with coke, and the heat urged          the utmost for two hours.
                                         to
  The fire was suffered      burn out, and the crucible with its
                              to
 contents removed for examination.             was sound, but the
                                              It
 luting had been completely fused. The nails were found melted
 into two complete buttons, and the porcelain was partially
  fused upon the surface.
     The registerI.  appeared      to   be
                                       uninjured, but the platinum
 ring and wedge were loose, evidently from contraction hav

 no   doubt owing   to the heat having exceeded that       at

  The platinum bar also, which there was some difficulty in
  removing from the cavity, presented a very extraordinary ap
  pearance. It was apparently embossed with crystals, and was
  evidently larger at the lower end than at the top: it was also
  something contracted in length.            Upon examination with a
 lens no regular facets could be detected, but it had the appear
  ance of a bar constructed of plates of native platinum loosely
  welded together.
     The register which contained the iron bar was considerably
  bent, and had several transverse clefts in             substance, owing       its
 possibly               its
                  having become inclined
                   to                                the crucible. Partial in

362       Mr. Henwood's Survey of the Mines of Cornwall.
    In the preceding columns the “direction” is with regard
to true north, and the dip in deviation from the horizon.
When in its horizontal course one vein or lode is intersected
by another, and the parts on opposite sides of the traversing
vein are not exactly opposite to one another, the intersected
“lode” is said to be “heaved.” Whether we approach the
traversing vein from the east or west, on the course of that
which it has “heaved,” still in either case the dislocated por
tion on the opposite side will be found by turning to the same
hand; and thus a heave to the “right” or to the “left” is the
same on either side:—this is the meaning of the letter R in
 the foregoing Table. The GA and SA refer to whether the
 dislocated portion is to be found on the side of the “greater”

in the importation of Egyptian           cotton, to take into conside

serious commercial sacrifices, which then attended the enforce

ceases as soon as the weather becomes very hot.       “Extreme

bable that increased heat produces no change either in the
number    or proportions of the atoms of the substances; but
that, in some        which chemical science has not yet pre
pared us to explain, it modifies only the arrangement of the
atoms, and thus confers new distinctive characters.
   In pursuing the inquiry experimentally, two circumstances
seemed to me to require to be established.
   1st, That raw cotton, and other substances likely to har
bour contagion, would sustain, no injury by the temperature
conceived to be necessary for their disinfection.
   2ndly, That in at least some one unequivocal instance, con
tagious or infectious matter should be proved, by actual expe
riment, to be destructible at that temperature.
   I. To ascertain the first point, I submitted in August 1824, a
quantity of raw cotton to a dry temperature of 190°Fahrenheit,
which was steadily kept up in the inner compartment of a
double vessel heated by steam, during two hours.       When the
staple of the cotton was examined by Mr. Garnett, he pro
nounced it to be so essentially injured, as to set at rest, on a
first view,      all
               intentions     adopting this method
                                  of                     purifica                  of
tion. The same unpromising appearance was presented also
by   cotton yarn, which, after being spun, had been heated
during two hours            at
                      190° Fahrenheit.     After being allowed                                    to
cool  during    quarter
                 a               of
                                hour, an was compared with yarn
                                                   it

alarm which has overspread the continent of Europe, and in
a less degree extended over this country, in consequence of
the devastating effects of a disease (cholera), the contagious
nature of which is rendered highly probable, and which, like
other contagious diseases, may be presumed to be capable of
being conveyed by fomites.           It is therefore of the greatestim
portance to devise effectual and easily practicable means of
extinguishing the first sparks of that distemper which may
show themselves in this country, avoiding at the same time
greater injury than is necessary to individual interests or to
general commercial prosperity.

Among them were several fabrics, which were purposely chosen,
of the most fugitive colours and delicate textures.       After
being exposed three hours to a temperature of 180°, and then
left a few hours in a room without fire, they were pronounced,
by an excellent judge of the articles who furnished the speci
mens, to be perfectly uninjured in every respect.     Furs and

  180° Fahrenheit during four hours.           Three healthy children
 of   proper age were inoculated with this matter without any
  effect; but being afterwards vaccinated with fresh matter, they
  all took the disease.

 368   Dr. W. Henry On         the Disinfecting Powers   of increased
lymph was placed, were heated during intervals varying from
 two to three hours, at a temperature never below 160° nor
 above 165° Fahrenheit.          The trials were judiciously varied
 by Mr. Gee, by inserting each specimen of the matter which
 had been dried, into one arm only of a healthy child; while
 into the other arm of the same child recent matter was                   in
 serted.    In every instance, the heated matter proved ineffi
 cient; while the matter which had been dried at the tempera
 ture of the atmosphere produced a satisfactory pustule.
    4. For the sake of obtaining a sufficient number of in
 stances,    I requested Mr. Marsden, House-Surgeon                 of the
 Manchester      Royal   Infirmary,    to make trial of some      genuine
 vaccine lymph which      I   had received from him, and had then
submitted to heat. One specimen had been placed two hours in
a steady temperature of 150°; a second four hours in the same
 temperature;      a third two hours, and the fourth four hours,
 in the temperature of 172°. In no one instance, did any of
 these specimens, when inserted in the usual manner, produce
 the vaccine pustule.
º
    5. Descending in the scale of temperature, another portion
of vaccine lymph was exposed to an uniform heat of only
 120° Fahrenheit for three hours. Two children, inoculated
by Mr. Gee with this matter, received the infection, and the
            were, in each case, remarkably well characterized.
   rom their arms matter was taken, with which upwards of
forty children have been vaccinated, who have gone through
the disease in the most satisfactory manner.
    It may be considered, then, as established by the experiments
which have been related,—1st, That vaccine matter is not de
stroyed by a temperature of 120° Fahrenheit; and it is even
probable that it would sustain, without losing            its  efficiency,
a  heat several   degrees   higher;-2ndly,       That vaccine lymph       is
rendered totally inert by exposure                 temperature       of
                                                                      140°

animal poisons which          lie dormant      in the state     of

are  likely  to   be
                   disarmed     of their terrors    by  the same simple
means? The expectation,         I    am aware, rests entirely        on
                                                                      ana
logy; but the analogy appears             to me   sufficiently strong     to
render  it  desirable that    it should become the parent           expe
                                                                 it of
riments.     It   iswith that view only that        I  propose   to    the
                           or of
enlightened physicians           this and other    countries,  who have
the means        verifying
                 of             disproving the inference        byexperi
ments   on   the more diffusible and active contagions.             Until,
indeed, the soundness    of     the analogy has been established by
a  sufficient number       of facts  of  the latter class, no extensive
practical measures can safely        be grounded upon     it.
                                                                          If

    Ifa favourable result should however issue from these sug
gestions, nothing can be more easy or less expensive in construc
tion, or more manageable in use, than an apparatus for subject
ing articles imported from unclean places, in any quantity, how
ever large, to the disinfecting agency of a dry heat, without even
the slightest injury to the quality of those substances.   A dou
ble vessel, made of copper, or of tinned or cast iron, of any
convenient shape, with a sufficient space between the two ves
sels for containing steam, and an interior cavity of due size
for a receptacle of the articles to be disinfected, is the essen

specting Mr. Rennie's character as a naturalist, which the perusal of
the introductory matter discloses.  His incapacity for the office he has
assumed of Editor of Montagu's work, will be made abundantly evi
dent hereafter.
   Mr. Rennie appears to be wholly ignorant of the higher philosophy
of Natural History, considered either as a branch of science, as a
means of training the mind to the love of truth, or as an instrument
of leading it to the admiration and adoration of the Creator. He
seems to have little knowledge or perception of the vastness of na
ture, and none whatever of the fact, that there are such things as de
sign and order in the distribution of the beings and substances which
compose            it.

the reader who is previously unacquainted with the subject, to con
clude that Mr. Rennie's representations must needs be founded in
truth, when he would have had nothing but Mr. Rennie's assertions
to support that conclusion, had an ingenuous plan been pursued.
    In the most false and unfounded manner he confounds the athe
istical doctrine of appetencies, broached by Darwin, Lamarck, and
Robinet, with the Macleayan doctrine of the progression in affinity
from one group of animals to another, or the variation of form of
each species from that possessed by the preceding one, so that on
examining the entire group, a progressive change of character is ob
servable, made up of the separate differences between each pair of
contiguous species.       He asserts, with equal violation of the truth,
that the  Quinary    System,     “while it professes to reject this strange
doctrine, at the same time adopts               very language      the most un

the views of natural arrangement of Mr. Macleay and his disciples,
so far as they have yet been enunciated; noticing some differences
of opinion, on minor points, which exist among the naturalists of
this school. By this means we hope to convey a just idea of them to
the general reader; for we wish to enlist every reflecting mind inter
ested in the study of nature, in the support of the “new views,”
confident alike of the delight which the truths they unfold will convey
to every person of common intellectual powers, and of the increased
stability they will be found to give to the deductions of a sound natu
ral theology, harmonizing most perfectly with the Christian Religion.
    For reasons which will be evident in the sequel, we begin with
Mr. Rennie's attack on the Quinary System. This commences in
p. xxxii. of his prefatory matter, and in the following page, under the
head “The Quinary System and Modern Doctrine of Types, Affinities,
and Analogies,” he ostensibly begins the consideration of the subject.
Mr.W. S. Macleay's attempt to discover the natural system he states to
have been “beyond                    all
                              question, highly laudable,” though,               con                             he
tinues,     “Ishall endeavour         show, after giving
                                                   to          brief outline [of it], a
it appears        to   be
                    altogether       failure.”a   Mr.       then gives           R.

from   a  review published        the Zoological Journal, and four extracts
                                           in

     Mr. Rennie's statement insinuates, though                  does not broadly af               it
 firm, that Mr. Macleay identifies                                          his
                                                 views with the actual system                                                           of
 nature,        existing
                as            nature;    now this we positively deny, and we
 deny too, that such sense can           a in  fairly                 be

 the passages quoted. After having examined the preface                     the Horae                                      to

 it.    The reader will observe that            these passages Mr. Macleay does
                                                                       in

  natural system"—“the plan                                    of
                                            the creation itself—the work"of an
  all-wise, all-powerful Deity". But                would suppose, from the con   he
  nection       in which the extracts are introduced                Mr. Rennie, that                       by

be further from the truth; Mr. Macleay does not, in the entire course
of his preface, even once either expressly make or indirectly imply
such an identification.         He speaks throughout of the natural system
as a thing which it is the end of the pursuit of natural history to dis
cover, not as a thing yet discovered by any naturalist, and not at all
as having been discovered by himself. Nor can the assumption Mr.
 Rennie would insinuate be discovered, (neither is it in the smallest
degree implied,) in the quotations which follow from Mr. Macleay's
 paper in the Transactions of the Linnaean Society, and from his
“Letter on the Dying Struggle of the Dichotomous System.”
    But previously to our entering in detail upon this part of the sub
ject, we must, for another purpose, quote and make some remarks upon
 the remainder of this page of Mr. Rennie's book; it is as follows:—
 “Again, speaking of his discovery of what he calls the nature of the
 difference between affinity and analogy, Mr. Macleay says, “It is
 quite inconceivable, that the utmost human ingenuity could make
 these two kinds of relation tally with each other, had they not been so
 designed at the Creation.”          In another place he talks of portions of
 his  system   being    ‘almost    mathematically      proved to be natural f.’”
 The italics are all Mr. Rennie's.              We have in the extract now
 before us, the first example of a numerous class of misinterpreta
 tions of the plainest figures and forms of speech in the English
 language, which distinguish the present production of this champion,
 before whose mighty prowess all the discoveries of modern zoology
 are to be dispelled, like the illusions of fancy before the blaze of truth;
 a class of errors, which must either have resulted from wilful determi
 nation not to understand the representations of the New School of
 Zoology, as they are used by their authors and designed to be under
 stood by them, or else the most deplorable and unpardonable igno
 rance of his own language, and of the figures common to                language,                         all
 which     claimant for
                 a          literary                          or
                                          scientific honours ever   yet displayed.
 As we shall show            the sequel, the entire drift
                                          in                     this page,                 of                        is   to
 support the assertion that Mr. Macleay's system and “the natural
 system” are regarded                   identical.  toTo contribute towards the

strongly affirm his opinion, that the two relations of affinity and ana
logy co-exist in nature, (to which subject we shall by and by advert
in detail,) and were designed so to co-exist, at the Creation. But                                                                 all

by placing it between the wires of a battery; the repetition of
Gay-Lussac and Thénard's very important process for preparing
potassium; and his attempts to decompose the earths. With respect
to the latter Dr. Paris remarks, “his results were indistinct: they
could not, like the alkalies, be rendered conductors of electricity
by fusion, nor could they be acted upon in solution, in conse
quence of the strong, affinity possessed by their bases for oxy
gen.”    While engaged on this subject, he received a letter from
Berzelius, announcing the fact that he, in conjunction with Pontin,
had decomposed barytes and lime by negatively electrizing mercury
in contact with them, and thus had obtained amalgams of the bases of
those earths: these experiments were repeated by Davy with many
in addition, and an account of them was read before the Royal
Society on the 30th of June 1808. The memoir was entitled
“Electro-chemical Researches on the Decomposition of the Earths;
with Observations on the Metals obtained from them, and on the
Amalgam of Ammonia.”
 It will not be requisite to enter into           a discussion   on the mature
of the amalgam     ; the appearances which  it presents have not been
explained. But that hydrogen and azote are metals, or contain any
thing metallic, will scarcely now be maintained; the amalgama
tion is probably merely apparent, and the recent experiments of
Mr. Daniell tend to confirm this opinion.
   In 1808 Davy read his third Bakerian Lecture; the title of it is
“An Account of some new Analytical Researches on the Nature of
certain Bodies, particularly the Alkalies, Phosphorus, Sulphur, Car
bonaceous matter, and the Acids hitherto undecompounded; with
some general Observations on Chemical Theory.” Of this excellent
paper Dr. Paris gives an analysis. So sanguine was Davy's hope of
decomposing some substances which have even yet resisted analysis,
that he addressed a letter to Mr. Children during the progress of
his experiments; in which he says,      “Ihope on Thursday to show
  ou nitrogen as a complete wreck, torn to pieces in different ways.”
   In a letter to the above-named gentleman, dated September 23,
 1809, we also meet with some opinions which subsequent investiga
tions have by no means corroborated.         “I
                                            doubt not,” he says, “you
have found before    this, asIhave  done,  that the substance we mis
took for sulphuretted hydrogen is telluretted hydrogen, very soluble
in water, combinable with alkalies and earths, and a substance
affording another proof that hydrogen is an oride.”     He says also,
“I  find that taking ammonium as the basis of   hydrogen,   according
to the ideas which I  stated,    all
                                 the compounds    will agree with the
suppositions that  I mentioned    you, viz. eight cubic inches
                                   to                             hy     of
drogen, two   of  oxygen, ammonia; four and two, water; four and
four, nitrogen; four and six, nitrous oxide; four and eight, nitrous
gas; four and ten, nitric acid.”
     We need hardly observe that        of
                                    the opinions here mentioned,

   Dr. Paris's second volume commences with a subject of peculiar
interest; we allude to the introduction of Mr. Faraday to Sir H.
Davy. Dr. Paris observes that “it is said of Bergman, that he con
sidered the greatest             of        his   discoveries         to    have been the discovery
of  Scheele. Amongst the numerous services conferred upon sci
ence
        bySir Humphry Davy, we must not pass unnoticed that kind
and  generous   patronage which first raised Mr. Faraday from ob
scurity, and gave               to
                        the chemical world     philosopher capable         a                                            of
pursuing that brilliant path       inquiry which the genius
                                                      of            his                                            of
master   had        so
                successfully explored.”
   “The circumstances which first led Mr. Faraday         the study                              to                     of

the Sub-Committees, and the subjects of scientific inquiry which they
have proposed.    In the mean while we have the pleasure to state, that,
at the  request  of the Association, Professor Airy has undertaken to
prepare a Report on the state and progress of Astronomy; Dr. Brew
ster a similar Report on Optics; Professor Whewell on Mineralogy;

   Specimens were exhibited of two Mammalia, presented to the So
ciety by J. Boyle, Esq., Colonial Surgeon, Sierra Leone. They were
the remains of animals which died on their passage homewards, and
had unfortunately been put after death into brine too weak for their
perfect preservation.   Since their arrival at the Museum they had
been transferred to strong spirit, with the view of preserving as com
pletely as their then state would permit, specimens of so much            in
terest. One of them was stated by Mr. Bennett to be a fully grown
Aulacodus Swinderianus, Temm.; the other a Lemuridous species,
which is probably the animal noticed and imperfectly represented
by Bosman under the name of Potto. The latter was shown to be
the type of a new genus, which Mr. Bennett characterized as follows:

in about six rather long lanceolate processes, forming a pectinated
tip ; the eyes are small, round, somewhat lateral, and oblique : the
ears moderate, open, slightly hairy, both within and without.                The
body is rather slender. The limbs are nearly equal, long, and slender:
the fingers moderately long.         On the fore-hands the inder is exces
sively short, the first phalana being concealed, and the ungueal pha
lana (the only phalanc free) being barely large enough to support a
rounded mail, which does not exist on the specimen, but of which
there is an apparent cicatria ; the nails of            the other fingers are             all
flat and rounded. Those           the hinder hands are similar, except that

    Mr. Boyle states that this animal “is called by some the Ground
Pig, by others, the Ground-Rat. It feeds upon ground nuts, Cassada,
and other roots. On the passage homewards it ate potatoes, and was
becoming very docile.”
    It is very probably the “wild Rat, bigger than a Cat” mentioned
by Bosman.

 Chanticleer, and presented to the Society by the Lords Commission
ers of the Admiralty, together with numerous other Zoological spe
cimens obtained during the same voyage, was laid upon the table.
It contained among others a young individual of the Scyllium cirra
 tum, in the state in which it is described by Schneider as the Squalus
ounctatus : a specimen of the Blennius pilicornis, Cuv., described ori
ginally by Marcgrave, and remarkable for the long acicular tooth at
 the back of the lower jaw on each side, a peculiarity which may here
 after cause it to be regarded as the type of a distinct genus: a spe
 cimen of the Antennarius scaber, Chironectes scaber, Cuv., also de
scribed by Marcgrave: and two species which appeared to be new to
science, and which were thus characterized by Mr. Bennett:

was read. Mr. Holdsworth regards the fish in question as the Um
brina, Sciaena Aquila, Cuv.; with which species, occasionally taken in
the English Channel, his description agrees.

    ON THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF BARYTES.                BY DR. THOMSON.
fg
    I   HAD from a set of experiments in which dry chloride of barium
        was decomposed by sulphate of potash, inferred that the atomic
weight of barytes was 975. The conclusion was founded upon this
experiment: 13:25 grains of chloride of barium were mixed with
                                                                11 grains

11  grains of sulphate of potash, both in solution; and it was found
that after the sulphate of barytes had precipitated, the residual
liquid contained no sensible quantity of sulphuric acid or of barytes.
Berzelius in the third volume of his Larbok i Kemien, stated that
when these proportions were used, there always remained an excess
of barytes.     I requested several of my practical pupils to repeat the
experiment without mentioning my object, and they                           gave me the              all
same   proportions               of
                           the two salts that         had   previously
                                                                    I      stated.    was                          I

When    heated to redness in a tube it loses about 38:102 per cent, or
seven atoms of oxygen from the acid, and one atom from the base.
   Orichlorate of Strontia.--When the solution is evaporated to the
consistence of a syrup, it assumes on cooling a mass of a crystalline
appearance, which readily attracts moisture from the air. It gives a
fine purple to flame.
   Orichlorate of Lime—This salt is deliquescent; when evaporated
to the consistence of a syrup it solidifies into a crystalline mass. It is
soluble in alcohol, and burns with a reddish flame.
   Orichlorate of Magnesia—Deliquescent,                 soluble in alcohol, and
crystallizes in long prisms; oxichlorate of alumina reddens litmus
paper, although excess of gelatinous alumina has been used in pre
paring it; it does not crystallize, and is soluble in alcohol.
   Orichlorate of Lithia.--It is prepared like the preceding salts by the
direct union of the acid with the base.               It crystallizes perfectly in
long transparent needles, which are deliquescent and soluble in
alcohol.
   Orichlorate of Ammonia.-This salt is neutral; but like ammoniacal
salts in general it is rendered acid by evaporation; it crystallizes in
very fine transparent rectangular prisms, bevelled at the extremities.

     General Observations.—The        weather this month has been alternately
  wet and dry, and the nights were generally warm.
     The 1st was a cold day, with a gale from the North, and heavy rain
 nearly an inch in depth, which considerably lessened the temperature of
 the ground.      Distant thunder occurred in the afternoon of the 2nd; but
 the night being clear, with a North-west wind, the first hoar frost ap
 peared in the grass fields early in the morning of the 3rd.               On the 7th
 and 8th, distant thunder occurred, and the lightning was vivid at mid
 night of the latter day. In the evening of the 12th a faint aurora borealis
 appeared from half-past 8 till 10 P.M. Early in the morning of the 19th
 a great number of swallows assembled, and suddenly departed for a warmer
 climate: they remained here this year only twenty-two weeks.
    There were a few flashes of sheet lightning in the evening of the 26th.
 It lightened in the night of the 27th from 7 P.M. till midnight, when a
 change of wind to the North-east brought on a thunder-shower.                   Heavy
 showers of rain and hail in the afternoon of the 28th were succeeded by
 vivid lightning, from 5 till 10 P.M. Strong forked lightning, with thunder
 and rain, also occurred in the evening of the 30th from 6 till 9 P.M.
    The mean temperature of this month is nearly a degree lower than
 the mean of September for many years past.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
 observations this month, are, eleven meteors, one rainbow, one aurora
borealis, lightning and thunder on five days; and two gales of wind, namely,
one from the North, the other from the South-east.

of  the other ingredients; but there is not one of these which
is not, in more than one case, either absent, or present in very
small quantity. Shall we say then that garnet consists essen
tially of silica, and that the other substances are accidental?
that it is thus chemically identical with quartz? This appears
too absurd to be thought of; and yet the doctrine of essential
composition with accidental mixture appears to leave us no
other alternative”.
   A case often quoted by the advocates of accidental mixture
is the Fontainbleau spar, and this Mr. Brooke adduces. This
instance has always appeared to me utterly irrelevant.        The
carbonate of lime is here crystallized among the previously
existing particles of sand; so that these are imbedded in it
like plums in a pudding. There is no difficulty in such a case,
any more than when any one mineral is crystallized about
splinters or needles of another;—a very common occurrence.
But who would consider these splinters or needles as belong
ing to the surrounding crystals? In the Fontainbleau spar,
no one doubts that the carbonate of lime gives the crystalline
character, and that the quartz is caught up in it in grains.
The slightest touch of acid, or scratch with the penknife,
proves this.    It is the easiest thing in the world to show that
this is not a homogeneous or simple mineral: the question is
about such as are homogeneous.
   Mr. Brooke would perhaps reply to this, that the Fontain
bleau spar is a palpable mixture, and that other minerals may
be impalpable mixtures: that they may appear to be homo
geneous when they are not really so; and that there may be
a gradual transition from mixtures obvious to the eye, like
the Fontainbleau spar, to mixtures which cannot be detected
by any physical character, and are discoverable only by che
mical analysis.
   To this I reply, that if we really cannot tell whether a spe
cimen be approximately a simple mineral, I do not see what
the use can be of analysing it at all. But the way to decide this
point, is to take minerals which possess the obvious qualities
which may be expected to characterize, simple minerals; as
transparency, smooth surfaces, apparently uniform structure,
bright and uninterrupted cleavage extending to the smallest
fragments:   all  which properties the Fontainbleau spar wants.
And we do take such cases, we neither find ourselves driven
     if
to  specimens manifestly very impure; nor            do
                                                  we find     che    by
mical examination, large and irregular accidental mixtures.

    If
    now in the analyses thus expressed, we add together the
numbers in the columns A and Fes, and also those in the co
lumns Fe, Mn, C, M, we have certain numbers which we
must compare with each other, as follows:
                               S         A, Fes Fe, Mn, C, M.
                     (1)       4    |    1.82         2-68

                     (3)       4    ||   1-86         2-65
                     (4)       4         2-15         2-74.
                     (5)       4    ||   2:02         3-17
                     (6)       4         2-11         2.96

                     (8)       4    |    1.97         2-92
  Now in these columns the approximate equality of the
numbers in each column is remarkable. None of those in the
second column differ much from 2; none of those in the third
column much from 3; the first column being invariably 4.
We have a degree of resemblance altogether different from
what appeared in the former table. And this becomes stronger
when we notice, that in all the cases the number in the third
column is very nearly one and a half times that in the second,
and that this proportion obtains even where the numbers them
selves differ from the average, as in (2). We may observe that
in this analysis (2), which is much the furthest from the mean,
we have only to suppose an excess of 7 per cent. of silica,
in order to make it agree with the rest; and that in this case
there must be some inaccuracy in the analysis, since the pro
portions of the separate ingredients amount to 102 instead
of 100. Jn (4), where the second column is too large, and the
third too small, we are led to ask, whether it is possible that
in the analysis any portion of Fe has been converted into Fes:
the probability of such an inaccuracy must be left to chemists
to determine.
   But even without making any allowances, I think the agree
ment of the above numbers is as close as we could expect,
I will  leave the matter to be decided by those who may attend to                  it.
I shall use the notation which I     have explained, because  it   isthe only one
which will answer my purpose,       as well     the only one which
                                                 as                      algebrai

relative advantages      the two will     bediscoveredin   any one who has         to
work with them: and there would be little use         a by  further discussion of
these    ongeneral principles.
                                                                                  and

and sufficient to justify usin considering 2 and 3 as the stand
ard values of the second and third columns, from which
values the deviations are comparatively inconsiderable.

order has been detected   by  the application of the doctrine of
isomorphism, appear to be sufficient to assure us that that
doctrine has a foundation in nature.
    Ifthere be any instances in which the analyses do not con
form to the formula proposed, as Mr. Brooke asserts to be
the case with regard to amphibole compared with Beudant's
formulae, there can be no doubt that we must allow either that
the formula is wrong, or the mineral wrongly named, wrongly
analysed, or impure.     The isomorphous view of the constitu
tion of bodies has  not, nor can it have, any authority beyond
what it derives from                   its
                         agreement with facts. The superiority
of this view over that                       .#
                             accidental mixture, arises from its
appearing that the latter gives         approximation         no                                  at       all   to
many      of
          the analyses; while the former has given,    the cases                           in
which have been most carefully examined,       very close agree              a
ment, under very trying circumstances.

elements are as    yet imperfectly understood; and when we
have but one analysis, it must often be difficult or impossible
to decide whether any two ingredients are in definite propor

   There are many, therefore, of the general arguments em
ployed by Mr. Brooke which involve reasonings unauthorized

     We find in     many cases minerals which, agreeing in the
form of their chemical formula, and differing in one or more
of their elements, agree also in their system of crystallization,
but differ slightly in their angles and in their physical pro
perties. Thus carbonate of lime, of iron, of magnesia,
(C+2c, Fe+2c', M +2c',) and mixtures of these,                    belong             all
to the rhombohedral       system,   and have      certain   approximate

that in some specimens of arragonite a portion of strontia enters
into the composition of the mineral; which is what we might
expect, carbonate of strontia having a plesiomorphous relation
to arragonite.
    In other cases, such as those adduced by Mr. Brooke, of
paranthine and sodalite; of eudialyte, zircon, and olivine; it is
very far from being clearly established, as yet, that the che
mical formulae of these groups can be made respectively iden
tical, even by the substitution of isomorphous elements; and
it certainly has not yet been proved that in these cases the
elements are isomorphous.            Ifthere be really dimorphous
minerals of this kind, the observations of the last paragraph
may be applied to them: at present we do not appear to pos
sess a sufficient number of good analyses of these species, to be
able to determine how far they are examples of the theory.
But certainly the theory of accidental mixture cannot possibly
explain any difficulties of this kind, which the theory of isomor
phism will not explain at least as well.
   I   am therefore surprised that Mr. Brooke should have
brought forwards such cases as objections to the isomorphous
 theory.          I
             But am still more surprised that he should have
 brought forwards as objections the differences which occur in
 other cases, where the very essence of the theory requires that
 there should be a difference, and when the theory could not
 stand a moment if there were none. “Arsenic,” he says,
 “combines with sulphur in two different proportions, and
 producing different primary forms. Hence the proportion of
 a common element, and therefore an isomorphous one, occa
 sions a change, even in the system of crystallization.”          No
 doubt the change of the proportion of an element occasions
 a change in the crystallization: we should have little chance
 of finding any connection between the elements and the cry
 stallization if it were not so: as + 2s (realgar) and as + 3s
  (orpiment) have different chemical formulae, and accordingly
 we find they have a different system of crystallization.       How
 Mr. Brooke conceives that the theory of isomorphism can
 identify these two compounds,           I
                                       cannot understand.          If,
                                                                when
 he   says, “a common element, and therefore            isomorphous
                                                             an
 one,”  he   means that two atoms        of   an
                                            element are isomorphous
 with three,  he  certainly supposes what          no

 phism ever dreamt       of
   In   like manner     I cannot see how the isomorphous theory
  offers any ground for the expectation,            of
                                                   which          he

coexistence of unequal elasticities is not only possible, but must
 be the case; for if the aether be an elastic fluid uniformly dif
fused through space absolutely devoid of other matter, it fol
lows that wherever it penetrates a space filled with any me
dium, such as air, it must necessarily be attracted round each
particle of air, and form spheres of a density increasing towards
their centres. Amongst an infinite number of such spheres
uniformly diffused, a succession of vibrations communicated in
a given direction, will of course give rise to vibrations propa
gated with various velocities, according to the particular elasti
city of different parts of the disseminated medium: thus we
shall have a number of coexistent vibrations producing un
dulations of different lengths which, when they are incident
upon a new medium, will cause a deviation in position pro
portional to the unequal lengths of their undulations, accord
ing to the well known and established explanation of the
general law of simple refraction as expressed by the undula
tory theory.

LIII.  On the Symmetrical Functions of a specifted Number of
  the Roots of an Equation.   By the Rev. R. MURPHY, Fellow
  of Caius Coll. and of the Camb. Phil. Soc.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,
INofa the
      paper published in the last Number of the Transactions
          Cambridge Philosophical Society, I have given a
few simple rules relative to the solution of algebraical equa
tions, with their demonstrations. The sum of any specifted
number of the roots taken in order from the least, upwards,
and the sum of any given function of such roots, may be
thence found, for any proposed equation p(x) = 0, containing
only positive and integer powers of w. The coefficients of the
different terms of an equation are, as is well known, the sums
of symmetrical functions of all the roots; and my present
object is to show a simple method of obtaining the corre
sponding sums of the symmetrical functions of a specifted num
ber of the roots; and as general investigations relative to a
specified number of the roots are     Ibelieve new in analysis,
this paper may not be unacceptable to your mathematical
readers.
   Let 21, 2, as ...... an be the m least roots, taken in order,
of the equation 4 (a) = 0, and A any arbitrary quantity. Then

LW. Additional Remarks on Isomorphism. By H.J. BRooKE, Esq.
                      F.R.S. L.S. & G.S.*
      the appendix to a work just published by Dr. Daubeny
IN  on the Atomic Theory, some observations are inserted re
lative to a paper of mine on Isomorphism, inserted in No. 57
of this Journal.
   Upon these observations I shall at present only remark,
that they contain two paragraphs upon which              am desirous         I
of immediately setting myself right with Dr. Daubeny and the
readers of his work.
   Dr. Daubeny says, “It seems impossible to apply the [theory
of mixture of foreign matter] to the garnet species, neither has
Mr. Brooke attempted to do so.”
                                                                of be
   What mineral is              it,
                               should first
                                  I              disposed     inquire,            to
that  is     to  designated
                be                 the nameby     Garnet?          not             It   is
denoted    by        its
                    crystalline form, for that         common           is                  to   a
variety     others; and there
           of                                        no
                                         very apparent reason why,
                                                is
among the substances which, chiefly              account        on
                                                             their                of             si
milar  forms,  have been included under the         supposed    garnet
tribe, there should not be some, which, on account               their                 of
chemical differences,                 do
                                really constitute distinct species.
To enter, however, upon                    of an
                                      investigation     this question    of

matrices or rocks in which the several varieties have been
found;—a point upon which scarcely any correct information
can   be collected from the published works               the subject.       on
And probably               on
                       reconsideration, Dr. Daubeny will                                    be   of
opinion, that the garnets are, from the class         forms     which   of         to

       Mr. Brooke's Additional Remarks                        on Isomorphism.            425
they belong, the last which ought to be adduced as evidence
either of the truth or fallacy of isomorphism.
   The second paragraph to which have alluded is as fol   I
lows:—
    “It   may be remarked, that in the case of Stilbite which
Mr. Brooke has brought forward as an exception, he has over
looked the presence in it of 6 atoms of water, a circumstance
which constitutes a chemical difference between that mineral
and paranthine.”
     This however involves an entire misrepresentation of what
I   have stated;—unintentional                I
                                         have no doubt, and occasioned
by hasty perusal of what I wrote.                         I
                                                did not, as Dr. Daubeny
will perceive on     looking   again at my paper, raise any question
about the form of Stilbite.               I
                                       referred to Eudyalite as an ex
ample in which soda and lime are said to be isomorphous in
respect of 1 atom of silica; to Paranthine, in which they are
said to be isomorphous in respect of 2 atoms of silica; and
to Stilbite, in which they stand in the same relation to 3 atoms
of silica. And I did this merely to adduce the inference that
 all other elements which might be supposed isomorphous in
 respect of 1 atom of silica, ought to be equally so when com
 bined with 2 atoms, or with 3 atoms; and hence it was unne
 cessary even to consider the water or any of the other com
 ponent elements of either of these minerals.
     With regard to plesiomorphism, it does not appear that any
 limit has been assigned to the difference in the plesiomorphous
 angles. Silica and alumina are said to be isomorphous when
 alumina acts the part of an acid.           But as the question raised
 is,  whether the atoms        silica and alumina are isomorphous,
                                  of
  unless those      alumina differ according
                   of                                              as
                                                       this substance acts
  the part of            or   of
                             base, and                          not easy
                                                                                             or be to
                acid                          this case
                                                   in                   it    is
 conceive what          atom means,—silica and alumina should
                        an
  isomorphous generally.         Now the primary form              silica,         of
  quartz, is   a rhomboid          of
                                 94°   15', and that       alumina,     of co           or
  rundum, also rhomboid, but measuring 86°
                   a                                           Hence these5'.
  bodies are, when they occur singly, only plesiomorphous, with
                                           of
                     their angles                 to 8°

  they are required          by

  elements when alumina becomes              substitute for silica. When

               completing the history of the Safety-lamp, Dr. Paris
       briefly notices the Geological Society of Cornwall, and the pa
tronage and support which it received from Sir H. Davy: to this
Society he communicated a memoir on the Geology of Cornwall,
which was published in the first volume of                 Transactions.      Of    its
this paper Dr. Paris gives          analysis, and then proceeds

   After the numerous and long extracts which we have made from
 Dr. Paris's work, we can allot but little space for further remarks,
  though there are various subjects of high interest upon which we
  have not bestowed a single observation; they are noticed by the
  biographer with a minuteness and an accuracy worthy of the illus

  For an account of the share which Davy had in developing the na
  ture and properties of iodine; of his method of protecting copper
  sheathing; his experiments on electro-magnetism, and the paper on
  the phaenomena of volcanoes, we must refer the reader either to the
  memoirs themselves”, or to Dr. Paris's account of them. Alluding
  to his retirement from the office of President of the Royal Society,
  Dr.Paris remarks: “To assert that Davy retained his popularity, or
  to deny that he retired from the office under the frown of a consi
  derable party, would be dishonest.                I would willingly dismiss this
  part of his life without too nice an examination; but am writing                         I
  a history, not an eloge.
     “As a philosopher, his claims to admiration and respect were
  allowed in     alltheir latitude; but when                 he
                                                      sought for the homage due
 to   patrician distinction, they were denied with indignation.                 How
 strange    it   is,
                   that those whom Nature has placed above their fellow
  men
        by  the god-like gift        genius, should seek from their inferiors
                                       of
 those distinctions which are generally the rewards                 fortune. Whenof
 we learn that Congreve,             his interview with Voltaire, prided him
                                      in
 self upon his fashion rather than upon his wit; that Byron was more
 vain  of his heraldry than          his ‘Pilgrimage
                                       of                     Childe Harold; that
                                                                      of
 Racine    pined     into   an atrophy,    because the monarch passed him
 without    a recognition       the ante-room

 lament the weakness from which the choicest spirits                     our nature       of
 are not exempt. Will philosophers never feel, with Walpole, that
‘a    genius transmits more honour                      by
                                                   blood than         can receive'?  he

of   Davy, would his name have commanded higher homage,                           his                  or

of the proportions between the times of revolution of the planets and
their distances from the sun. Again, after Kepler had promulgated his
discoveries, Galileo discovered the satellites of Jupiter,
                                                             and by ob
servations on these, Kepler saw it ascertained that the law which he
had discovered to apply to the revolutions of the planets around the
sun, held good also when applied to the periods
                                                   of circulation of the
satellites of Jupiter around that planet; “thus demonstrating it to
be something more than a mere empirical rule, and to depend on the
intimate nature of planetary motion itself.” But it was left for the
 genius of Newton to complete, to a
                                               certain degree of generality, the
 natural system of the planets which had been discovered by his pre

   Nov. 1 and 15.—A Paper was read on the Sexual Organs and
mode of Impregnation in Orchideae and Asclepiadea'.       By R. Brown,
Esq., V.P.L.S., &c. &c.
   Mr. Brown's principal object in this paper is to detail some obser
vations on the structure and oeconomy of the fecundating organs in
these families, made by him chiefly in the present year. They have
hitherto presented the most important objections to the prevailing
theories of vegetable fecundation: but Mr. Brown thinks we are now
as far advanced with respect to this function in these families, as in
any other tribe of Phaenogamous plants; and that upon the general
problem of generation, additional light is more likely to be derived
from them than any other part of the vegetable or animal kingdom.
   Orchideae.—Two opinions have been entertained as to the mode of
impregnation in this family.    Haller, Adanson, Curtis, C. K. Spren
gel, J. K. Wachter, Schkuhr, Swartz, Salisbury, and Treviranus
considered the direct application of the pollen to the stigma as essen
tial to fecundation : while others, as Linnaeus, Schmidel, Koelreuter,
Stokes, Batsch, Richard, Du Petit Thouars, Link, Lindley, Bauer, and
Mr. Brown himself, from the peculiarities observable in the structure
and relative position of the sexual organs, have considered the direct
contact of the pollen mass and stigma as improbable, and have con
sequently had recourse to other explanations of this function.
   Wachter in 1799 was the first who succeeded in impregnating an
orchideous plant by applying the pollen to the stigma, a result
which was confirmed in 1804 by Salisbury, and twenty years after
by Treviranus.
   These observers have sufficiently proved that impregnation is ac
complished by the direct application of pollen to stigma; but no sub
sequent phenomena resulting from the action of the stigma on the
pollen is noticed.
   Those authors who conceived that the pollen mass could not come
into direct contact with the stigma, have attempted to explain the fe
cundation of Orchideae in various ways.
   Batsch in 1791 supposed that the only way in which the pollen
could act on the ovarium in Ophrydeae was by the retrogradation of
the impregnating power through the caudicula to the gland beneath
it; and this opinion was also that of Richard, who applied it to the
whole order, and was entertained by Mr. Brown in 1810.           It was
also the opinion of Mr. Bauer, to whom it appears to have occurred
as early as 1792.
   The opinion of Du Petit Thouars was peculiar. He considered that
the glutinous substance connecting the grains of pollen was the fe
cundating matter; that the elastic pedicel of the pollen mass, not
formed before expansion, consisted of this gluten; and that in the
expanded flower, the gluten which has escaped from the pollen    is,
                                                                 |  all

    In the spring        this year Mr. Brown renewed his observations
                                     of                                                                                            on

  are entirely distinct. Their production he considers a vital action
  excited in the grain by the application of an external stimulus, which
 is afforded by the secretion on the surface of the stigma; and they
  derive nutriment either from the particles contained in the grain, or
 from the conducting surfaces with which they are in contact.
     The first visible effect of the action of the pollen on the stigma is
 the enlargement of the ovarium, which, in those cases where it was
 reversed by torsion, untwists and resumes                original position.           its

    Asclepiadeae.—The mode              impregnation   of    this family was sup             in
posed       byJussieu, Richard, Bauer, Treviranus, and               Mr. Brown,                       by                    to
 be  indirect; that                 is,
                          that there was        immediate contact      no the pollen                            of
with the stigma, but that the fecundating matter was conveyed from
the mass through the arm and gland                the female organ.          to
      At
       a  very early period Gleichen had observed that the pollen masses
were originally distinct from the glands,-a fact which Mr. Brown had
afterwards stated           1809, and which had equally been observed and
                                     in
delineated           by
                   Mr. Bauer. Gleichen also states, that before the masses
 unite with the glands they are removed from the cells                 the anthera,                        of
and implanted into the wall              the tube which surrounds the ovaria,

                       considers                      as
                                      the early preparation for the formation
of   pollen.     He remarks, that the tops         the styles are not originally
                                                                             of
connected with the pentagonal body, and therefore, that impregnation
does not usually take place until the true stigmata,                   those extre                         or

penetrated through the substance              the pentagonal body, and are
                                                                  of                                                        on

    Sprengel        1793 asserts that insects extract the pollen masses
                         in
                                                                                from

from the cells, and apply them to the apex of the stigma, which, being
a secreting part, is calculated to act on the oily matter exuding from
the surface of the pollen mass.
    In 1829 Ehrenberg describes the grains of pollen as contained in
the proper membrane of the mass, which bursts in a regular manner,
and as having each a tube, which tubes collectively are directed
towards the point of dehiscence.            He does not say how they communi
cate with the stigma, and supposes that they form an integrant part                                                .
of the grain, without being produced by the action of an external sti
mulus.
    In July last Mr. Brown resumed his investigations into the struc
ture and functions of the organs of this family.                He verifies observa
tions made by Mr. Bauer so early as 1805, that the masses are cellu
lar, each cell containing a single grain. These cells he considers as
the outer membranes of the grains of which the inner membranes are
the grains described by Treviranus without tubes, and by Ehrenberg
after their production.
     He found that the agency of insects was necessary to effect fecun
dation; that the pollen masses were actually removed from the cell
of the anthera, and immersed in the fissures formed by the projecting
alae of the antherae, the descending process of the stigma near                                              its
 flexure being broken,             that the mass was entirely separated from
                                         so
 the gland. The pollen mass was                    placed     sothe fissure, that  in                        its
 inner        or
              convex edge was closely pressed            that point where the tube
                                                                         to

                                     is      the base    to  the corresponding an
                                                                              of

                                                                         a                                   of
 slender tubes, was observed issuing from the gibbous part                   the edge         of
 which had burst. On opening the mass, these tubes were found                                                to
 proceed each from          grain

 They were like those described               Orchideae. in   The cord had opened
a   passage for itself through the membrane, or, rather, had separated
 the upper edge                of

  styles; then inclined towards the inner side                 the apex, which of                       is   in
  some    degree   exposed.     On   opening    the  cavity       the style, the cord

at about half-past 10, by inference, and for some minutes remained
on the edge of the limb, presenting an appearance not unlike that
of the lunar mountains coming into view during the first quarter of
the moon, until it finally disappeared on the body of the planet.
At least twelve or thirteen minutes must have elapsed, when, acci
dentally turning to Jupiter again, to my astonishment     perceived               I
the same satellite outside the disc 1 It was in the same position as
to being in a line with the apparent lower belt, where it remained
distinctly visible for at least four minutes, and then suddenly va

at different places, by Mr. Maclear and Dr. Pearson.

tions of the double stars, 70 Ophiuchi, ; Ursae Majoris, 44 Bootis,
'Y Virginis, 7 and a Coronae, Castor, y Leonis, and s Bootis, made
during the last and present year. Mr. Dawes is of opinion that the
apparent discs are more affected by the aperture of the telescope
than by any other circumstance; and that this is the principal
reason why a reflector presents a smaller image of a fixed star than
an achromatic of equal illuminating power.
   III. The reading of Mr. Herschel's paper on the measures of
364 double stars was completed.
   This paper contains the micrometrical measures of the angles
of position and distances of 364 double stars, observed by Mr. Her
schel with the seven-feet equatorial in his possession at Slough, the
same which was used by Sir James South in his observations at
 Passy, and in a part of the measures of double stars in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1824. The individual measures, being too
numerous, are not stated; but the mean results of each night's ob
servation are set down in tabular order, with a weight attributed to
each, indicative of the degree of confidence which the observer him
self attributes to them, and with notes attached, descriptive of any
peculiar circumstances in the observation proper to be recorded.
They comprise the results of 735 sets of measures, or from 6000 to
8000 individual observations, obtained under            atmospheric cir
                                                                    all
cumstances,    in  the years  1828,  1829,   and 1830. Almost          the                 all

The periods of these two stars may be stated respectively at 55 and
43 years; that of # Ursae at 56%, which last determination agrees
nearly with that of M. Savary, who has assigned 58% years for this
element.   The period of 70 Ophiuchi has been determined by Pro
fessor Encke at 73,862 years.
   Lastly, Mr. Herschel subjoins some practical remarks on the
management and action of telescopes, and takes occasion to intro
duce a set of measures of the positions of Saturn's satellites, taken
under remarkably favourable circumstances, and also a single ob
servation of the place of the comet of 1830, the only one he could
succeed in procuring.
    In a subsequent letter received from Mr. Herschel, he alludes to
a new method of taking the angles of position, viz., by reflected as
well as by direct vision. He conceives that this method possesses
two capital advantages: 1st, That the quantity directly measured
is double the quantity sought, by which, of course, the error of de
termination is halved; and, 2ndly, That the error of the zero is
destroyed altogether, the double arc being given by the difference
of readings in the limb of one and the same circle, maintained in one
and the same position.       Mr. Herschel also adds, that subsequent
and   very satisfactory  measures of , Coronae fully confirm the con
clusion above mentioned with regard to the revolution of that star.
    IV. On the dependence of a clock's rate on the height of the
barometer, by the Rev. Dr. Robinson.
    The rate of a clock of good workmanship may be assumed to
depend on three things; first, the rate at a given temperature and
barometric pressure: secondly, on the variation of temperature, as
shown by the thermometer; and thirdly, upon the atmospheric
pressure, measured by the barometer.         The variation of temperature
not   only affects the materials of the  pendulum,    but, along with the
 atmospheric pressure, greatly modifies the action of the air in the
 way of buoyancy and inertia, &c. Possibly, the irregular action of
 the wheelwork, the diminution of arc from the thickening of the
 oil   on
        the pallets, and even the hygrometric state           the air, mayof
 sensibly alter the rate      clock; but the present memoir

 to the consideration of the first-mentioned sources of error.
    As the changes are minute, Dr. Robinson formed equations                                of
 condition, where the quantities sought were the rate          the clock  of                at

M.  Geoffroy  Saint-Hilaire,  apparently from a specimen preserved in
spirit; the individual before the Meeting agreeing much more nearly
with the colours as recently described by M. Isidore Geoffroy Saint
Hilaire, from whose description it scarcely differed, except in the
less intensity of the rufous tinge of the tips of the hairs of the upper
surface.
   Of the Nycticejus two specimens were exhibited, on which Dr.
Horsfield pointed out the characters by which that group had been
generically distinguished from Vespertilio as circumscribed by modern
authors. He remarked on the geographical distribution of the genus,
which might be regarded altogether as an American form, were it not
for the existence of a species in Java described by him in his ‘Zoo
logical Researches' as the Vespertilio Temminckii, and of the present
species obtained on the Continent of India.         As the second Indian
species of this group, he regarded the present acquisition as peculiarly
interesting.    It is considerably larger than the Javanese species, from
which it differs also remarkably in        colouring.its
   Dr. Horsfield thus characterized and described the species:

    This new species of Julis is one of those fishes, now becoming nu
merous, which might be confounded with the Julis Aygula, (Coris
Aygula, LaCép.). The latter appears to have hitherto rested solely
on the figure and description preserved by Commerson, no specimen
of it having been referred to as existing in collections. A specimen
of that species has, however, recently been added to the Society's
Museum from a collection of fishes formed in India, and agrees well
with the figure published by LaCépède, in the truncation or even
